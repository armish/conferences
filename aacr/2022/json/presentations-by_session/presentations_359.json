[{"Abstract":"Breast cancer driven by estrogen receptor (ER) is responsible for approximately 60-70% of cases among women. Selective inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4\/6) and ER signaling is now standard-of-care therapy for ER positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer. CDK4\/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib (PD), used in combination with endocrine therapy have shown improvement in progression-free survival compared to endocrine therapy alone in the metastatic setting. However, the inevitable development of acquired resistance significantly limits the efficacy of this targeted therapy. In ER+ breast cancer resistant cells, rewired signaling driven by different oncogenes, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), overcomes the inhibition of CDK4\/6 by PD, which, in turn, allows cell cycle progression contributing to PD-resistance. We investigated the dependency of ER+ breast cancer cell lines sensitive and resistant to PD on EGFR signaling <i>in vitro<\/i>. We evaluated the expression and activity of EGFR in two different matching pairs of ER+ palbociclib-sensitive (pS) and palbociclib-resistant (pR) breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) and observed elevated EGFR expression in MCF7\/pR cells. Increased EGFR expression in MCF7\/pR cells correlated with elevated ER alpha phosphorylation at S118 and S167 sites, suggesting a direct cross-talk between EGFR and ER signaling in PD-resistant cells. Serum starvation significantly decreased EGFR activity, cdk2 and cyclin D1 expression in both MCF7 and T47D PD-resistant cells compared to the parental cell lines, confirming their dependency on the presence of growth factors. Notably, stimulation with EGF promoted ER phosphorylation and expression of cell cycle related targets: cdk2, cyclin E and wee1 in both MCF7 and T47D cell lines sensitive and resistant to PD. Furthermore, stimulation with estrogen promoted EGFR activation in MCF7\/pS and MCF7\/pR cells, indicating a direct cross-regulation between these molecular targets. Further, exposure to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib dramatically inhibited the proliferation of MCF7\/pR cells compared to the parental cells, suggesting that EGFR could be an important bypass signaling regulator contributing to resistance to PD. We found that dual treatment with erlotinib and PD significantly inhibited Rb phosphorylation in MCF7\/pR cells improving the effect of PD on cell cycle arrest. Moreover, dual treatment of MCF7\/pR cells attenuated ER expression suggesting the higher dependency of ER signaling on EGFR activity in resistant cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that EGFR signaling is a mechanism of resistance in ER+ cell lines with acquired resistance to PD <i>in vitro<\/i> and that EGFR targeting can be a promising approach to improve palbociclib efficacy in breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e5950e9-d5a3-40eb-ac64-ec30ba5d7ef4\/@D03B8ZEt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,EGFR,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16032"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nadiia Lypova<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lilibeth Lanceta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan M.

Although pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including paclitaxel (PTX), is associated with good outcomes, 50-60% of TNBC patients do not experience pCR and suffer poor long-term outcomes, often due to chemotherapy resistance. Identifying and analyzing the tumor cells responsible for chemotherapy resistance will lead to improved treatment strategies.<br \/>We developed a model of TNBC resistance to neoadjuvant PTX using Met1 murine mammary carcinoma cells. To study clonal dynamics in response to PTX we developed a barcoding method, SunCatcher. First, 31 single-cell derived clonal populations were generated from parental Met1 cells. Each clone was infected with a lentiviral vector containing a unique DNA barcode detectable by qPCR. All barcoded clones (BCs) were mixed in equivalent numbers to generate a BC pool that we confirmed captures the parental Met1 heterogeneity and tumor growth kinetics.<br \/>First, PTX responses were tested <i>in vitro.<\/i> The BC pool had an IC50 of ~100 nM, while individual BCs ranged in IC50 from 5 nM to 25 &#181;M. We maintained the BC pool in 100 nM PTX for 39 days (termed long-term PTX; LTP), at which point it became clonal for BC25, suggesting that BC25 (IC50 of 100 nM) is uniquely PTX resistant, despite being the most proliferative and Zeb1<sup>hi<\/sup>\/EpCAM<sup>low<\/sup> clone <i>in vitro<\/i>. BC25 was not detected in the control-treated BC pool at 39 days.<br \/>Next, the BC pool was orthotopically injected into FVB\/NJ mice and treated the mice with 20 mg\/kg PTX on days 7, 11, and 15. At the day 18 experimental endpoint, tumor volume significantly decreased by 56% in response to PTX compared to control. BC25 composition increased from 7.7% (controls) to 15% (PTX treated) within the tumors at endpoint. We also injected BC25 and LTP cells alone and administered the same PTX regimen once tumors reached 50 mm<sup>3<\/sup>. Both BC25 and LTP tumors were unresponsive to PTX and had a longer latency period (35d) than BC pool (10d).<br \/>We performed a drug screen of 2313 compounds spanning FDA-approved cancer therapeutics on the LTP cells to identify compounds to target the PTX-resistant clone. HDAC inhibitors were the most potent class of hits and one, Panobinostat, killed LTP cells with an IC50 of 4.3 nM.<br \/>Utilizing SunCatcher, we identified a unique PTX-resistant TNBC subclone that represents residual disease associated with poor long-term outcome. Typical <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments would have reached ethical endpoint before BC25 had a chance to grow, given its long latency, therefore this PTX-resistant clone would not have been identified. This is an important finding because therapeutic resistance can emerge after a protracted period, longer than typical pre-clinical experiments. Further work will explore mechanisms of resistance and the potential for combination therapies to prevent recurrent disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7eec51a2-789c-45c5-9b55-d9e2f68d8fe9\/@D03B8ZEt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Chemoresistance,Paclitaxel,DNA barcoding,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16033"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Milos Spasic<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuchen Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Maynard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Goreczny<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrienne Waks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Tolaney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Mittendorf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra McAllister<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus, understanding the mechanisms of resistance and identifying novel treatment strategies are needed to improve survival. Our previously published data shows that palbociclib resistance is marked by significant upregulation of the IL6-STAT3 signaling pathway in HR+, HER2- breast cancer cells and treatment with TTI-101, a small-molecule STAT3 inhibitor completing Phase I studies in solid tumor patients, significantly decreased cell viability. Additionally, matched biopsies from advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer patients who progressed on palbociclib plus ET had an upregulation in activated STAT3 (STAT3 phosphorylated on Y705, pY-STAT3) as compared to their pre-treatment biopsy. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting the IL-6\/STAT3 pathway is a viable therapeutic strategy. Our ongoing studies are directed at delineating the role of IL-6 and pY-STAT3 as predictive biomarkers to provide preclinical rationale for targeting STAT3 in patients who develop CDK4\/6i resistance.<b><br \/>Methods:<\/b> We downregulated IL-6 using shRNA in MCF7 and T47D palbociclib sensitive and resistant cells. We tested the efficacy of TTI-101 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from patients with metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer who progressed on treatment with palbociclib + ET. We also collected plasma samples from patients with metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer just prior to CDK4\/6i treatment and at disease progression.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Downregulation of IL-6 in palbociclib resistant cells reduced pY-STAT3 levels and re-sensitized cells to ET and palbociclib. Induction of IL-6 is an early event by treating sensitive cells with 1uM palbociclib for 21 days during which the cells adapted and eventually developed resistance. Suppression of IL-6 in sensitive cells revealed that it is needed for cells to overcome growth inhibition by palbociclib. Targeting STAT3 in palbociclib resistant PDX mouse models using TTI-101 (50mg\/kg twice daily by oral gavage), resulted in significantly reduced tumor volume; a synergistic effect was observed when TTI-101 was combined with palbociclib. Lastly, IL-6 levels in plasma samples from metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer patients were significantly higher at disease progression compared to pre-treatment with CDK4\/6i.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Collectively, these studies suggest that IL-6 signaling through STAT3 is a key mediator of resistance to palbociclib. We provide the rationale for using circulating IL-6 as a biomarker of disease progression and tumor pY-STAT3 as a selection criterion for treatment with TTI-101 to prevent or reverse resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/623f4fbc-52fb-4abe-a9bc-dd8a19fb1f0f\/@D03B8ZEt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,STAT3 activation,Interleukin-6,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16034"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicole M.

In clinical trials, patients with HER2+ BC expressing ER respond poorly to neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy versus those lacking ER expression. Additionally, combining anti-HER2 with endocrine therapy (ET), like aromatase inhibitor (AI), does not significantly improve pathological complete response in HER2+\/ER+ patients. In advanced or <i>de novo<\/i> HER2+\/ER+ metastatic BC (MBC), treatment with ET plus anti-HER2 yields the highest 5-year overall survival. Unfortunately, in the real-world setting outside of clinical trials, just 23% of patients receive this combination, and nearly 40% receive ET alone. The clinical challenge associated with treating advanced HER2+\/ER+ BC demands a better understanding of ER signaling and downstream pathways in HER2-driven BC. Our goal is to identify alternative targeted therapies and\/or tailor therapeutic combinatorial strategies to treat and\/or delay progression of HER2+\/ER+ BC. In this study, we established two long-term estrogen (E2) deprived (LTED) HER2+\/ER+ cell line models from BT-474 (BT) and MDA-MB-361 (MM) to mimic endocrine therapy resistance (ETR) to AI, and characterized the response of these cell lines to anti-HER2 and other ETs. We also performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify differences between parental and derived ETR-LTEDs. The ER expression was retained in BT-LTEDs but lost in MM-LTEDs as compared to parental cells. Additionally, ER transcriptional activity was confirmed by increased expression of ER-target genes upon E2 stimulation only in BT-LTEDs. However, both LTED variants were less responsive to fulvestrant and showed upregulation of pro-survival AKT signaling. Focusing on the now ER- MM-LTED model, WGS and targeted duplex sequencing identified a significant increase in exonic missense mutations, notably C&#62;T and C&#62;A. Several of the mutated genes encode for transcription and chromatin regulatory factors. scRNAseq analysis showed that MM-LTEDs shift from a luminal- to more basal-like phenotype, with enrichment of genes that regulate immune response and cell motility. Thus, loss of ER expression in MM-LTEDs on the mRNA and protein levels may explain observed intrinsic resistance to fulvestrant and gain of the basal-like phenotype. In summary, we report that our ETR BT- and MM-LTED models capture distinct ER-associated phenotypes of HER2+\/ER+ BC. Additional studies are necessary to understand the functional significance of these missense mutations on the development of drug resistance in HER2+\/ER+ BC. Ongoing studies are testing pharmacological inhibition of key upregulated genes associated with the basal phenotype to potentially delay disease progression and provide better treatments for ETR HER2+\/ER+ BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0406d0dd-e819-4701-9eb4-abe805d57568\/@D03B8ZEt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Drug resistance,Estrogen receptor,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16036"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shaymaa Bahnassy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hillary Stires<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stanley Tam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasmin J.

About 13% of women will develop invasive breast carcinoma in their lifetime and it is estimated that about 280,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 2021. Seventy-percent of diagnosed breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and about 90% of the ER-positive breast cancers are androgen receptor (AR)-positive. We have previously shown that AR agonists inhibit ER-positive breast cancer growth by sequestering the pioneer-transcription factor FOXA1 from ER-cistrome. Tissue-selective AR modulators (SARMs) such as enobosarm are in clinical trials to treat ER-positive breast cancers. Since resistance is a major impediment to sutained treatment, it is important to identify new therapeutic strategies and their mechanisms of resistance. Here, we evaluated the possible mechanisms of resistance to AR agonists in ER-positive breast cancer.<br \/><b>Description:<\/b> ER-positive breast cancer cell line xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were used as experimental models. Once tumors grew to ~100-300 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were randomized and treated orally with vehicle or enobosarm (30 mg\/kg\/day). Animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks when the tumors responded to treatment and after 10 weeks once resistance developed to treatment. Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly and tumors were collected at sacrifice for further analyses. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were performed on tumor tissues.<br \/><b>Summary:<\/b> AR agonists, enobosarm and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), inhibited the proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells ZR-75-1 and T47D. Transcriptome analysis revealed that AR agonists activate AR in ER-positive breast cancer cells and inhibit ER-target gene signature. AR agonists inhibited the growth of breast cancer cell line xenograft T47D and breast cancer PDXs HCI-7 that express wildtype ER, and HCI-13 and WHIM-23, two models that express Y537S mutant ER. Treatment of WHIM-23 and T47D xenograft for over ten weeks resulted in resistance and regrowth. AR agonist-sensitive and -resistant tumors were analyzed using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq to understand the mechanism of resistance development. The results indicate that the prolonged activation of AR will result in resistance. These mechanisms of resistance can be utilized as possible therapeutic targets.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These results suggest that the AR is a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. However, resistance development is possible with AR agonists and the mechanism provides suggestions for future combination therapies.<br \/><b>Disclosure:<\/b> This work was supported by an NCI grant (CA229164 and CA229164S1 to RN) and by a DOD grant (W81XWH2110055 to RN).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/08405c5f-0e68-4d76-bd38-e4f31e51991a\/@D03B8ZEt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Androgen receptor,Molecular targets,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16037"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Asemota<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suriyan Ponnusamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thirumagal Thiyagarajan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramesh Narayanan<\/i><\/presenter>.

To identify specific mediators of tumor growth in NF1 mutant cancers, we performed a genetic knockout (KO) screen in isogenic WT and NF1 KO breast cancer cells. After employing stringent cutoff criteria, we found 28 genes that are specifically essential for NF1 KO cells but not WT cells. Among these genes, <i>NR2F2<\/i>, encoding an orphan nuclear receptor, was one of the top candidates. We validated that its loss significantly impaired the growth of multiple models of NF1 null, ER+ breast cancer.<br \/>Loss of NF1 leads to the hyperactivation of Ras which sequentially activates multiple effector pathways, including the MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway. We found that MAPK activation upon NF1 loss led to elevated NR2F2 expression levels. A negative correlation between NF1 and NR2F2 expression was further confirmed in public gene expression databases. These data suggested that induction of NR2F2 expression might be one mechanism that mediates endocrine resistance caused by NF1 loss. Consistently, we found that exogenous expression of NR2F2 could confer endocrine resistance while its knockout hypersensitized ER+ breast cancer cells to endocrine therapies and significantly attenuated NF1 loss induced resistance.<br \/>RNA-seq analysis revealed that estrogen response gene sets were among the most enriched signatures upon NF1 KO, NR2F2 over-expression (OE) or NR2F2 KO. NF1 KO or NR2F2 OE decreased the expression of early estrogen response genes and impaired their E2-induced expression, most of which could be rescued by NR2F2 KO, suggesting a regulatory effect of NR2F2 on ER transcriptional activity. To further define these mechanisms, ongoing integrative analyses of NR2F2 qPlex-RIME, ER and NR2F2 ChIP-Sequencing and ATAC-Sequencing will be presented.<br \/>Taken together, our studies identify NR2F2 as a MAPK driven transcript whose induction mediates endocrine resistance, and may serve as a novel therapeutic target to overcome anti-estrogen resistant breast cancer growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e05353c7-60dc-4f46-9be3-e6b4e1561dec\/@D03B8ZEt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hormone receptors,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Gene regulation,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16038"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanyan Cai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peihua Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fan Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Shao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pedram Razavi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guotai Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maurizio Scaltriti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarat Chandarlapaty<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, intrinsic and acquired resistance remains a major limitation to its clinical efficacy. Adipocytes were shown to exhibit a pro-survival cross talk with breast cancer cells, limiting their sensitivity to T-DM1 and raising the question of metabolic alterations involved in this resistance phenotype. To explore the role of tumor cell metabolic plasticity in T-DM1 resistance, xenografts of the human HER-2 positive breast cancer model BT-474 were exposed <i>in vivo<\/i> to increasing doses of T-DM1. BT-474 WT and R tumors were characterized by RNAseq and primary explants of <i>in vivo <\/i>tumors were cultured and analyzed <i>in vitro<\/i>. Although HER-2 levels were found to be strongly reduced in resistant cells, no increase of its pro-survival downstream partners were observed at the transcriptomic level. Conversely, PIK3CA and KRAS were respectively 2.5- and 2-times downregulated in BT-474 R according to RNAseq data, suggesting the implementation of compensatory pathways for cell survival and proliferation. Tumors resistant to T-DM1 exhibited alterations in lipid metabolism, including an increase in lipid droplet content observed by ORO staining, upregulation of fatty acid metabolism pathways, and lipid transporter FABP4 overexpression. Cells resistant to T-DM1 survived to 2-deoxyglucose treatment (100 mM) as well as glucose deprivation <i>in vitro<\/i> while these conditions were cytotoxic to BT-474 WT cells. In addition, BT-474 R cells were resistant to palmitate exposure, suggesting energy production is monitored by an increased lipid import and metabolism. Ferroptotic cell death and associated lipid peroxidation have recently been associated with alterations in lipid metabolism. H2D-CFDA staining revealed a 2-fold increase in ROS content in R cells at the basal state compared to WT cells. <i>In vitro<\/i>, BT-474 R cells were highly sensitive to ROS inducers such as H2O2 and bleomycin when compared to WT cells (IC50s were 7- and 30-fold higher in WT compared to R cells for H202 and bleomycin, respectively). This unusually strong cytotoxicity of H2O2 was found to be correlated with a significant increase of ROS content within the resistant cells compared to wild type cells after H2O2 treatment. Additionally, inhibitors of ferroptosis such as GPX4, and the antiporter system xct were found to be downregulated in resistant cells, while the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 was 5-fold more cytotoxic in cells resistant to T-DM1 than in WT cells. T-DM1 -resistant cells thus demonstrate increased fatty acid uptake, decreased ability to eliminate ROS and enhanced sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers. Altogether, these results suggest that ferroptosis could constitute a promising target for T-DM1-resistant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d0d7cbb-a000-4630-a00e-db2c9a31c5af\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Resistance,Reactive oxygen species,Fatty acids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16039"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Louise Conilh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliette Sauveur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Beaumel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claire Scheffges<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Estelle Nunez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Cheillan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Dumontet<\/i><\/presenter>.

The primary systemic treatment for TNBC remains to be chemotherapy. But chemoresistance frequently develops with the conventional usage of chemotherapy drugs, which results in poorer prognosis and higher recurrence of TNBC than other subtypes of breast cancer. Therefore, to improve the treatment for TNBC, overcoming chemoresistance is a critical challenge to conquer. The RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) is a posttranscriptional regulator. It can stabilize target mRNAs through binding to U- or AU- rich elements mainly in 3&#8217; untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA and upregulate their translation level in most cases. The encoded proteins of HuR target mRNAs are implicated in multiple cancer hallmarks, including chemotherapeutic sensitivity. The cytoplasmic accumulation of HuR is reported to contribute to chemoresistance in multiple cancer cells, and HuR inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to chemodrugs. We hypothesize that inhibition of HuR function by disrupting its interaction with mRNA can accelerate the decay of target mRNAs and thus reduce the translation level of proteins responsible for chemoresistance. Recently, our lab identified a small molecule HuR inhibitor, KH-3, which potently inhibits HuR function by disrupting HuR-mRNA interactions. In this study, KH-3 is used as a tool compound to investigate the roles HuR plays in chemoresistance development and evaluate whether HuR inhibition can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC cells. Two MDA-MB-231 cell sublines resistant to docetaxel (231-TR) or doxorubicin (231-DR) were generated in our lab. Compared to the parental cell line, two sub-lines exhibit similar sensitivity to KH-3, and KH-3 re-sensitizes chemoresistant cells to docetaxel or doxorubicin in the MTT-based cytotoxicity assay and the colony formation assay, indicating that HuR inhibition can overcome the acquired chemoresistance. The in vivo efficacy studies in orthotopic xenograft mouse models of human TNBC confirm that KH-3 synergizes docetaxel treatment. Regarding to mechanisms of action, several HuR direct target mRNAs implicated in chemoresistance were found upregulated in the resistant cells, which were reversed by KH-3 treatment. Detailed molecular mechanisms are now under investigation. This study suggests that HuR inhibition is a promising strategy to overcome the challenge of chemoresistance of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/de976920-966c-4025-a5af-488fa2bbb8df\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Chemosensitization,HuR,RNA-binding protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16040"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lanjing Wei<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cuncong Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Aubé<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danny R.

It has no standard-of-care treatment targets and thus efficacious and safe treatments are urgently sought for this unmet medical need, and to address the disparity in breast cancer outcomes. The current proposal is motivated by data showing elevated expression of proteasome subunit RPN13 is associated with both African American race and lower survival in QNBC patients, that RPN13 selectively targeted by a small molecule Up284 developed by Up Therapeutics. Both triple negative breast cancer and QNBC cell lines show evidence of greater vulnerability to proteasome inhibitors. However, licensed 20S proteasome inhibitors, e.g. bortezomib, have proven ineffective against solid tumors, with emergence of resistance, and dose limiting toxicities including thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Up284 has a target and structure designed to overcome the limitations of the licensed drugs with respect to drug resistance. Up284 blocks substrate recognition and deubiquitination rather than just one of the three 20S catalytic activities), poor activity against solid tumors (Up284 has a novel spiro structure with evidence of improved drug access to tumor as compared to peptide-based 20S inhibitors), key toxicities of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (unlike 20S inhibitors, Up284 does not target the immunoproteasome expressed by hematopoietic cells and does not show these toxicities). Up284 shows broad anticancer activity <i>in vitro, <\/i>including against QNBC lines with a robust therapeutic index, a promising safety profile and pharmacodynamics, and the ability to control xenograft tumor. By inhibiting proteasome ubiquitin receptor RPN13 function and its associated deubiquitinase activity, Up284 triggers more rapid accumulation and increased molecular weight polyubiquinated protein aggregates than is induced by 20S inhibitors. These toxic misfolded protein aggregates produce an unresolved ER stress, activate the canonical Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling cascade and more rapidly triggers apoptosis than 20S inhibitor. The safety parameters and promising efficacy of Up284 against breast cancer lines encourages us to validate Up284 efficacy in more QNBC lines and animal models. We discuss Up284 efficacy and pharmacological analysis in our presentation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5e72ecc-c84f-4cb0-aa9e-060d69e7f705\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Proteasome inhibitors,Targeted therapy,African American,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16041"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Balasubramanyam Karanam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clayton Yates<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi Anchoori<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, all metastatic BC patients develop resistance, which in nearly 40% of patients is due to activating mutations, mostly Y537S and D538G, in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Tumors harboring these mutations are more aggressive and the patients' prognosis is worse. We hypothesized that refractory response to further treatment lines, i.e, chemotherapy, partially accounts for the worse prognosis. Hence, our goal was to study whether LBD-ER BC cells are resistant to chemotherapy and reveal the mechanism of action.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used MCF-7 cells stably expressing WT-ER, Y537S or D538G-ER mutations.<b> <\/b>Cell proliferation and viability were determined using MTT, methylene blue and colony assays. We evaluated apoptosis by monitoring cleaved-PARP and flow cytometry using Annexin\/7AAD staining. MDR1 expression was studied using qRT-PCR and western-blot. JNK\/c-Jun pathway was studied by pJNK and cJun expressions, cJun transcriptional activity, ChIP assay and pharmacological inhibition.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> LBD-ER cells exhibited higher proliferation and viability and exerted less apoptosis compared to WT-ER cells following treatment with paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and 5-FU. MDR1 expression and JNK pathway activity was higher in D538G cells compared to both WT-ER and Y537S cells. Importantly, inhibition of the JNK pathway, using SP600125 and BI-78D3, lead to decreased MDR1 expression, increased cleaved PARP, and decreased viability in the D538G cells. In addition, our results revealed that JNK increased c-Jun binding activity of the MDR1 gene in the D538G mutated cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These results indicate that LBD-ER cells confer resistance to chemotherapy. The mechanisms leading to it are diverse, and we found that in D538G increased JNK pathway activation resulted in elevated MDR1 expression and chemo-resistance. This paves the way to therapies aiming at inhibition the JNK pathway in order to restore chemo-resistance. This study also highlights the marked differences between these seemingly similar mutations, strengthening the necessity to adopt a personalized treatment approach for BC patients who developed endocrine resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e98be38-5bb1-4ebd-bf3d-d51595445bf1\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,JNK,MDR1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16043"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marwa Taya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keren Merenbakh-Lamin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tami Rubinek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ido Wolf<\/i><\/presenter>.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype representing 15-20% of all breast cancers. TNBC often ends with a poor clinical outcome due to high histological grade and recurrence rates with few treatment options. Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for TNBC treatment, but unfortunately, patients frequently develop resistance, and alternative treatment strategies for chemoresistant disease remain a major unmet need. ER&#946;, a second form of the estrogen receptor, is known to be expressed in approximately 20-30% of TNBC, and ligand-mediated activation of ER&#946; elicits potent anti-cancer effects in chemosensitive TNBC. However, the utility of ER&#946; in the chemoresistant setting remains unclear.<br \/>Materials and methods: To study the mechanistic basis of chemoresistance in TNBC cells and identify alternative treatment approaches for chemotherapy-resistant disease, doxorubicin-resistant (Doxo-R) and paclitaxel-resistant (Taxol-R) cell lines were generated using MDA-MB-231 cells. A Doxycycline (dox) inducible expression system was used to overexpress ER&#946; in these cells. RNA sequencing and transcription factor (TF) activation profiling was performed to glean a comprehensive mechanistic insight into mechanisms of resistance and the functions of ER&#946;, and the efficacy of ER&#946; targeted therapies, were assessed.<br \/>Results: Doxo-R and Taxol-R cells exhibited a 3- and 12-fold decrease in sensitivity to their respective chemotherapeutic agents. Doxo-R cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel while Taxol-R cells exhibited no changes in sensitivity to doxorubicin. Expression of ER&#946; had no impact on the IC50s for either chemotherapy drug. Taxol-R cells exhibited a significantly increased number of cells in the S phase. Proliferation assays revealed that ER&#946; targeting agents, including estradiol (E2) and the ER&#946;-specific agonist LY500307 (LY), led to substantial inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion when ER&#946; was expressed. We identified a large spectrum of genes expression changes that were acquired in Doxo-R and Taxol-R cells. These changes included 91 kinases genes in Doxo-R cells and 164 in Taxol-R cells. TF activation profiling indicated that eight and four TFs were activated more than 2-fold, including NRF1, WT1, and SATB1 in both Doxo-R and Taxol-R cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Doxo-R and Taxol-R TNBC cell lines were successfully established and serve as a good model for studying the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and screening effective agents to reverse or treat chemoresistant disease. As in the sensitive setting, ER&#946; targeted therapies may represent an alternative treatment for TNBC patients with chemorefractory ER&#946;+ disease, a possibility that is currently being explored through a phase II clinical trial (NCT03941730).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f17f924e-3a0e-4983-a8d6-483fc2353e45\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Estrogen receptor &#946;,Transcription factor,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16044"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiyin Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael J.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible cellular program that contributes to the intratumoral heterogeneity of carcinoma cells and confers traits that promote metastatic progression and resistance to chemotherapy. The standard of care for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains neoadjuvant chemotherapy where cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and paclitaxel are administered in combination. In case of advanced\/metastatic disease, third-line eribulin is administered as a single agent. In some cases of advanced disease, vinorelbine has also demonstrated efficacy. Eribulin, vinorelbine, and paclitaxel are microtubule inhibitors that act via mitotic blockade.<br \/><b>Knowledge gap:<\/b> Despite major advances in our understanding, the contributions of EMT research to improvements in cancer therapy have been minimal and yielded no clinically viable strategies to selectively modulate EMT in human tumors.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our new data reveals that eribulin, in addition to blocking tubulin polymerization, utilizes epigenetic mechanisms to induce MET. Using thermal proteome profiling and mass spectrometry analyses, we identify candidate target proteins of eribulin that could enable it to act in an epigenetic fashion to induce MET.Treating TNBC patient-derived xenograft tumors with eribulin induces a significant reduction in metastatic burden, with the remaining metastatic colonies exhibiting a well-differentiated histopathology. Eribulin efficiently induce MET in cells that have received no prior chemotherapy; in cells pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes, eribulin is less efficient at MET induction. Additionally, cells that were resistant to first-line taxane treatment were also resistant to eribulin-induced cell death. Using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we have determined the optimal sequence of eribulin administration to maximize its MET-inducing and cytotoxic effects.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We uncover that, working through altering the chromatin landscape and transcriptional profile of cells, eribulin induces MET and primes cells for subsequent chemotherapy. Additionally, the activity of eribulin is highest when administered in the treatment-na&#239;ve setting. By developing an understanding of eribulin&#8217;s mechanism of action, treatment strategies can be optimized to maximize therapeutic potential by exploiting its effects in both mitotic blockade as well as MET. Upon completion of this study, we will better understand how MET-induced tumor differentiation would work and the impact that it would have on current conventional therapeutic strategies.<br \/><b>Acknowledgements:<\/b> Eribulin studies funded by Eisai Inc.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19572b1c-ab9d-4a4c-95b0-45d5c7e7cf24\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),Drug resistance,Metastasis,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16045"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meisam Bagheri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nevena B.

Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer comprises 70% of all breast cancer cases. Antiestrogens and CDK4\/6 inhibitors are now part of standard of care therapies for advanced and metastatic ER+ breast tumors. Unfortunately, resistance to these therapies is prevalent and metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease. Since drug resistant cancer cells often have deregulated metabolic pathways, we tested the efficacy of a novel dysfunctional tyrosine, SM-88 (D,L-alpha-metyrosine; racemetyrosine), alone or in combination with sub-toxic doses of conditioning agents, methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus (MPS) in resistant cell models of ER+ breast cancer. In normal cells, tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid, is made from phenylalanine and not readily taken up by cells. Therefore, it is hypothesized that SM-88 uptake will be increased in cancer cells compared to normal cells. To evaluate whether SM-88 is a potential anti-cancer agent for drug resistant ER+ tumors, we used antiestrogens and CDK4\/6 inhibitors sensitive (parental MCF7 and T47D cell lines) or resistant (MCF7-R and T47D-R) cells in this study. We show that cell proliferation was inhibited in both sensitive and resistant ER+ breast cancer cells at 72 h, however, the IC50 of SM-88 as a monotherapy was higher in resistant cells compared with sensitive cells, 5mM versus 2 mM, respectively. Combination of SM-88 and MPS had an additive effect and lowered the IC50 in both resistant and sensitive cells, 2mM versus 1mM, respectively. Both LAT1 and CD98, known transporters of tyrosine, were expressed in sensitive and resistant cells. Furthermore, SM-88 as a single agent or in combination with MPS resulted in the induction of incomplete autophagy in both sensitive and resistant cells.

Despite the demonstrated efficacy, intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti-HER2 ADCs remains a major challenge. The activity of ADCs is dependent upon the internalization of the HER2-ADC complex into specific subcellular compartments permissive for release of the chemotherapeutic payload. Previous studies have demonstrated that statins, a commonly used cholesterol-lowering medication, could increase plasma membrane-bound HER2 and improve trastuzumab efficacy in HER2-positive gastric cancer. In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of statins on the efficacy of HER2 ADCs. We performed <i>in vitro<\/i> internalization assays with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) labeled with a pH-sensitive pHrodo fluorogenic dye to monitor T-DM1 entering lysosome whereupon payload DM1 is released, and found that combined treatment of T-DM1 and lovastatin potently enhanced T-DM1 internalization of T-DM1 into lysosome in HER2-amplified and HER2-low models. Consistent with the internalization assays, lovastatin increased cell death caused by T-DM1 and sensitized the HER2-low ZR75-1 cells to T-DM1 treatment <i>in vitro<\/i>. Using HER2-positive xenograft models, we found orally administrated lovastatin promoted T-DM1 uptake in tumors and enhanced T-DM1 efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>. To investigate whether these results might be observed in the clinic, we conducted retrospective analyses on a cohort of 164 HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated at MSKCC who received T-DM1. Among these patients, 21 (12.8%) were taking statins concurrently with T-DM1, and the median progression-free survival in the patients who received statins was 14 months (95% confidence interval, 3.5-24 months) compared to 5.4 months (95% confidence interval, 3.9-7.0 months) in those who had no record of statin use (p=0.1). Overall, our findings demonstrate that statins potentiate the susceptibility of breast cancer cells to anti-HER2 ADCs by modulating HER2 membrane dynamics and HER2-ADC internalization, suggesting statin as a rational therapeutic partner for anti-HER2 ADC in HER2-positive breast cancer, especially those with relatively low HER2 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3473b7ad-c910-4d93-884e-d2dca9440c70\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Statins,HER2,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Endocytosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16047"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bo Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua Z.

Resistance to cancer therapies arises from many factors. One of the key factors driving resistance is oncogenes which initiate pro-growth, pro-survival and metastatic programs that enable cancers escape various therapies. In HER2+ breast cancer, the oncogene HER2 is the master driver of this tumor. Trastuzumab effectively targets HER2. While this is generally successful, some patients who have HER2+ breast cancer develop resistance to trastuzumab and there are limited treatment options for them. Moreover, for low HER2+ expressing breast cancer, there are limited treatment options for them. And in African American women who have HER2+ breast cancer, there is disparity in their treatment outcomes. We have discovered that 3&#8217;UTR of HER2 is enriched with poly U stabilizing AU rich elements (ARE). We have developed a novel technology wherein we engineered the stabilizing HER2 3&#8217;UTR ARE motifs to destabilizing motif in HER2+ and HER2+ trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cells to control HER2 transcript. We achieved complete degradation of HER2 within 4-8 days in HER2+ wildtype breast cancer cells and 9-11 days in HER2+ trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cells. We had loss of cancer cell viability by more than 90%. We also show that control of HER2 transcript downregulated HER2-dependent kinases, transcription factors, and HER2 interactome. Mechanistically, the control of HER2 transcript was achieved by destabilized ARE sequence specificity which triggered the proteins PARN, XRN1 and CNOT1 to degrade HER2 transcript and this led to induction of active caspase 3\/7, reduction of cell size, and severe distortion and disruption of the cancer cell membrane leading to cell death. Taken together, we have a developed a novel approach to control HER2 transcript expression both on spatial and temporal scale. This novel approach offers applications for targeting HER2+ trastuzumab resistant breast cancer as well as other cancers resistant to HER2 targeted therapy and driven by pervasive oncogenic signals.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1972ba16-ce43-4e9b-9fac-2150ad77b44f\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Oncogene,Target discovery,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16048"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chidiebere U.

For each patient, we inferred the clonal structure of the samples and tracked the metastatic spread of different clones throughout the body. For 7 patients, we also analyzed serial cfDNA samples to identify clones that were selected for during treatment. We identified significantly recurrent and convergent (arising independently in distinct clones) acquired mutations in ESR1, KRAS, and chromatin modifier genes, in particular, mutations in KMT2C, which may represent mechanisms of drug resistance in this clinical setting. To experimentally study the role of KMT2C mutations, we used CRISPR\/Cas9 to knock out KMT2C in the ER+ CAMA1 breast cancer cell line that is sensitive to both ER and CDK4\/6 inhibition. KMT2C knock-out cells demonstrated significantly increased viability under treatment with fulvestrant (ERi), palbociclib (CDK4\/6i), or their combination compared to the control cell lines. We show that this increased drug resistance is driven by downregulation of the ESR1 pathway, suggesting a decreased dependency on ER signaling for cell cycle progression. In addition to the early survival benefit, KMT2C knock-out resulted in a dramatic outgrowth of cells under long-term fulvestrant treatment. The KMT2C KO fulvestrant-resistant outgrown cells were highly resistant to the CDK4\/6 inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib compared to control cells, as well as to novel ERalpha inhibitors and a range of targeted therapies currently in clinical trials. By testing a panel of compounds on KMT2C KO and control cell lines, we propose potential novel therapeutic strategies that may help overcome the development of resistance in KMT2C-mutant cells. These findings suggest that KMT2C mutations may be a mechanism of acquired resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibitor combinations, and subsequent treatment with therapies directed towards ER or CDK4\/6 pathways may be ineffective and other treatment avenues need to be developed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/56af5d60-29a3-43a9-b1bd-11876bae943d\/@v03B8ZEu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cell cycle inhibitors,Chromatin remodeling,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16049"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizaveta Leshchiner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignaty Leshchiner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth E.

However, resistance to herceptin and\/or lapatinib frequently occurs and currently represents a significant clinical problem. We previously demonstrated that both HER3- and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-initiated signaling played crucial roles in the development of herceptin resistance. Further studies showed that our herceptin-resistant SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 sublines, as compared their parental SKBR3 and BT474 cells, respectively, also exhibited refractoriness to lapatinib <i>in vitro<\/i>. However, the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of lapatinib against the herceptin-resistant BC models (SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20) remains unclear.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tumor xenograft models were established via subcutaneous inoculation of SKBR3-pool2 or BT474-HR20 cells into athymic nude mice. Tumor formation was assessed by palpation and measured with fine calipers twice a week. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or lapatinib (80&nbsp;mg\/kg) via intraperitoneal injection daily for three weeks. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were performed to assess the expression and activation of proteins. Two individuals independently read and quantified all IHC slides by considering both the intensity of immunostaining and the percentage of positive-staining tumor cells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Treatment with lapatinib profoundly inhibited growth of the tumors established with SKBR3-pool2 cells. In contrast, lapatinib slightly, but not significantly, reduced tumor growth in BT474-HR20 cells-derived xenograft models. IHC analyses of the tumors obtained from both SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 xenografts showed that lapatinib treatment had little effect on the expression of HER3 and the protein phosphatase PPP3CB.

Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a humanized anti-TROP2 antibody conjugated with SN-38, was approved for treatment of metastatic triple negative breast cancer, with the greatest efficacy in patients with medium or high TROP2 levels. We sought to enhance efficacy of TROP2-targeted therapies by pharmacological regulation of TROP2 expression.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> TROP2 levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in two sets of breast tumors: a set of surgical samples and a tissue microarray. TROP2 mRNA expression was assessed in surgical samples and breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with RNAseq and assessed in the TCGA. In cell lines, expression of TROP2, E-cadherin (E-cad), and Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11) were assessed by immunoblotting and qPCR following drug treatment or cell line manipulation. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition was evaluated by cell migration, cell invasion, and anchorage-independent growth assays. Antitumor efficacy of drug combination was assessed by cell survival, cell colony formation, and apoptosis assays.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> By IHC, TROP2 was expressed in only 40% of metaplastic breast cancers (MpBC), but nearly all non-MpBC tumors. TCGA database evaluation further showed higher TROP2 levels in non-MpBC tumors than metaplastic tumors. In breast cancer surgical specimens, breast cancer PDXs, and the TCGA, there was a strong correlation between TROP2 and E-cad expression. <i>In vitro<\/i>, we demonstrated that downregulating transcriptional factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) led to mesenchymal-epithelial transition with upregulation of both E-cad and TROP2 expression in breast cancer cells, leading to increased sensitivity to SG treatment. Screening of epigenetic modulators identified DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine as an enhancer of TROP2 and E-cad expression in PDX cell lines of metaplastic cancer origin and mesenchymal subtype breast cancer cell lines. Decitabine increased TROP2 expression by decreasing TROP2 promoter methylation. Decitabine was significantly synergistic with SG, and enhanced apoptosis. Similarly, overexpression of TROP2 (by plasmid) in cell lines enhanced activity of SG. Furthermore, decitabine increased expression of SLFN11, a putative biomarker of SN38 sensitivity, and was synergistic with SG in TROP2 expressing, SLFN11 low breast cancer cell lines.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> TROP2 is expressed in most breast cancers, but is expressed less frequently in MpBC, an aggressive subtype unresponsive to traditional therapies. Epigenetic modulator decitabine upregulates TROP2 and SLFN11 expression and enhances antitumor efficacy of SG. Combinatorial treatment of TROP2 ADCs with epigenetic modulators of TROP2 represent a novel therapeutic strategy for tumors with low TROP2 or SLFN11 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cbc6394d-94e0-4a97-b0da-a8667267fb01\/@w03B8ZEv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Trop-2,Breast cancer,Epigenetics,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16056"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ming Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy P.

However, clinical observations suggest that BRCA<sup>m<\/sup> tumors develop PARPi resistance. Current strategies to overcome PARPi resistance include impeding multiple DNA repair pathways to induce excessive DNA damage. Here, we propose a novel strategy targeting oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases to enhance PARP trapping. By developing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells with acquired talazoparib resistance, we observed a high prevalence of activated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) kinase in these cells through kinase antibody array analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis and <i>in vitro<\/i> kinase assay suggested that FGFR3 phosphorylated PARP1 at tyrosine residues 158 and 176. Biochemistry studies suggested that only PARP1 tyrosine 158 phosphorylation contributes to PARPi resistance in the cells we developed. We then developed a monoclonal antibody against tyrosine 158 phosphorylated PARP1, and found that high-level PARP1 tyrosine 158 phosphorylation positively correlated with PARPi resistance in breast cancer patient-derived xenograft models. We further demonstrated that the combination of FGFR inhibitor and PARPi delayed DNA repair with prolonged PARP trapping. Moreover, synergy between PARPi and FGFR inhibition was observed in multiple TNBC cell lines with PARPi resistance<i> in vitro<\/i>. The combination of PARPi and FGFR inhibitor also showed synergism <i>in vivo<\/i>, and treatment with the combination of PARPi and FGFR inhibitor was tolerated in mouse models. These findings reveal that PARP1 tyrosine 158 phosphorylation facilitates resolving of the PARPi-induced PARP-trapping, and that the tyrosine 158 phosphorylated PARP1 may be an effective biomarker to indicate FGFR3 mediated PARPi resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/04c86f51-aa91-4427-9461-25da5a667f33\/@w03B8ZEv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Drug resistance,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16073"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>MeiKuang Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiya Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Han Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer K.

Basal type-BC cells are sensitive to MEKi (MEK Inhibitor), and 77% of basal-type BCs are TNBCs. We previously showed that MEKi selumetinib (AZD6244) effectively inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in a TNBC xenograft model. However, clinical studies have shown that MEKi as single agents have only modest activity against solid tumors. Therefore, combinatorial therapeutic strategies represent an urgent unmet clinical need for TNBC patients. Using a high-throughput whole-genome siRNA screen, we identified and validated the antiapoptotic protein MCL1, which is overexpressed in many human cancers, including TNBC, as a potential candidate that could be therapeutically targeted alongside MEK. We hypothesized that the combination of AZD6244 plus AZD5991 overcomes MEKi resistance in TNBC.<br \/>Methods and Results: We previously established two cell lines resistant to AZD6244 to a final concentration of 15 &#181;M (MDA-MB-231-R and SUM-149-R). Both these MDA MB-231-R and SUM-149-R cells showed increased proliferation with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 24.01 and 22.76&#956;M as compared to the parental IC<sub>50<\/sub> 2.7 and 3.80&#181;M respectively. The colony-forming rates of the MDA-MB-231-R and SUM-149-R cells were more than 50% higher than their parental cells (p &#8804; 0.05), and the resistant cells had lower proportions of the cells in G0\/G1 phase (49.03% and 22.89%, respectively) than their parental cells did (73.01% and 60.03%, respectively). Compared with their parental cells, SUM 149-R (86.26% vs 66.04%) and MDA MB-231-R (95.27% vs. 73.47%) had a higher proportion of CD44<sup>+<\/sup>CD24<sup>-\/low<\/sup> cells and higher average mammosphere count (330 vs. 55) and (892 vs. 273). The IC<sub>50<\/sub> values for SUM149-R (1.68 &#181;M) and MDA-MB-231-R (7.2 &#181;M) cells treated with AZD6244 in combination with the MCL inhibitor AZD5991 was significantly lower than that for cells treated with AZD6244 alone. To validate this finding, we used siRNA to knock down MCL1 and confirmed 80-90% silencing of both resistant and parental cells via western blotting. Furthermore, MCL1 silencing sensitized both MDA-MB-231-R and SUM-149-R cells to AZD6244, as MCL1-knockout cells treated with AZD6244 had significant reduction in cell proliferation and colony formation as compared to the respective controls.<br \/>Conclusions and Future Directions: Our findings support our hypothesis that the combination of AZD6244 plus AZD5991 overcomes MEKi resistance in TNBC. To further translate these interesting findings, we plan to evaluate the effect of this drug combination in vivo in TNBC models.

While use of targeted agents has substantially improved survival of these patients, clinical drug resistance is prevalent. DNA repair defects are a feature of cancer that has been exploited by targeted agents such as inhibitors of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). PARP inhibitors have been shown to be effective in patients with germline mutations in other DNA repair factors such as BRCA1\/2. There is limited data for the use of PARP inhibitors in HER2+ breast cancers, and in tumors without BRCA1\/2 mutations. Using a collection of HER2+ and HER2-low expressing breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have differential responses to the Her2-targeted agents Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, and T-DM1, we tested the combination of these agents with Talazoparib (Talzenna&#8482;), a clinically approved Parp inhibitor<i>.<\/i><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Orthotopically engrafted PDX mouse models resistant to either Trastuzumab or T-DM1 were randomized into treatment arms including Trastuzumab or T-DM1 in combination with Talazoparib, and the single agents alone. Mice are monitored for body weight and change in tumour volume every 2-3 days, then sacrificed at endpoint for survival analysis. We have also generated PDX-derived cells (PDCs) from one model with which to validate <i>in vivo <\/i>results and perform mechanistic studies. All models are being characterized for copy number changes, somatic mutations, and protein expression by immunohistochemistry.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The combination of Talazoparib and either Trastuzumab or T-DM1 was effective in 3 PDX models, including a Trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ PDX, a T-DM1-resistant HER2+ PDX and a T-DM1-resistant HER2-low expressing PDX. The combinations resulted in significant delays in tumour growth (p&#60;0.05), including a transient tumour regression with the combination T-DM1+Talazoparib in 1 PDX. Median overall survival time was improved with the combination of Trastuzumab +Talazoparib (p&#60;0.05), while the combinations of T-DM1+Talazoparib increased survival time although not significantly. Notably all models have maintained Her2 expression through treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our results suggest that combining HER-targeted agents with Talazoparib may benefit patients with advanced HER2-therapy resistant HER2+ and low HER2+ breast cancers.

Classical views of therapeutic resistance include tumor heterogeneity and genetic instability, but our group and others have identified an unappreciated cancer cell phenotype, the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state, that provides an alternative model. The PACC state is induced upon exposure to a variety of applied stressors, including multiple different classes of chemotherapy, and is characterized by an enlarged cell size, polyploidy of the typically aneuploid cancer genome, and the ability to repopulate tissue through depolyploidization. We have demonstrated that PACCs are present in a variety of cell lines, arise in response to a multitude of stressors <i>in vitro, <\/i>and are resistant to cisplatin, docetaxel and Ipatasertib treatment. Thus, we hypothesize that the PACC state is driving cancer&#8217;s therapeutic resistance to nearly all available treatment regimens and enabling cancer relapse. Elimination of the PACC state is essential to prevent cancer recurrence, and ultimately enable a cure for cancer.To identify candidate drug targets specific to the PACC state, we performed RNA sequencing, NanoString mRNA panels, bulk proteomics and cell surface proteomics of PACCs versus their parental cell line. PACCs were induced from prostate cancer lines PC3 and LNCaP, and breast cancer line MDAMB231 with both cisplatin and docetaxel treatment. Initial datasets with PC3 cells found that 1013 genes are enriched (greater than 1.5 Log2 Fold Change) in cisplatin induced PACCs while 88 genes are enriched in docetaxel induced PACCs. 22 genes were enriched with both chemotherapy treatments implying that there are genes common to the PACC state. NanoString mRNA and proteomic analysis further validated a subset of the overlapping genes, including ATF3, BIRC3, IL6, and NOX5.Our existing data reveals that there are molecular vulnerabilities of the PACC state that can be manipulated for therapeutic elimination. We will further validate candidate genes across numerous stressors and cell lines and then assess the PACC state&#8217;s dependence on these pathways through inhibition and engineered cell lines. Information from these studies will directly lead to development of a therapeutic strategy specifically targeting the PACC state, with the intention of eliminating cancer resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17d2d989-43e6-45ad-b6ca-2411e176e8bd\/@w03B8ZEv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapy resistance,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16135"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luke Loftus<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Despite the efficacy of taxanes, many tumors will recur due to drug resistance. Therefore, the need to understand the mechanism behind drug resistance is critical to improve patient outcome and survival. Our lab was the first to show that loss of the <i>Adenomatous Polyposis Coli<\/i> <i>(APC)<\/i> tumor suppressor caused resistance to PTX in the MDA-MB-157 human TNBC cell line. In the absence of APC, apoptosis induction was decreased, as measured through cleaved caspase 3 and annexin\/PI staining. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind APC-mediated PTX response, we analyzed the BCL-2 family of proteins and found a robust increase of the pro-survival family member, Bcl-2. The BH3 mimetic, ABT-199 (Venetoclax), which specifically targets Bcl-2, has been used as a single or combination therapy in multiple hematologic malignancies. In addition, ABT-199 has shown promise in multiple subtypes of breast cancer. Therefore, we used ABT-199 in combination with PTX to address the hypothesis that APC-induced Bcl-2 increase is responsible for PTX resistance. Combination treatment in three CRISPR-mediated APC knockout TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, and SUM159) caused changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Combined, these data suggest restored sensitivity to PTX using ABT-199. Our studies are the first to show that Bcl-2 inhibition can restore PTX-sensitivity in APC mutant breast cancer cells. These studies are critical to advance better treatment regimens in patients with TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c14a6eac-3dd0-4f2c-852c-6d238c3b30f9\/@w03B8ZEv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcl-2 protein family,APC,Breast cancer,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16137"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sara Maloney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Zabala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Richmond<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jenifer R.

CDK4\/6i [palbociclib (palbo), ribociclib (ribo), and abemaciclib (abema)] have the same nominal targets but vary in their target specificity and are pharmacologically distinct. Clinical benefit was observed in patients treated with abema after progression on a prior CDK4\/6i suggesting that palbo\/ribo refractory tumors retain abema sensitivity.

Currently, very few options are available for TNBC treatment. Cancer cells exploit glycolytic machinery for the Warburg effect and aerobic glycolysis. Enolase 1 (ENO1) is the glycolytic enzyme expressed in the majority of tissues and many cancer cells have its higher expression. Apart from the glycolytic role in the cytosol, ENO1 also plays different roles in cancer cells including function as a surface receptor. We have developed a chemical small molecule (CET12) that strongly binds to ENO1 and restrain its activity and subcellular localization. CET12 treatment arrests the TNBC cells in the mitotic phase and leads the apoptotic cell death <i>via<\/i> AMPK activation. Global proteome profiling suggested that CET12 pushes the cells toward oxidative phosphorylation.

We recently suggest new insights into the critical role of the NSDHL involved in breast tumor growth and metastasis and its potential for targeted cancer therapy. Compound 9, which is a novel inhibitor of NSDHL, was kindly provided by Dr. Lee B-J in Seoul National University College of Pharmacy. This study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer potential of Compound 9 in breast cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Therapeutic potential of Compound 9 (10~100 &#956;M) was investigated in several human breast cancer cell lines. Total intracellular cholesterol level was measured using Total Cholesterol Assay Kit. Cell cycle analysis using DNA staining with PI, apoptosis analysis using Annexin V\/PI-labeling, and transwell migration assay were performed. The Synergistic anticancer effect of compound-9 and paclitaxel was evaluated by crystal violet assay. Western blot and immunofluorescent staining were assessed for investigating the mechanism by which Compound 9 exerts the anti-cancer effect.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Time-dependent intracellular uptake of Compound 9 by breast cancer cells was observed. Compound 9 induced cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects and cell cycle arrest (G0\/G1), and suppressed migration activity on diverse breast cancer cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Total intracellular cholesterol level was reduced by Compound 9. Combination with Compound-9 and Paclitaxel led to synergistic cytotoxicity. Compound-9 increased the autophagy-related proteins (P62, LC3II) but decreased the anti-apoptotic proteins (XIAP, BCL2).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data show that Compound 9 exerts strong anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activity in breast cancer cells, suggesting potential additional utility as an anti-cancer drug. Further studies are necessary to validate the potential anti-cancer effect of Compound-9 in breast tumor mice models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/935720c1-949c-4c61-9186-c44380acd3b2\/@x03B8ZEw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug sensitivity,Compound 9,NSDHL,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18160"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>So-Hyun Yoon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hoe Suk Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moonjou Baek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seungyeon Ryu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sangeun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han-Byoel Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bong-Jin Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wonshik Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

TTFields therapy is approved in several territories for treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) and unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. Recently, membrane permeability of GBM cells has been found to be increased in response to TTFields application. The current study aimed to further explore this effect, testing the potential of TTFields to facilitate cellular accumulation of the anticancer agent doxorubicin (DOX) in breast carcinoma cells.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> 4T1 breast mammary carcinoma cells were treated with TTFields (1.7 V\/cm RMS) for 72 h across a frequency range (50-500 kHz). Cytotoxicity was examined by cell counts, and permeability determined by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) intracellular accumulation, both measured by flow cytometry. Next, TTFields at the frequency inducing highest permeability was applied to chemotherapy-sensitive and matched chemotherapy-resistant cells. Intracellular accumulation of DOX and drug-induced cytotoxicity were measured by flow cytometry. <i>In vivo<\/i> validation was performed by 72 h delivery of TTFields at the frequency of maximal permeability to mice orthotopically inoculated with 4T1 cells and injected with DOX 24 h before treatment cessation. DOX florescence was measured using <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging system (IVIS) for whole tumor assessment and flow cytometry for detection at the single-cell level.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> While highest TTFields-induced cytotoxicity was observed at 150 kHz, 7-AAD intracellular accumulation was maximal at 300 kHz. When TTFields were delivered concomitant with DOX, the drug accumulated to the same extent in chemotherapy-resistant cells as in chemotherapy-sensitive cells. Application of TTFields also sensitized both cell types to DOX, with cytotoxicity observed at low drug concentrations. Furthermore, 2- to 3-fold higher DOX accumulation was seen in tumors isolated from mice treated with TTFields relative to control.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> Permeability of 4T1 breast cancer cells was elevated by TTFields, allowing enhanced intracellular accumulation of DOX and improving drug efficacy, even in chemotherapy-resistant cells.
