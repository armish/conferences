Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) following chemoradiotherapy and resection significantly improves disease free survival (DFS) for esophageal cancer, the effectiveness of ICB together with chemotherapy in LA GC\/GEJ cancer is unknown.<br \/>Methods: This is a multicenter, single-arm, phase II clinical trial of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks with capecitabine 625 mg\/m2 twice daily and oxaliplatin 130 mg\/m2 every 3 weeks (CAPOX) in patients with resectable GC\/GEJ adenocarcinoma. Subjects with ECOG PS of 0-1 received CAPOX with pembrolizumab for 3 cycles prior to and 3 cycles following surgery with an additional cycle of pembrolizumab just prior to surgery and 12 months of maintenance pembrolizumab following adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. The study had 80% power to detect an increase in pCR rate from 3% to 15% with a one-sided alpha of 0.05. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, DFS, and overall survival (OS). This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02918162).<br \/>Results: Between 02\/10\/2017 and 06\/17\/2021, 36 patients were enrolled with 34 (21 gastric and 13 GEJ) evaluable for efficacy. The median age was 65 years and 17 (50%) patients had an ECOG PS of 1. In total, 29 (85%) patients underwent resection. Seven patients achieved a pCR (20.6% of evaluable patients and 24.1% of those who underwent resection). An additional 6 (17.6%) patients achieved a near CR and 8 (23.5%) demonstrated a significant treatment effect on pathologic review. One patient was deemed unfit for surgery, 2 expired prior to surgery, and 2 were found to have metastatic disease during surgery. At the time of data cut-off, the median follow-up was 19 mo. Of those who underwent resection, 4 (13.7%) experienced disease recurrence and 5 (17.2%) expired. The probability of survival at 1 and 2 years was 0.91 (0.82-1.0) and 0.80 (0.64-0.99), respectively. The median DFS and OS have not been reached. Of the 35 patients who received treatment, treatment related adverse events (AEs) of grade greater than or equal to 3 were reported in 18 (51%) patients. Grade greater than or equal to 3 immune-related AEs were reported in 10 (29%) patients. Three grade 5 AEs occurred, two possibly treatment-related (gastric hemorrhage and gastric perforation) and one unrelated to treatment (cardiac arrest).<br \/>Conclusion: In LA GC\/GEJ adenocarcinoma, the combination CAPOX and pembrolizumab resulted in a pCR rate of 20.6%. The combination was well tolerated and 85.3% of patients underwent surgical resection. This trial met its primary endpoint supporting further investigation of this regimen as an alternative for patients who are unlikely to tolerate triple combination chemotherapy. Correlative studies are in progress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Immune checkpoint blockade,Chemotherapy,Surgical resection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alexander Grenander Raufi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shing Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael May<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Armando Del Portillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naomi Sender<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Sta Ana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katarzyna Gautier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Alouani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haeseong Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Oberstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gulam A.

This study enrolled patients with FIGO stage IIIC-IV EOC. Patients were assigned to one of the following neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy (NACI): original cohort arm1 (D 1,500 mg q3w + T 75 mg q3w + paclitaxel 175 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> + carboplatin AUC 5 [3 cycles]) or expansion cohort arm2 (D 1,500 mg q3w + T 300 mg [1 dose] + same chemotherapy as original). Arm2 was initiated after the completion of arm1. After NAC, all patients underwent interval debulking surgery (IDS). After IDS, three cycles of D (1,120 mg) and adjuvant chemotherapy followed by D maintenance (1,120 mg [total 12 cycles]) were administered. During treatment, serial biopsies were performed to explore immunologic changes in tumor microenvironment (TME). The primary endpoint was a 12-month PFS rate. Interim analysis was performed to evaluate outcomes after NAC after all patients underwent IDS. A total of 45 patients were enrolled as follows: arm1 (n=23) and arm2 (n=22). The majority of the patients presented with high-grade serous carcinoma (91.1%) and stage IV disease (77.8%). After NAC, the ORR was 86.7% by RECIST v1.1 (95.7% in arm1 and 81.8% in arm2, P=0.17). At IDS, 30 patients (66.7%) had R0 resection (73.9% in arm1 and 59.1% in arm2, P=0.353). Fourteen patients (31.1%) had a CRS 3 (39.1% in arm1 and 22.7% in arm2, P=0.337) and 5 (11.1%) had a pathologic remission. Skin rashes were the most common adverse events (51.1%) and grade &#8805;3 events occurred in 3 patients (15.6%), which completely resolved after steroid use. Stromal TIL (P=0.0335), CD8 (P&#60;0.001), CD8\/Foxp3 ratio (P&#60;0.001) on immunohistochemistry were significantly increased after NACI. When TILs were analyzed in detail by flow cytometry, suppressive intratumoral regulatory T cells (Treg) were significantly decreased after NACI in both arm (P&#60;0.05). Interestingly, the frequency of intratumoral Treg after NACI was lower in arm1 than arm2 (P&#60;0.05). These interim data highlight the clinical activity and manageable toxicity profile for the addition of D and T to NAC in aEOC. Additional translational study data will be presented at the meeting.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{4BA95679-B6E6-4938-B593-B1F63BFCA0EE}\"><caption>Summary of secondary outcomes<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">D+T75+CT (n=23)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">D+T300+CT (n=22)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P value<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR by RECIST<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22 (95.7%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18 (81.8%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.187<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR by PERCIST<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13\/14<sup>a<\/sup> (92.9%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16\/18<sup>a<\/sup> (88.9%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.856<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">R0 at IDS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17 (73.9%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (59.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.353<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CRS3 at IDS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9 (39.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (22.7%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.337<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pathologic CR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (17.4%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (4.5%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.348<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/><sup>a<\/sup>, PERCIST was available in 14 (original) and 18 (expansion) cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,CTLA-4,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Junsik Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunhyang Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Je-Gun Joung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myong Cheol Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byoung-Gie Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Weon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung Bok Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunghoon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chel Hun Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hee Seung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Yoon Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jongsuk Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung-Yun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

NeoCOAST (NCT03794544) is a global, randomized phase 2 study of the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) durvalumab (D) alone or combined with the anti-CD73 mAb oleclumab (O), the anti-NKG2A mAb monalizumab (M), or the anti-STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide danvatirsen (Da) as neoadjuvant therapy.<br \/>Methods: Pts with previously untreated, cytologically\/histologically documented, resectable, Stage I [&#62;2 cm]-IIIA NSCLC and ECOG PS 0-1 were randomized 1:1:1:1 (stratified by lymph node involvement) to receive D 1500 mg IV alone Q4W or combined with O 3000 mg IV Q2W, M 750 mg IV Q2W, or Da 200 mg IV QW, for one 28-day cycle, followed by surgery. Da monotherapy was also given on days 1, 3 and 5 of the week prior to combination treatment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed major pathological response (MPR; &#8804;10% residual viable tumor cells at tumor site and nodes, at surgery). Secondary endpoints were pathological complete response (pCR; no viable tumor cells), safety and tolerability, feasibility of surgery, PK and immunogenicity. Exploratory endpoints included tumor and microbiome biomarkers and blood mRNA signatures.<br \/>Results: From March 2019 to Sept 2020, 84 pts were randomized and 83 received D (n=26), D+O (n=21), D+M (n=20), or D+Da (n=16). MPR occurred in 11.1% (95% CI, 2.4-29.2), 19.0% (95% CI, 5.4-41.9), 30.0% (95% CI, 11.9-54.3), and 31.3% (95% CI, 11.0-58.7%), respectively. pCR occurred in 3.7% (95% CI, 0.1-19.0), 9.5% (95% CI, 1.2-30.4), 10.0% (95% CI, 1.2-31.7%) and 12.5% (95% CI, 1.6-38.3), respectively. Rates of treatment-related AEs were 34.6% with D, 57.1% with D+O, 50.0% with D+M, and 43.8% with D+Da (grade &#8805;3 in 0%, 4.8%, 0% and 6.3%, respectively). Most pts (76\/83; 91.6%) completed surgery with no significant delay; of the 7 pts unable to, 5 had progressive or stage IV disease. Across all arms, MPR was more common in pts with baseline tumor PD&#8209;L1 expression &#8805;1% vs those with &#60;1%. With D, CD73 expression was correlated with greater residual viable tumor cells at surgery; however, with D+O, high CD73 (&#8805;10% tumor cells) was associated with reduced viable tumor cells. Transcriptome analysis of post-treatment and baseline blood samples showed upregulation of genes involved in B cell activation and antigen presentation in pts with MPR in the D+O arm, and upregulation of genes associated with Tregs in pts with MPR in the D+M arm.<br \/>Conclusions: One cycle of<b> <\/b>D + O, M or Da improved MPR and pCR rates vs D alone, with no new safety signals. Responses were associated with baseline tumor PD-L1 and CD73 expression levels. Pts with MPR receiving D+O or D+M had peripheral transcriptomic signatures related to immune cell function. These data warrant further investigation of these agents in resectable NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,Durvalumab,Neoadjuvant,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tina Cascone<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosario García-Campelo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Spicer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Walter Weder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Davey Daniel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Spigel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maen Hussein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Mazieres<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julio Oliveira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edwin Yau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Spira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raymond Mager<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oday Hamid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin-Yang Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Blando<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lara McGrath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Italia Grenga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yee Soo-Hoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakesh Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Forde<\/i><\/presenter>.

Notably, neoadjuvant NIVO + chemo did not impede feasibility of surgery nor increase incidence of surgical complications or adverse events (AEs) vs chemo alone. We report results from the first prespecified interim analysis of EFS, the other primary endpoint.<br \/>Methods: Adults with stage IB (&#8805; 4 cm)-IIIA (per AJCC 7<sup>th<\/sup> ed) resectable NSCLC, ECOG PS &#8804; 1, and no known <i>EGFR<\/i>\/<i>ALK<\/i> alterations were randomized to NIVO 360 mg + chemo Q3W or chemo Q3W for 3 cycles (n = 179 each). Primary endpoints were EFS and pCR (both assessed by blinded independent review) in the randomized population. EFS was defined as the length of time from randomization to any disease progression precluding surgery, disease progression or recurrence after surgery, or death due to any cause. An exploratory analysis of EFS by pCR status was conducted.<br \/>Results: At a median follow-up of 29.5 mo (database lock, October 20, 2021), neoadjuvant NIVO + chemo significantly improved EFS vs chemo in the randomized population (median [95% CI], 31.6 mo [30.2-not reached (NR)] vs 20.8 mo [14.0-26.7]; HR [97.38% CI], 0.63 [0.43-0.91]; <i>P <\/i>= 0.0052; 2-year EFS rates, 64% vs 45%). EFS results in the subgroups by disease stages, histologies, and PD-L1 expression levels are shown in the<br \/>Table: In the pooled patient population (NIVO + chemo and chemo arms combined), EFS was improved in patients with pCR compared with those without (median, NR vs 21.1 mo; HR [95% CI], 0.11 [0.04-0.29]). Incidence of grade 3-4 treatment-related (33.5% vs 36.9%) and surgery-related AEs (11.4% vs 14.8%) was similar between the NIVO + chemo and chemo arms, as reported previously.<br \/>Conclusions: In CheckMate 816, neoadjuvant NIVO + chemo showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS vs chemo alone. These results, along with the significant improvement in pCR, support NIVO + chemo as a potential new treatment option for patients with stage IB-IIIA resectable NSCLC.<b><\/b><br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{FEE1A7CE-4219-40B7-AC0A-9F96295311B4}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Subgroups<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>Median EFS, mo (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\"><b>HR (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>NIVO + chemo<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Chemo<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Overall (n = 358)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">31.6 (30.2-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20.8 (14.0-26.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.63 (0.43-0.91)<sup>a<\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><b>Baseline disease stage<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IB-II (n = 127)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR (27.8-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR (16.8-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.87 (0.48-1.56)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IIIA (n = 228)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">31.6 (26.6-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.7 (10.8-22.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.54 (0.37-0.80)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><b>Tumor histology<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Squamous (n = 182)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30.6 (20.0-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22.7 (11.5-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.77 (0.49-1.22)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Non-squamous (n = 176)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR (27.8-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.6 (13.8-26.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.50 (0.32-0.79)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><b>PD-L1 expression level<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt; 1% (n = 155)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25.1 (14.6-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18.4 (13.9-26.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.85 (0.54-1.32)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8805; 1% (n = 178)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR (NR-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.1 (11.5-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.41 (0.24-0.70)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1-49% (n = 98)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR (27.8-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">26.7 (11.5-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.58 (0.30-1.12)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8805; 50% (n = 80)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR (NR-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.6 (8.2-NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.24 (0.10-0.61)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><sup>a<\/sup>97.38% CI reported.
