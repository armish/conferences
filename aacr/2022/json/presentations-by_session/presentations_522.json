[{"Abstract":"Radiotherapy resistance is still an obstacle of improving the survival of patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer. In this study, whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing were preformed on colorectal cancer tumor tissue samples which were colloected from multiple centers, and the pathologic complete response predictive model PGS-LARC(Prediction Genotype Signature for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer) was established. A candidate SNV-SCAPER rs3812908 T&#62;C was screened using this model. To investigate the relationship between SCAPER rs3812908 T&#62;C and radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer, targeted sequencing was performed and the results revealed that proportion of CC genotype was significantly higher in resistant sequencing cohort than in sensitive ones (30% vs. 22%). And Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results revealed that SCAPER protein expressed less in CC genotype colorectal cancer tissues than in TT genotype. Here, the cell proliferation results showed that <i>SCAPER<\/i>-KD cells and <i>SCAPER<\/i> rs3812908 CC cells were more radioresistant than <i>SCAPER<\/i>-NC and TT cells. Furthermore, the immunofluorescence assay showed <i>SCAPER<\/i> rs3812908 T&#62;C promoted translocation of S phase associated protein-Cyclin A2 into nucleus and western blotting results showed that the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK(p-ERK and p-JNK) increased significantly in <i>SCAPER<\/i> CC cells, and the protein p-ATR, p-ATM, p-CDC25C and CDC25A related to homologous recombination repair were also increased in <i>SCAPER<\/i>-KD and <i>SCAPER<\/i> CC cells.Taken together, the <i>SCAPER<\/i> gene rs3812908 T&#62;C plays an important role in radioresistance of colorectal cancer. The SNV of SCAPER rs3812908 T&#62;C significantly promotes Cyclin A2 nuclear translocation, activates the MAPKs pathway, and increases homologous recombination repair, and finally leads to radioresistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bcd3df34-777b-44fe-af36-0e2f7df81807\/@q03B8ZQu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitivity,colorectal cancer,SCAPER gene,Single Nucleotide Variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17527"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hai-na Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ting Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shao-yan Xi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi-wei Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan-hong Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei-wei Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Till present, the underlying molecular mechanism of NPC radiation resistance remains poorly understood. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors have achieved better efficacy in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. Further studies are needed to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors enhance response to radiation in NPC. We performed RNA-seq analysis in NPC radioresistant and wild-type cells. We identified EGR1 promotes NPC radiation resistance and is significantly correlated with NPC recurrence. We further found that EGR1 upregulated PD-L1 expression at transcriptional level in a p38 MAPK dependent manner. Moreover, EGR1 participated in CD8+T cell mediated immune evasion in NPC radioresistant cells. We therefore propose a hypothesis that p38 MAPK\/EGR1 axis induced PD-L1 expression promotes radiation resistance of NPC by enhancing immune evasion. This study aims to identify the key regulatory factors in p38 MAPK\/EGR1\/PD-L1 axis, especially PD-L1, as a new target to improve radiosensitivity of NPC, provide theoretical basis for PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors plus radiotherapy in the treatment of NPC. Meanwhile, this study also provides the possibility for predicting the radiosensitivity of NPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/85f224cd-de59-4a43-b50c-7c355ccce57b\/@q03B8ZQu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,EGR1,Radiation resistance,p38 MAPK signaling pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17528"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dong-Fang Meng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Genomically stable gastric cancer (GSGC), featuring the worst prognosis of four subtypes of GC based on its molecular characteristics, receives limited benefits from recently approved HER2-targeted antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) due to the lack and heterogeneity of tumoral HER2 expression. Currently, radionuclide drug conjugates (RDCs) have attracted great attention in targeted therapy, owing to its unique advantages of radiation-associated direct DNA damages and relatively long radiation distances. These unique advantages enable RDCs to efficiently and broadly ablate both cancer cells and cancer-associated stromal cells in heterogeneous tumor microenvironment without being internalized by target cells, featuring a novel and more efficient &#8220;bystander killing&#8221; effect than linker-cleavable ADCs. Here, a RDC was developed by rationally screening GSGC-targeting antibodies and radionuclides for targeted treatment of GSGCs. Meanwhile, the &#8220;bystander killing&#8221; effect of the RDC will be quantitatively determined and compared with conventional linker-cleavable ADCs.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>First, ICAM1 was identified as a more preferable molecular target relatively to HER2 in human GSGCs via flow cytometric analyses. Next, a RDC was constructed by covalently conjugating anti-ICAM1 antibody with radionuclide <sup>131<\/sup>I via indogen chemistry. <sup>131<\/sup>I, the RDC warhead emitting &#946;-particles with an emission range of<b> <\/b>approximately 0.8 mm, is a clinically-used radionuclide with FDA approval for treating several tumors. Then, the half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50s<\/sub>) of constructed <sup>131<\/sup>I conjugated ICAM1 antibody (<sup>131<\/sup>I-ICAM1) was evaluated in human GSGC cell lines. Its inherent bystander killing effect was validated by measuring the viability of ICAM1 negative cells co-incubated with ICAM1 positive cells in the treatment of <sup>131<\/sup>I-ICAM1, in comparison with ADC of the same target. Ultimately, the anti-tumor efficacy of <sup>131<\/sup>I-ICAM1 was verified in heterogeneous GSGC models. Simultaneously, the histopathological damages to normal organs by <sup>131<\/sup>I-ICAM1 was minimized by optimizing its dose.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>In this study, we constructed a rationally designed <sup>131<\/sup>I-ICAM1 by conjugating ICAM-1 antibody and clinical available radionuclide <sup>131<\/sup>I and investigated the intrinsic bystander killing effect of this RDC in ablating heterogeneous GSGCs.

It exerts potent anticancer effects by inhibiting hexokinase II enzyme of glycolysis pathway and ATP generation in cancer cells. In present investigation we have examined the effect of 3-BromoPyruvate employing panc-2 cancer cells, and syngeneic pancreatic cancer mouse model. The clonogenic survival assay demonstrated dose dependent inhibition of cell growth, and we observed 95 % cell death at 15 uM conc. Further, ATP production was severely inhibited in cancer cells treated with same concentration of 3-BP. We also observed that 3-BP in combination with low doses of irradiation was more effective in killing cancer cells than 3-BP alone. Electron microscopy revealed that 3-BromoPyruvate severely damaged mitochondrial integrity which might have severely affected ATP generation in cancer cells. We further tested 3-BromoPyruvate (2.5-10.0 mg\/kg) in syngeneic panc-2 tumor mouse model and observed that 3-BP at10.0 mg\/kg dose significantly reduced tumor growth (volume) about 35-40%. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) data showed that 3-BP inhibits hexokinase II (HK2) and TGFbeta1 and enhanced active caspase-3 expression in tumor tissues as compared to untreated control. The disruption of the interaction between VDAC1 and HK2 due to 3BP treatment was confirmed by CO-IP. Interestingly, 3 BP at higher dose induces caspase-3 activation in tumor derived organoid without showing any effect on normal pancreatic organoid. Altogether, the results in this study demonstrated that 3 BP could be a promising anti-tumor drug against pancreatic cancer and its efficacy could be improved in combination with radiation therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c82e498d-2e9d-45ee-9f7f-6cc17aa3ac92\/@q03B8ZQu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Drug discovery,Radiosensitization,Tumor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17530"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanjit K.

Because half of all cancer patients will receive radiation therapy (RT), there is a need to understand the etiology of radiation-induced sarcomas, as these cancers are thought to exhibit worse outcomes than their sporadic counterparts.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective single-center analysis of sarcoma patients treated from 2013-2019 was conducted. Univariate and survival analyses were used to distinguish the characteristics of RAS and sporadic sarcoma (SS), and further assess differences in disease presentation, cancer treatment, and survival between the two groups.<br \/>Results: The incidence of RAS during the study period was 6%. Breast (25%), prostate (25%) and colorectal (15%) cancers were the most common primary tumors associated with RAS development. There was substantial variation in the characteristics of the two groups, with noted differences in the histologic compositions, clinical stage at presentation, and overall survival (Table 1). The most frequent RAS histologies were angiosarcoma (30%), leiomyosarcoma (25%) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (20%), while the most frequent SS subtypes were liposarcoma (15.5%), carcinosarcoma (13.5%) and leiomyosarcoma (11.9%). No patients with RAS had a known genetic cancer predisposition. A higher percentage of RAS patients presented at later clinical stages, as 75% of all RAS cases versus 41.9% of all SS cases were diagnosed at stage III\/IV (p=0.004). RAS also exhibited overall worse outcomes, as the 5-year survival was significantly decreased compared to SS (32.6 vs 60.3%, p=0.027).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study identifies marked differences in the disease characteristics and clinical outcomes of RAS and SS. Further research into cancer predisposition, biomarkers of risk, and molecular pathways of disease is essential to provide individualized care to patients with RAS.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{63FF725F-2727-408F-98A1-9FF3117A27AF}\"><caption>Table 1: Summary of Sporadic Sarcoma and Radiation-Associated Sarcoma Characteristics<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Sporadic Sarcoma<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Radiation-Associated Sarcoma<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>P-Value<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Count<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">310<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median Age at Diagnosis (Years)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">58.51 (0.02-87.74)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">68.81 (48.09-84.19)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.003<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Location<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Trunk 109 (35.2%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Trunk 10 (50.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Lower Extremity 97 (31.3%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Lower Extremity 2 (10.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Head\/Neck 36 ( 11.6%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Retroperitoneal 4 (20.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other 68 (21.9%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other 4 (20.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Histologic Subtype<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Liposarcoma 48 (15.5%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Angiosarcoma 6 (30.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Carcinosarcoma 42 (13.5%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Leiomyosarcoma 5 (25.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Leiomyosarcoma 37 (11.9%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">UPS 4 (20.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Chondrosarcoma 36 (11.6%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Liposarcoma 3 (15.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other 147 (47.4%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other 2 (10%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Clinical Stage<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">I &amp;

The pathophysiology of MPE formation in advanced breast cancer remains poorly understood, and their composition and biology are understudied. To characterise the phenotypic diversity of malignant pleural effusion, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 10 MPEs from 7 metastatic breast cancer patients with diverse molecular subtypes: two triple negative (TNBC) patients, three luminal B patients including one with a rare inflammatory subtype, and two luminal A patients. For all patients, we sequenced cells from the entire MPE, without performing any enrichment or selection, in order to ascertain the cellular composition and molecular phenotypes in an unbiased manner. We identified pronounced differences in the relative proportions of malignant, mesothelial and immune cell populations: both TNBC and two Luminal B patients had extensive malignant cell populations, while the other three patients had few or no detectible malignant cells but extensive immune populations. We also observed heterogeneity in the expression of subtype-specific gene signatures and in copy number aberration patterns that captured variability across malignant cell populations both within and between patients. We observed that most malignant cells retained the molecular subtype diagnosed in the primary tumour, however sub-populations of malignant cells could be identified that mapped to different molecular subtypes, indicative of complexity in the molecular phenotypes of cancer cells disseminated to or metastasising in the pleural cavity. We distinguished mesothelial cell populations from malignant cells using key markers, expression of the PAM50 signatures, and copy number aberration patterns. We found that pleural mesothelial cells expressed a cancer associated fibroblast-like transcriptomic program that may support cancer growth within the pleural cavity through the secretion of growth factors that target malignant cells. Our dataset presents the first unbiased and unselected assessment of breast cancer associated MPEs at single cell resolution, providing the community with a vital resource for the study of MPEs. Our work highlights the molecular and cellular diversity captured in MPEs and advances the use of these clinically relevant biopsies both in monitoring disease progression and in the development of targeted therapeutics for patients with advanced breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/75058e4e-19ae-408c-9686-3bde26bfd629\/@r03B8ZQv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Malignant progression,Microenvironment,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19946"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Holly J.

With osimertinib, DFS and OS curves were convex on log-linear plots, suggesting rapid tumor regrowth once therapy is discontinued. In chemo trials, 10 of 10 DFS curves and 9 of 10 OS curves fit 2-phase decay EDNLRA models (Table 1). Popkin calculations indicate that of control patients destined to recur, 12% would recur by 2 months after surgery, 22% by 4 months and 31% by 6 months.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> PopKin suggests osimertinib delays recurrence rather than preventing it. Combined chemo analyses suggest chemo converts 15% of patients from rapidly to slowly recurring, but many &#8220;shifted&#8221; patients eventually recur. Hence, chemo may induce reversible tumor senescence rather than eradicating micrometastases. Anti-senescent cell strategies might prove beneficial.

At diagnosis, approximately 20-25% of patients with EwS have metastatic disease. While systemic chemotherapy, along with surgery and\/or radiotherapy, has significantly increased the survival rate of patients with localized disease, metastatic Ewing sarcoma (EwS) has an extremely poor overall survival with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 20-30%. This prognosis has not changed in the last several decades. Thus, there is an <i><u>imperative need to focus particularly on mechanisms of metastatic growth and progression and to identify and target the underlying intrinsic and extrinsic molecular features<\/u><\/i>. Unfortunately, presently there is no reliable engineered mouse model to functionally study EwS development and metastasis. Using two independent EwS cell lines, we have developed highly aggressive, lung-specific metastatic models that show mechanistic overlap with human patient tumor data and are valuable resources to further study and target metastatic EwS.<br \/>Approach: Using a serial transplantation approach, we generated lung specific metastatic lines by repeated intra-tibial injection of two commonly used EwS cell lines (A673 and TC71), allowing metastatic foci to form, followed by dissociation and subsequent re-injection into the tibia. We repeated this 5 times to generate highly aggressive lung-specific metastatic cell lines. As a proof of principle, when equal numbers of GFP+ parental cells and mCherry+ lung metastatic cells are injected into the tibia in NSG mice they form primary tumors with red and green cells, while the metastatic lesions in lungs are almost exclusively mCherry+. A multi-omics approach including glycoproteomics, secretome, and transcriptomic analysis were then used to characterize these cells and compare them with patient tumor samples.<br \/>Results: Integration of focused proteomics and glycoproteomics data revealed upregulation in AXL, MEK6, STAT1, and STAT3 proteins and phosphoproteins in metastatic lesions. Focused RNA profiling with Nanostring technologies using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides of patient tumor samples revealed increased expression of several other upstream genes that signal through STAT1, including IL-6, IKK-&#946;, TRAF-6, and Myd88. In addition, upregulation in factors involved in tumor invasive front such as Furin, TIMP-2, MMP-2, and MMP-14 were also noted. We are currently in the process of further validating some of the key regulators using larger set of patient derived tumors and by targeting them in orthotopic mouse models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0eb6633-89ba-4241-bb2e-53a0030d04bd\/@r03B8ZQv\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor,Metastasis,Pediatric cancers,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21351"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Atreyi Dasgupta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lyazat Kurenbekova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tajhal Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason T.
