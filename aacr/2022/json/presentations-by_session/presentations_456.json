[{"Abstract":"Background: Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is the second most common vascular sarcoma and contains a <i>TAZ-CAMTA1<\/i> gene fusion (TC) in &#62;90% of cases, and concurrent work demonstrates that endothelial expression of this oncogene at physiologic levels is sufficient to induce EHE tumorigenesis in mice. A major impediment to EHE research is the lack of EHE cell lines, and to date efforts to establish primary cultures of EHE cells have been unsuccessful. As 57% of human EHEs contain secondary genetic alterations, most commonly <i>CDKN2A <\/i>variants, that are associated with later stage disease, we hypothesized that these alterations mechanistically enhance EHE tumorigenesis. We further hypothesized that loss of <i>CDKN2A<\/i> in EHE cells will allow for tumor cell outgrowth in vitro and generation of the first EHE cell lines.<br \/>Methods: Mice bearing our previously generated TC allele, whereby the endogenous <i>Taz<\/i> allele can be conditionally replaced with a TC transgene under the action of Cre, were paired with a conditional <i>Cdkn2a <\/i>knockout allele and an endothelial specific Cre (<i>Cdh5-<\/i>CreERT2). Histological characterization and single cell RNA sequencing of the resultant tumors was performed. Tumors were dissociated and the resultant tumor cells were grown ex vivo as cell lines. We characterized the cell lines using genomic, immunocytochemistry and RNA Seq methodologies. Expanded cells were then reimplanted into NSG mice.<br \/>Results: When compared to <i>Cdkn2a<\/i> WT murine EHE tumors, tumors containing a mono- or bi-allelic deletion of <i>Cdkn2a <\/i>have a greater proliferative rate as displayed by greater cellularity, and increased number of Ki67+ cells. While CDKN2a variant tumors displayed enhanced proliferative capacity, they maintained the characteristic EHE histologic phenotype and transcriptional profile. Tumor cells were successfully grown ex vivo and the resultant cell lines maintained an endothelial morphology in vitro, expressed the TC oncoprotein, and had a transcriptional profile characteristic of both murine and human EHE. These cell lines were successfully cultured to greater than 40 passages. Finally, in mouse models, these cell lines generate local tumors when injected subcutaneously, metastatic lung tumors when injected intravenously, and induce peritoneal sarcomatosis when injected intraperitoneally in an orthotopic model. In each of these sites, the ensuing tumors maintained the EHE histologic phenotype.<br \/>Conclusions: We were able to demonstrate that <i>CDKN2A<\/i> loss enhances the tumorigenicity of EHE in vivo. Further, we were able to generate the first cell lines of this disease which replicate several facets of the human disease and therefore serve as a robust model system for therapeutic testing of compounds, which if successful can be used to treat EHE or other TAZ-dependent cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13221cac-10af-4aa7-90ab-3666f1d26aa3\/@u03B8ZM9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Hippo pathway,Endothelial cells,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14292"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caleb Nathaniel Seavey<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuang Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Hallett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajaybabu V.

Lack of a basic understanding of OS etiology, and lack of a sensitive method to detect pulmonary micro-metastases are major obstacles impeding meaningful therapeutic advancement. Here we report the generation of genetically engineered lineage-tracing mouse OS models, in which p53 expressions were conditionally deleted or mutated in chondrocytes, indicating that OS can originate from chondrocyte-derived osteoblastic-lineage cells. OS incidence peaks during puberty when rapid bone growth occurs. Longitudinal bone growth is achieved through endochondral ossification, a process sustained by growth plates - cartilage discs at the ends of long bones. As bone lengthening, growth plate chondrocytes go through proliferation, differentiation, and maturation in sequential steps to provide a continuous supply of cartilage scaffolds for ossification. Besides, mature chondrocytes residing at chondral-osteo junctions, are themselves an innate source of osteoblasts directly participating in bone formation. Not only there is a close link between OS incidence and growth plate activity, primary OS is most frequently localized at the growing ends of long bones, such as at proximal tibia, distal femurs, and proximal humerus. Given these associations, we hypothesize that mice harboring p53 deletion initiated in mature chondrocytes may develop osteosarcoma, and if so chondrocytes to osteoblasts transformation may be a vulnerable process to genome instability triggers. We generated various chondrocyte-Cre driven lineage-tracing reporter mouse models, in which either Col10a1-Cre or Acn-CreERT2 were Cre drivers to induce p53 deleted, R245W hot spot, and p53 deleted\/Rbhet alleles. To date Col10a1-Cre\/p53fxfx\/Rosa-tomato (Xp53KO) mice developed osteosarcoma with 100% penetrance (n=32). The mean latency in days is 273.3 &#177; 60.5 (195-330), in a similar range of Osx-cre\/p53fxfx mice by CR Walkley, etc. The OS from Xp53KO mice histologically resemble human OS and possessed osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacities <i>in vitro<\/i>. Most notably, the Xp53KO mice developed OS in long bones and spines, no cranium-facial OS was detected. Regarding OS distributions, our Xp53KO OS mice show the closest resemblance to that of humans, compared to previous genetically engineered mouse OS models. Additionally, the transplanted OS from Xp53KO mice showed good response to cyclophosphamide treatment (n=7, 15mg\/kg), but not to topotecan (n=7, 0.6mg\/kg), vincristine (n=7, 1mg\/kg) and rapamycin (n=7, 5mg\/kg) treatments, analogous to human OS. With reporter (tomato) expressions, we can trace and isolate the OS ancestry cells from the onsets of deletions to osteosarcoma genesis at any stages, as well as mutant cells in distant sites. Our OS models may unveil critical insights into the development of OS as well as its dissemination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/87af9209-30d1-4a6c-aea3-2170a2fb4a06\/@u03B8ZM9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Osteosarcoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14293"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xin Zhou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaohui Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yizheng Tu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhongting Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Gorlick<\/i><\/presenter>.

Infiltrating immune cells, including macrophages, have been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis, and efforts have aimed at the tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic strategy. Although tumor-promoting roles of macrophages are well-established, the specific macrophage factors and transcription factor-mediated regulatory programs that drive breast cancer progression are less understood. Using a p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> syngeneic model of premalignant progression to invasive cancer, we identified distinct subpopulations of macrophages that resemble both normal tissue resident macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages. Interestingly, most of these macrophage subsets highly express C\/EBP&#946;, suggesting a global function of C\/EBP&#946; in macrophages. C\/EBP&#946; is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and is important for monocyte differentiation and myeloid-derived suppressor cell function. To address the function of macrophage C\/EBP&#946; during tumorigenesis, <i>Cebpb<\/i>-floxed mice were bred to <i>iCsf1r-Cre<\/i> mice to generate mice (<i>Cebpb<\/i><i><sup>&#916;M<\/sup><\/i>)<sup> <\/sup>where <i>Cebpb<\/i> is selectively deleted in macrophages (CSF1R-expressing myeloid cells). Genetic ablation of macrophage C\/EBP&#946; in premalignant lesions results in a significant decrease in progression to invasive cancer. In established claudin-low tumors, deletion of macrophage C\/EBP&#946; results in decreased tumor latency and the re-expression of cytokeratin 8+E-cadherin+ cells, reminiscent of luminal-like tumors. This phenoytpe was recapitulated in an ex vivo 3D co-culture model, where uniformly round structures that lack mesenchymal projections form in the presence of <i>Cebpb<\/i><i><sup>&#916;M <\/sup><\/i>BMDMs. These data suggest that macrophage C\/EBP&#946; may help maintain a mesenchymal phenotype in claudin-low tumors. Ongoing studies are aimed at identifying the <i>Cebpb<\/i>-induced gene networks in macrophages that mediate tumor progression. These studies will have critical implications for whether inhibition of C\/EBP&#946;-regulated genes may revert claudin-low tumors to a luminal-like phenotype, rendering tumors responsive to current therapies.

The disease progression has been defined by substages (adenocarcinoma to castration resistant PCa to neuroendocrine PCa) both from mouse models and patients from clinical studies. The mechanism of the disease advancement and hence treatment modalities is still under investigation. Hippo pathway, the evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway, known to regulate organ size, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, stemness etc., is also implicated in PCa tumorigenesis. Transcriptional co-activator YAP1 which acts downstream of the canonical hippo kinases is known to interact with plethora of proteins. But how non-canonical hippo kinases can regulate YAP1 in this disease is yet to be unraveled. We find that NIMA-related kinase isoform 1, Nek1, interacts with YAP1 and phosphorylates Tyr-407 of YAP1. The significance of this post-translational modification is the focus of the study. We find that Nek1 phosphorylates YAP1 to stabilize YAP1 and promote tumorigenesis.<br \/><b>Material and Methods:<\/b> Human YAP1 cDNA encoding plasmid mutated at Tyr 407 to Phenylalanine using site-directed mutagenesis. YAP1-Y407F and WT expressed in HEK293A cells. For genetic analysis in mouse model, female TRAMP mice were bred with Nek1<sup> -\/+<\/sup> male mouse (Jackson laboratory). Genotypic analysis confirmed Nek1<sup>-\/+ <\/sup>TRAMP and Nek1<sup>+\/+<\/sup>TRAMP which were used for this study. After 16weeks of age the male mice were castrated and sacrificed at 20weeks of age. Prostate tissues collected and histological sections done (paraffin embedded). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was done using vector labs IHC kits, data analyzed and scored by our pathologist.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Immunoblots from YAP1-Y407F and WT cells treated with Cycloheximide (50ug\/ml) at different time points (0.5-6hrs) show that YAP1-Y407F is less stable than WT with t<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>of 0.5hrs whereas WT is stable till 2hrs. Very importantly, while intact TRAMP\/Nek1+\/- mice do develop PCa normally with much enlargement of the prostate at 18-20 weeks, if these mice are castrated, the tumors fail to grow and the prostate retains normal size and general morphology. Our IHC data confirms that firstly, castrated Nek1<sup>+\/+<\/sup>TRAMP shows clearly cancerous acini whereas the Nek<sup>-\/+ <\/sup>TRAMP shows mostly stromal fibrosis and hyperplasia (as shown in H&#38;E and IHC). Secondly, when stained for activated Nek1 marker, pNek1 (T141), we find that Nek1 stain intensity is low in Nek1<sup>-\/+<\/sup> tissues compared to Nek1<sup>+\/+<\/sup>. Most importantly, YAP1 level is lower in the same parallel tissue sections of Nek1<sup>-\/+<\/sup>. From the above analysis, we conclude that Nek1 activity regulates stability of YAP1, and infer that YAP1 function is critical for the timely progression to adenocarcinoma following androgen deprivation therapy.<br \/><b>Acknowledgements: <\/b>Funding Resources: Department of Defense (DoD-PCRP grant W81XWH-17-1-0417) ; FWCC Bridge Award.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1cb7b791-edc5-42fd-a89d-b6d34b5760e7\/@u03B8ZM9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate tumor,Hippo pathway,NEK1 Kinases,YAP1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14299"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ishita Ghosh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zobair Alam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Md.

In the TCGA-LUAD dataset, LKB1 was found to be more frequently mutated in males than in females even after correcting for potential confounders (male versus female: 22.8% versus 11.3%, p &#38;lt; 6.9x 10<sup>-4<\/sup>, FDR = 0.033). Similar trends can be found in all other large LUAD datasets. However, the mechanistic basis of this bias is unknown because the existing mouse models of lung cancers either did not exhibit sex bias or showed female mice being more susceptible to the development of lung cancers. Here, we demonstrate that our lentivirus-inducing Kras\/LKB1-mutant genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) and tail-vein injection syngeneic model exhibit sex bias against the tumor formation in the female host. In our KRAS<sup>LSL-G12D<\/sup>\/LKB1<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>\/Rosa-Luc GEMM mice, the lung tumor formation was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and validated by immunohistochemistry of tumor bearing-lung. The sex bias of time to lung adenocarcinoma formation in males and females was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. 97% (31\/32) male GEMM developed LUAD after the induction, whereas only 58% (15\/26) female GEMM developed LUAD (p=0.0001, log-rank). The tail-vein injection method used the WRJ388-AD1 cell line, which was derived from WRJ388. Tumor growth in the chest area was monitored by BLI and evaluated by the mixed-effects model. Sex bias preference for developing lung tumors in the male host reached significance on day 14 post-injection (p=0.0037) and lasted during the study (day 21, p=0.0021). On day 21, with the cutoff as 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> p\/sec\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>\/sr in lung region, 100% male GEMM formed lung tumor while only 36% female GEMM formed lung tumor after the injection. Collectively, this KRAS\/LKB1-mutant lung adenocarcinoma exhibits sex-biased tumor formation and growth, which are consistent with clinical data among LUAD patients. This model will provide researchers with opportunities to understand the mechanistic basis of this sex bias and to develop novel personalized therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b8ce2f9d-8657-41bc-9e34-260896ff4ab1\/@u03B8ZM9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Sex bias,LKB1-mutant,mouse model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14300"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yijian Fan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiuju Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunzi Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mellissa Gilbert-Ross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Marcus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>.

The lack of effective therapeutic strategies for PDAC necessitates the development of models to better understand the disease. Transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF&#946;)-SMAD4 signaling plays a critical role in PDAC development with more than half of all patients either have mutated SMAD4 (loss of function) or altered type II TGF TGF&#946; -receptor (Tgfbr2) gene. Here we present a murine model of PDAC with Tamoxifen induced conditional deletion of the TGF&#946;-receptor 2 (Tgfbr2) gene and expression of an activating Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutation in pancreatic acinar cells. <i>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>; Tgfbrii<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>; Ptf1a-CreER<\/i> mice were generated by crossing Ptf1a<sup>Cre-ERTM <\/sup>mice with LSL-Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> mice in which expression of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> is restrained by a lox-stop-lox cassette until Cre activation by tamoxifen injection.

This model showed a latency of approximately 16-20 weeks following 5 <i>i.p.<\/i> injections of tamoxifen (~75 mg\/kg in corn oil). Follow-up on the survival of the mice post tamoxifen injections showed the median survival of 252 days in male and 234 days in female mice. Histological evaluation showed multifocal nodules of neoplasia composed of tubules and acini with cuboidal to polygonal cells. Carcinoma cells were positive for cytokeratin 19 and for mucins identified by Alcian blue staining, both confirming the ductal phenotype of these tumors. Picrosirius red staining demonstrated dense stromal desmoplasia which recapitulates human disease. Flow cytometric evolution of the immune microenvironment was also done to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells. Additional characterization of our novel mouse model of pancreatic cancer is underway to understand PDAC progression and develop effective therapeutic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f5033caf-5c7a-492c-baea-1c625ec231dc\/@u03B8ZM9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,KRAS,TGF-&#946;,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14302"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanjay Pandey<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brett Bell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia G.

While ccRCC genesis has been associated with several signaling and metabolic pathways, the exact process by which <i>VHL<\/i> inactivation becomes tumorigenic remains unknown. We surmised that observing the behaviour and gene expression profiles of <i>Vhl<\/i>-inactivated cells <i>in vivo<\/i> with spatiotemporal resolution would help define cell types and conditions in which this genetic lesion is on balance tumorigenic. Here we report a novel lineage marking model of <i>in vivo<\/i> <i>Vhl<\/i> inactivation and describe the immediate consequences of <i>Vhl<\/i> loss in different nephron segments at cellular resolution. Studying <i>Vhl<\/i> inactivation with single-cell resolution requires a system in which <i>Vhl<\/i>-inactivated cells can be accurately identified. We developed a mouse model in which <i>Vhl<\/i> recombination is structurally linked to the expression of a tdTomato reporter cassette. This allows recombined cells to be visualised and isolated based on tdTomato expression. We coupled this model with the renal tubular epithelium (RTE) restricted <i>Pax8-CreERT2<\/i> to induce biallelic (KO\/KO) or monoallelic (wt\/KO) inactivation of <i>Vhl<\/i> and observed the immediate fates of affected cells. <i>Vhl<\/i> is thought to be haplosufficient; thus, the wt\/KO mice act as lineage-marked <i>Vhl-<\/i>competent controls to lineage-marked <i>Vhl<\/i>-null cells. We first observed the behavior of <i>Vhl<\/i> KO cells in the RTE over time. <i>Vhl <\/i>was inactivated by a controlled dose of tamoxifen that induced recombination in a subset of cells across the nephron.<i> <\/i>Three weeks after recombination, <i>Vhl <\/i>KO cells were morphologically normal but had stabilized HIF-2, confirming a reported &#8216;HIF-isoform&#8217; switch. There were equal numbers of tdTomato-positive cells in the KO\/KO and wt\/KO kidneys, suggesting that initial recombination is equal between the genotypes and that there is no immediate distortion in cell fates following <i>Vhl <\/i>KO. However, four months after recombination, there were fewer tdTomato-positive cells in the KO\/KO kidneys, suggesting a gradual removal or loss of <i>Vhl<\/i> KO from tissue. This was most prominent in the renal papilla and cortex. Additionally, some <i>Vhl<\/i> KO cells presented with morphological signs of cellular stress and altered differentiation. Taken together, we believe <i>Vhl<\/i> KO cells are subjected to profound selection in the nephron and that cell-type-specific, negative, and heterogenous consequences of <i>Vhl <\/i>KO impact on cell survival. One corollary is that many cells which ultimately survive in <i>Vhl <\/i>KO organs are in fact <i>Vhl-<\/i>competent. By intrinsically coupling <i>Vhl<\/i>-inactivation and lineage marking, our model allows these populations to be distinguished and followed over time. We are now studying the differential gene expression patterns of <i>Vhl<\/i> KO cells in cells of the RTE and aim to define genetic signatures for contexts in which <i>Vhl<\/i> KO cells survive and contribute to ccRCC genesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f616698e-78f8-416b-b67d-3d8f7d2913e1\/@u03B8ZM9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Lineage-tracing ,tumorigenesis,VHL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14305"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joanna D C C.

CRC typically arises from mutations that inactivate the tumor suppressor APC, which activates the WNT\/CTNNB1 pathway to drive cell transformation and tumor growth. Identifying factors that reduce incidence of CRC is of high interest. Intriguingly, a large population study has found a decreased incidence of CRC in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), an inherited disease affecting approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals. ADPKD typically arises from germline mutations in the <i>PKD1<\/i> gene, which encodes a transmembrane signaling protein that is ubiquitously expressed. Puzzlingly, activated WNT\/CTNNB1 signaling is also found in ADPKD, which would be expected to enhance rather than reduce likelihood of CRC.<br \/>To investigate the role of PKD1 in modulating CRC tumorigenesis, we established a mouse model with tamoxifen-inducible loss of <i>Apc<\/i> with or without parallel loss of <i>Pkd1<\/i> in the colon.<i> Pkd1<\/i> loss vey significantly reduced tumor incidence (~80%) and rate of growth. In addition, growth of <i>Pkd1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>;Apc<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>organoids was reduced relative to <i>Apc<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i><sup><\/sup>organoids, indicating a cancer cell-intrinsic activity. Analysis of signaling pathway activation by RNA-seq indicated that <i>Pkd1<\/i>-deficient CRC organoids had enhanced WNT\/CTNNB1 signaling, excluding reduced activation of this core driver pathway as a mechanism of action.<br \/>Considering alternative mechanisms, a prominent feature of ADPKD is reprogramming barrier function in renal cells to reduce permeability, supporting cyst development; notably, compromised integrity of the epithelial barrier is associated with CRC. We tested the hypothesis that loss of Pkd1 increased colon barrier integrity. As a first approach, we compared susceptibility of wt versus <i>Pkd1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice to dextran-sodium sulfate (DSS), which induces colitis by damaging epithelial barriers. Histopathological assessment confirmed significantly less DSS-induced damage of colon tissue in <i>Pkd1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice. Further, treatment of DSS-treated mice with orally gavaged FITC-dextran led to elevated FITC-dextran in the serum of wt versus <i>Pkd1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice, indicating greater passage through a functionally impaired barrier. In ADPKD, decreased barrier permeability is mediated by upregulation of specific claudins (CLDN4, 7); in CRC, these claudins are typically reduced during and promote tumor formation. We detected strong elevation of CLDN4 and CLDN7 in the colonic epithelium of <i>Pkd1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>versus wt mice, with the expressed proteins having consistently greater localization to cell junctions. Based on these and other data, we identify PKD1 control of barrier function as an important regulatory mechanism in CRC tumorigenesis, which may suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on targeting PKD1-associated effector pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/558e9e1b-1bd8-4c24-b408-47215da9ba65\/@v03B8ZMa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"APC,Carcinoma: adenocarcinoma,Tight junctions,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14306"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Anna S.

Although powerful, this approach is not widely applicable due to the limited availability of clinical materials and throughput thus limiting the number and type of hypotheses that can be rigorously tested. However, a genotype-therapy sensitivity relationship could be measured in isogenic systems using reverse genetics, whereby mutations in relevant genes are introduced followed by evaluation of a phenotype in wild-type and mutant contexts. Since no such pre-clinical system exists for bladder cancer, we developed an immunocompetent mouse model to induce customizable isogenic tumor formation in bladder urothelium using CRISPR.<br \/>Methods: Bladder urothelium was harvested from transgenic mice harboring LSL-Cas9\/GFP in Rosa26 locus (as described by Platt et al) and grown as organoids. These organoids had a basal phenotype. AAV harboring Cre and sgRNA(s) were used to induce Cas9 and engineer mutations. Based on their frequent somatic alteration pathway in TCGA-BLCA, <i>Tp53<\/i> and <i>Rb1<\/i> were chosen for knockout first to establish &#8216;base organoids&#8217;. Additional genes related to PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway were edited in base organoids to develop a series of organoids with different genotypes predicted to activate this signaling pathway. Sanger sequencing and western blot were used to confirm knockout. Kinase inhibitors targeting the mTOR pathway at different levels were assessed in organoids with different genotypes. The edited urothelial cells were grafted in mouse bladder to develop isogenic tumor to assess <i>in vivo<\/i> therapeutic vulnerability of <i>in-vitro<\/i>-prioritized kinase inhibitors matching the genotype of the allografted tumor.<br \/>Results: <i>Rb1<\/i>, <i>Tp53<\/i>, and <i>Pten<\/i> were successfully knocked out in urothelial organoids. When treated with Ipataseritib, an AKT inhibitor, the triple knockout organoid was found to be 9X more sensitive than <i>Trp53\/Rb1<\/i> knockout organoids.

The 5-year survival rate of esophageal cancer is 10 ~ 25%. Esophageal cancer is mainly divided into esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma. ESCC accounts for 80% of all esophageal cancer cases and shows a poor prognosis due to a lack of symptoms at early stages. Given that early diagnosis of ESCC may lead to better outcomes, understanding the biology of ESCC initiation is imperative. To recapitulate the early events of ESCC, we employed the murine esophageal organoid (EO) system recently developed. Based on in silico analyses, we selected nine candidate genes (<i>TP53<\/i>, <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, <i>NOTCH1<\/i>, <i>NOTCH3<\/i>, <i>KMT2D<\/i>, <i>KMT2C<\/i>, <i>FAT1<\/i>, <i>FAT4<\/i>, and <i>AJUBA<\/i>) frequently mutated in ESCC patients. The EOs were then genetically manipulated with the combinatorial ablation of nine genes by CRISPR\/Cas9 system. The EOs carrying PN (<i>Trp53<\/i> and <i>Notch1<\/i> KO), PC (<i>Trp53 <\/i>and <i>Cdkn2a <\/i>KO), and PCN (<i>Trp53<\/i>, <i>Cdkn2a<\/i>, and <i>Notch1 <\/i>KO) showed hyperplastic and neoplastic properties with impaired squamous cell differentiation and organoid integrity, compared to the wild-type (WT) EOs. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analyses of WT, PC, PN, and PCN organoids showed the highest enrichment of ESCC cancer stem cell markers in PCN organoids. Unlike the cell lineage in WT EOs, neoplastic EOs (PC, PN, and PCN) exhibited distinct cell lineage along with multiple root cell clusters. While WT EOs failed to become neoplastic, PN, PC, and PCN EOs displayed the transforming activity <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft transplantation assays. Intriguingly, in allograft mouse models, while PN organoids-derived cells barely developed tumors, PC and PCN organoids-derived cells developed tumors with marked downregulation of genes related to antigen processing and presentation. These results suggest that combinatorial loss of P53, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1 play a pivotal role in ESCC neoplasia, stemness, and immune checkpoint, unveiling the biology of ESCC initiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d1466c50-70cd-4d53-9712-af0381c01f0e\/@v03B8ZMa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Organoid,CRISPR\/Cas9,Single cell RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14309"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyung Pil Ko<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gengyi Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuanjian Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bongjun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sohee Jun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae-Il Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

A common factor observed between such individuals and those with the disease is the presence of increased inflammation and cytokine signature. A key mediator of inflammation and cytokine-induced necroptosis and metabolic signaling is the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (<i>Ripk3<\/i>). Ripk3 plays important tumor-promoting and suppressive roles in multiple cancers. Compared to bone marrow (BM) cells isolated from wild-type mice, higher levels of Ripk3 activity can be detected in <i>Tet2<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> BM cells. Based on the evidence that <i>Tet2<\/i> mutations alone are insufficient and are known to cooperate with other mutations for full-blown malignant transformation, we hypothesize that loss of Ripk3 signaling might promote the transformation of <i>Tet2<\/i> mutant HSPCs To test our hypothesis we crossed <i>Tet2<\/i> conditional knockout (<i>Tet2<\/i><sup>fx\/fx<\/sup> Mx1-Cre<sup>+<\/sup>) mice with <i>Ripk3<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice to generate <i>Tet2<\/i> and<i><sup> <\/sup>Ripk3<\/i> compound knockout (<i>Tet2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>Ripk3<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>) mice. We performed in vitro colony assays and in vivo engraftment and reconstitution assays on Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) derived from <i>Tet2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>Ripk3<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> and <i>Tet2<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>mice. Our results indicate that TNF-&#945; stimulation confers a significant hematopoietic advantage to <i>Tet2<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> HSPCs which is abolished upon loss of Ripk3. Moreover, while <i>Tet2<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> BM-MNC has significantly higher reconstitution ability in vivo, the additional loss of Ripk3 led to reduced engraftment and reconstitution that was comparable to WT BM-MNC. Given that TNF-&#945; stimulation promotes Ripk3 activation, our results indicate that the TNF-RIPK3 signaling axis is essential in conferring enhanced hematopoietic fitness of <i>Tet2<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>HSPCs.<i>Tet2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>Ripk3<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>mice developed aggressive tumors by 12-15 months of age as characterized by profound hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, with substantial lymphocytosis, neutrophilia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. There was extensive infiltration of tumor cells in the liver and spleen in diseased <i>Tet2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>Ripk3<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. There was a marked expansion of both CD4<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup>CXCR5<sup>+<\/sup> follicular T helper cells (T<sub>fh<\/sub>) and CD4<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> peripheral T helper cells (T<sub>ph<\/sub>), indicating the development of a T cell lymphoma in the <i>Tet2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>Ripk3<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice. Additionally, disease characteristics including the reduced surface expression of CD3 in the tumor cells, increased levels of classical T<sub>h<\/sub> cytokines in the serum, as well as the presence of heterogeneous populations of cells within the tumor tissues recapitulate the pathological features of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL). We are currently investigating Ripk3 signaling in the tumor cells of AITL patients and whether we can treat such aggressive fatal diseases by reactivating Ripk3 signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/984fe7ac-fbce-4ef2-9a1a-d36a032a71c4\/@v03B8ZMa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T lymphocytes,Tumor suppressor gene,Serine\/threonine kinase,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14482"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kanak Joshi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuchi Zinzuwadia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Mack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanhui Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Sellin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Breslin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ameet R.
