[{"Abstract":"Genomic alternations especially copy number aberrations (CNAs) are particularly imperative for diagnostic classification and risk stratification in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) has been mandatory in clinical routine to detect recurrent genomic abnormalities in AML\/MDS, it presents a few obvious shortcomings, such as time-consuming in vitro cell-culturing procedure, low resolution (no smaller than 10 Mbp), and subjective bias introduced from the visual interpretation by cytogeneticists. With the technological advances of next generation sequencing (NGS), the current CCA test and the molecular tests are likely to be challenged by whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which is a more unbiased method to detect all types of genomic aberrations not only those well-characterized clinically actionable mutations but also cryptic alternations yet to be defined and annotated. In this study a shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) based assay, LeukoPrint, was utilized to depict genomic CNA profiles from the bone marrow cells of 107 newly diagnosed patients with AML (n=63, 58.9%) or MDS (n=44, 41.1%). Bone marrow was collected and mononuclear cells were separated to harvest genomic DNA which was sequenced without capture at approximately 1x coverage depth. Genome-wide CNAs was analyzed for each sample using an automated pipeline. European Leukemia Net (ELN) or Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)-defining CNAs were selected and used to assign patients to a genetic risk group through the same classification systems that are used for CCA. It demonstrated 98.1% concordance of CNA profiles at individual patient level with cytogenetics and\/or FISH. It is advantageous in detecting CNAs of short segments (1 Mb) and from samples with low leukemic cell content, more accurate for describing complex karyotypes and less confounded by subjective bias. LeukoPrint improved the overall diagnostic yield by redefining the risk categories for 16 patients (15%) by presenting new information. Nearly identical CNA profiles from the paired plasma and bone marrow suggest that peripheral blood may serve as a substitute to spare bone marrow aspiration. In summary, LeukoPrint provided an automated, convenient and cost-effective approach to describe genomic CNA profiles in AML\/MDS. It brought greater diagnostic yield and risk stratification information by incorporating into the routine cytogenetics based on the standard ELN\/IPSS-R guidelines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dfe3cb1f-d29e-4a9e-bf12-b0b9026f0967\/@s03B8ZQd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,WGS,myelodysplastic syndromes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17492"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"02abb467-e521-4996-9682-0373c4c8eb8e","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/02abb467-e521-4996-9682-0373c4c8eb8e\/@s03B8ZQd\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaodong Lyu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dandan Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengna Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuexin Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenling Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiyong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuaipeng Geng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingshuai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangxiang He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangwei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinyin Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zunmin Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mao Mao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongping Song<\/i><\/presenter>.

The prognosis of patients with GBM is poor, with a five-year survival rate of 5% and a median overall survival of 12-16 months. In addition, there is a high risk for the recurrence of GBM patient, with the median time of 9.5 months. However, little was reported about the degradation of GBM recurrence.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were conducted to address the histopathological and molecular features of the patient.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>This patient was firstly diagnosed with GBM in April 2019, followed by surgical resection to completely remove tumor occupancy. IHC staining of the tumor sample showed positive expression of P53, S-100, GFAP, EGFR, MGMT, and a 60% expression of Ki67. Thus, this tumor was clinically classified as WHO grade 4 according to its histopathological features. Then we performed NGS and found that the tumor contained four SNVs (<i>EGFR<\/i> c.865G&#62;A, <i>EPHA5<\/i> c.2152C&#62;T, <i>RB1<\/i> c.1615G&#62;T, <i>TP53<\/i> c.742C&#62;T), <i>EGFR<\/i> gene amplification, and without <i>IDH1<\/i> or <i>IDH2<\/i> mutation. These molecular features of the tumor were classified as WHO grade 4 and were consistent with the histopathological grading. In May 2021, two recurrent tumors were found in this patient and were surgical resected again. However, IHC staining of the tumor sample showed positive expression of P53, S-100, and GFAP, while EGFR and MGMT were undetectable, and expression of Ki67 was only 5%. Thus, these recurrent tumors were diagnosed as low-grade astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) according to their histopathological features. Furthermore, NGS was performed with one of those recurrent tumors and showed that it contained 38 SNVs including those four variants in the primary tumor, <i>EGFR<\/i> gene amplification, and without <i>IDH1<\/i> or <i>IDH2<\/i> mutation. According to the fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS), IDH-wildtype astrocytoma combined with <i>EGFR<\/i> gene amplification should be classified as IDH-wildtype GBM (WHO grade 4), which was different from the histopathological grading. From our points of view, though these recurrent tumors are actually high-grade glioma from their &#8216;molecular identity&#8217;, maybe they have not developed to high-grade tumors at the time of diagnosis because of our timely follow-up examination.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In summary, we reported a rare GBM patient survived for two-years post surgical resection and recurred with a low-grade astrocytoma in histopathological diagnosis. However, the molecular features revealed that the recurrent tumor should be diagnosed as a high-grade glioma, suggesting the clinical importance of combining the molecular and conventional histopathological diagnosis. Moreover, we provided a clinical evidence of histological degradation of GBM, and showed a rare clinical case of inconsistence of histopathological and molecular diagnosis in recurrent GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4a59849f-aed0-4859-b044-cb18cee6d15d\/@s03B8ZQd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Degradation ,Astrocytoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17493"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhipeng Su<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bella Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ximeng Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qun Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tonghui Ma<\/i><\/presenter>.

Deregulated FGFR signaling is observed in a subset of tumors across various histologies, making FGFRs ideal therapeutic targets. We sought to determine the genetic landscape of FGFR-family variations in a cohort of pediatric and young adult patients with solid tumors. The CHOP Comprehensive Solid Tumor Panel was performed on 1,420 patients. The panel covers 238 cancer genes and screens for single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, copy number alterations, and 117 fusion gene partners interrogating over 700 exons for known and novel fusions. Identified variants were categorized and reported according to the AMP\/ASCO\/CAP guidelines. Fifty-six patients (4.1%), including 47 children and 9 young adults, were found to carry at least one FGFR alteration in their tumors. CNS tumors accounted for most of the cases (51 total, 87.9%), with pilomyxoid astrocytoma\/pilocytic astrocytoma and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor the most common (13 and 12 patients, respectively). Non-CNS solid tumors included rhabdomyosarcoma (4 patients), neuroblastoma\/ganglioneuroblastoma (2), and follicular thyroid carcinoma (1). FGFR somatic alterations were found in 56 tumors including 41 SNVs and small indels, 6 internal tandem duplications (ITDs), and 15 fusions genes. The most common SNVs observed were hotspot mutations p.K656E and p.N546K of <i>FGFR1<\/i>. Sequence alterations in <i>FGFR1<\/i> contained 35 SNVs and small indels, mostly gain of function mutations located in the kinase domain, and 6 kinase domain ITDs. One SNV was identified in <i>FGFR2<\/i> in the immunoglobulin domain. Two SNVs were reported in <i>FGFR3<\/i>, both of which were in the fibroblast growth factor receptor family domain, and 3 SNVs were identified in <i>FGFR4<\/i>, all occurring at the p.V550 codon located on the kinase domain. Companion mutations in non-FGFR genes were detected in 27 tumors, predominantly involving RAS signaling pathway genes including <i>NF1<\/i> (14 variants), <i>PIK3CA <\/i>(8), <i>PTPN11 <\/i>(6) and <i>PIK3R1 <\/i>(4). Among fusion variants, <i>FGFR1-TACC1<\/i> fusions were found in 5 patients, mostly in pediatric patients. One <i>FGFR3-TACC3 <\/i>fusion was identified in one young adult patient. Seven pediatric patients tested positive for <i>FGFR2<\/i> fusions; all with different 3&#8217; partners. The detection of an FGFR alteration defined or changed the histologic diagnosis for 22 patients. Our results reveal that FGFR alterations account for 4.1% (56\/1420) of the patients with solid tumors tested in our laboratory. The majority of the FGFR-positive tumors are low-grade CNS tumors. Further, the identification of FGFR alterations can significantly improve the tumor diagnosis and provide genomic evidence for potential targeted treatment with FGFR inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7e15ec07-567e-4ba4-aadc-a8a42f7b9570\/@t03B8ZQe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),Molecular diagnosis,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18454"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jinhua Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Schubert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ariel Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maha Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Netta Golenberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weixuan Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kajia Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiani Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth H.

To optimally stratify patients for such strategy, reliable and preferably non-invasive biomarkers that repeatedly can assess neoadjuvant therapy response are needed. Recognizing the importance of the tumor microenvironment, we investigated a less explored imaging marker assessing tumor BF for its potential to predict overall survival (OS).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 24 rectal cancer patients given curative-intent neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) underwent a multi-echo dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with gadolinium contrast for estimation of tumor BF before either 25x2 Gy (n=18) with concomitant chemotherapy or 5x5 Gy (n=6). 4-7 weeks post-RT the MRI was repeated. Baseline blood samples were analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT-2). Tumor volumes were measured before and after RT. After the subsequent surgery, ypT scoring assessed tumor RT response. Cox regression for OS analysis and t-test for group comparisons were performed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>7 patients were non-survivors and the median follow-up for survivors was 55 months (range, 44-60). The change in tumor BF (&#916;BF) during neoadjuvant RT was identified as a significant marker of OS (Table). Tumor stage and volume were not significant. All patients with more than 20% decline in BF were survivors. Separating cases in two groups based on &#916;BF revealed that patients with increase or a low decrease had higher baseline levels of LDH (p = 0.032) and ANGPT-2 (p = 0.028).<br \/><b>Discussion: <\/b>MRI-assessed tumor &#916;BF during neoadjuvant treatment is a significant predictor of OS in rectal cancer patients, making &#916;BF a potential biomarker for treatment stratification in a watch-and-wait strategy. Blood LDH and ANGPT-2 indicate that non-responding tumors may have a hypoxic microenvironment insusceptible to RT.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{7DF78B2C-CD0B-4D50-AC63-5F2A4A18D848}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Parameter<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Hazard ratio for impaired OS<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>p-value<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tumor stage<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.08 [0.40-2.95]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.88<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ypT score of the surgical specimen<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.54 [0.76-3.12]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RT fractionation (25x2 Gy versus 5x5 Gy)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.24 [0.50-9.90]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Baseline BF<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.96 [0.92-1.00]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.05<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Post-RT BF<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.02 [1.00-1.04]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#916;BF<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.03 [1.01-1.05]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.01<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Baseline tumor volume<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.01 [0.99-1.04]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Post-RT tumor volume<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.01 [0.98-1.05]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.42<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#916;tumor volume<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.03 [0.99-1.07]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.15<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2b5794c-788c-4847-9459-cbb5d07cb0af\/@t03B8ZQe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Functional and molecular imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Magnetic resonance imaging,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Overall survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18455"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kine M.

While many PNETs have the propensity to be indolent, some small tumors display aggressive features with early metastatic potential. We used machine learning to develop a predictive model of metastatic potential dependent upon the transcriptomic signature of primary PNET tissue. To build this model, RNA sequencing data was obtained from the primary tissue of 96 surgically-resected PNETs from various institutions. Two cohorts were generated with equally balanced metastatic PNET composition (15 (32.6%) vs. 13 (26.5%), p=0.52). A differential gene expression analysis identified 20 concordantly differentially expressed genes associated with metastatic status between the two cohorts. Unsupervised surrogate variable analysis estimated and adjusted for significant sources of variation not related to metastatic potential and mitigated unwanted noise and batch effects. A gene set enrichment analysis identified an additional 29 genes that most frequently contributed to the enriched biologic pathways extrapolated from the sequencing data. Log transformed, batch corrected TPM values for these 49 genes were combined with an additional 10 clinically-relevant genes, including ARX and PDX1, that are known to contribute to PNET signatures or oncogenesis. The datasets were subsequently randomized in a 1:1 ratio and informative features with respect to metastatic status were identified utilizing a Boruta algorithm, with <i>a priori <\/i>exclusion of highly-correlative genes and those that displayed near zero variance. Nine genes, including <i>AURKA<\/i>, <i>ARX<\/i>, <i>CDCA8<\/i>, <i>CPB2<\/i>, <i>MYT1L<\/i>, <i>NDC80<\/i>, <i>PAPPA2<\/i>, <i>SFMBT1 <\/i>and <i>ZPLD1<\/i>, were identified as sufficient to classify the localized or metastatic outcome. Distributed random forests (DRF), generalized linear models (GLM), gradient boosting machines (GBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models were trained utilizing these 9 genes. Training ROC ranged from 0.92 for DRF to 1 for XGboost. When applied to 47 independent validation samples, the testing sensitivity ranged from 75% for DRF to 94% for GBM; specificity ranged from 84% for DRF to 94% to XGboost and GLM; positive predictive value ranged from 72% for DRF to 86% for GLM; negative predictive value ranged from 88% for GLM to 97% to GBM. The degree of predictive agreement between models ranged from 64% to 91%. Taken together, we have developed a highly sensitive predictive model of the metastatic PNET phenotype that is based on expression of nine genes. Its application as a guide for management should be studied prospectively in patients with newly diagnosed PNETs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a6b4af0c-f63c-4173-968e-9c9894c5b0b6\/@t03B8ZQe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Machine learning,Predictive biomarkers,Metastatic potential,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18456"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jacques A.

Currently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is used as a target. Targets more specific for HNSCC would reduce background signal, resulting in a higher tumor to background ratio. We aimed to identify new potential targets for FMI in HNSCC.<br \/>Methods: Publicly available transcriptomic data were collected. A biostatistical method known as Transcriptional Adaptation to Copy Number Alterations (TACNA) profiling was applied, which captures the downstream effects of copy number alterations (CNAs) on mRNA levels, which we used to predict the overexpression on the protein level. By comparing gene expression profiles of HNSCC and normal oral mucosa, genes overexpressed explicitly in HNSCC were identified. Potential targets were selected based on the degree of overexpression, plasma membrane expression, and cross expression in other tissues in the head and neck region. Next, the expression of potential targets of TACNA results on mRNA level were validated on the protein level and compared to EGFR expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Subsequently, paired biopsies of HNSCC, adjacent suspicious mucosa, and healthy mucosa of the same patients were stained. Receptor expression was evaluated using H-scores (i.e., percentage of positive cells combined with staining intensity).<br \/>Results: TACNA profiling was applied on 111 samples of healthy oral mucosa and 410 HNSCC comparing expression levels of 19,635 genes. The newly identified membrane-bound targets were glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), placental cadherin (P-cadherin), and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1). The three targets were evaluated by IHC in a total of 31 patients, of which 8 had oropharyngeal, 7 hypopharyngeal, and 16 laryngeal carcinomas. GLUT-1 had a median H-score of 175, P-cadherin 140, and MCT-1 40. GLUT-1 and P-cadherin were significantly higher compared to EGFR, with a median H-score of 90 (p &#60; .001). GLUT-1 receptor expression was also seen on erythrocytes, while P-cadherin expression was seen in the basal layer of normal epithelium. This can complicate its use in FMI.<br \/>Conclusion: TACNA profiling results were successfully validated in immunohistochemistry as a first step in the search for new specific FMI targets in HNSCC. GLUT-1 and P-cadherin show promising results with significantly higher receptor expression than EGFR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/da199096-601a-4f02-bb56-8de77dc413e5\/@t03B8ZQe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immunohistochemistry,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20865"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeroen E.

Methods: Primary tumors and lymph node metastases of 38 patients who underwent primary resection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were selected. In addition, lymph node metastases from salvage surgery after (chemo)radiotherapy from 22 patients with HNSCC were selected. Immunohistochemical staining for EGFR, VEGF and GPNMB was performed, after which protein expression was scored using H-scores (percentage of positive tumor cells multiplied by staining intensity ranging from 0 to 2). Primary tumors and lymph node metastases with an H-score &#8805;5 were considered positive, after which sensitivity rates were calculated. Groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data with post-hoc Bonferroni corrections. Results: In untreated primary HNSCC the sensitivity was 86.8% for EGFR (median H-score 60), 92.1% for VEGF (median 60), and 100% for GPNMB (median 100). In previously untreated lymph node metastases the sensitivity was 81.6% for EGFR (median 30), 86.8% for VEGF (median 65), and 100% for GPNMB (median 118). In lymph node metastases after initial (chemo)radiotherapy, sensitivity was 86.4% for EGFR (median 95) and 100% for GPMB (median 100). VEGF sensitivity could not reliably be evaluated in these lymph nodes due to nonspecific staining in all tissue slides. GPNMB expression was significantly higher compared to EGFR in untreated primary HNSCC (p = .009 and p &#60; .001, respectively) and lymph node metastases (p &#60; .001 for both). Conclusion: GPNMB shows better tumor-specific receptor expression in both sensitivity and H-scores compared to EGFR and VEGF in immunohistochemistry. VEGF performed comparable to EGFR in untreated HNSCC and lymph node metastases. GPNMB could therefore be a new potential imaging target based on these immunohistochemical results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/76dda3d7-771e-4d89-a7ab-6aa6f2ef549e\/@t03B8ZQe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Lymph node metastasis,Immunohistochemistry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20866"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeroen E.

We previously reported that treatment of CRC preclinical models with temozolomide (TMZ) leads to MMR deficiency, increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) and, sensitization to immunotherapy. To clinically translate these findings, we designed the ARETHUSA clinical trial whereby O6-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) deficient, MMR proficient and <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant mCRC patients receive priming therapy with TMZ. Analysis of solid tissue biopsies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) obtained after TMZ treatment revealed the emergence of TMZ mutational signature, alterations in MMR genes and increased TMB in 14 out of 16 patients. Genetic mutations induced by TMZ were dose-dependent and multiple alterations in the nucleotide context favored by the TMZ signature emerged in MMR genes such as the <i>MSH6<\/i> T1219I variant which was detected in ctDNA and tissue of 13\/14 (93%) of the cases. A subset of the patients whose tumors after TMZ priming displayed the <i>MSH6<\/i> mutation, the TMZ mutational signature and increased TMB, achieved disease stabilization upon pembrolizumab treatment. Overall, we provide <i>proof-of-concept<\/i> that treatment of MGMT deficient\/MMR proficient <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant mCRCs with TMZ can be tracked by mutational signature analysis and lead to inactivation of the MMR pathway, emergence of the TMZ mutational signature, TMB increase, and, in some cases, to disease stabilization during ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/78d53af1-ba2d-4eb0-976e-95bee6270e85\/@t03B8ZQe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mismatch repair deficiency,Temozolomide,Mutational Signature,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20869"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Giovanni Crisafulli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Sartore-Bianchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Lazzari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filippo Pietrantonio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessio Amatu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Macagno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludovic Barault<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Cassingena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alice Bartolini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Luraghi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianluca Mauri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Battuello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicola Personemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valeria Pessei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pietro Paolo Vitiello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Tosi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Idotta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emanuele Valtorta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emanuela Bonoldi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Germano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Di Nicolantonio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Marsoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Salvatore Siena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Bardelli<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, we performed transcriptional profiling by RNA-Seq (n=582) and targeted genomic sequencing by FoundationONE CDx (n=743) from prostate cancer tumor specimens in the phase III IPATential150 trial of first-line ipatasertib (Ipat) plus abiraterone (Abi) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (N=1101). Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis of the 582 samples with RNA-Seq with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) reveals four consensus subtypes. This includes an immune\/cell cycle-high, an AR signature\/cell cycle-high, a stroma program-enriched, and an ERG fusion-enriched subtype. Subgroups of patients with immune\/cell cycle-high and AR signature\/cell cycle-high tumors had the shortest radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and were characterized by high MYC and cell cycle-related gene signatures.

However, the criteria used to define overexpression of MET protein have differed among many studies, and in contrast to the initial phase II studies, the phase III trials failed to show any clinical benefit from anti&#8209;MET therapies in GCs, even in patients with MET-positive disease. Several studies have used consistent criteria to define MET amplification on FISH, and recent MET inhibitor trials for MET amplified cancers have been successful. Furthermore, hyperactivation of MET pathway are known to reduce the growth-inhibitory effect of trastuzumab in HER2 positive GC. Currently, there is no FDA approved MET inhibitors for GC. Capmatinib and savolitinib, which are selective MET inhibitors, has been evaluated for various MET positive cancers. The aim of this study was to test these MET inhibitors on MET amplified gastro-esophageal cancer (GC) cells.<br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b>Among a total of 37 GC cells in our lab, the following cells were positive for MET by copy number amplification (CNV &#62; 10): SNU-620, ESO51, MKN-45, SNU-5 and OE-33. We assessed cytotoxic response of these GC cells to capmatinib or savolitinib alone by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay and anchorage independent growth in soft agar. Western blots were performed to assess the cellular activity of capmatinib or savolitinib in MET signal pathway. Xenograft studies were performed to evaluate in vivo therapeutic efficacy of savolitinib with MKN-45 cells.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Savolitinib and capmatinib showed anti-proliferative activity against MET amplified GC cell lines in dose-dependent manner. There was no inhibitory effect on GC cells without MET amplification, such as SNU-216 and SNU-1750. Savolitinib inhibited phosphorylation of MET and down-stream signaling pathway, such as AKT or ERK, in MET amplified GC cells. We observed that treatment with savolitinib induced a significant decrease in the number of colonies formed in soft agar. In addition, Savolitinib exhibited dose-responsive anti-tumor efficacy in xenograft model with MKN-45 GC cells. Furthermore, the combination of Trastuzumab and capmatinib exhibited enhanced inhibition of AKT and ERK activation in OE-33 cells, which is positive for both HER2 and MET, and resistant to trastuzumab alone.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Collectively, these data support that targeting MET with Savolitinib and capmatinib efficiently suppresses the growth of MET amplified GC cells. Moreover, MET inhibitor could synergize with trastuzumab to induce the therapeutic effect on the HER2 and MET amplified GC cells. Further studies are warranted to test this concept in clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),Hepatocyte growth factor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21514"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jin-Soo Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sungyoul Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mi Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

A biomarker that will be able to differentiate between benign andmalignant nodules would help to accelerate diagnosis and reduce unnecessary and invasive procedures. Here, we investigated the utility of quantitative radiomics to predict malignancy of small pulmonary nodules. Data including cancer status, age, gender, smokingstatus and CT radiomics data, from 242 patients accrued from the Detection of Early Lung Cancer Among Military Personnel (DECAMP1) consortium was used. DECAMP1 is a prospective study of 500 current or former smokers with indeterminate pulmonary nodules (0.7-3.0 cm). A total of 446 quantitative radiomic features were extracted from CT images of each patient. For the prediction models, various feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine and Support Vector Machine were used. Data was split into train and test set with tenfold cross-validation.Models were evaluated using; Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and Area under the curve - a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). In terms of predictive performance, the AUC value was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.50-0.78) for the clinical model and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) for the radiomics model. Adding clinical features to the radiomics model (gender, age, smoking status) did not improve the model. We have also investigated the slice thickness and scanner (PET vs PET-CT) variables on the models&#8217; performance and saw a modest improvement of the AUC values when using more homogenous data. In this study, we showed the potential of radiomics for lung cancer prediction in DECAMP1.For future work, we are planning to test whether incorporating bronchial gene expression data improves lung cancer detection and to validate these findings in separate, independent cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bfdd47de-7335-44d6-b937-42f96622c21b\/@t03B8ZQe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Radiomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Radiomics,Indolent nodule,Detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21676"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kate M.

Understanding the evolution of target antigen expression can guide selection and sequencing of newer therapies targeting CD19 and CD20. We sought to quantitate the change in expression of CD19 and CD20 in R\/R DLBCL after Rituximab (R)-based chemo immunotherapy (CIT) relative to pretreatment levels.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Pts. diagnosed with DLBCL after January 2014 who were R\/R to R-based CIT (R-CHOP or R-EPOCH), were identified and clinical variables at diagnosis (Dx) and first R\/R were recorded. Data from archival flow cytometry assays on Dx and R\/R biopsies were accessed. Using <i>FCS Express&#174; <\/i>software, neoplastic cells were gated, and fluorescence intensity (FI) of CD19 and CD20 expression were reported. Multivariate linear mixed model was used to compare median and geometric mean FI of CD19 and CD20 between Dx and R\/R.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 51 flow cytometry assays (26 Dx and 25 R\/R) were analyzed for 33 pts., of whom paired assays (at both Dx and R\/R) were available for 18 pts. Median age at Dx was 64 (range, 41-76) yrs, 24 pts. (73%) were male and 29 (88%) had IPI &#8805; 2. Cell of origin at Dx was GCB in 16 (49%), non-GCB in 12 (36%) pts., while two had a double-hit rearrangement. Median time to R\/R was 10.4 months.<br \/>There was a significant reduction in median FI of CD20 from Dx [median: 40,610 (range: 167 - 259,962)] to R\/R [median: 11,596 (range: 63 - 79,592)], representing a reduction of 63% at R\/R relative to Dx (P= 0.01; 95% CI: 20-73%). Similar change was observed in geometric mean FI of CD20, which was reduced 65% at R\/R relative to Dx (P&#60; 0.01; 95%CI: 31-82%). Median and geometric mean FI of CD19 at R\/R were 38% and 20% lower compared to Dx, respectively, but these differences were not statistically significant (P= 0.08 and 0.39, respectively). Relative change in FI at R\/R in individual cases, compared to the mean FI of all Dx cases, showed that 21 out 25 R\/R cases (84%) had reduction of CD20 whereas only 14\/25 (56%) had reduction of CD19. Interestingly, 7\/25 (28%) R\/R cases had an increase in CD19 expression by &#62;80%. Reduction in CD20 geometric mean FI from Dx to R\/R was significantly associated with age &#62;60 years (p=0.04), bone marrow involvement (p &#60;0.01) and &#62;1 site of extra nodal involvement (p= 0.03) at Dx.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Quantitative assessment by flow cytometry revealed a significant decline in expression of CD20 at R\/R compared to Dx in patients with DLBCL treated with R-based CIT. CD19 expression was largely unchanged, although dramatically upregulated in a subset of R\/R cases. Given the role of CD19 mediated pathways in B-cell NHL and its association with PI3K pro-survival signaling, these data merit further exploration as a potential mechanism of treatment resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/420fb19b-1062-4a32-8aa7-85f14ed27130\/@t03B8ZQe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CD19,CD20,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21748"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Agrima Mian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Narendra Bhattarai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manishkumar S.
