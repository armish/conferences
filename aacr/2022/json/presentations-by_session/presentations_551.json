[{"Abstract":"<b>Objective:<\/b> Synovial sarcoma (SS) and myxoid\/round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) are rare subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma. Reported prognostic factors of survival for SS and MRCLS include tumor size\/grade, tumor depth, and round cell component specifically for MRCLS. However, these publications refer to both localized and advanced disease, and there is a lack of a systematic review of these factors. The objective is to systematically review prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS) in subjects with advanced (metastatic or unresectable) SS and MRCLS.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> Literature searches were conducted in PubMed and Embase using search strings for advanced\/metastatic SS and MRCLS, and survival, and included English language articles (2000-2020), complemented with clinical trial registry summaries and oncology conference proceedings (most recent 3 years). Studies with multivariable (MV) analyses were prioritized.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Sixteen studies investigated prognostic factors associated with OS (13 SS, 2 MRCLS and 1 SS\/MRCLS). Five studies were conducted in the US, two in the UK and three in the EU; three SS studies and one MRCLS study included at least 100 subjects in the analyses. <u><\/u> <u>Advanced SS<\/u>: Among six studies with MV analyses of OS, the factors in the models varied by study. Age was studied in three analyses with older age being associated with worse OS in one analysis. Metastasectomy was included in two analyses and found to be associated with longer OS in one analysis. Larger primary tumor size was associated with shorter survival in two analyses. Other factors associated with worse OS and occurring in one analysis include: males, no chemotherapy\/radiotherapy\/surgery of primary tumor, extra-pulmonary metastasis, lymph node metastasis, shorter time to metastasis and higher performance status. Univariate analyses showed similar results. <u>Advanced MRCLS<\/u>: While no MV analyses were conducted, the following factors were investigated in two univariate analyses each but had p-values &#62;0.05: primary tumor grade, primary tumor size, percentage of round cells and location of metastases. Only one study identified factors associated with worse OS: stage IV at diagnosis, &#8805;3 metastatic lesions at start of first-line therapy and a high number of organs involved during first-line therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Limited evidence exists for prognostic factors of OS among advanced SS and MRCLS subjects. Large tumor size was the most common factor associated with poor OS in MV analyses among advanced SS subjects; other factors associated with poorer prognosis included older age, males, and metastasis characteristics. Among advanced MRCLS subjects, there were very few prognostic factors reported and all stemmed from univariate analyses in a single study, underscoring the scarcity of data available and the need for further explorations with this subtype.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Funding: <\/b>GSK<b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3eea55d6-4961-4d95-84e2-75fb23090cff\/@D03B8ZTc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognostic factors,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Overall survival,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17926"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Samantha St Laurent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Van den Bosch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hilde Vroling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huifen Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Shibani Pokras<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, most biomarkers are currently developed from single type of omics data. The goal of this study is to identify prognostic prostate cancer signatures using transcriptomics and metabolomics profiles jointly aiming to capture wider spectrum of biological information.<br \/>Methods: In this study, we included 94 tumor and 48 adjacency normal samples with both transcriptomics and metabolomics profiles from Dana-Farber\/Harvard Cancer Center SPORE Prostate Cancer Cohort. There were 85 patients being followed up with median length of 2.02 years including 3 lethal and 8 progression cases. We first constructed a multi-omics covering network that contained minimal set of variable pairs but sufficiently rich to account for observed inter-patient variations. The network was built on known gene-metabolite interaction pairs from Pathway Commons as prior knowledge. Next, we used a diffusion process with each of connected gene-metabolite pairs as seeds to identify candidate signatures in the network. Signature sizes were controlled under 5 by adjusting the tree height during pruning. Hierarchical clustering and survival analyses were then performed to stratify patients into two risk groups for disease-free survival probability. Only the prognostic signatures with power higher than 0.9 from bootstrapping were kept for external validation and functional analyses. Since to our best knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset with both transcriptomics and metabolomics to validate the multi-omics signature we identified. We thus trained a rank-based kTSP classifier using gene expression data in SPORE cohort as a surrogate signature and validated it in TCGA prostate cancer cohort independently.<br \/>Results: Constructed covering network consisted of 12 metabolites and 54 genes with inter-patient heterogeneities being captured efficiently. We identified one high-powered multi-omics signature (Gene: EGLN3; Metabolites: succinate, trans-4-hydroxyproline) that exhibited good prognostic value where high-risk patients had significant less time of disease-free survival (log rank test: p=0.019, power: 0.974). In addition, genomic variations were observed in different percentages of patients in high and low risk groups including NCOR1(SNV, 70.6% vs 96.3% p=0.025), NKX3.1(CNV, 29.6% vs 64.7% p=0.031) and TNFRSF10C (CNV, 29.6% vs 64.7%, p=0.031). No evidence indicated the patient grouping by the signature depend on Gleason scores (p=0.44). The surrogated gene signature contained 6 pairs of genes that can effectively classify TCGA patients into two prognostic groups (log rank test: p=0.048). Still, no evidence indicated the surrogate gene signature is associated with Gleason score (p=0.23) in TCGA dataset.<br \/>Conclusions: We identified a prognostic multi-omics signature (EGLN3, succinate, trans-4-hydroxyproline) with high statistical power.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ebb28cd0-e076-41e8-9d88-540fe5fd9167\/@D03B8ZTc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Multiomics,Prostate cancer,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17927"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhuoran Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Benedetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Carelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Rosenthal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hubert Pakula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Omar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renato Umeton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Brundage<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Krumsiek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimo Loda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi Marchionni<\/i><\/presenter>.

The U.S. military health system (MHS) provides beneficiaries with universal health care. Our previous studies showed improved survival of the MHS patients with lung cancer compared to those in the US general population covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. This study expanded the previous studies by further comparing MHS patient with SEER patients with different insurances to provide evidence on the effects of insurance status on survival. The MHS patients were identified from the Department of Defense's (DoD) Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR). The SEER patients were identified from the 18 cancer registries of the SEER program. All patients were diagnosed with histologically confirmed lung cancer between 2007 and 2013. The SEER program defines insurance type as insured (private insurance, Medicare administered through a managed care plan or private supplement), insured\/no specifics (Medicare NOS, insurance NOS), any Medicaid (Indian\/Public health Service, Medicaid, Medicaid administered through a managed care plan, Medicare with Medicaid eligibility), and uninsured (no insurance, self-pay). The results showed that compared to ACTUR, SEER patients with non-small cell lung cancer exhibited increased risk of mortality regardless of their insurance type. Specifically, the adjusted HR (95% CI) was 1.08 (1.03-1.13), 1.22 (1.16-1.28), 1.40 (1.33-1.47), 1.49 (1.41-1.58), for SEER insured, insured\/no specifics, Medicaid, and uninsured, respectively. This pattern was consistently observed in subgroups by age, gender, race, and tumor stage. Among small-cell lung cancer patients, the higher HR compared to ACTUR was significant only for Medicaid (HR=1.24, 95% CI=1.11-1.38) and uninsured (HR=1.28, 95% CI=1.13-1.45). Furthermore, compared to ACTUR, the likelihood of receiving surgery was significantly lower in SEER with odds ratios (95% CIs) of 0.85 (0.76-0.95), 0.64 (0.57-0.72), 0.40 (0.36-0.45), and 0.34 (0.29-0.39) for insured, insurance\/no specifics, Medicaid, and uninsured, respectively, and was observed regardless of tumor stage. Our study suggests that the MHS lung cancer patients had survival advantage over the SEER patients and the advantage was even larger when compared to Medicaid or uninsured patients. In addition, the SEER patients were less likely to receive surgery regardless of tumor stage, especially for Medicaid or uninsured patients.

It is the seventh most common cancer, yet it is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. It is estimated that in 2021, 48,220 patients will die from pancreatic cancer. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include smoking, diabetes, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, and family history. Over 80% of the patients present with metastatic disease. Despite advances in chemotherapy, the average survival remains less than 5 years even after surgery. Genetic research on pancreatic cancer has generally only focused on familial pancreatic cancer, which is only 10% of all pancreatic cancer patients. This study focuses on finding genes that impact the survival of pancreatic cancer patients based on race, with the goal of finding genes that are race specific and can be used as biomarkers and potential targets to develop personalized treatment options. All datasets for pancreatic cancer in cBioPortal were used for this study. The data were then stratified based on race information for the patients. Three (3) racial categories, 1) White 2) African American and Black, and 3) Asian were chosen. Our analysis finds that White, African Americans and Asians<br \/>have distinct copy number alterations, more specifically amplifications in specific genes, with GATA6, RECQL4, and MIB1 being only altered in White patients, PKD1L1, GARS1, and NEUROD6 only altered in Black &#38; African American patients, and the entire 4p16.3 cytoband of genes (39 in total), only altered in Asian patients. Patients with alterations in these unique genes also had poor survival. Using the Protein Atlas, MD Anderson Cell Lines Project (MCLP) dataset and genecards.org data, we identified potential drug candidates that target the proteins encoded by these genes. Our study clearly demonstrates that race specific genetic alterations exist in pancreatic cancer and provides a foundation for the development of race specific diagnostic\/prognostic biomarkers and targeted therapeutic options with better survival outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cf6c7dfa-2570-4a5c-802c-b73a61167312\/@E03B8ZTd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Gene expression analysis,Survival,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17931"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Digonto Chatterjee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Hester<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meera Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alakesh Bera<\/i><\/presenter>.

The Navajo Nation, the largest tribe in the Southwest, is experiencing higher incidence of stomach cancer compared to the general population in the region, possibly due to high prevalence of <i>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)<\/i> infection and other contributing factors, like diet. To learn about factors linked to stomach cancer, we initiated a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence, virulence, and dietary correlates of <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection among Navajo adults. We hypothesized that <i>H. pylori<\/i> infections, particularly with the virulent <i>cagA<\/i> gene, would be highly prevalent in Navajo adults compared to other non-AI populations, and that diets high in salt, processed meats, and low in vegetables would be associated with prevalent <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection. Study recruitment occurred from January to October 2021 in two geographic areas of the Navajo Nation. Participants were recruited using online and offline platforms, including social media (Facebook, Instagram), study website (www.theabidstudy.com), newspapers, flyers, word of mouth, and community outreach events. Eligible, consenting study participants provided a stool sample, which was analyzed by droplet digital PCR assays for <i>H. pylori<\/i> 16S gene detection and <i>cagA<\/i> virulence gene typing. Participants also provided health and food information through two questionnaires.Preliminary data indicate that prevalence of <i>H. pylori<\/i> is high in the included regions of the Navajo Nation. The <i>H. pylori <\/i>prevalence (51.5%, 95% CI: 38.9-64.0) in this study is higher than the prevalence in the US population (35%). Moreover, the <i>cagA<\/i> virulence gene prevalence in the Navajo with <i>H. pylori<\/i> was 55.9% (95% CI: 37.9-72.8), which is comparable to the US prevalence of 50%. These early results point to a need of developing prevention strategies to reduce <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection in the Navajo Nation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/42e49fac-55c2-4f8e-971d-9d80579e7182\/@E03B8ZTd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Helicobacter pylori,American Indian,Stomach cancer,CagA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17932"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dornell Pete<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda I.

Native Hawaiians (NH) as a unique ethnic group in the US, exhibit many disproportionate health issues. In particular, they suffer from both elevated CRC incidence and mortality rates. This study aimed to investigate if genetic differences could contribute to disparities observed between NH and White CRC patients by defining the association between unique NH-genetic differences and CRC outcomes.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><b> <\/b>Paired tumor and adjacent normal biospecimens of NH CRC patients were collected from the Hawaii Tumor Registry (HTR), and gene expression and mutation were examined by RNA sequencing. Genomic data of CRC Whites was extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database as a comparative cohort. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for both NH and TCGA cohorts via DESeq2 with FDR q-value &#60; 0.05 and a cutoff of 2-fold change. MutTecT2 and GATK were used to identify significant somatic mutations. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression with 10-fold cross validation was performed to predict genetic risk factors for early detection, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was processed for canonical pathways and network discovery. Univariate Cox proportional regression was performed to identify DEGs related to patient survival; multivariable Cox regression model with stepwise fitting generated a prognostic index (PI), and the prediction value was examined by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). A nomogram was developed by integrating PI and clinicopathologic factors; calibration curves were provided to internally validate the performance, and discriminative ability was appraised by concordance index.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>In total, 2096 DEGs were identified between NH tumor and normal groups, 1740 transcripts and 78 carrying mutations were unique to NH compared to the TCGA Whites cohort. A set of 23 genes including 10 NH specific DEGs were identified as genetic risk factors for detecting NH with CRC, and the AUC was 99.8%. A 9 gene-signature prognostic model including 5 NH specific DEGs was built with high survival prediction capability (AUC=0.99), and Kaplan-Meier curve showed that the low PI group had a better survival than the high PI group in NH with CRC (Logrank P=3.6E-05). After adjustment by age, gender, and tumor grade, the prognostic 9 gene-signature was still significant (<i>P<\/i>=0.0059).

This study analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) &#8211; Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) linked data resource. The study population consists of 982 women (&#8805; 65 years old at diagnosis) with primary breast cancer who were diagnosed in 1998-2012 and completed the MHOS survey within 24 months before diagnosis and completed at least one more survey after diagnosis. The study population was grouped into three ethnic\/racial groups: Whites (n=791), Black\/African American (n=104) and Hispanics (n=87). The mean age of the population was 74.8 &#177; 6.1. HRQoL was measured using SF-36\/VR-12 questionnaire and summarized as Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) Score. Results showed an increase in the PCS score at month 6 after diagnosis, and a decrease at month 12 was observed in Whites and Black\/African Americans. A continuous decrease in the PCS score till month 12 and an increase at month 24 was observed in Hispanics. All three groups showed similar trends in MCS scores over time - the MCS score dropped at month 6 but was back at baseline by month 12. The Whites had the highest MCS score out of the three, and Hispanics had the lowest. The MCS score for Hispanics decreased by month 36, whereas it increased for Black\/African Americans. The MCS score for Whites remained fairly the same. The results also showed an increase in the total number of comorbidities at month six after diagnosis, along with a decrease to the baseline comorbidities by month 12. Hispanics had the highest increase in comorbidities at month 6 and Whites had the lowest and most stable. The number of comorbidities remained fairly the same in Whites and Black\/African Americans, whereas the number of comorbidities increased slightly at month 24 for Hispanics and drastically increased at month 36. Overall, changes in the total number of comorbidities had a negative correlation with the changes in MCS scores, therefore it can be concluded that the number of comorbidities have a negative effect on a patient&#8217;s mental health. Whites were observed to have less comorbidities and better MCS scores than Black\/African Americans or Hispanics. The information gained from this study will help clinicians and patients in the shared treatment decision process and guide individualized survivorship care plans among older women with breast cancer.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eb7fb5a7-352b-4a1e-b31e-d9ca9adb4325\/@E03B8ZTd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Survivors,Quality of Life,Disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17935"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"89aac380-e0fc-4843-a2d1-795d7ff3e058","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/89aac380-e0fc-4843-a2d1-795d7ff3e058\/@E03B8ZTd\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sushantti Rupesh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunkyung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

Exercise has been associated with decreased breast cancer mortality and adverse symptoms. This study&#8217;s purpose is to understand prevalence and predictors of inadequate aerobic exercise in patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer to inform interventions to increase exercise participation.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> Patients seen at least once at Mayo Clinic Rochester were prospectively enrolled within one year of an initial breast cancer diagnosis in the Mayo Clinic Breast Disease Registry after providing informed consent. This analysis includes those who completed a baseline survey with self-reported exercise data using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. This longitudinal cohort study was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> 1,738 participants reported their usual weekly quantity of moderate and strenuous exercise an average of 95 days (SD 71 days, range 0-365) after diagnosis. Table 1 displays participant characteristics overall and by whether participants reported at least 150 minutes of moderate and\/or strenuous activity weekly (&#8220;met guidelines&#8221;) or not (&#8220;did not meet guidelines&#8221;). Overall, 39% of participants met guidelines, including 56% of those aged 18-39 years, 40% of those aged 40-69 years, and 27% of those aged 70+ years.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> Older age was associated with less likelihood of meeting exercise guidelines (all age groups vs 70+, p &#60; 0.05). A more diverse cohort will be needed to evaluate differences by gender and race\/ethnicity. There did not appear to be any obvious impact on exercise level by time since diagnosis (during the first year after diagnosis) or educational status, though substantial missing data limit conclusions related to the latter. Additional research is needed to assess exercise levels later in survivorship and the impact of various treatment modalities on exercise habits<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{6EDF5AAE-F05C-412C-8F04-30D00E9E5CA5}\"><caption>Table 1.

While some dietary components have been implicated as risk factors for pancreatic cancer, epidemiological data on the role of overall diet quality in pancreatic cancer etiology are limited, especially from population-based prospective studies. This study examined<b> <\/b>the relationship between diet quality and pancreatic cancer incidence in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Data were analyzed from 177,313 African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, Latino, and White men and women aged 45-75 years who completed a quantitative food frequency questionnaire at cohort entry. Diet quality was assessed by a priori diet quality indices (DQIs), the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED) score, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII&#174;). These five DQIs were investigated because of their potential to capture differences in various nutritional patterns across different racial\/ethnic groups. Multivariate Cox models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the DQIs and pancreatic cancer incidence adjusted for age, sex, race\/ethnicity, education, diabetes status, family history of pancreatic cancer, vigorous physical activity, smoking status with pack years, total energy intake, body mass index (BMI), and alcohol consumption. Stratified analyses were done by sex, race\/ethnicity, smoking status and BMI.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> During an average follow up of 19.3 years, 1,782 incident pancreatic cancer cases were identified. Overall, we did not observe statistically significant associations between the DQIs and pancreatic cancer risk. In subgroup analyses comparing the highest vs. lowest quintiles of the scores, a protective association was observed with the DASH for ever smokers (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60-0.92) and individuals with BMI &#8805; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.94), but not for never smokers (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.82-1.31, <i>P<\/i> for heterogeneity = 0.004) or those with BMI &#60; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.94-1.56, <i>P<\/i> for heterogeneity = 0.097). There were no differences in associations by sex or race\/ethnicity (<i>P<\/i> for heterogeneity &#8805; 0.43).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In this large prospective study,<b> <\/b>we did not find reduction in pancreatic cancer risk associated with healthier diet as assessed by the 5 DQIs. There is some indication that adherence to the DASH diet may potentially be protective against pancreatic cancer among ever smokers or individuals classified as overweight or obese. Further investigations are needed to confirm these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/32b23c85-6769-4284-ac32-ba458bef65d4\/@E03B8ZTd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,Pancreatic cancer,Cohort study,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17939"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Heather Steel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Song-Yi Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiffany Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Stram<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loic Le Marchand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna H.

Understanding genetic factors associated with breast density may help clarify mechanisms by which breast density increases breast cancer risk. To date, 46 genetic loci have been associated with breast density, however, these studies have been performed among predominantly European ancestry populations. This study sought to identify genetic factors associated with breast density among women of African ancestry.<br \/>Methods: We utilized a cohort of women aged 40-85 years who underwent screening mammography at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from 2010-2014. The cohort was linked to the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), a repository of DNA samples from consenting patients. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of breast density among women with available genotypes who either self-reported their race as Black\/African American, or had an African ancestry genotype (N = 1,323). For each mammogram, the publicly available &#8220;LIBRA&#8221; software (v1.0.4) was used to quantify dense area and area percent density (dense area divided by breast area) from raw (i.e., FOR PROCESSING) full-field digital mammograms (Selenia Dimensions, Hologic Inc.). Women completed a breast cancer risk factor questionnaire at the time of mammography and BMI was obtained from electronic health records. We tested for associations of dense area and area percent density with ~8.5M common variants, adjusting for age, BMI, menopausal status, and two principle components of ancestry as covariates.<br \/>Results: We identified three novel loci associated with dense area at genome wide significance (p &#60; 5e-08), including <i>KCNA3<\/i> (rs61803939, p =3.40e-08, beta=3.26, SE=0.59) and two nearby loci on chromosome 19, <i>ZNF486<\/i> (rs6511094, p =1.41e-08, beta=2.44, SE=0.43) and LOC100129265 (rs1428621382 p = 5.13E-08, beta=2.40, SE=0.44). Our results also replicated three previously reported signals near genes <i>TET3 <\/i>associated with dense area, <i>TNS1<\/i> and <i>SMIM25<\/i> associated with area percent density at nominally significant p &#60; 1e-06.<br \/>Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first breast density GWAS in women of African ancestry. Although the study had a small sample size, the analyses replicated associations of three known genes and also identified three novel breast density loci.

Our study explored the prevalence of germline pathogenic\/likely-pathogenic (P\/LP) mutations and actionable somatic mutations to understand the clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in gynecological malignancies.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Genomic data was retrospectively analyzed for 1,610 women with various stages of gynecological malignancies including ovarian (OC, n=945), cervical (CC, n=358), and endometrial cancers (EC, n=307). Genomic data were derived from targeted NGS of paired white blood cell and other biological samples using a 520-gene panel that included 62 cancer predisposition genes. Genomic signatures including tissue-based tumor mutation burden (tTMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) were also estimated from somatic mutation profiles.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The prevalence of germline P\/LP mutations in cancer predisposition genes was 20.6% for OC, 13.4% for EC, and 6.4% for CC. OC had the highest mutation rate in genes involved in the homologous recombination repair pathway (18.8%, 178\/945), while EC had the highest mutation rate in genes involved in mismatch repair (MMR) pathway (5.5%, 17\/307). The frequency of actionable germline P\/LP mutations was 19.8% for OC, 11.7% for EC, and 5.0% for CC. The detection rate for actionable somatic mutations were comparable between carrier and non-carrier of germline mutations (OC, 80.5% vs 76.3%, p=0.2; EC, 73.2% vs 80.5%, p=0.4; and CC, 56.5% vs 63.0%, p=0.7). tTMB was also comparable and generally low among carrier and non-carrier of germline mutations (OC, 3.0 [range: 2.0-5.0] vs 3.0 [2.0-5.0], p=0.9; EC, 6.2 [4.8-45.1] vs. 4.8 [2.8-13.2], p=0.1; and CC, 4.8 [2.4-6.0] vs 4.0 [2.4-7.9], p=0.8). The proportion of MSI-H was comparable for OC patients with or without germline mutations (2.6% vs 1.2%, p=0.2); however, the proportion of MSI-H was significantly higher for EC (29.3% vs 11.7%, p=0.019) and CC (13.0% vs 1.2%, p&#60;0.001) who were carriers of germline mutations than non-carriers. The proportion of MSI-H was comparable between EC patients with germline (n=5) and somatic (n=29) MMR gene mutations (40.0%, 2\/5 vs 48.3%, 14\/29; p=1). EC patients with MSI-H were more likely to have high tTMB (cut-off &#8805;7 mutations\/Mb) (p&#60;0.001).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: The comparable frequency of actionable somatic mutations in women with or without germline mutations indicates that both populations could benefit from NGS testing.

Previous studies with small sample sizes have shown that early-onset CRC appears to have a distinct clinical, pathologic, and molecular features compared to late-onset CRC (&#8805; 50 years of age). However, few studies in a large population have focused on the differences in germline gene mutation spectrums of these two groups of patients.<br \/>Methods: Hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed in 5080 colorectal patients in a CAP\/CLIA-approved laboratory (3DMed). NGS testing for germline mutations and MSI was implemented.<br \/>Results: Of 5080 colorectal patients, early-onset CRC was observed in 1305 (25.7%) patients. The incidence of germline mutation was higher in early-onset CRCs than late-onset CRCs (8.97% vs. 4.15%,OR=2.27, P&#60;0.0001). Consistently, the frequency of MSI-H was higher in early-onset CRCs (13.0% vs. 5.7% , OR=2.48, P&#60;0.0001). The most frequently mutated gene was MLH1 (3.07%) in early-onset CRCs, followed by MSH2 (1.69%), APC (1.0%), MSH6 (0.84%), PMS2 (0.38%), RAD50 (0.31%), CHEK2 (0.31%), MUTYH (0.23%), BRCA1 (0.23%), and BRCA2 (0.23%). The frequency of MMR gene mutations among early- and late-onset patients was 5.98% and 1.27%, respectively (OR=4.95, P&#60;0.0001). MMR gene mutations accounted for 60% of germline mutations of early-onset patients, while this percentage was lower for late-onset CRC (30%). Higher frequencies of APC, RAD50 and CHEK2 gene mutations were associated with early-onset CRCs (all P&#60;0.05). The mutation frequencies of other DDR genes, MUTYH, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ATR, FANCD2, TP53, were not statistically different between the two groups. The late-onset CRC tended to harbor a wider spectrum of germline cancer gene mutations, including an additional 14 cancer-related gene that were not found in early-onset CRC.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings revealed different prevalence and spectrum of germline cancer gene mutations between early-onset and late-onset CRC, suggesting that young patients should be specially considered.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/497b194a-aad9-49af-a70b-9b24d56c1fa4\/@F03B8ZTe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-14 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,germline mutation,Early-onset,Old-onset ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17942"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhidong Gao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Xin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bin Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peng Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kewei Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mujun Yin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaodong Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhanlong Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Depei Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingjiang Ye<\/i><\/presenter>.

Reduced diversity at HLA loci may adversely affect the host&#8217;s ability to recognize foreign antigens and tumor neoantigens, and subsequently, increase disease burden. To better understand the role of inherited HLA diversity in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, we utilized data from a population-based study of 10,347 participants (5,574 CRC cases and 4,773 healthy controls) from the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Study (MECC). Germline DNA samples were genotyped using genome-wide arrays, and HLA Class I and II four-digit resolution alleles were imputed using SNP2HLA and a reference panel of 5,225 individuals from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium. Heterozygosity and homozygosity at each HLA locus and the number of homozygous genotypes at class I loci (A, B, C) and class II loci (DQB1, DRB1, DPB1) were quantified. To examine the joint effect of Class I and Class II loci, we combined the total number of homozygotes for all loci and categorized into 3 groups: heterozygotes at all loci, 1 to 4 homozygotes, or 5 or more homozygotes. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of CRC associated with HLA locus homozygosity. Individuals with heterozygous genotypes for all loci served as the reference category, and analyses were adjusted for sex, age, genotyping platform, and global ancestry. Individuals with homozygous genotypes at all 3 Class I genes had an increased risk of CRC when compared to those with heterozygous genotypes at all Class I loci (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02-1.76, P = 0.033; P<sub>trend<\/sub> = 0.039). A similar association was observed for Class II loci, with an OR of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.05-1.65, P = 0.015; P<sub>trend<\/sub> = 0.157). For HLA Class I and II combined, individuals with five or more homozygous genotypes at HLA class I or II loci were at higher risk for developing CRC (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.24-2.73, P = 0.0023; P<sub>trend<\/sub> = 0.015), when compared to those with all heterozygous genotypes. Our findings support a heterozygote advantage at HLA class I and II loci as a protective factor for CRC. This indicates an important role for HLA genetic variability in the etiology of CRC potentially operating through a mechanism of decreased diversity of tumor neoantigens that can be displayed to the adaptive immune system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f7da18fe-8619-4386-bfcf-aa15245bd570\/@F03B8ZTe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,HLA class I,Risk factors,Genetic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17943"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ya-Yu Tsai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chenxu Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph D.

The study objective was to describe characteristics and treatment patterns of metastatic SS (mSS) patients receiving systemic treatments.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This was a retrospective observational cohort study in mSS patients treated in The US Oncology Network practices. Both EHR and chart review data from 2012-2019 were used. All mSS adult patients initiating systemic treatment as first-line (1L) therapy, with <u>&#62;<\/u>2 visits were included. Patients diagnosed with or treated for other primary tumors were excluded. Demographic and clinical characteristics were reported based on index date (date of first systemic treatment initiation in the metastatic setting). Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) and time to next treatment (TTNT) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 39 adult mSS patients were identified receiving 1L systemic treatment. Of these, 25 went on to receive a 2L treatment (64%), and 16 went on to receive 3L+ treatment (41%) during the study observation period. Median age was 41.0 years, 74% male, 70% Caucasian. 25% had metastatic disease at original diagnosis of SS (vs. localized disease). 87% had metastases to lung, 25% had &#62;1 site of metastasis. See Table 1 for treatment distributions by line and for TTD and TTNT.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This study provides information on treatment patterns for mSS patients treated across multiple institutions within a US community oncology setting. About 2\/3 of mSS patients received 2L systemic treatments. While doxorubicin and ifosfamide regimens were most common in 1L, variability exists in the 2L and onward settings, with ifosfamide and pazopanib being more frequently used than in earlier lines. Additionally, shorter TTD and TTNT with each subsequent line of therapy documents the need for effective treatment options in the 2L+ setting that can further delay progression.<br \/><b>Funding:<\/b> GSK [208280]<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{6418CEA1-F1D9-4074-A32F-C19A66921045}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Distribution of treatments by line<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median time to discontinuation in months<\/b><b>(95% CI)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median time to next treatment in months<\/b><b>(95% CI)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><b>1L systemic treatment (n=39)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Doxorubicin + Ifosfamide containing regimen<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 (35.90%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\">3.9 (2.2, 5.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\">9.3 (6.2, 11.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pazopanib alone or in combination<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (17.95%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Docetaxel + gemcitabine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (15.38%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ifosfamide monotherapy<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (15.38%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Doxorubicin + olaratumab combination<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other treatment regimens including gemcitabine, trabectedin, and investigational drugs (not related to SS)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><b>2L systemic treatment (n=25)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ifosfamide alone or in combination<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (28.00%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"5\" colspan=\"1\">3.6 (1.5, 6.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"5\" colspan=\"1\">6.7 (4.4, 11.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pazopanib alone or in combination<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (28.00%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"5\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Doxorubicin containing regimen<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gemcitabine alone or in combination<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Others including cisplatin containing regimen, trabectedin<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><b>3L+ systemic treatment (n=31 among 16 patients)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Chemotherapy monotherapy*<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (41.94%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"1\">2.7 (1.0, 3.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"1\">4.6 (1.5, 9.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pazopanib alone or in combination<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9 (29.03%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ifosfamide alone or in combination<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (16.13%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Chemotherapy combination (other than with pazopanib or ifosfamide)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">*Includes dacarbazine, doxorubicin, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, IL-2, temozolomide, vinorelbine.1L, first-line therapy; 2L, second-line therapy; 3L, third-line therapy; IL-2, interleukin-2.Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD; in months) was calculated as the time interval between the initiation of each line of therapy and the last administration of that line, if there was a record of discontinuation, death or movement to the next treatment, or last administration date of the treatment if &#8805;120 days before the last visit date.

We sought to validate the MIA nomogram against the University of Pittsburgh SPORE database. The secondary aim was to assess whether the addition of the degree of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and location of the primary melanoma increases the predictive value of the nomogram.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients were managed in the Melanoma Center of the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) and the Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) SPORE Database. The status of SLN, primary location and degree of TIL infiltration, and the parameters adopted by the MIA nomogram including age, histological type, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were recorded from the electronic medical record. The MIA nomogram performance was evaluated by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for the most accurate cut-off value. Logistic regression was used to assess the effects of TIL and the location of melanoma.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In total, 68 patients were assessed, 44 (64.7%) with negative SLN, and 24 (35.3%) with positive SLN. The median age (interquartile range, IQR) was 60.5 years (49.8, 68.3). The most common histological subtype was nodular n=43 (63.2%) followed by 18 (26.5%) superficial spreading, 4 (5.8%) lentigo maligna, and 3 (4.5%) desmoplastic. Median Breslow thickness (IQR) was 3.9 mm (3.0-5.1). Ulceration was present in 47 (69.1%), and 14 (20.6%) had a LVI identified.

TIL was absent, non-brisk, and brisk in 16 (23.5%), 40 (58.9%), 12 (17.6%) of cases, respectively. Location for 32 (47.6) was the trunk, 29 (42.6%) the extremities, and 7 (10.3%) the head and neck area. The AUC was 72% with 95% CI (58%-85%). At the most accurate cutoff value the MIA nomogram had 54% sensitivity, 84% specificity, 65% positive predictive value, 77% negative predictive value, and 74% accuracy. Location of melanoma and TIL did not demonstrate any significant predictive value beyond the risk score (p=0.24 and p=0.92, respectively).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The MIA nomogram demonstrated only fair predictive value.

Advances in breast imaging and machine learning have enabled evaluation of radiomic markers from mammography imaging with respect to breast cancer risk. Identification of radiomic markers associated with short term risk of breast cancer would be useful to direct supplemental screening. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of mammographic imaging features beyond breast density to predict screening failure using machine learning.<br \/>Methods: We utilized full-field digital mammography (FFDM) studies from a cohort of women aged 40-85 who had a negative screening mammogram at the University of Pennsylvania Health System from 2010 - 2015. <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> carriers, women with prior breast cancer, and women with breast implants were excluded. We identified 125 breast cancer cases diagnosed within 2 years of a negative mammogram whom we matched to controls not diagnosed with breast cancer within 2 years in a 1:5 ratio on BI-RADS breast density category, age, race, and screening date, resulting in a total of 750 FFDM studies. For each FFDM image, a total of 344 radiomic features were extracted using a previously validated lattice-based computational approach for parenchymal pattern characterization. Radiomic features were summarized across both breasts and across mammographic image views (CC and MLO) using means and standard deviations of radiomic features. Principal component analysis was applied to z-score normalized radiomic features and four principal components (PCs) were retained. Widely used machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs), were applied. The performance of the machine learning models in predicting screening failure on the basis of the radiomic PCs was evaluated via cross-validated calculations of the area under the ROC curve (AUC).<br \/>Results: Upon fine-tuning, SVM models using the mean summaries of radiomic features demonstrated a cross-validated case-control discriminatory capacity of AUC = 0.61 (95% CI 0.52, 0.68) while RFs did not achieve significant performance (AUC = 0.53, 95% CI 0.45, 0.60). Neither SVM models, nor RFs achieved significant predictive performance as measured by the cross-validated AUC when the standard deviation summaries of radiomic features was used.<br \/>Conclusions: Given that BI-RADS density is the standard measure of breast density used clinically to direct supplemental screening, measuring the performance of radiomic features beyond BI-RADS provides the most clinically useful findings. In this small sample, our results suggest that mammographic radiomic features provided only moderate discriminatory accuracy, when BI-RADS density, age, race, and screening date were controlled for via matching.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/64f44015-9b50-46a2-8c0b-4609cc487741\/@F03B8ZTe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast density,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17948"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Aimilia Gastounioti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Ehsan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Walter Mankowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily F.

Data on birth characteristics including gestational age, sex, birthweight, birth order, pregnancy complications (e.g., eclampsia, toxemia, diabetes), mode of delivery, and parental ages were retrieved from birth records maintained by the California Department of Public Health. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from an unconditional multivariable logistic regression model that included year of birth and birth characteristics.<br \/>Results: A higher birthweight was associated with a significantly lower risk of EO-MPN (age at diagnosis: 0-37 years), and the OR for the birthweight z-score was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78-0.98). Individuals whose mothers experienced complications during pregnancy had a higher EO-MPN risk (OR=1.54, 95% CI: 1.08-2.19). Compared to individuals born to mothers at the age of 25-29 years, those born to mothers &#8805;35 years had a significantly increased risk of EO-MPN (OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.09-2.47). Stratified analyses by MPN subtype identified male sex and pre-term birth as risk factors for PV, and lower birthweight, complications during pregnancy, and older paternal age as risk factors for ET. Associations between birth characteristics and risk of EO-MPN also exhibited variations based on age of diagnosis, with lower birthweight being a risk factor for those diagnosed at 0-19 years (n=71 cases) and pregnancy complications being a risk factor for those diagnosed at 20-37 years (n=148 cases).<br \/>Conclusion: In this first-ever population-based study that examined EO-MPN, our findings support a role of birth characteristics in the etiology of this rare phenotype and underscore etiological heterogeneity by MPN subtype and age of diagnosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4d0529d4-da4d-4c04-af07-353e29732145\/@o03B8ZTf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-24 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Risk factors,Case-control study,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17951"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nikolai A.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found &#62;200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer risk, with many SNPs differentially associated with ER status or intrinsic subtype. We hypothesized that some of these SNPs are preferentially associated with more proliferative tumors, while others are preferentially associated with less proliferative tumors. In this study, we aimed to build a polygenic risk score (PRS) predictive of proliferative tumors, using the GWAS-identified SNPs.<br \/>Methods: We used data from 3 studies that included array-based SNP genotyping and tumor transcriptomic data: The Cancer Genome Atlas, METABRIC, and the I-SPY 2 Trial (total n=2,467). Our outcome was the risk of recurrence score weighted on proliferation (ROR-P), a validated tumor prognostic signature. Using the breast cancer risk SNPs, we built respective linear regression models to predict ROR-P, with genetic ancestry, study, and ER status as covariates. We performed 5-fold cross-validation and used the model r<sup>2<\/sup> to identify the optimal p-value threshold for including SNPs in the PRS. To decrease uncertainty of our estimates, we performed 100 repeats across the pooled datasets. To test whether this model predicted poor prognosis breast cancers, we first used it to impute ROR-P among genotyped breast cancer cases in UK Biobank (UKB). We then examined the association between &#8220;genetically predicted&#8221; ROR-P and breast cancer-specific survival using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for genetic ancestry and age at diagnosis.<br \/>Results: Associations between 224 breast cancer SNPs and ROR-P were tested. The best-performing model in cross-validation contained 96 SNPs, each associated with ROR-P at p &#60; 0.45, with model r<sup>2<\/sup> 0.054. The SNPs with the strongest positive correlations with ROR-P included those discovered in GWAS for HER2-positive and ER-negative cancers, both of which tend to be highly proliferative. Among 7,247 incident cancers in UKB, higher genetically predicted ROR-P was associated with shorter survival, with a per-standard deviation hazard ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.05-1.24, p = 0.002).<br \/>Conclusions: We used breast cancer susceptibility SNPs to construct a PRS fitted to ROR-P, a prognostic signature recapitulating tumor proliferation. This PRS was associated with worse clinical outcomes in breast cancer cases from UKB. Our results suggest that correlations between SNPs and tumor gene expression can be used to &#8220;tune&#8221; PRS to tumor phenotype, e.g. proliferation. Highly proliferative tumors are more likely to present as advanced cancers even among women getting routine screening. If replicated in other datasets, our findings could be used to identify women who may especially benefit from tailored screening and prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9b4f94dc-57ce-4a2d-bb04-587d4a991f2d\/@o03B8ZTf\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-20 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Genetic polymorphism,Risk factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18380"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yiwey Shieh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacquelyn Roger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Huntsman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donglei Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jovia L.

This may be due, in part, to the fact that BMI is an imperfect measure of body fat as BMI does not distinguish weight from lean muscle versus adipose tissue. Here, we investigated the association of adiposity measured by computed tomography (CT) with survival among the most common histotype of ovarian cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). The present study included 383 women diagnosed with HGSOC from 2008 to 2019 who were evaluated at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute and had pre-treatment computed tomography scans available for analysis. The sliceOmatic v5.0 rev13 (Tomovision, Magog, Canada) medical image analysis software and accompanying ABACS module for segmentation was used to quantify subcutaneous (SAT), visceral (VAT), and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) from the third lumbar (L3) axial slice including the transverse processes. We used Cox proportional hazard regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of each measure of adiposity with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) while adjusting for age at diagnosis, stage, race and ethnicity, and first-line treatment. The degree of ascites was included in the VAT models as ascites fluid density can mask VAT. We also assessed these associations within first-line treatment groups (upfront chemotherapy [n=147], upfront surgery [n=236]). In the overall study population, we observed a positive but not statistically significant association with OS and RFS for the highest vs. lowest tertile of IMAT (HR= 1.18, 95% CI=0.83, 1.67 and HR=1.16, 95% CI=0.85, 1.58, respectively). Among women who received upfront surgery, the highest tertile of IMAT was associated with a 57% increased risk of recurrence compared to the lowest tertile (HR=1.57, 95% CI=1.04, 2.37), while the association between IMAT and OS was similar to the findings in the overall population (HR=1.14, 95% CI=0.73, 1.78). No association was observed between IMAT and OS or RFS among women who received upfront chemotherapy. No associations with OS or RFS were observed for SAT or VAT overall or within first-line treatment groups. In summary, we observed inferior RFS among HGSOC patients with higher IMAT. These findings suggest that IMAT measured from standard-of-care imaging may represent a biomarker of recurrence among HGSOC patients, and incorporating lifestyle and behavioral changes (e.g., diet, exercise) to decrease IMAT may be warranted for this patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/accb7caa-695a-49c5-bc14-9d1b38089ec7\/@o03B8ZTf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Body size,Survival,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18855"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christelle Colin-Leitzinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahmoud Abdalah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rikki Cannioto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing-Yi Chern<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evan Davis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Gillies<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa McGettigan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaileene Perez-Morales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natarajan Raghunand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sweta Sinha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olya Stringfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajwantee Tirbene<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Schabath<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lauren C.

To understand potential reasons for this, we examined associations of tumor-infiltrating B cells and T cells, including sub-populations defined by expression of immune checkpoints and T cell exhaustion markers, with survival in three epidemiologic studies. Analyses included participants in the Nurses&#8217; Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and New England Case-control study who were diagnosed with stage 1-3 HGSC for whom tumor tissue was obtained. B cells (CD19, CD20, CD138), T cells (CD3), and T cell subpopulations (CD3 co-localized with CD8, CD4, PD1, PDL1, LAG3, TIM3) were measured using multiplex immunofluorescence assays performed on tissue microarray slides containing 3 cores per case. For each participant, we summed counts of immune cells infiltrating the tumor and total tumor cells across cores. Counts of immune cell subpopulations were adjusted for the parent cell count using residuals from beta-binomial models. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall mortality according to presence\/absence or quantiles of immune cells were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for age at diagnosis, diagnosis year, stage, study, and total tumor cell count. Among 389 women with HGSC, presence vs. absence of CD19+ B cells was suggestively associated with lower mortality (HR 0.79, 95%CI:0.61-1.01); similar associations were observed for CD19-adjusted CD20+ B cells and CD138+ plasma cells (HRs 0.75-0.78, quintile 5 vs. 1).Higher total T cells was associated with improved survival (HR 0.67, 95%CI:0.45-0.99, quintile 5vs. 1). Similar reduced risks were observed with high levels of both CD19+ B cells and CD3+ T cells (HR 0.66) or high levels of one cell type (HRs 0.65-0.75) compared with low levels of both. For the two primary T cell subfractions, lower risk was observed with higher CD3-adjustedCD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (HRs 0.68, 0.73, 0.69, 0.59 for quintiles 2-5 vs. 1), but notCD3+CD4+ helper T cells (HR 0.97, 95%CI: 0.72-1.31, tertile 3 vs. 1). T cells with immune checkpoint markers (PD1, PDL1) and\/or markers of T-cell exhaustion (LAG3, TIM3) generally were not associated with mortality or tended to be associated with lower mortality risk, with a significant inverse association observed for CD3-adjusted CD3+PD1+TIM3- cells (HR 0.61,95%CI:0.41-0.92, quintile 5 vs. 1).Overall, higher levels of B cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells in tumor were associated with improved outcomes, consistent with other studies. Congruent with the apparent ineffectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in ovarian cancer, our results do not support that T cells expressing immune checkpoint and\/or T cell exhaustion markers are related to worse outcome among women with HGSC. Future analyses will consider multiple cell types simultaneously and the stroma compartment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ab296aa3-1bc2-469d-a19e-1c5b0118b2e2\/@o03B8ZTf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survival,Immune cells,Epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18856"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shelley S.

We used joinpoint regression to compute annual percent changes (APC) and average annual percent changes (AAPC) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both sexes and used eleven 5-year age groups (35-39 years through 85+ years). Race\/ethnic groups were classified as non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks (NHWs and NHBs), Hispanics, American Indians\/Alaska Natives, and Asians and Pacific Islanders.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Overall, the age-standardized incidence rate for GBC decreased by 0.3% annually between 2001 and 2018 (95% CI -0.5%, -0.1%).

APC increased among individuals aged 45-54 years from 1.2% to 1.4% but decreased among those who were &#8805; 75 years (-0.7% to -1.6% per year). While GBC incidence rates were stable among men between 2001 and 2014, incidence rates decreased by over 2% per year between 2014 and 2018 (APC, -2.1%; 95%CI: -3.9, -0.3). GBC incidence remained relatively stable between 2001 and 2018 among women.

Women who experience longitudinal decreases in breast density have a reduced risk of breast cancer; however, besides age, which correlates with decreases in breast density, it is unclear what other factors contribute to changes in breast density over time. Understanding factors associated with density changes may enable a better understanding of breast cancer risk and potential strategies for prevention. This study investigated factors associated with changes in mammographic density in a cohort of 3,392 postmenopausal women (mean age=61.3&#177;8.8 years) with no history of breast cancer who had at least two mammograms spaced at least three months apart at a University of California, Irvine Health breast imaging facility between 2011-2017. Self-reported information on demographics, breast and reproductive history, and lifestyle factors, including body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, smoking, and physical activity, was collected by an electronic intake form, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS) mammographic density scores were obtained from electronic medical records. 7.9% of women exhibited a longitudinal decrease in mammographic density, 6.7% exhibited an increase, and 85.4% exhibited no change. Longitudinal changes in mammographic density were statistically significantly correlated with age, race\/ethnicity, and age at menopause by univariate analysis using the Fisher&#8217;s exact test. Multivariate conditional logistic regression using baseline mammographic density as strata was performed to identify factors associated with a longitudinal increase or decrease in mammographic density. Variables were selected if they were nominally significant (p &#60; 0.10) in the initial univariate analyses of women who exhibited a longitudinal change in mammographic density (race\/ethnicity, age at baseline, menopause age) or were otherwise selected a priori based on previous literature showing an association with mammographic density (alcohol, physical activity, BMI). Asian women were more likely to exhibit a longitudinal increase in mammographic density (OR=1.78, 95% CI=1.02-3.09, p=0.04) and less likely to exhibit a decrease (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.40-0.83, p=0.003) compared to white women.

Considerable evidence suggests a beneficial effect of analgesics, and especially aspirin, on cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer risk. Studies examining whether widely used analgesics - aspirin, non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and acetaminophen - play a role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have yielded mixed results.<br \/>Methods: We examined associations between pre-diagnostic analgesic use and incidence of total and fatal RCC in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; 1986-2016), Nurses&#8217; Health Study (NHS; 1980-2016 for aspirin; 1990-2016 for non-aspirin NSAIDs and acetaminophen), and Nurses&#8217; Health Study 2 (NHS2; 1989-2015; total RCC only). Information on use of aspirin, non-aspirin NSAIDs, and acetaminophen was collected longitudinally on biennial questionnaires. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate cohort-specific, multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to current use (updated in each questionnaire period) and, separately, duration of use (since study baseline) of each analgesic. Results across cohorts were combined using random-effects meta-analyses. We also used Cox regression to evaluate post-diagnostic analgesic use with respect to RCC-specific mortality among RCC cases in the pooled HPFS and NHS cohorts.<br \/>Results: Among 259,545 participants, 796 incident RCC cases were diagnosed. Neither current nor duration of pre-diagnostic use of any of the analgesics was associated with the risk of total RCC in meta-analyses of the three study cohorts. For fatal RCC (n=175 cases), however, meta-analyses of the HPFS and NHS suggested covariate-adjusted positive associations with current (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.96-1.96, p-heterogeneity: 0.80) and duration of (HR<sub>&#62;10yrs vs. Never<\/sub>: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.23-5.58, p-trend: 0.006, p-heterogeneity: 0.30) pre-diagnostic non-aspirin NSAID use. In addition, in the HPFS only, current (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.33-4.17) and duration of (HR<sub>&#62;10yrs vs. Never<\/sub>: 1.83, 95% CI: 0.42-7.93, p-trend: 0.07) pre-diagnostic acetaminophen use indicated positive associations with fatal RCC. Analyses of RCC-specific mortality among participants diagnosed with RCC demonstrated an inverse association with current post-diagnostic aspirin use (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48-0.97), but not duration of post-diagnostic aspirin use (HR<sub>&#62;10yrs vs. Never<\/sub>: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.53-1.51, p-trend: 0.98). Analgesics were not otherwise associated with RCC survival.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings support a potential positive association between non-aspirin NSAID use and incident fatal RCC. It remains possible that analgesics may operate differently in the setting of RCC from the context of other chronic diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b381d37a-3e73-46aa-b83b-1ee35d72a80b\/@p03B8ZTg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Epidemiology,Aspirin,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18862"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rebecca E.

Furthermore, <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies found MCFAs have strong anticarcinogenic properties. Recent evidence reveals MCFAs inhibits aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells. It is conceivable that MCFAs have an &#8220;anti-Warburg effect&#8221;. In a double-blind randomized trial (Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer; NCT01105169), we found that 12-week personalized magnesium (Mg) supplementation led to significantly increased circulating levels of MCFAs, particularly caprylic acid (C8:0), which was due to enhanced microbial production. These novel findings suggest individuals with Mg sufficiency can receive supplies of MCFAs from microbiome whereas people with Mg deficiency cannot and so need MCFAs from intake. Thus, we hypothesized that the associations between intakes of C8:0 and risk of cancer mortality are modified by body Mg status. We tested this hypothesis in the NHANES, a nationally representative study. We recently developed the Mg depletion score (MDS) to assess Mg status and validated it against the invasive gold standard measure of Mg status. MDS performs better than either serum Mg or Mg intake at predicting Mg deficiency. We also found higher Mg intake was associated with reduced risks of inflammation and total mortality only among those with higher MDS scores, i.e., higher risk of losing Mg in the kidney. Thus, we examined if MDS modified the associations between intakes of MCFAs and risk of cancer mortality. Among 11,890 US adults aged &#8805;20 years over a median follow-up of 70 person-months, the associations between C8:0 intake and cancer mortality risk differed by MDS (<i>P<\/i><sub>interaction<\/sub>=0.12). Higher C8:0 intake was associated with increased cancer mortality risk when MDS=0 (no risk of losing Mg; <i>P<\/i><sub>-trend<\/sub>=0.03) after adjusting for all covariates, including dairy product intake. C8:0 intake was not related to risk of cancer mortality when MDS=1. Conversely, C8:0 intake may be associated with a reduced cancer mortality risk among those with MDS&#62;1(high risk of losing Mg). In particular, higher C8:0 intake was significantly associated with a reduced risk of cancer mortality (<i>P<\/i><sub>-trend<\/sub>&#60;0.01) with an HR (95% CI) of 0.11 (0.02-0.84) for the highest quartile of C8:0 intake when Mg intake was above the Estimated Average Requirement. No associations were found for intakes of C6:0, C10:0 and C12:0. In summary, C8:0 can be generated by human gut microbiome through optimized Mg consumption; dietary intakes of C8:0 were associated with a reduced risk of cancer mortality among those at high risk of losing Mg, but with adequate Mg consumption; and intakes of C8:0 were related to an increased risk of cancer mortality among those with no risk of losing Mg.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00293319-a993-4c89-a8f5-a0505dfc1041\/@p03B8ZTg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Magnesium,Medium-chain fatty acids,Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18863"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lei Fan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangzhu Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Shingina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lihua Shu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martha Shrubsole<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Dai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Emerging evidence also suggests that arsenic exposure may be a risk factor for breast and other cancers. Previous studies have been conducted in populations with endemically high levels of arsenic; however, the impact of chronic exposure to low levels is not known. Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe the arsenic exposure in Canadian adults and to evaluate the association between arsenic status and cancer risk.<br \/>Methods: The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) is an ongoing, nationally representative survey that collects self-reported and objective health measures, including biomonitoring data, from participants in biennial cycles. This analysis utilized total, inorganic and organic urinary arsenic biomarkers (&#181;g\/L) from Cycles 1-5 (2007-2017) of the CHMS. Incident cancers were ascertained through a linkage to the Canadian Cancer Registry. Arsenic exposure was described using weighted percentiles, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between arsenic exposure and cancer risk (overall and site-specific).<br \/>Results: This analysis included 10,000 individuals, aged 18-80. The median total urinary arsenic level was 7.5 ug\/g of creatinine. Preliminary models showed that levels of inorganic arsenic exposure above the geometric mean (&#62; 4.5 &#181;g\/L) were associated with a 3-fold increased risk of developing any cancer (HR = 3.58; 95%CI 1.63-7.85), compared to those with lower levels. Site-specific risk modelling is ongoing and preliminary results will be presented.<br \/>Significance: This study found inorganic arsenic exposure may be associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. To our knowledge, this study is the first to ascertain national estimates of arsenic exposure and provide insight on the relationship between arsenic exposure and cancer risk in Canadian adults. These findings are critical for developing population-level interventions to reduce the Canadian, and global, cancer burden.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/504c1b1f-c84e-4326-9e22-f4d9c27a26aa\/@p03B8ZTg\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Environmental exposure,Biomarkers,Epidemiology,Population Health,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18864"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katherine Pullella<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vicky C.

Dysregulation of the receptor activator of nuclear factor &#954;B (RANK) pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <i>BRCA1<\/i>-associated breast cancer. In addition, lower levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG), the decoy receptor for RANK-ligand, have been reported among women with a <i>BRCA1 <\/i>mutation and may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Thus, inhibition of RANK signaling represents a potential target for prevention, and furthermore, OPG levels may be a biomarker of subsequent cancer risk. Whether non-genetic exposures also influence circulating levels of OPG in these high-risk women is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate reproductive, hormonal, and lifestyle correlates of OPG levels in <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutation carriers.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Eligible women included <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutation carriers enrolled in a longitudinal study, aged 18 years or older, without a history of cancer, and with a serum sample available. All women completed a baseline questionnaire at the time of enrolment and a follow-up questionnaire every two years thereafter to collect detailed information on various exposures (i.e., reproductive, hormonal, and lifestyle) and outcomes. Serum OPG levels (pg\/ml) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the associations of various reproductive, hormonal, and lifestyle exposures at the time of blood collection with serum OPG and to estimate adjusted means.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: A total of 828 women were included in the current analysis. Older age was associated with significantly higher OPG levels (&#60;50 vs. &#62;60 years, 79.04 vs. 82.01 pg\/ml; <i>P<\/i><sub>trend <\/sub>&#60; 0.0001). Current vs. never smoking was also associated with significantly higher OPG levels (87.69 vs. 73.48 pg\/ml; <i>P<\/i><sub>cat<i> <\/i><\/sub>&#60; 0.0001). There were no significant associations between other exposures and levels of OPG (<i>P<\/i> &#8805; 0.17). Findings were similar in the analyses stratified by menopausal status.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: The results from this study suggest that non-genetic factors likely have a minimal impact upon serum OPG among women with a <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutation. Further studies are needed to explore other potential correlates of OPG (i.e., diet, supplement use) and to elucidate whether integration of circulating OPG levels may improve existing risk prediction models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9c8467aa-6a48-4249-9bf7-714c9d4e8b62\/@p03B8ZTg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA1,Breast cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18865"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah S.

This can benefit patients and their relatives through cascade testing (CT), preventing many cancer-related deaths. We explored the impact of this strategy for tumor profiling on cancer syndrome diagnosis.<br \/>Methods: The Tumor Profiling Lab (TPL) sequences cancer specimens and matched normal tissue using the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay (ThermoFisher). A protocol was implemented between the TPL and the Cancer Genetics and Prevention Program (CGPP) by which a notification was sent to oncologists and the CGPP when a PGV was identified. The notification highlights the finding and facilitates referral to CGPP. Our analysis includes data from 1\/2018 to 7\/2021. Primary outcome: identification of PGV. Secondary outcomes: patients referred and seen by CGPP, and advised for CT.<br \/>Results: A total of 123 (6.35%) patients with over 20 cancer types had a PGV; for 85 (69.1%) this was a new finding. 36 of the 85 (42.4%) were referred to CGPP and of those, 24 (66.7%) were seen and advised for CT. 4 patients with newly diagnosed PGV had already been seen by CGPP, but either had not undergone genetic testing or had not been tested for the gene in which a PGV was later found. Of the 123 patients with PGV, 74 were not seen by CGPP. 33 (44%) were advised by their oncologist regarding CT for relatives. In total, among patients with newly diagnosed PGV, 51 (60%) were advised for CT.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>2\/3 of cancer patients in whom paired tumor\/normal sequencing analysis identified a PGV had not been previously diagnosed with an inherited cancer syndrome by standard of care approaches. Identification of a PGV resulted in CT advice for 60% of these patients, with hundreds of family members potentially benefitting from preventive measures. Creating more streamlined systems for notifying relatives can result even in greater benefit by reaching more individuals.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{FEB4AE58-8171-4D78-8D9C-38BBC644BCFE}\"><caption>Baseline demographics<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Table 1<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>N = 123<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Age at tumor testing<\/b>, mean (range)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">60.4 (10-90)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Gender<\/b>, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Female<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">62 (50.4)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Male<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">61 (49.6)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Stage at tumor testing<\/b>, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Stage IV<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">103 (83.7)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Stage I-III<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20 (16.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Known PGV<\/b>, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Known<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">38 (30.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">New<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">85 (69.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Referral to CGPP<\/b>, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Referred<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">37 (30.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not Referred<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">61 (49.6)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A (known to a cancer genetics program*)<br>*22 known to CGPP; 3 known to outside programs<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25 (20.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Seen by CGPP<\/b>, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Seen<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">49 (39.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not Seen<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">74 (60.2)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Days from referral to visit<\/b>, median (range)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17 (1-217)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Advised for CT (including seen by CGPP)**<\/b>, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Advised<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">81 (65.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not advised<br>** One patient seen before tumor testing; no identifiable mutation at that visit.

However, in 40-60% of patients the germline driver is unknown.<br \/>Methods: Through whole exome sequencing, an individual with high polyp burden and negative genetic testing for variants in SMAD4 and BMPR1A was found to have a potentially inactivating germline variant in BMPR2. Under an IRB-approved protocol, patient-derived, three-dimensional organoids were established from adjacent colon and polyp tissue of this individual, as well as an individual with a BMPR1A deletion and age- and sex-matched controls. Proliferation, metabolic activity, and protein expression of each line were measured by Western blot, Ki67 staining, EdU labelling, cell titer glo (CTG) assay. Results: Distinct phenotypic differences are evident between colonoids from an individual with a BMPR1A deletion and both the colon and polyp BMPR2 variant colonoids, such as increased crypt budding and Ki67 staining. CTG assay data indicate higher metabolic activity in BMPR2 variant colonoids in comparison to normal controls (p= 0.0104.) Through Western blot analysis, both BMPR2 colon and polyp colonoids showed decreased SMAD4 expression and phosphorylation.<br \/>Conclusions: These data demonstrate that clear phenotypic differences exist between colonoid lines established from normal controls, individuals with known JPS predisposition genes, and a novel candidate driver of disease, <i>BMPR2<\/i>. Proliferation and protein expression data suggest that both known and candidate genotypes are consistent with a hyperproliferative phenotype. <i>In vitro<\/i> data support <i>BMPR2<\/i> as a candidate germline driver of the JPS phenotype, and additional study is ongoing regarding downstream pathway regulation in colonoids with a <i>BMPR2 <\/i>variant.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/469a2a3c-09c5-4a83-a9c7-2e445416975e\/@p03B8ZTg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hereditary cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18867"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"a04c3db3-0b94-4fb7-9ade-4c8b8b2b1265","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a04c3db3-0b94-4fb7-9ade-4c8b8b2b1265\/@p03B8ZTg\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Suzanne P.

Both families present variants of uncertain significance (VUS), that could be pathogenic, but show incomplete penetrance. GC is the leading cause of cancer-related death in Chile. Worldwide, about ten percent of gastric cancer have a familial aggregation and in Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC), E-Cadherine 1 gene (<i>CDH1<\/i>) and alpha-E-catenin gene (CTNNA1) are the most commonly mutated genes. To our knowledge, only one HDGC Chilean family with a pathogenic <i>CDH1<\/i> mutation has been reported, suggesting a low frequency of <i>CDH1<\/i> mutations in this population. The index patient of the first family had a diffuse GC at age 59-y. His father and paternal grandfather also died of GC. A CDH1 germline variant c.88C&#62;A in (p.Pro30Thr, rs139866691) was found previously in the index patient by Sanger sequencing. Variant genotyping in available family members showed that two non-affected sisters were carriers. In the second family, there were eleven members affected with GC and two with breast cancer. The index patient was diagnosed with a tubular\/intestinal gastric tumor at 51y of age and had a brother who died of GC at 38y. Cancer gene panel sequencing was performed in index patient DNA and cascade genotyping in family members was performed using Kompetitive allele-specific PCR. A germline variant c.293G&#62;A (p.R98Q, rs746832629) in the <i>CTNNA1<\/i> gene was found in the index patient. We searched the variant in other members of the family and carried out a co-segregation analysis, that indicates an incomplete penetrance of the variant because two non-affected brothers do have it. Additionally, one affected sister did not carry the variant, but her tumor sample&#180;s histology is papillary, the most frequent type in sporadic CG and her age of onset was 60-y. Both rs139866691 and rs746832629 are located in conserved structures of their coding proteins. rs139866691 maps to a conserved loop in the E-Cadherin 1 preprotein domain and rs746832629 maps to the first alpha-helix of alpha-E-catenin corresponding to the beta-catenin binding domain. Based on our data, we believe that both variants are likely pathogenic and causative of the hereditary GC observed in these families but show incomplete penetrance. To search for additional candidate pathogenic variants, we recently completed whole-exome sequencing in the index cases from the two available affected cases of the second family and we found other candidate genes reported in breast cancer and related with nitroso compound metabolism. We are searching for the second hit in the second family index patient&#180;s tumor sample and performing isogenic models and functional analysis of rs139866691 and rs746832629 to clarify their pathogenicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e34c20ef-7310-4274-8777-fa83be0beff7\/@p03B8ZTg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Hereditary cancer,Mutations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18868"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Graciela Molina<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carol Parra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole B Halmai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana P Estrada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alma Poceros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Lott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rasika Venkatesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enrique Norero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Osvaldo Torres<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro Corvalán<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Carvajal-Carmona<\/i><\/presenter>.

TWAS approaches such as S-PrediXcan, FUSION and TIGAR, show comparable overall performance for susceptibility gene discovery; however, integrating prior disease-specific regulatory information is lacking. To improve accuracy of gene expression prediction by integrating information on susceptible transcription factor (sTF) occupancy in target cells and tissues, we developed an analytical framework, called sTF-TWAS. We evaluated six sets of putative regulatory variants selected from sTF-occupied sites, and performed generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) analysis to combine sets and quantify overall associations. We demonstrated that sTF-TWAS outperforms S-PrediXcan in both simulation and real data analyses. Using summary statistics data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), we also incorporated alternative splicing (sp) data in TF-TWAS and identified 76 and 88 significant genes for breast cancer risk at a Bonferroni-corrected <i>P<\/i> &#60;0.05 from sTF-TWAS and sp-sTF-TWAS, respectively. Of 153 putative susceptibility genes from both sTF-TWAS and sp-sTF-TWAS, 14 genes in 12 loci had novel associations with breast cancer risk and 90 genes were previously unreported by breast cancer GWAS.

Incidental or secondary findings are often uncovered at the time of germline sequencing. Current guidelines focus on secondary findings as they relate to inherited cancer predisposition. However, sequencing done on the PB has the potential of uncovering cancer-associated somatic variants. Somatic variants in genes associated with hematologic malignancies could indicate the presence of clonal hematopoiesis, clonal cytopenias or in rare instances an undiagnosed hematologic malignancy. In this abstract, we describe leukemia-associated somatic variants identified through whole exome sequencing (WES) in the PB of genomic research participants. A total of 24 patients with clonal hematopoiesis were identified from our institutional cohort of the ORIEN avatar study of 807 patients with solid tumors. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were selected from protein coding sequences and splice sites of 64 genes involved in hematologic malignancies. Matched tumor and PB samples allowed for inclusion of variants found exclusively in the PB sample. Chart reviews were performed, and blood indices were collected for patients with clonal hematopoiesis variants. The median age of patients in this cohort was 73 years old (range 42-82) and 54% (n=13) were still living at the time of chart review. There were 27 variants distributed amongst 24 patients with 8% (n=2) of patients having 2 or more variants identified. The median reported variant allele frequencies (VAF) was 0.447. Most variants were missense (n=14) followed by stop gain (n=5), frameshift (n=3), splice site (n=3), stop lost (n=1), and inframe insertion (n=1). <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>DNMT3A<\/i> (n=4) variants were identified most frequently followed by <i>JAK2, KRAS,<\/i> <i>MYD88<\/i> (n=3), and <i>PTEN<\/i> (n=2). The rest of the genes accounted for one variant each, including <i>TET2<\/i> and <i>IDH2.<\/i> Complete blood count (CBC) values were recorded for WBC, Hgb, MCV, RDW, platelets, and ANC, 79% (n=19) of patients had abnormal CBCs. No patients in this cohort were seen by a hematologist. Our results indicate that approximately 3% of patients identified in a research based solid tumor cohort had clonal hematopoiesis. Most of these patients had abnormalities in their hematologic parameters and would likely benefit from referral to hematology. Our data demonstrate the importance of considering somatic variation when the PB is used as germline tissue in research settings. Clonal hematopoiesis has significant clinical consequences ranging from risk of blood cancers to cardiovascular disease. We argue for the need to establish accepted frameworks for identification and evaluation of clonal hematopoiesis in participants of genomics research. Further analysis of associations between incidence of CHIP, cancer type, and prior treatment are underway","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b9fc93e8-bd8a-4f0f-a528-cb36b7fad160\/@q03B8ZTh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-14 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Whole exome sequencing,Genomics,Somatic mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18870"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"2f1a60b4-a706-4dbe-b7b4-372841652a38","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2f1a60b4-a706-4dbe-b7b4-372841652a38\/@q03B8ZTh\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennie Vagher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Atkinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikaela Larson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Nix<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Post<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Courtney Scaife<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Tward<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cindy Matsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason P.

However, the role of metformin, the first-line anti-diabetic drug, in breast cancer carcinogenesis has not been elucidated completely. We aimed to examine further the association between the use of metformin and other anti-diabetic medication and breast cancer incidence within two large prospective cohort studies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We followed 184,437 women who participated in the Nurses&#8217; Health Study (NHS;1994-2016) and the NHSII (1995-2017), with the baseline tied to the date metformin was introduced into the United States market. Information on T2D diagnosis, metformin, and other anti-diabetic medication, and other covariates were self-reported at baseline and repeatedly assessed by follow-up questionnaires every two to four years. Breast cancer cases were self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between metformin\/other anti-diabetic medication use and breast cancer incidence were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> During 3,412,366 person-years of follow-up, we ascertained 9,442 incident invasive breast cancer cases, of which 720 were among women with T2D. Compared with women without T2D (n=168,498), similar risks of developing breast cancer were observed among those who ever used metformin (HR =0.95; 95%CI=0.79-1.13) and among those who received medications other than metformin (HR =1.11; 95%CI=0.91-1.37). Among women with T2D (n=15,939), compared with never metformin users, ever use of metformin overall was not associated with breast cancer (HR =0.90; 95%CI=0.72-1.13), but a lower risk of breast cancer was observed among past metformin users (HR =0.72; 95%CI=0.52-0.99). Longer duration of metformin use was not associated with risk of breast cancer (each 2-year interval: HR =0.98; 95%CI=0.93-1.03, p<sub>-trend<\/sub>=0.32). However, among women with substantial weight increase since age 18 (&#62;25 kg), greater than 5 years of metformin use was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer (HR =0.62; 95%CI=0.43-0.89).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Although we observed inverse associations among past metformin users, similar associations were not found among current users.

This thesis also intends to examine the predictors for low quality of life, separately for physical quality of life and mental quality of life. Possible predictors explored include diet quality, age at cancer diagnosis, race and ethnicity, body mass index, alcohol intake, physical activity, and more. The data source for this thesis is the National Health and Examination Survey 2005-2012. The sample population included 1244 cancer survivors 20 years or older that answered yes to the question &#8220;have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that had cancer or malignancy of any kind&#8221;? Both, mental and physical health, were determined based on the number of days physical and mental health was not good and dichotomized according to mean value. The four groups identified were low mental health and low physical health (n=148, 11.9%), low mental health and high physical health (n=239, 19.2%), high mental health and low physical health (n=143, 11.5%), and high mental health and high physical health (n=714, 57.4%). The diet quality was calculated using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 since it measures adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The SAS Survey Analysis Procedures was used to account for the random multi-stage sampling of NHANES. On the other hand, ANOVA and chi-square were used to determine the possible predictors of low quality of life while multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the independent predictors of low physical and mental health with statistical significance was set at a two-sided p-value of &#60;0.05. The results showed that age, economic status, and physical activity are predictors of low quality of life for adult cancer survivors. This indicates that future interventions for improving quality of life should be focused on increasing physical activity, especially in middle aged, obese, and economically disadvantaged cancer survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae26ab66-2c8b-45d0-9aab-c9173563e544\/@q03B8ZTh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Physical activity,Quality of Life,NHANES,Cancer Survivors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18873"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Odette Chirinos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunkyung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

The website has been used as a tool and resource for health intervention research. This analysis described the characteristics of English and Spanish language users who responded to an online survey.<br \/>Methods: Visitors to cookforyourlife.org were invited to participate in an online survey collecting demographic characteristics and health behaviors. Those at least 18 years old were eligible. Respondents with a cancer diagnosis were asked a subset of questions about treatment and side effects. English language (EL) and Spanish language (SL) versions launched in December 2020 and April 2021, respectively. Survey data were analyzed through October 2021 and only included those completing at least 50% of the survey questions. Demographic characteristics from web analytics data were compared.<br \/>Results: Among EL respondents, 3039 initiated the survey and 2417 completed at least 50% of the questions. Of these, 53% were persons with a cancer diagnosis, 8% were caregivers of cancer patients, and 39% other. The majority of EL respondents were US residents (77%), but many were also from Europe (11%) and Canada (6%). Cancer patients\/survivors were most likely to be &#8805;55 years old, female, non-Hispanic white, have income &#62;$100K, and be college educated. Caregivers and others were younger, but otherwise had similar demographics. Among cancer patients\/survivors, 46% had breast cancer and 7% pancreatic and 49% reported having treatment side effects in the past week, with 31% citing fatigue and 15% anxiety. Among SL respondents, 804 initiated the survey and 545 were eligible for analysis. Of these, 17% were cancer patients\/survivors, 8% caregivers, and 75% other. SL respondents were also more likely to be female and highly educated, but were younger, from South\/Latin America, and had income &#60;$30K. Among SL cancer survivors, 31% had breast cancer and 8% had colorectal. Web analytics data on 1.5+ million visitors from December 2020 to October 2021 indicated most visitors were 71% female and lived in South\/Latin America (35%) or the US (31%).<br \/>Conclusions: Respondents of the Cook for Your Life English-language website survey were predominantly US women with high socioeconomic status; many had history of breast cancer. Conversely, Spanish-language respondents had more socioeconomic diversity, but fewer were diagnosed with cancer. Web analytics data suggested survey respondents may differ demographically from general website users. Knowledge about our website users is necessary for developing targeted strategies to improve reach. Future research efforts will focus on delivering content to more varied populations of cancer patients and survivors, their caregivers, and individuals interested in cancer prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/83b90eb9-3bd3-4925-b905-ec97b69b1d23\/@q03B8ZTh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,Cancer prevention,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18874"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"41d39b68-3b2d-41f1-b992-3dee75e8bac9","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41d39b68-3b2d-41f1-b992-3dee75e8bac9\/@q03B8ZTh\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eileen Rillamas-Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liza Schattenkerk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Cobos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kate Ueland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Heather Greenlee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Although various clinical and tumor characteristics are established prognostic factors, the role of epidemiologic risk factors on short- versus long-term survival are unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between various hormonal, reproductive, and lifestyle risk factors on ovarian cancer mortality by survival trajectory time intervals across the survivorship phase.<br \/>Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study included 1,421 unselected women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer from 1995 to 2004 in Ontario, Canada. Clinical information was obtained from medical records, risk factor information from telephone interview, and vital status was updated by linkage to the Ontario Cancer Registry up until 2020. We examined clinical risk factors, hormonal and reproductive related factors, lifestyle factors, and family history. Extended Cox proportional hazards models with Heaviside functions were used to estimate the association between risk factors and mortality by survival trajectory time interval (&#60;3, 3-&#60;6, 6-&#60;10, and &#8805;10 years).<br \/>Results: After a mean follow-up of 11.6 years, 65% (n=926) subjects died of which 51% (n=731) were due to ovarian cancer. Clinical factors such as late stage and presence of residual disease were strongly associated with short-term mortality, which attenuated over survival time. Stage IV disease significantly increased the risk of mortality compared to stage I disease for the survival interval within 3 years of diagnosis (HR 50.05; 95% CI 6.78, 369.57), however this association declined for survival beyond 10 years (HR 2.76; 95% CI 1.35, 5.65). Similarly, presence of residual disease increased the risk of mortality in the short-term (HR 2.47; 95% CI 1.40, 4.34), yet attenuated for long-term survival (HR 1.26; 95% CI 0.83, 1.93). Risk factors such as breastfeeding, smoking, and BMI were not associated with short-term survival, but significantly associated with long-term survival. History of breastfeeding decreased the risk of mortality (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46, 0.93), while a history of smoking (HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.27, 2.40) and obesity (HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.24, 2.65) increased the risk of mortality among long-term survivors.<br \/>Conclusions: This study confirmed that clinical risk factors such as stage at ovarian cancer diagnosis and residual disease following debulking surgery are important prognostic factors in the short-term survival trajectory while breastfeeding, smoking, and BMI play a stronger role for long-term ovarian cancer survival. These findings suggest a role of modifiable factors in improving long-term outcomes across the survivorship phase.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58aba106-d485-4b76-93a1-65d6997605aa\/@q03B8ZTh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: other,Survival,Risk factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18875"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shana Jean Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barry Rosen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John R.

Geospatial patterns of young-onset colorectal cancer (yoCRC) mortality rates in the U.S. have received limited attention, and prior studies were limited by a lack of adjustment for demographic factors, a focus only on hot spots, and a lack of cluster-specific relative risks (RRs). Adjustment allows clusters to represent areas where modifiable factors may be driving anomalous mortality rates. Aggregated 1999-2019 yoCRC mortality data for 3,036 counties was obtained from CDC WONDER Underlying Cause of Death, and demographics were obtained from 2005-2019 census variables and 2015 Robert Graham Center data. Mortality rates were stabilized via spatial smoothing, then a quasi-Poisson model was fit with median age, sex, race\/ethnicity, and social deprivation. Adjusted yoCRC death counts were utilized in a Poisson circular spatial scan to identify Gini hot\/cold spots at a maximum cluster size of 6% of the population at risk. Resulting RRs signified clusters where adjusted deaths were higher or lower than expected based on population and adjusted total deaths. Three statistically significant hot spots and five statistically significant cold spots were identified. The cluster with the largest log-likelihood ratio was a southern hot spot region encompassing counties horizontally from eastern Texas to central Georgia and vertically from southern Louisiana to southern Kentucky (RR: 1.26; p&#60;0.0001). Other notable clusters included hot spots centered in North Carolina (RR: 1.18; p&#60;0.0001) and Ohio (RR: 1.18; p&#60;0.0001), and large cold spots in western counties (Table 1). Our results reiterate southern and Appalachian hot spots from prior literature and provide new insights into a notable Ohio hot spot along with vast western cold spots. Future work is needed to identify established and potentially novel factors that may be driving yoCRC mortality clustering patterns, such as obesity, diet, or physician access.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{C9D45B25-61A5-496D-AA2C-21F552B17265}\"><caption>Table 1: Poisson spatial scan results adjusted for median age, sex, race, and social deprivation<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gini cluster<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Classification<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">States in cluster<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Relative risk<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Log-likelihood ratio<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Monte Carlo p-value<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Hot spot<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.28<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">139.03<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Hot spot<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.18<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">63.31<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cold spot<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.83<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">61.95<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Hot spot<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.16<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">40.14<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cold spot<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">California, Oregon, Washington<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.86<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">39.10<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cold spot<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">California<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.87<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35.53<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cold spot<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Texas<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.86<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29.91<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cold spot<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Wyoming<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.90<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.56<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ebb3134-475a-4d23-8fb2-ff0cc8182497\/@r03B8ZTi\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Epidemiology,Young-onset,Cancer cluster,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18981"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>R.

We examined geographic and racial variation in cancer mortality in the state of Georgia, and investigated the correlation between the observed spatial differences and county-level characteristics.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We analyzed data on breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer mortality among adults (aged &#62;18 years) in 159 Georgia counties from years 1999 through 2019. Geospatial methods were applied, and we identified hot spot counties based on cancer mortality rates overall and stratified by non-Hispanic White (NH-White) and NH-Black races. We assessed differences in county-level characteristics between hot spot and non-hot spot counties using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Spearman correlation and stratified all analyses by race\/ethnicity.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among all adults, 5.0% (8 of 159), 8.2% (13 of 159), 5.0% (8 of 159), and 6.9% (11 of 159) of Georgia counties were estimated hot spots for breast cancer, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer mortality, respectively. Among NH-Whites, 5.7% (9 of 159), 4.4% (7 of 159), 4.4% (7 of 159) counties, and 5.0% (8 of 159) of counties were identified as hot spots for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer mortality, respectively.

Over time, however, the incidence of small intestinal cancer has increased while other GI cancers (eg., colorectal, gastric, etc.) have decreased. To help elucidate the cause of this increase, we investigated histology-specific incidence and mortality trends in small intestinal cancer. We used SEER-9 data (covering ~10% of the US population) to identify 4 histological categories of small intestinal cancers (adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine, lymphoma, and sarcoma\/gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST]) to assess trends in incidence. Because death certificates do not include histology information, incidence-based mortality (IBM) was used to assess histology-specific mortality trends. From 1976 to 2016, 22,082 patients were diagnosed with one of four histological types of small intestinal cancer (ICD-O-3 codes C17.0-17.9). The overall incidence of these cancers more than doubled, from 12.1 to 27.9 per million (absolute increase 15.8; 95% CI: 14.3-17.3), largely because of a nearly 4-fold growth in neuroendocrine tumor incidence: from 3.7 to 14.6 per million (absolute increase 10.9; 95%CI: 10.0-11.8). The proportion of patients with localized disease increased from 14.7% of cases in 1976 to 38.9% of cases in 2014. There was little concomitant change in neuroendocrine mortality (from 1.4 to 2.2 per million, absolute increase 0.8; 95%CI: 0.4-1.2). The histologic distribution changed from 30% neuroendocrine histology in 1976 to 52% in 2016. Duodenal neuroendocrine tumors grew particularly rapidly from 0.1 to 4.2 per million (absolute increase 4.1; 95% CI, 3.7-4.5). Adenocarcinoma incidence rose slightly, but in tandem with mortality. Deaths attributed to small intestinal cancer on death certificates were virtually indistinguishable from adenocarcinoma IBM, suggesting that deaths attributed to small intestinal cancer were, in fact, predominantly due to adenocarcinoma. Both incidence and mortality of lymphoma initially rose before declining, similar to that for non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas in general. Despite a small increase in GIST incidence, mortality decreased by 40% (from 1.0 to 0.6 per million). In summary, cancers of the small intestine are being diagnosed more frequently. There was little change in the occurrence of adenocarcinoma or the ability to treat the disease. Treatment advances, however, were apparent in GIST and lymphoma as evidenced by improvements in population-based mortality. Neuroendocrine tumor incidence increased rapidly and substantially while mortality was relatively stable, a pattern consistent with overdiagnosis and\/or better diagnosis of symptomatic, low-lethality disease. Overdiagnosis appeared particularly likely in early stage and (more accessible) duodenal tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a60fc99a-8baf-4245-be58-f6488ef289d3\/@r03B8ZTi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Incidence,Gastrointestinal cancers: other,Mortality,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18983"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"08a9d2f2-429b-4265-b120-a92fb879e510","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/08a9d2f2-429b-4265-b120-a92fb879e510\/@r03B8ZTi\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haley J.

Previous studies have suggested genetic ancestry and human development index (HDI) as contributing factors, but few studies have been conducted at the international level. Here, we aimed to examine whether the frequency of common genomic variation associated with neuroblastoma can affect its risk at the ecological level with consideration of the socioeconomic status of a population. Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) for 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were abstracted from the Geography of Genetic Variants Browser. The number of incident neuroblastomas for each population was obtained from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents series. Further, population pseudo-polygenic risk scores (pp-PRSs) were calculated as a sum of MAFs at the population level, each of which was weighted by effect sizes from prior studies. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine whether differences in MAFs across the population influence the risk of neuroblastoma, with and without adjustment for HDI and whether pp-PRSs can be a predictor of the risk of neuroblastoma. Overall, our results indicated that the neuroblastoma risk associated with variation in SNP frequency could not be differentiated from that of HDI at the ecological level. Additionally, pp-PRSs were not significantly associated with the risk of neuroblastoma (IRR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.62&#8212;1.60). Further study using individual-level data is warranted to minimize the ecological fallacy in this study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed652fe4-d9c2-4ca0-a586-f7123ee5b744\/@r03B8ZTi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Incidence,International,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18984"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eun Mi Jung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca A.

Data to delineate if a postpartum diagnosis is an independent risk factor for breast cancer metastasis remain limited. Here, we addressed this question using early-onset cases available from the Utah Population Database.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>This population-based study includes 2,970 women with stage I-III breast cancer, diagnosed at &#8804;45 years of age between 1996 and 2017. The primary exposures are nulliparity or time between last childbirth and diagnosis of breast cancer. Primary outcomes are distant metastasis and breast cancer-specific death. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to investigate associations between exposures and outcomes adjusting for diagnosis year, age, tumor stage and estrogen receptor (ER) status. Stratified analyses were conducted.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Reproductive histories of the breast cancer patients were grouped as nulliparous (n=860), and parous: diagnosed 0-&#38;lt;5 years (n=614), 5-&#38;lt;10 years (n=615) and &#8805;10 years (n=881) since last childbirth. Through multivariate analyses, we find a breast cancer diagnosis within 5 years postpartum associates with elevated risk for metastasis [(HR)(95%CI)]=1.5(1.2-2.0)] and breast cancer-specific death [HR(95%CI)=1.5(1.1-2.1)] compared to nulliparous cases. Further, for stage I or II cancers that classically have good prognoses, a postpartum diagnosis (0-&#38;lt;5 years) is a dominant feature of increased risk for metastasis [HR(95% CI)]=[1.9 (1.2-2.8)], particularly liver metastasis, and a 2 fold increase in probability of death [HR(95% CI)]=[2.0 (1.2-3.2)]. For women diagnosed with poor prognostic ER- breast cancer, the probability of dying in 0-&#38;lt;5 yrs postpartum group is also ~2 fold compared to nulliparous cases [HR(95% CI)]=[2.3 (1.3-4.1)]. ER+ cases diagnosed 0-&#38;lt;5 yrs postpartum trended towards poor outcomes with marginal significance. Unexpectedly, the proportion of patients progressing to metastasis was the same for ER+ and ER- disease, at 13.2% and 13.5% respectively, with ~3 fold more deaths in women diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer due to increased incidence. Further, we find increased liver metastasis in ER+ patients diagnosed &#38;lt;5 years postpartum, with a full 46% of women who progressed to metastasis having liver as first site of metastasis.<br \/>Conclusion: This study shows a postpartum diagnosis as an independent risk factor for breast cancer progression and implicates a birth-interval-associated liver biology in the increased liver metastasis observed in this study. Irrespective of ER status, clinical consideration of time between last completed pregnancy and breast cancer diagnosis will increase accuracy of prognosis in young-onset breast cancer patients.<br \/>1.Nichols, H.B., et al., <i>Breast Cancer Risk After Recent Childbirth: A Pooled Analysis of 15 Prospective Studies.<\/i> Ann Intern Med, 2018.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/05d20450-8f71-4324-830a-ba7890d46d80\/@r03B8ZTi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Mortality,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18986"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhenzhen Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Solange Bassale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonali Jindal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Guinto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alison Fraser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomi Mori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken R.

Few studies have evaluated the association of census tract-level SEP on BC mortality by race\/ethnicity, particularly within stage at diagnosis in young women.<br \/>Objective: To determine associations between residential SEP, measured by household educational attainment, and BC mortality by race\/ethnicity within stage at diagnosis among young women in California, 2006-2015.<br \/>Methods: Data are from a pilot data product, the California Cancer Registry Data with Synthetic Census Tracts, which is available to external researchers coordinated with confidential data available to qualified internal users. The present study includes 41,886 young (25-49 years of age) California women who were diagnosed with primary invasive BC during 2006-2015. SEP was defined based on % of households completing a bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher (categorized as &#8804;30%, 30-60%, and &#8805;60% of households). Multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the association between SEP and BC mortality by race\/ethnicity within stage at diagnosis by calculating hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusting for age at diagnosis, marital status, tumor histology and diagnosis year.<br \/>Results: For Stage I BC, compared to census tracts with &#8804;30% bachelor&#8217;s degree, the adjusted HR (95% CI) was 0.57 (0.44, 0.74) for tracts with 30-60% and 0.48 (0.32, 0.72) for tracts with &#8805;60% of households attaining a bachelor&#8217;s degree. For Stage II, the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) are 0.75 (0.66-0.84) and 0.54 (0.44-0.67); for Stage III, 0.80 (0.72-0.89) and 0.63 (0.51-0.76); and for Stage IV 0.73 (0.65-0.84) and 0.53 (0.41-0.69). When examined by race\/ethnicity and stage at diagnosis, a significantly reduced mortality was associated with residing in census tracts with &#8805;60% of households having attained a bachelor&#8217;s degree compared to &#8804;30% for Stage I only among Asian (HR=0.30; 95% CI=0.11-0.77); for Stage II for White (HR=0.53; 95% CI=0.41-0.70) and Asian (HR=0.56; 95% CI=0.34-0.91); for Stage III White (HR=0.72; 95% CI=0.55-0.94) and Hispanic (HR=0.49; 95% CI=0.24-0.99); and for Stage IV White (HR=0.58; 95% CI=0.41-0.82) and Asian (HR=0.48; 95% CI=0.26-0.90) populations. Sample size was limited among Black and Asian Pacific Islander subgroups.<br \/>Conclusion: Higher census tract-level SEP, defined as &#8805;60% of the population having a bachelor&#8217;s degree, is associated with a significantly decreased risk for BC-mortality at all stages of diagnosis. This effect isn't consistent across all stages of diagnosis among Hispanic populations, but is consistent among Non-Hispanic White and Asian populations in California, 2006-2015. <u> <\/u>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b5120d12-1536-4065-99b0-6bdf820be2de\/@r03B8ZTi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Race,Mortality,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18987"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhenzhen Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ellen Velie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shangyuan Ye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joe Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lydia Marcus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiuh-Wen Luoh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Duo Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mandi Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, age-related disparity in the management of patients with mCRC has not been adequately evaluated. In this study, we aimed to compare and contrast the treatment outcome and adverse events among different age groups of patients with mCRC.<br \/>Methods: We used individual patient data of a clinical trial (NCT00364013) from Project Data Sphere with patients who received first-line FOLFOX or FOLFOX + panitumumab for mCRC. Patients in each treatment arm were grouped into &#60;50 years, 50-65 years, and &#62;65 years of age groups. Continuous and categorical variables were compared with <i>t<\/i> test and Fisher&#8217;s exact test, respectively. Survival was summarized using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association of adverse events with survival.<br \/>Results: Among 935 patients included, 112 (12.0%) were in the &#60;50 group; 456 (48.8%) were in the 50-65 group; 367 (39.2%) were in the &#62;65 group. All three groups had similar baseline characteristics. Median overall survival (OS) of both &#60;50 (18.4, 95%CI 13.1-23.1 months) and &#62;65 (18.0, 95%CI 16.3-22.2 months) groups were significantly shorter (<i>p<\/i>=0.008) than median OS of the 50-65 group (22.7, 95%CI 20.0-26.5 months) in the FOLFOX arm. Similar findings were present in the FOLFOX + panitumumab arm (<i>p<\/i>=0.049). Both &#60;50 and &#62;65 groups had a trend (<i>p<\/i>=0.09) toward shorter progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the 50-65 group. As to adverse events, in the FOLFOX arm, all grade nausea\/vomiting of the &#60;50 group was more common than that in the &#62;50 group (70.3% vs 55.8%, <i>p<\/i>=0.05). Compared to the &#62;50 group, the &#60;50 group had earlier onset of neutropenia at 7.8 weeks (<i>p<\/i>=0.003) and chest pain at 5.4 weeks (<i>p<\/i>=0.008). In the FOLFOX + panitumumab arm, all grade fatigue (58.3% vs 35.7%, <i>p<\/i>=0.003), neuropathy (52.1% vs 34.7%, <i>p<\/i>=0.03) and mucositis (43.8% vs 29.5%, <i>p<\/i>=0.049) of the &#60;50 group were more common than those in the &#62;50 group. The duration of various adverse events were similar among the age groups. In the FOLFOX arm, severe (grade&#8805;3) liver toxicity was associated with worse PFS (HR 3.6, 95%CI 1.3-9.8, <i>p<\/i>=0.01) and OS (HR 7.3, 95%CI 2.7-20.1, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). In contrast, severe neuropathy was associated with better PFS (HR 0.6, 95%CI 0.4-0.9, <i>p<\/i>=0.009) and OS (HR 0.5, 95% 0.3-0.8,<i> p=<\/i>0.001). In the FOLFOX + panitumumab arm, severe anemia was associated with worse PFS (HR 1.7, 95%CI 1.02-2.8, <i>p<\/i>=0.04) and OS (HR 2.8, 95%CI 1.7-4.7, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). In contrast, severe rash was associated with better PFS (HR 0.5, 95%CI 0.3-0.8, <i>p<\/i>=0.002) and OS (HR 0.3, 95% 0.2-0.5,<i> p&#60;<\/i>0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: Patients with early-onset mCRC had not only worse OS in both treatment arms but also higher incidence of adverse events. Our management approach should adapt to the unique features of this patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c719610d-4565-4350-888f-16ca0fe7ff64\/@r03B8ZTi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Survival,ADVERSE EVENTS,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19040"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lingbin Meng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ram Thapa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Xie<\/i><\/presenter>.

Women were &#61619;60 days post-treatment (current endocrine therapy allowed), consumed &#60;5 servings of fruits\/vegetables per day and\/or engaged in &#60;150 minutes\/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Hip-worn Actigraph GT3X accelerometers measured ST for 7 consecutive days at baseline.

Multivariable linear regression models adjusting for wear time (average minutes\/day) and minutes of MVPA\/day were used to examine whether the following factors were predictors of ST at baseline: self-reported demographics, psychosocial factors (assessed via PROMIS Physical Function and PROMIS Anxiety forms), diet quality (Healthy Eating Index 2015 score), caloric intake (calories\/day), and fruit and vegetable intake (servings\/day).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among the 84 women included in this analysis who had actigraphy measurements at baseline, the average ST\/day was 684&#177;79 minutes.

The health complications and mortalities caused by SHS exposure in Pakistan are also very prominent as it causes more than 33 thousand annual deaths. In this pilot study, we wanted to evaluate the exposure to secondhand smoke at work and at home, and its association with the prevalence of diseases through a survey based cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire was designed and developed using Google Forms and a short link was distributed using social media channels (i.e., WhatsApp groups and Facebook). Respondents were young adults from all cities of Pakistan who had access to internet and were digitally literate. Exposure to secondhand smoke at home, during childhood (from 0-18 year of age), adulthood exposure (after 18 years of age), and exposure at work was evaluated. The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel and R.A total of 438 respondents participated in this survey with representation of male (54%) and female (46%) belonging to major cities in Pakistan, including Peshawar (38%), Islamabad (10.4%), Lahore (7.2%), and Karachi (6%). Overall, 75% of the study cohort were exposed to SHS, with the highest exposure noticed during adulthood with 70.3% of people being exposed to SHS after 18 years of age. Amongst those who were exposed daily at home, 63% had chronic bronchitis while 60% had cardiac diseases as self-reported health issues. Those exposed to SHS during childhood for 2 or more than 2 hours per week, 80% had self-reported chronic bronchitis in the survey. During adulthood, universities dominated as a location that offered highest exposure to SHS for 2 or more than 2 hours\/week. One-year exposure history at workplace revealed that of those who were exposed to SHS at work &#8216;several times a day&#8217;, 60% had high blood pressure, 55% had asthma, while 50% had chronic bronchitis. At home &#8216;the father&#8217; was identified as the main source of secondhand smoke and during adulthood universities are identified as place of highest exposure. At workplaces although the percentage of people exposed to secondhand smoke is lesser than those reported in previous studies but the correlation with medical complications was revealing. Overall throat irritation, gastric issues, and eye irritations were highly reported medical conditions amongst exposed individuals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/62af07fe-8c81-4704-a484-8c399a83eed9\/@s03B8ZTj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tobacco smoke,Secondhand smoke,Passive smoking,Environmental smoke,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20871"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shagufta Rehmat<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faisal F.

Patients with MM have several lines of treatment options and overall survival has increased with current treatments, nonetheless, MM remains currently incurable. It has been recently noted that ABO blood types may influence the survival of MM patients (PMID: 33362882). The purpose of this study is to find if there is a relationship between the survival of MM patients and their ABO blood type.<br \/>Methods: Patients were drawn from the self-reported HealthTree Cure Hub database which included 1,173 individuals. 458 patients reported having A blood type, 56 patients reported having AB blood type, 155 patients reported having B blood type, and 504 patients reported having O blood type. Patients who did not report a blood type were excluded from this analysis. An analysis of variance was conducted to analyze the relationship between the survival time (total time to next treatment) and a patient's ABO blood type. A t-test was conducted to compare the survival time of O blood group with other blood types. Additionally, an analysis of variance was conducted to determine the relationship between ABO blood groups and a patient's likelihood of being considered high risk.<br \/>Results: We found that there was a relationship between total time to next treatment and ABO blood type. On average the total time to next treatment of MM patients with O blood type was longer compared to other blood types with an average of 2027 days. Patients with A blood type had an average of 1762 days, AB blood type had an average of 1882 days, and B blood type had an average of 1747 days. While the difference in average survival time was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.138), it is still worth noting that there is a difference in average total survival time for patients with O blood type. We further compared the average total time to next treatment between O blood group and all other blood types. We saw that there was a statistical significance (p-value = 0.040) and concluded that on average the survival time of patients with O blood type is higher than other blood groups by 250 days. We also investigated whether or not patients in certain ABO blood groups are more inclined to have high-risk mutations. We categorized patients as high risk and standard risk-based on guidelines defined by Mayo Clinic&#8217;s mSMART. We found that there was no statistical significance (p-value = 0.797) and concluded that patients are equally likely to be considered high risk for all ABO blood groups.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>Our results indicated that MM patients with blood type O have a longer survival time on average than patients with blood type A, AB, and B. We saw that a patient&#8217;s likelihood of having a high-risk mutation is the same across all ABO blood groups. Our results may help lead to further research investigating why despite having a similar proportion of patients who are considered high risk, patients with O blood type differ in average survival time.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1c8770d9-1ff1-49d8-8f58-e371fbf5001f\/@s03B8ZTj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Prognosis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21073"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zena M.

Yet delayed diagnoses and inappropriate first lines of therapy often wipe out whatever &#8220;advantages&#8221; they may have had, keeping mortality statistics higher than would be expected (PMID: 25469920). For underserved populations, a number of commonly accepted disparities exist in myeloma, and more broadly, cancer care. Patients who receive treatment by a high-volume provider (myeloma specialist) is a factor that can help patients with MM to have a longer life expectancy (PMID: 31487686). Therefore, we analyzed whether there is a disparity between race and receiving care from a myeloma specialist which may contribute to the differences in survival that is being seen.<br \/>Methods: Validated real-world (RW) MM patient data was collected through HealthTree Cure Hub for Multiple Myeloma (healthtree.org). We examined the patient&#8217;s race which was either Caucasian American or Black American and whether or not they were being treated by a myeloma specialist. The association between race and specialist was examined by a chi-squared (<i>X<sup>2<\/sup><\/i>) test.<br \/>Results: In this retrospective analysis of 2,871 MM patients, we compared Caucasian Americans (n= 2716) and Black Americans (n=155). Our analysis revealed a significant association between the two races and whether or not they had a myeloma specialist, <i>X<sup>2<\/sup><\/i>(1, N = 2,871) = 5.85, p = 0.015. Black Americans were less likely to be treated by a myeloma specialist.<br \/>Conclusion: The findings of this RW analysis identify a glaring disparity in Black American MM patients and receiving care from a myeloma specialist. Addressing the underlying cause of the findings could extinguish other MM-related issues, such as delays in getting a correct diagnosis, lack of access to myeloma specialists, and many other non-medical issues leading to less-than-optimal outcomes from the majority of these Black American patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/00b3807f-cdf0-4b37-a60d-94bfb21d4bf9\/@s03B8ZTj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Race,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21074"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christian S.

However, results of genetic association studies that focus on HL developed among children and adolescent individuals are limited. Given the historically high survival rate, it is reasonable to leverage available genetic data for survivors of childhood\/adolescent HL for this investigation. Utilizing existing data from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort, the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) original cohort and CCSS expansion cohort, we performed a fixed-effects meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies for a total of 1,286 HL cases, 6,824 other childhood cancer cases and 373 non-cancer controls, all of whom are of European ancestry. Three independent SNPs in the HLA locus (rs28383311, Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.80, <i>P<\/i>&#8201;=&#8201;2.14&#215;10<sup>-21<\/sup>; rs3129198, OR = 1.52, <i>P<\/i> = 2.05&#215;10<sup>-14<\/sup>; rs3129890, OR = 1.51, <i>P<\/i> = 6.21&#215;10<sup>-13<\/sup>) were identified using step-wise conditional logistic regression. HLA SNP rs28383311 had a moderate correlation (r<sup>2 <\/sup>= 0.46) with rs2858870 reported previously by Cozen et al. (Blood, 2012) in the <i>HLA-DRA<\/i> gene region in adolescent\/young adults onset HL. HLA SNP rs3129198 had a perfect correlation (r<sup>2 <\/sup>= 1.0) with rs2281389 (<i>HLA-DPB1<\/i>) reported previously by Moutsianas et al. (Blood, 2011) in mostly adults-onset HL. In contrast, SNP rs3129890 had a low correlation (r<sup>2 <\/sup>= 0.15) with rs2395185 (<i>HLA-DRA<\/i>) reported previously by Urayama et al. (JNCI, 2012) in HL cases diagnosed across a wide age range between 16 and 80 years old. Our analysis also identified additional SNPs for non-HLA loci at genome-wide significance level including: 1) rs1432297 (OR = 1.30, <i>P<\/i> = 2.5&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>), which is in moderate correlation (r<sup>2<\/sup>=0.52) with previously reported rs1432295 (<i>REL<\/i>); 2) rs13279159 (OR = 1.32, <i>P<\/i> = 1.7&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>), which is in high correlation (r<sup>2<\/sup>=0.75) with previously reported rs2019960 (<i>PVT1<\/i>); and 3) rs3824662 (OR = 1.52, <i>P<\/i> = 3.9&#215;10<sup>-10<\/sup>), which had a high correlation (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.91) with previously reported rs3781093 (<i>GATA3<\/i>). In addition, a novel uncommon SNP with a large effect size (rs117361561, OR = 1.95, <i>P <\/i>= 2.50&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>, minor allele frequency = 0.02) was identified and mapped to <i>PDGFD<\/i>, a plausible gene for HL susceptibility. Twelve out 18 (67%) previously reported genome-wide significant non-HLA SNPs were replicated with <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05 based on our meta-analysis. By analyzing early onset HL within pediatric and adolescent age range, we further dissected the associations in HLA locus by replicating three independent SNPs. We also found a novel non-HLA locus and replicated the majority of previous findings in the non-HLA region, suggesting mostly overlapping as well as potentially unique genetic etiology for HL risk across different ages of onset.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ada0d4f6-1764-4e31-a4e9-82381e95509e\/@s03B8ZTj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hodgkin's lymphoma,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),HLA ,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21410"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cheng Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nan Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaojun Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenghong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Smita Bhatia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather Mulder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Easton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinghui Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yutaka Yasui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory T.

Government mortality data has inadequate coverage, with single sources like the SSA being reappraised for completeness. To overcome this problem, RWE mortality composites have been developed using obituary data sourced from funeral homes, newspapers, &#38; other online obituary sources, but no single source has complete coverage. We explored a privacy preserving record linkage strategy using a set of commercial mortality composites and governmental data sources to improve population coverage. Tokenization technology was used to generate a high coverage, deduplicated mortality data resource from disparate datasets, including a government source, a private claims source, two digital obituary sources, and a private media source. The CDC-reported number of total deaths were used as a benchmark, and we compared each of the five mortality data sources against this number to understand individual coverage. We then assessed coverage when these data sources were linked and de-duplicated to form a single dataset.

New therapies with higher curative rates are needed to improve prognosis. There has been increasing interest in inhibitors of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) in suppressing tumor growth. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors show promise not only due to their ability to inhibit glucose uptake, but also from the subsequent improvements in other metabolic disorders that may affect cancer prognosis.<br \/><b>Purpose:<\/b> We evaluated the associations of tumor SGLT2 protein expression with survival following diagnosis of incident epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tumor samples were obtained from 492 patients undergoing debulking surgery for primary EOC at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center between 1995 and 2002. Only incident cases and patients who did not receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were included in analyses (n=396). Tissue samples were compiled into tissue microarray<b> <\/b>blocks<b> <\/b>that were sectioned, stained, imaged, and analyzed for SGLT2 expression. Data on patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics, along with available information on components of metabolic disorders, were linked to each patient. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were performed to determine hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for EOC-specific and all-cause mortality.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> In our analysis of 396 EOC patients seen at Roswell Park, we observed significant associations between high SGLT2 expression and decreased risk of both EOC-specific (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.94) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.53-0.95). In particular, among those with advanced-stage tumors, there was a significant association between high SGLT2 expression and lower risk of EOC-specific (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.42-0.91) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.45-0.90). A lower risk of all-cause mortality was observed among those with high-grade tumors (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48-0.98). Trends of increasing SGLT2 associated with decreased risk of mortality varied by histological subtype. The inverse association between high SGLT2 and EOC-death was stronger among those with a history of hyperlipidemia (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.19-0.99) and obesity (HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23-0.82) compared to other metabolic syndrome components. These associations were less robust for all-cause mortality.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Contrary to our initial hypothesis, higher SGLT2 expression among EOC patients may be associated with more favorable prognosis. This association may be stronger for high grade and advanced stage tumors as well as non-serous subtypes. Identifying other factors associated with levels of expression could aid in the development of potential screening interventions and more personalized treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fdd8d6a0-6f1f-4dba-8eff-3f46a728aea7\/@s03B8ZTj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Tissue microarrays,SGLT2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21731"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer M.

To overcome barriers and improve pt engagement, we constructed a Personal Pathway to Success (PPS) program which enabled patients to choose cessation components they could effectively use.<br \/>Methods: City of Hope (COH) constructed a comprehensive list of cessation tools. Patients completed tobacco use and Lifestress social domain stress assessments. PPS was then proposed to patients who selected tools they would initially use in quit attempts. Pts could add or delete tools at any time but were encouraged to add likely effective tools. Since tobacco use is associated with adverse surgical outcomes, the PPS program was pilot tested at the preoperative anesthesia testing clinic (PATC). Patients were evaluated for acceptance of cessation and follow through with counseling. Results were compared by Chi square statistic to pt cessation results before PPS program implementation. Study data collection was 9\/11\/21 to 1\/3\/22.Results: The tools in PPS were Individual cessation counseling, nicotine replacement and cessation medications, signed personal commitment agreement, cessation support group, choosing a buddy partner (family, friends or support group), lung cancer screening, letter to primary care physicians requesting assistance for non-responding patients, SmokeFree Text support, Kick It California or Asian Quitline support, rapid action plan for relapses, 5Ds cessation and 7 self-care skills, COH relaxation and\/or hypnosis videos, guidance for cinnamon stick\/bubble blowing, stress management and smoking cessation apps, cessation videos and audios, educational brochures, advice on vaping, assistance with internet and digital devices, family education and support, and psycho-social or substance abuse referrals. At PATC 36 evaluable patients were offered the PPS program, counseling and\/or video education. Nineteen patients (53%) agreed to cessation, 14 (74%) scheduled a definite date for counseling. 42% completed the counseling. Video education was watched by 6 (32%) patients. Thirty two % had future appointments, but 26% had not yet scheduled. Three patients (8%) desired more time to evaluate cessation. Fourteen patients did not respond despite 3 attempts and were referred back to their attending physician. Compared to results pre-PPS, patient initiation was increased from 8.7% to 53% (p&#60;.001).<br \/>Conclusions: The Personal Pathway to Success program empowered patients to select among different cessation tools and increased pt acceptance of cessation. Offering comprehensive tobacco cessation during cancer surgery pre-anesthesia visits represents a teachable moment when patients are more motivated to accept behavioral interventions and tobacco cessation. Further research will develop additional methods to further increase engagement of hard to reach patients, family and caregivers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dab90301-17ef-42ac-9bc0-a3cb2b82614f\/@s03B8ZTj\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tobacco,Smoking,Surgical resection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20414"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cary A.
