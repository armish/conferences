The Central Florida Pharmacy Council (CFPC) is a professional volunteer community 501 (c) 3 organization. Founded in 1996, the mission of the CFPC is to improve the health and wellness of African Americans and minorities through the presentation and development of culturally appropriate health education programs. The purpose of CFPC&#8217;s community health education programs are to improve the health status and empower African Americans and minorities to take a proactive approach in the management of their health. Purpose of Study: It is estimated that in 2019 approximately 29,570 African American (AA) men were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCA). Disparities in PCA among AA men have been documented at all stages of the cancer continuum, i.e., diagnosis to treatment to survivorship. Shared decision making (SDM) a process in which patients and clinicians work together to make medical decisions based on clinical evidence is vital to the selection of treatment. However, for an individual to make an informed decision and fully participate in the SDM process they must understand the disease and its treatment options. The overall goal of our project is to improve SDM for AA men who have been diagnosed with localized low risk PCA. Methods: Four focus groups were conducted with 17 African American (AA) prostate cancer survivors, 8 AA men who have not been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 8 spouses and relatives of AA men who are prostate cancer survivors. Focus group facilitators (community PCA advocates) received training from the project&#8217;s Community-Based Participatory Researcher. Data extracted from the transcripts were organized, coded, and analyzed for recurrent patterns and themes utilizing NVivo qualitative software (&#169; QSR International Pty Ltd. 2020). The purpose of the focus groups was to determine what the most important questions that African American men wanted to know regarding their diagnosis for prostate cancer and treatment options for prostate cancer. Results: The topic of impotency that is caused by most PCA treatments was brought up frequently among all focus group participants. African American men would like to know more about the side effects of treatment options and what treatment options are available that do not disrupt their quality of life, such as impotency and incontinence. Many felt that risking the consequences of prostate cancer was better than living with the side effects of treatment. Spouses were also concerned about impotency but felt their husband&#8217;s life was more important. Several men felt that physicians were fast to recommend certain harsh treatments that were going to affect their quality of life without discussing life changing side effects. Based on the expenses involved in treating their cancer, some felt they could not choose a better treatment. The most frequent resource for PCA treatment information and information to treat impotency was sought from friends and family members who were PCA survivors. Additional questions posed by the participants: What are the causes of PCA? What is the life expectancy? Can PCA be prevented? What are some alternative treatments? Conclusion: These results as well as future focus groups will help us design and develop an artificial intelligent conversational PCA treatment decision aid that is literacy and culturally appropriate for AA men.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7365596f-962e-4135-bc3f-3245e5854440\/@K03B9118\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21632"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Angela Adams<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We envision a future when no women will die from advanced\/metastatic cancer. Our HistoryOur story started when several family and friends lost their battles with cancer due to lack of resources, language barriers, and inadequate access to health care. Several of us got together to do all in our power to help women diagnosed with advanced or metastatic cancer find all the resources and companionship they need during their struggle with cancer.Programs:Program 1: Patient Navigation and Companionship.In this program we help women with advanced\/metastatic cancer understand their disease, the opportunities for medical services (including availability of clinical trials for their specific disease) and the challenges faced. We help each woman along the journey through education, support and companionship. When possible, we will accompany them to procedures and appointments and provide transportation as needed. We also help them to identify financial and other resources available to them. Our activities in Houston before the COVID-19 pandemic were conducted in-person through visits at patients&#8217; homes, or hospital rooms, or through meetings at public places. During the COVID pandemic, we conducted most meetings using virtual means but have resumed our in-person meetings and rides to appointments or other places.Program 2: Activities to Enhance Quality of LifeWe promote activities and help women identify ways that may enhance their mental, physical and emotional well-being so they feel better and remain engaged as they battle with advanced\/metastatic cancer. We also connect our clients with support groups in English and Spanish for patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Program 3: End of Life ResourcesWe help women with advanced cancer when standard of care therapies or clinical trials are not able to control the growth of their cancer. We provide resources available for this stage of their journey, educating them about their options, legal documents required and companionship as needed (home or hospital visitations). Program 4: Scientific ResearchWe conduct patient-centered scientific research to explore new ways to complement or improve outcomes of standard of care therapies.

We use data and stories that we collect from the young survivor community to educate our physicians on the difficulties that the majority of young women face getting diagnosed with accuracy and urgency. Summary: In this poster we describe our methods for survivor community-led research on the prevalence and causes of delayed breast cancer diagnosis in women under 40 in the United States. The relevance of these methods for advocacy organizations focused on other cancer types and\/or age groups will be discussed. The poster will also be relevant to researchers who have interest in breast cancer risk assessment and\/or diagnostics. Methods: The research emerged organically from the Breast Cancer Portrait Project, which began as a project to photograph and interview young breast cancer survivors. An issue of high priority that emerged from these semi-structured interviews (n=68) was the difficulty that young women face in receiving a prompt and accurate diagnosis. Based on the domains that emerged from the portrait interviews, a retrospective survey was designed to gather information from survivors about their breast cancer diagnosis while minimizing sampling bias. The survey was administered online via SurveyMonkey and participants (n=221) were recruited widely across social media. The identification of the researchers as breast cancer survivors\/advocates, their embedment in the community, and their prior training in formal social science research methodology facilitates this community-led research. Implications: Using the results of the survey, we plan to establish a communication loop with physicians to raise awareness of delayed diagnosis and improve the timeliness from first detection of breast cancer to diagnosis. Input from physicians will inform future studies among survivors. This approach to community-led research has potential to be replicated across other cancer communities, allowing survivor-advocates to identify the issues that most affect their community and collect evidence to help them be more effective advocates. With 1 in 4 Americans having cancer in their lifetime, an increasing number of social scientists have a personal connection to cancer, facilitating studies of this type across other survivor communities. In cancers which are rare in general or rare in particular age groups, survivor communities may need to rely more heavily on external researchers to carry out community research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a8ec741d-6667-4f51-b7ad-6d12451e4a1c\/@s03B9119\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21638"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>STEP Tubman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In recent years, it has been suggested that veterans may have been at an increased risk of contracting this cancer due to exposures to parasites, known as liver flukes, in Southeast Asia. This association has been suggested with Vietnam-era veterans (1961-1975) who would have had extended exposures to countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and others. In 2018, a clinical trial was published noting the presence of liver flukes in multi-service veteran populations decades after their service. Of the 50 people surveyed, one was currently diagnosed with CCA. The VA has acknowledged the association of liver flukes and CCA, but denied an association with service time and thus denied benefits and coverage for those seeking medical care. This is likely due to CCA not typically presenting until decades after exposure to liver flukes (and thus decades after service), as well as the small size of the CCA affected population. In 2021, the VA announced the beginning of the Vietnam Era Health Retrospective Observational Study (VE-HEROeS), researching the rate of CCA in Vietnam-era veterans versus individuals of the general public. While this is a wonderful step in identifying risk factors in developing CCA, these clinical trials take time to process and current veterans and their families have been denied care and benefits. We need to better support veterans and their families affected by Cholangiocarcinoma as well as other cancers that could be associated with current and past service. There needs to be more awareness, more funding, and more involvement in the scientific community to identify risk factors, mitigation, and earlier identification of this devastating disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1afc5662-3641-4187-a4e5-b3dea027eaa7\/@t03B911a\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21640"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>AMELIA Wagenknecht<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
