[{"Abstract":"Amplification and copy number alterations of the 17q23 amplicon are common in breast cancer and neuroblastoma and have been associated with early relapse and poor prognosis. Recent work identified a key vulnerability associated with amplicon-driven overexpression of TRIM37<i> <\/i>in these tumor types (Meitinger et al. 2020; Yeow<i> <\/i>et al. 2020). High levels of TRIM37 prevent acentrosomal spindle assembly and render cells mitotically vulnerable to inhibition of polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a serine\/threonine protein kinase that controls centrosome duplication.<br \/>We have discovered potent small molecule inhibitors of PLK4 that are highly selective against the kinome, including against the closely related aurora kinases and PLK1-3. Self-regulation of PLK4 protein levels occurs through proteasomal degradation induced by PLK4 trans-autophosphorylation. ORIC PLK4 inhibitors blocked trans-autophosphorylation leading to stabilization of PLK4, thus directly demonstrating target inhibition in cells. Importantly, PLK4 inhibitor induced PLK4 protein stabilization correlated with cell viability, providing a quantifiable pharmacodynamic (PD) association with antitumor activity. Cell viability assessment across a cancer cell line panel revealed that the highly selective ORIC PLK4 inhibitors showed greater potency in TRIM37 high cancer cell lines as compared to TRIM37 low cell lines. In contrast, less selective compounds, including from the clinical literature, did not display differential potency in TRIM37 high versus low cancer cell lines. Importantly, cell potency in TRIM37 high cancer cells was rescued with knockdown of TRIM37, illustrating that selective PLK4 inhibitors are synthetic lethal with TRIM37 amplification. Oral administration of ORIC PLK4 inhibitors resulted in regressions of TRIM37 high xenograft tumors, with corresponding PD effects and no body weight loss.<br \/>In summary, we have discovered novel, potent, highly selective small molecule inhibitors of PLK4 that are orally bioavailable and confirmed the potential for this new target in treating tumors with high levels of TRIM37.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/536b7b74-22f3-4d44-947a-8866d167ef6e\/@F03B8ZDg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polo-like kinase,Small molecule inhibitor,Centrosome,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15053"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyle A.

VIP expression by cancer may represent a paracrine immune-checkpoint pathway while simultaneously having autocrine effects on cancer growth. We used an <i>in silico<\/i> model to identify genes whose over-expression in cancer was correlated with VIP expression and confirmed the role of VIP receptor (VIPR) signaling <i>in vitro<\/i> using VIPR inhibitors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The TCGA PanCan dataset (UCSC Xena) was used to compare mRNA expression data of VIP versus 760 genes involved in 48 cancer related pathways. Associations by cancer histology and germ layer were calculated. A Pearson&#8217;s Coefficient cutoff of R &#62; [0.3] defined a significant gene association. VIP and target gene expression were confirmed and quantified by western blot analysis in cancer cell lines and VIPR signaling was inhibited using ANT008, a novel VIPR inhibitor.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Significant associations were observed between VIP expression and<b> <\/b>10 genes (Table 1). Strong associations (R &#62; [0.4]) were observed in cancers derived from ectodermal and mesodermal germ layers. The strongest gene association was for VIP and ZEB1 in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD, R = 0.7643). <i>In vitro<\/i> experiments using Jurkat T cells confirmed expression of VIP and ZEB1 proteins. Treatment with the VIPR inhibitor ANT008 (10&#956;M) reduced VIP and ZEB1 protein expression by 50%. A similar fold increase in ZEB1 expression was observed with exogenous VIP. PCR studies are currently underway.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The results demonstrate autocrine signaling between VIP expression and cancer associated gene pathways. ZEB1 is a known EMT (epithelial mesenchymal transition) regulator, and our <i>in vitro<\/i> studies novelly link VIP to EMT and demonstrate that this pathway is therapeutically targetable using a VIPR inhibitor.

Evidence suggests that rapid tumor cell growth associated with increased dNTP needs results in elevated NSP activity. As deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the NSP, and the only enzyme that can supply cells with all dNTP precursors for DNA replication, dCK has been implicated as a promising therapeutic target. Data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia demonstrated that most human cancer cell lines have elevated dCK gene expression (2- to 17-fold) therefore suggesting selective susceptibility of tumor cells to dCK inhibition. Accordingly, a potent first-in-class oral dCK inhibitor, TRE-515, was evaluated as a single agent in two human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) models. In the first CRPC model, C4-2, TRE-515 was administered intraperitoneally once a day for eight consecutive days (50 mg\/kg, QDx8). TRE-515 significantly inhibited tumor growth (50.7%, <i>p=0.021<\/i>, relative to vehicle control), with 50% of the TRE-15 treated tumors regressing during the eight-day treatment window. In a repeat C4-2 study, TRE-515 monotherapy trended toward tumor growth inhibition, (53.7%, <i>p=0.061<\/i>, relative to vehicle control). A second CRPC model, 22Rv1, was then selected as it has been shown to carry DNP mutations, suggesting enhanced sensitivity to dCK inhibition. In this study, TRE-515 was dosed orally two times a day for 28 days (75 mg\/kg, BIDx28) and plasma deoxycytidine (dC) concentrations (a substrate for dCK) were measured 7 hours after the morning dose on day 21. TRE-515 alone significantly inhibited tumor growth (49.9%, <i>p=0.0004<\/i>, relative to vehicle control), and growth inhibition was associated with a 77% increase in plasma dC levels (<i>p&#60;0.0001<\/i>), relative to vehicle control, consistent with TRE-515 inhibitory activities on dCK. These data are in agreement with a previously reported study on target enzyme inhibition by TRE-515 which employed a clinically validated PET probe imaging of dCK. Taking together these results support the therapeutic potential for TRE-515 to selectively inhibit cancer cells that rely on dCK for DNA synthesis and rapid malignant proliferation. As such, TRE-515 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 open-label, dose escalation study in solid tumors (NCT #05055609).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/946e920f-9b12-4b34-b334-782acac57413\/@F03B8ZDg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA replication,Metabolism,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15056"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caius G.

Therefore novel approaches to overcome stromal mediated resistance to therapy represent a potential strategy to improve the outcome to chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade, particularly in tumors that have a fibrotic microenviroment. Autotaxin is an enzyme that converts Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA), a key pathway that is aberrantly activated in fibrosis. LPA has also been described to act directly on tumor cells, promoting their growth and proliferation via G protein-coupled LPA Receptors (LPARs). IOA-289 is a novel, potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of Autotaxin, a target with known clinical application in fibrotic diseases and with a strong rationale for exploration in cancer.<br \/>In preclinical models, IOA-289 modulated levels of circulating LPA in a dose dependent manner. At doses achieving at least 50% reduction of circulating LPA, IOA-289 showed monotherapeutic efficacy in <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse models of cancer. Notably the effects were most prominent in orthotopic models that recapitulate the stromal components of the microenvironment. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies investigated the mechanism of action of IOA-289, and it was shown to be driven by:<br \/>(i)Direct anti-tumor activity on cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> (ii)Modulation of the secretory profile of fibroblasts(iii)Increased T cell infiltration <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i><br \/>In a healthy volunteer study following a single oral ascending dose, IOA-289 showed a dose dependent increase in plasma and a corresponding decrease in circulating LPA. We also demonstrated that ATX was elevated in plasma from pancreatic cancer patients compared to samples from healthy volunteers and are correlated with soluble CA19-9.<br \/>Based on our preclinical data we postulate that inhibition of the ATX\/LPA pathway with IOA-289 may be a beneficial therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with fibrotic tumor microenvironments. The predicted biologically effective dose of IOA-289 has been calculated using PK\/PD modelling combining data from preclinical studies and from the phase Ia healthy volunteer study. IOA-289 is scheduled to enter a phase Ib clinical trial in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/53d3b480-2a81-47e8-9e93-7cb0c0a74ae7\/@x03B8ZDh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stroma,Immune cells,Lipids,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15058"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"b620297d-0d27-4110-9d93-5e7a89db50ff","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b620297d-0d27-4110-9d93-5e7a89db50ff\/@x03B8ZDh\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zoe Johnson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcel Deken<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ragini Medhi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Maggs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Carruthers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Cheasty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessia Tagliavini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Nizzardo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Pergher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karolina Niewola<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Fraser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Van der Veen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pritom Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi ZIviani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefano Milleri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Lahn<\/i><\/presenter>. iOnctura SA, Geneva, Switzerland, CRUK, Cambridge, United Kingdom, Evotec, Verona, Italy, iOnctura SA, Amsterdam, Netherlands, Centro Ricerche Cliniche di Verona S.r.l., Verona, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a026dade-2328-4e9e-af1f-307e97a555ca","ControlNumber":"2992","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Z.

This contrasts with the Luminal and HER2<sup>+<\/sup> subpopulations for which clinical precision therapies exist to target cancer proliferation and improve prognoses. Consequently, the discovery of new targets is necessitated by the TNBC subtype, which has the poorest patient outcomes. Our studies have identified MAP3K19 as one such potential target. MAP3K19 an understudied protein kinase with poorly characterized physiological functions outside of its roles in the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Broadly, the MAPK signaling has been associated with cell proliferation and differentiation in pathways both intracellular and extracellular, which in the context of cancer cell biology warrants investigation into cancer cell behavior as well as the associated tumor microenvironment (TME). The Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) is an open-access drug panel designed by GlaxoSmithKline to identify novel kinases. Preliminary PKIS cell-viability screening identified GSK1440913, GW494601, and GSK907232A as compounds with the most adverse effects on cell phenotype and growth in TNBC lines MDA-MB-231 and PDX-derived TU-BcX-49S. Analysis of common targets revealed MAP3K19 a common target, suggesting its importance in cancer cell growth and proliferation. AT-9283, a more specific MAP3K19 inhibitor, was used to support the initial results. Treatment with AT-9283 resulted in a dose-dependent killing effect. Furthermore, MAP3K19 inhibition resulted in decreased EMT gene signatures by qPCR. To summarize, MAP3K19 was identified by the PKIS screen as a major kinase in TNBC. Treatment with AT-9283, a more specific MAP3K19 inhibitor, resulted in cellular death and reversal in EMT gene signature by qPCR. Future directions for this project involve genetic knock-down and overexpression of MAP3K19 to evaluate its roles in biology and its signaling mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c725356-c3b3-4259-bcdd-2086253e0c81\/@x03B8ZDh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Small molecule inhibitor,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15060"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Khoa Nguyen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madlin Alzoubi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Elliott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Drewry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bridgette Collins-Burow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Brognard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Burow<\/i><\/presenter>.

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) block resolution of TOP1 cleavage complexes (TOP1CCs) induced by TOP1 inhibitors, thus unmasking the inability of remaining pathways to repair DNA damage. However, previous clinical trials combining PARPi with standard TOP1 inhibitors (irinotecan, topotecan) were terminated early due to dose-limiting myelosuppression. We evaluated the combination of SG with PARP inhibitor in both pre-clinical models and phase 1b clinical trial.<br \/><b>Methods and Results<\/b>: In pre-clinical models we demonstrated that the targeted antibody-based delivery of SN-38 increased the ratio of tumor-to-normal cell SN-38, resulting in stabilized TOP1CCs, enhanced DNA damage and increased cytotoxicity with the combination, selectively in tumor cells but not normal cells, despite temporal separation of SG and PARPi exposure. To validate the hypothesis, we conducted a phase 1b investigator-initiated clinical trial combining SG with PARPi (talazoparib) in patients with mTNBC (NCT04039230). Inclusion criteria included female patients &#8805; 18 years of age with mTNBC (per ASCO\/CAP guidelines) and previous treatment with at least one prior therapeutic regimen for mTNBC. Clinical outcomes were assessed by Objective Response Rate per RECIST v1.1. In the phase 1b clinical trial (SG day 1,8 every 21 days with talazoparib), the staggered schedule with supportive therapy was relatively well-tolerated without DLTs, as predicted by the pre-clinical models. Furthermore, the staggered schedule demonstrated promising clinical activity. Molecular analysis of paired pre-treatment and on-treatment specimens demonstrated &#947;-H2AX accumulation, confirming pharmacodynamic inhibition with combination therapy. The dose-escalation portion of clinical trial successfully completed enrollment with a recommended phase-2 dose (R2PD) of sequential SG (10 mg\/kg on days 1,8) with talazoparib (1 mg on days 15-21), every 21 days.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Staggered dosing of SG and PARPi, leveraging the selective drug delivery mechanism of SG to minimize toxicity while maintaining efficacy, was feasible and demonstrated encouraging evidence of clinical activity with objective responses among patients with mTNBC. The translational study highlights how mechanistic insights and innovative scheduling could be utilized to develop promising drug combinations, including previously rejected combinations, for patients with mTNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a796345c-e66f-4492-afb5-7c319cfddf14\/@x03B8ZDh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Targeted therapy,Phase I,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15061"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aditya Bardia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James T.

As a result, <i>MYC<\/i> expression is highly regulated, but once dysregulated in cancer, <i>MYC<\/i> promotes tumorigenesis via activation of cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis.<br \/>CDK9 is both an upstream and downstream cofactor of <i>MYC<\/i>. CDK9 promotes <i>MYC<\/i> expression through its recruitment to super enhancers at the <i>MYC<\/i> amplicon and acts as a cofactor to drive gene expression programs.<br \/>Previously, we profiled pan-cancer sensitivity to KB-0742, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of CDK9, and identified <i>MYC<\/i>-amplified cancers as being especially sensitive to KB-0742. To better understand the connection between <i>MYC<\/i> and KB-0742 sensitivity, 11 different tumor types were evaluated preclinically using immortalized cell lines, patient-derived cell lines (PDCs), patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).<br \/>The 11 indications included head and neck, esophageal, gastric, liver, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic, ovarian, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), prostate, colon, and lymphoma. For 5 of the indications (head and neck, esophageal, gastric, liver, and colon), little activity was observed in cell lines and in vivo with weak correlations to <i>MYC<\/i> amplification. TNBC, ovarian cancer, and lymphoma showed good responses to KB-0742 treatment. For TNBC and ovarian, immortalized and patient-derived cell lines indicated lower IC50 values with increased <i>MYC<\/i> amplification or expression, but the results were not statistically significant. However, in vivo assessments using 15 PDX models showed good correlation of tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and <i>MYC<\/i> amplification\/expression, with some tumor regressions observed in several ovarian models. Two PDO models of TNBC with different treatment histories were also treated with KB-0742 and compared to 4 standard-of-care (SOC) compounds. KB-0742 showed much greater activity in the models, with maximal inhibition rates of 100% and 89%.<br \/>Cell-line screens of blood cancer-derived cell lines showed that lymphocyte-derived cell lines were the most sensitive to KB-0742 as compared to all other cancer types. We tested several PDX models for response to our compound. Treatment with KB-0742 resulted in TGIs of over 50% in several lymphoma models, including a TGI of 56% in 1 model of double-hit diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.<br \/>These data support the continual development of KB-0742, which is currently being tested in a phase 1\/2 clinical trial (NCT04718675). The dose-escalation phase is opened to relapsed or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

We, and others, have reported that HNSCC tumors significantly overexpress NEDD8 and exhibit high sensitivity to the first-in-class NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor pevonedistat. Here, we report that disruption of NEDD8-mediated protein turnover with pevonedistat dramatically augments cisplatin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in HNSCC models. Further analysis revealed that the specific pevonedistat target, CUL4A, played an essential role in driving the synergy of the pevonedistat and cisplatin combination. Targeted inhibition of CUL4A resulted in significant downregulation in Damage Specific DNA binding protein 2 (DDB2), a DNA-damage recognition protein that promotes nucleotide excision repair and resistance to cisplatin. Silencing of CUL4A enhanced cisplatin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in a manner similar to that of pevonedistat demonstrating that targeted inhibition of CUL4A may be a novel approach to augment cisplatin therapy. Administration of pevonedistat to mice bearing HNSCC tumors significantly decreased DDB2 expression in tumor cells, increased DNA damage and potently enhanced the activity of cisplatin to yield tumor regression and long-term survival of all animals. Our findings provide strong rationale for clinical investigation of CUL4A inhibition with pevonedistat as a novel strategy to augment the efficacy of cisplatin therapy for patients with HNSCC and identify loss of DDB2 as a key pharmacodynamic mediator controlling sensitivity to this regimen.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b4d2c2eb-f04e-49c1-879f-d989575b26da\/@x03B8ZDh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neddylation,Nucleotide excision repair,Cisplatin,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15063"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Trace M.

High risk MDS is invariably fatal due to either severe cytopenia, or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Inhibitors of transcription offer promising potential for new therapies. Modulation of CDK9 activity, which plays a critical role in controlling gene transcription through phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, has been proposed as a novel therapeutic approach. In this study, we examined the efficacy of alvocidib, a broad spectrum CDK inhibitor with highest potency against CDK9, which is hypothesized to slow transcription via inhibition of CDK9, leading to stalled RNA Polymerase II and cell death. We employed a previously characterized pre-clinical model of MDS based on the NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene, which induces MDS that progresses to AML in mice. In addition to alvocidib, we evaluated the in vitro efficacy of 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) and Decitabine (DAC), which are hypomethylating agents used in treatment of MDS. The in vitro assays demonstrated a potent effect of alvocidib on cell lines that expressed the NHD13 fusion gene. Alvocidib induced a clear cytostatic effect and showed increasing cytotoxic effects with time, peaking at 70% cell death after 72 hours. Annexin-V staining further supported these results, revealing that most cells were apoptotic by 72 hours. Neither 5-Aza nor DAC treatment matched these effects in vitro. The in vivo assays were based on treatment of chimeric mice with both wild type (WT) and MDS hematopoiesis, generated by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant with bone marrow from WT and NHD13 mice. Four treatment groups (saline, 5-Aza, Alvocidib, and 5-Aza+Alvocidib) were assessed by serial flow cytometry and complete blood counts. In contrast to in vitro studies, in vivo results did not show a clear survival benefit from either group receiving alvocidib, whereas 5-Aza treatment demonstrated statistically significant survival. However, this study revealed several &#8220;exceptional responder&#8221; mice, defined as mice that demonstrated a &#8805;75% reduction in WBC count and a &#8805;50% reduction in NHD13 engraftment levels following transformation to AML; these exceptional responses were observed only in mice receiving alvocidib. This type of dramatic response has not previously been observed in over 20 prior chimeric transplant experiments employing the NHD13 mouse model. Ongoing efforts include follow-up studies to evaluate the frequency of exceptional responders, as well as identification of acquired mutations which collaborate with the initiating mutation (NHD13) to generate AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9360edef-6b09-46df-bf18-0bf783bd28f1\/@x03B8ZDh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,Myelodysplastic Syndrome,Nup98-HoxD13,Alvocidib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15064"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan M.

We reported previously that Chr22q11 amplification, leading to BID overexpression, was associated with apoptosis in upon AURKB inhibition (AURKBi) in NSCLC cell lines resistant to EGFR TKIs. However, it remains to be elucidated whether high levels of BID expression are associated with sensitivity to AURKBi beyond NSCLC and Chr22q11 amplification.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A panel of 11 solid tumor cell lines were used in the study. Also included were the EGFR-mut cell lines PC9 and 11-18, and 36 EGFR-TKI resistant clones derived from them. FISH and Q-PCR were used to determine copy number status; mRNA expression was studied by nCounter and RT-Q-PCR and protein expression by Western blotting. The effects of drugs were analyzed by MTT and flow cytometry. CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used for KO generation while ectopic expression was achieved by cloning the <i>BID<\/i> gene into a doxycycline-inducible pTRIPZ vector. Finally, <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments were performed by implanting tumor cells into athymic nude mice.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> First, we analyzed copy numbers of <i>BID<\/i> and other 22q11 genes, together with BID expression levels, in the 49 cell lines included in the study . Then, we determined the dose-response curves of the cell lines for AZD2811, a specific AURKB inhibitor. We found that tumor cells with high <i>BID<\/i> expression levels were consistently sensitive to AURKB inhibition, independently of 22q11 amplification, while cell lines with low <i>BID<\/i> expression were uniformly resistant (r=0.91, p&#60;0.0001). Also, the growth of xenografts derived from the BID-high expressor H1819 cell line was inhibited by AZD2811. Gene silencing consistently rendered BID-high expressing cell lines fully resistant to Aurora B inhibition. Conversely, ectopic BID expression in BID-low cell lines significantly increased sensitivity to AURKB inhibitors particularly in absence of <i>KRAS<\/i> or <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations. Experiments using doxycycline gradients established that cell growth inhibition after treatment with AZD2811 was dose-dependent on the BID expression levels (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.97). Western blotting experiments in parental and BID-silenced cells demonstrated that AZD2811 induced apoptosis in sensitive cells by a mechanism mediated by CASP-2 activation, leading to CASP-3 cleavage. In addition, CRISPR KO of the PIDDosome components (CASP-2, PIDD1 and CRADD) mimicked the effects of BID silencing, rendering BID-high expressing cells resistant to AURKB inhibition. Finally, a prevalence study including 118 tumor samples of different solid malignancies revealed high BID mRNA levels in 6% of cases.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>BID upregulation switches cell fate from survival to apoptosis in response to AURKB inhibition in a wide range of tumor cell lines from different origins.

Following an iterative medicinal chemistry campaign; stringent biochemical, pharmacological and ADMET funnel screening identified promising INV-88 lead candidates with potent antitumor activities. Strong MIF binding by INV-88 compounds was demonstrated using thermal shift and fluorescence polarization assays. Profound <i>in vitro <\/i>antitumor pharmacological properties of INV-88 were established on several murine &#38; human tumor cell lines (HCT116, MeWo, DU145, 4T1, B16-F10, CT26).

By curbing the transcription of ribosomal RNAs they block the rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. We have recently identified specific and selective first-in-class inhibitors of Pol I. This class of Pol I inhibitors, represented by small-molecule BMH-21, blocks transcription initiation and elongation and causes the destruction of the enzyme catalytic subunit. BMH-21 activity is genetically dependent on Pol I in cancer cells and in yeast confirming the targeting specificity. Our earlier mechanistic and efficacy studies with BMH-21 have demonstrated the utility of the approach in targeting colon and prostate cancers and melanoma. The goal of this study was to pinpoint cancer types with specific sensitivity to these inhibitors and to identify markers of this sensitivity. To do so, we undertook unbiased large-scale cancer cell line screens with our Pol I inhibitors and conducted correlative analyses using open source DepMap and Achilles databases to identify cancer types and features that sensitize cancer cells to these inhibitors. The most sensitive lineages were colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, leukemia, myeloma, and ovarian. Comparison of the cancer cell line responses to the Achilles gene essentiality database showed high correlation to genetic knock-out of three Pol I subunits. This unbiased finding strongly supports identification of Pol I as the target. Further, we identified two ribosomal proteins, RPL22 and RPL22L1 as the top genetic and expression markers denoting sensitivity, and MDM4, a p53 transcriptional repressor, as the top protein marker. Together, these three markers conform to a new p53 regulatory pathway. These findings were validated using genetic and mechanistic analyses. We show that Pol I inhibition alters the MDM4 splicing and decreases the expression of MDM4 isoform that represses p53, and that this activity is dependent on the RPL22\/RPL22L1 proteins. Notably, perturbation of the biomarkers is strongly associated with mismatch repair defective (MMRd) cancers.

To investigate the mRNA processing pathways in patient samples, we performed a comprehensive, tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling-based proteome and phosphoproteome profiling of the normal and ovarian cancerous tissues from patients treated with different chemotherapy revealed that malignant cells have overexpression of mRNA processing pathways compared to normal cells. For this analysis, equal amount of tissues were homogenized, and tissue lysates were collected and processed for the quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that spliceosome, basal transcription factors, mRNA surveillance, ribosome and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes pathways are upregulated in cancer cells compared to control. On other hand, pathways associated with metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis were downregulated in malignant cells. Moreover, kinase Enrichment Analysis shows that CDK2, ATM, ATR, and MAPK associated kinases are upregulated in cancer cells compared to normal. Based on proteome analysis of patient samples, we investigated the pharmacological inhibition of Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1). This is an RNA binding protein and key regulator of pre-mRNA alternative splicing and processing. We recently showed that a natural product-derived small molecule (SU056) inhibits YB-1 activity. We found that SU056 binds to the YB-1 and blocks the RNA binding pocket. Proteomics results suggest that treatment with this drug strongly inhibits the spliceosome pathway. SU056 treatment arrests the ovarian cancer cells in G1 phase and inhibits the CDK2 and Cyclin E. SU056 inhibits the tumor progression and metastasis in the ID8 mice model and sensitizes the OVCAR8 NSG mice model for paclitaxel treatment. Our study provides a compelling case for YB-1 inhibition using SU056 as a potential therapy for ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/07f6bb2b-5259-43a7-bc04-5b7dbc2f478c\/@y03B8ZDi\/mp4?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Small molecule inhibitor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15070"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dhanir Tailor<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Feng Tsai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Honkala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenqi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanja Pejovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjay V.

The PAD4-mediated hyper citrullination reaction in neutrophils causes the release of nuclear chromatin to form a chromatin network termed Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). NETs have been shown to be associated with several pathological processes including, fibrosis, ischemic stroke, preeclampsia, thrombosis, cancers, and other autoimmune diseases. In the context of cancer, tumors secrete chemokines such as CXCL1 and GCSF to recruit and prime neutrophils to form NETs, which in turn, facilitate cancer metastasis by forming Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) clusters and potentially increasing tumor cell extravasation. Therefore, cancer cell endogenous PAD4 seems to play a significant role in metastasis, and inhibition of PAD4 could be a novel strategy to inhibit cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we describe a series of novel small molecule PAD4 inhibitors that are selective and orally bioavailable for the treatment of cancer.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> Potency and selectivity were evaluated in ammonia release assay using recombinant PAD enzymes. Cellular potency was evaluated by assessing the modulation of citrullination in a human neutrophil-based assay. ADME surrogates and PK studies were conducted using appropriate preclinical models. In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in syngeneic mice tumor models.<br \/><i>Results:<\/i> Multiple leads with strong in vitro potency on PAD4 (&#60; 0.200 &#181;M) were identified. One of the leads (JTxPAD4i) showed an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.102 &#181;M against recombinant human PAD4 in the biochemical assay and a similar potency on mouse PAD4. It was selective against PAD1, PAD2, and PAD3 enzymes (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>&#62; 10 &#181;M). In the human neutrophil-based assay, JTxPAD4i inhibited H3-Histone citrullination with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.125 &#181;M. It showed an oral bioavailability of greater than 50% across species, including mouse, rat, and dog. Oral dosing with JTxPAD4i at 50 mg\/kg, BID, in 4T1 mice syngeneic breast cancer model resulted in ~50 % tumor growth inhibition (TGI) as compared to ~35% TGI with anti-PD1 antibody and was well tolerated. TGI was associated with strong inhibition of histone citrullination and myeloperoxidase (MPO) that are markers for NET formation. There was also a strong and significant inhibition in inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-17, and IL-1&#946; in the tumor. Similar TGI was observed in additional breast and lung cancer syngeneic models with more than one PAD4 inhibitor from our lead series. Further studies with our lead molecules are underway to elucidate the mechanism of action of these PAD4 inhibitors.<br \/><i>Conclusion:<\/i> These studies clearly emphasize the potential of PAD4 inhibition in the treatment of cancer and our lead PAD4 inhibitors are being profiled in advanced toxicology studies to be developed as a clinical candidate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/565074fa-253c-4cca-957b-276e05388466\/@y03B8ZDi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,PAD4,citrullination,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15071"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dhanalakshmi Sivanandhan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sridharan Rajagopal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chandru G<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohd Zainuddin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naveen Sadhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramachandraiah Gosu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Rastelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Siddiqui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharad Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rudresh G<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadanand Mullurwar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saravanan Kandan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santosh Vishwakarma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gurulingappa Hallur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi Trivedi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeyaraj D A<\/i><\/presenter>.

One of the features of BC is deregulated transcription, which allows for classification of the disease based on gene expression signature into four basic types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and triple negative (TNBC) \/basal-like. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting oncogenic transcriptional programs may represent a promising strategy, in particular for TNBC, where the lack of common genetic alterations has so far limited the development of targeted therapies.<br \/>The CDK8 module functions as a master coordinator of transcription, bridging enhancers and core promoters. Meta-analysis of curated TCGA data reveals that &#62;15% of all BC have increased expression of CDK8 and\/or CDK19, and that elevated expression of both genes is associated with decreased overall survival. High CDK8 expression is inversely correlated with the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and positively correlated with occurrence of TP53 mutations.<br \/>RVU120 is a specific, low nM, selective inhibitor of CDK8\/CDK19, currently being tested in a first-in-human Phase Ib clinical trial in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors progressing from previous lines of therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05052255).<br \/>In order to establish a rationale for treatment of BC with RVU120 we have interrogated a panel of cell lines representing various subtypes of BC. These studies revealed that TNBC and ER-\/PR-\/HER2+ cells were highly sensitive to RVU120 and also to two other non-related CDK8\/19 inhibitors, indicating a class effect. In contrast, CDK8\/19 inhibitors were not able to inhibit mitogenic effect of estrogen, confirming differential efficacy in hormone - independent BC.<br \/>Detailed transcriptional profiling of RVU120-responder cells revealed high enrichment of STAT3 target genes, SOX4 target genes and gene hallmarks of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), signatures associated with invasiveness and stemness. Non-responder cells were characterized by enrichment of transcriptional signatures of ER activity. Further proteomic profiling show that the top responder cells were the Mesenchymal Stem-Like (MSL) molecular subtype of TNBC and were positive for transactivated pSTAT3. Transcriptomic RNAseq profiling of MSL TNBC cell lines indicated that among genes inhibited by RVU120 there was high enrichment of STAT1 (interferon signature), STAT3 (IL6- signaling) and STAT5 (IL2 signaling) dependent genes. Single agent efficacy of RVU120 has been confirmed in subcutaneous TNBC xenograft models in vivo at well tolerated doses. Overall, these studies provide rationale for further development of RVU120 in TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/da874986-380d-4023-aaa1-d7de912df802\/@y03B8ZDi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,CDK8,CDK inhibitor,Mesenchymal stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15074"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Urszula Pakulska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta Obacz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aniela Go&#322;as<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Milena Mazan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Magdalena Masiejczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agata Stachowicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justyna Martyka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Micha&#322; Combik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kinga K&#281;ska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katarzyna Wiklik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristina Goller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>El&#380;bieta Adamczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krzysztof Brzózka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Tomasz Rzymski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Nuclear &#946;-catenin-TBL1\/R1-TCF7L2 axis activity and EVI1 expression characterize leukemia stem-progenitor cells, supporting their self-renewal and blocking differentiation. EVI1 is overexpressed in AML with chromosome translocation t(3;3) or inv(3) at 3q26, where the distal GATA2 hematopoietic enhancer is repositioned to induce EVI1 overexpression while repressing GATA2. EVI1 overexpression confers poor response to therapy and inferior relapse-free and overall survival in AML. Tegavivint (BC-2059, Iterion) targets TBL1\/R1 and disrupts its binding to &#946;-catenin and TCF7L2, repressing MYC, cyclin D1 and Survivin, leading to apoptosis of AML cells. Here, we determined that treatment with TV (10-100 nM) dose-dependently induced apoptosis in AML cell lines (UCSD-AML1, MUTZ3 and OCI-AML20) and patient-derived (PD) AML cells (AML191 and AML194) with 3q26.2 lesions with\/without monosomy 7. This was associated with attenuation of protein levels of EVI1, TCF7L2, c-Myc, c-Myb, RUNX1, CEBP&#945;, c-KIT, BCL2, Bcl-xL and MCL1, but upregulation of CD11b, BIM and cleaved PARP levels. Additionally, by reducing BRD4 occupancy at GATA2 enhancer and repressing EVI1, the pan-BET protein inhibitor OTX015 (100-1000 nM) also dose-dependently induced apoptosis of AML cell lines and PD AML cells with t(3:3)\/inv(3). RNA-Seq and gene set enrichment analysis in AML cells showed that TV treatment caused log2 fold-enrichment of gene sets of inflammatory response, TNF&#945; and interferon signaling, TGF&#946; and apoptosis signaling, but negative enrichment of gene sets of c-Myc, E2F, DNA replication\/repair, as well as showed reduction in expression of WNT targets and 17-gene stemness score. Confocal microscopy showed that TV treatment disrupted co-localization EVI1 and &#946;-catenin with TBL1, also confirmed by Proximity Ligation Assay. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis confirmed that TV treatment attenuated EVI1, c-Myc, RUNX1, &#946;-catenin, TBL1\/R1, Bcl-xL, BCL2, MCL1 and Ki67 but augmented protein levels of APC and cleaved PARP in phenotypically characterized AML stem cells harboring t(3:3)\/inv(3) and EVI1 overexpression (with high expression of CLEC12A, CD123, CD244, CD99). <i>In vitro<\/i> co-treatment with TV and BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax or OTX015 synergistically induced apoptosis (determined by SynergyFinder) of AML cell lines and the PD AML cells. In the tail-vein infused and engrafted PD AML191 cell model in NSG mice, treatment with TV and\/or venetoclax or OTX015 for 6 weeks significantly reduced AML burden and improved overall survival of the NSG mice more than treatment with each drug alone or vehicle control, without any toxicity. These findings highlight that targeted inhibition of TBL1\/R1-nuclear &#946;-catenin-TCF7L2 axis combined with BET protein or BCL2 inhibition is effective therapy against AML models harboring 3q26 lesions and EVI1 overexpression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ff714731-baa9-4a50-b8b7-1c7ccc2ba0e2\/@y03B8ZDi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"&#946;-catenin,Acute myeloid leukemia,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15076"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christine Birdwell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Warren C.

The CXCR4\/CXCL12 axis is hijacked by various cancer types characterized by dramatic CXCR4 and\/or CXCL12 upregulation. This chemokine network misregulation causes hyperactivation of CXCR4-mediated processes, leading to (1) excessive stimulation of protective tumor-stromal interactions, (2) metastatic expansion of CXCR4<sup>+<\/sup> cancer cells to CXCL12-rich sites, and (3) intratumoral infiltration of CXCR4<sup>+<\/sup> immunosuppressive cells. Accordingly, CXCR4 antagonists have significant therapeutic potential against cancer. While clinical CXCR4 inhibitors are severely limited by suboptimal pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and off-target activities, several of our tetrahydroisoquinoline-based CXCR4 antagonists exhibit superior selectivity and PK profiles to these clinical comparators (<i>e.g.<\/i>, X4P-001).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: To test the hypothesis that improved PK profiles would translate to enhanced efficacy, our lead CXCR4 antagonist EMU-116 was compared to X4P-001 head-to-head in three mouse models of genitourinary cancers. First, human 786.0 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) xenograft-bearing female nude mice were treated p.o., q.d. with vehicle, axitinib (30 mg\/kg), X4P-001 (100 mg\/kg), EMU-116 (3, 10, or 30 mg\/kg), X4P + axitinib, or EMU-116 + axitinib. Subcutaneous tumor volume was monitored using calipers. Second, nude male mice bearing intratibial, luciferase-expressing human PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts were treated with vehicle (p.o., q.d.), docetaxel (10 mg\/kg i.p. weekly), X4P-001 (10 or 30 mg\/kg p.o., q.d.), EMU-116 (10 or 30 mg\/kg p.o., q.d.), X4P + axitinib, or EMU + axitinib. Intratibial tumor volume was monitored via luminescence imaging. Third, syngeneic RENCA RCC tumor-bearing female Balb\/c mice were treated p.o., q.d. with vehicle, X4P-001 (30 mg\/kg), or EMU-116 (30 mg\/kg). Subcutaneous tumor volume was monitored using calipers, and immune cell subsets in bone marrow, blood, tumor, and tumor-draining lymph nodes were quantified via flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: In the RCC xenograft model in combination with axitinib, EMU-116 (3 or 10 mg\/kg) was equally effective at decreasing tumor burden compared to X4P-001 (100 mg\/kg), whereas EMU-116 (30 mg\/kg) was more effective. In the bone metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model, EMU-116 was as or more effective than X4P-001 when paired with docetaxel. In the syngeneic RCC model, EMU-116 mobilized T cells more effectively than X4P-001.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: EMU-116, at the same or lower dose, was more efficacious than X4P-001 in these models. These results highlight EMU-116 as a clinical candidate with significant therapeutic potential to synergize with chemotherapeutics, targeted therapies, and immuno-oncology agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a99e7fb4-e9cb-4d1d-be8b-cbd5232fe340\/@y03B8ZDi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokine receptor,CXCR4,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15117"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eric J.

Current AR antagonists and AR signaling inhibitors (ASIs), used in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and to prevent disease progression, often fail due to production of alternatively spliced AR variants (AR-Vs) that lack the LBD but retain the DBD, which is essential to AR transcriptional activity. This project examines a series of novel compounds designed to inhibit AR-DNA interaction and study how these compounds affect castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).<br \/>Methods: Compounds potentially targeting the DBD were used to predict direction and position of compounds when docked to the AR. MTT assays, flow cytometry, immunoblots, qRT-PCR, luciferase assay, and immunofluorescence were used to test compounds on AR and PCa. Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS) tested potential binding of the compounds to the AR. Studies in intact mice were used to determine toxicity of the compounds and the maximum tolerated dose.<br \/>Results: Of 48 compounds synthesized, C15 had the highest and most consistent efficacy overall. C15 decreased metabolic activity in 22Rv1 and CWR-R1 cells that express AR-Vs and in C4 and C4-2 that do not express AR-Vs. Further, C15 had a reduced effect in AR-null PC3 cells and minimal effect in normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells. In C4-2 and 22Rv1, C15 significantly reduced PSA mRNA and AR transcriptional activity, and in C4-2, C15 significantly reduced TMPRSS2 and Nrdp1 mRNA levels. C08 and C15 reduced pronase-induced AR proteolysis only when the AR DBD is present. Furthermore, C15 reduces AR binding at the PSA enhancer, but DHT stimulation may weaken this binding inhibition and reduction in AR transcriptional activity. However, combining C15 with an AR inhibitor targeting the LBD (enzalutamide, darolutamide, apalutamide) restores the full inhibitory potential and even reduces metabolic activity and AR transcriptional activity further than either drug alone in both C4-2 and 22Rv1s. No toxicity in intact mice was observed with C15 with the highest dose tested being 50 mg\/kg.<br \/>Conclusion: Our preliminary data demonstrate that C15 directly binds to the DBD of the AR and potently inhibits CRPC cells, including those that express AR-Vs missing the LBD. Although increased DHT levels may weaken C15&#8217;s inhibition of the AR DBD, addition of a LBD-targeting AR inhibitor improves the inhibitory potential of both drugs. Based on these results, we conclude that C15 may hold great clinical potential as it successfully inhibits CRPC by targeting the AR DBD with minimal toxicity, and it can improve the effects of standard-of-care LBD-targeting AR inhibitors by reducing AR-V-induced resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6925b9a-7311-4ab4-b289-b8c9d849c80e\/@y03B8ZDi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor DNA-Binding Domain,Reversal of Drug Resistance,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15118"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Thomas M.

Hence, inhibition of TNKS1\/2 can stabilize AXIN proteins, and consequently &#946;-catenin degradosomes, resulting in inhibition of WNT\/&#946;-catenin signaling. Although several potent small-molecules have been developed to inhibit TNKS1\/2 and oncogenic WNT\/&#946;-catenin signaling, also showing convincing anti-tumor effects in numerous mouse cancer models, there are currently no TNKS1\/2 inhibitors available in the clinic. The development has mainly been disadvantaged by concerns over previous reports unfolding intestinal toxicity, apparently caused by on-target and WNT\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway-specific side effects, and a deficient therapeutic index. Here we show that the novel, highly potent and selective1,2,4-triazole-based TNKS1\/2 inhibitor OM-153, displaying improved ADME-properties and mouse pharmacokinetics, reduced WNT\/&#946;-catenin signaling and tumor progression in COLO 320DM colon cancer xenografts upon peroral (PO) administration of 0.33-10 mg\/kg twice daily (BID). In addition, combined OM-153 and anti-PD-1 treatment conferred a synergistic anti-tumor effect in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. In a 28-day repeated dose mouse toxicity study, body weight loss, intestinal damage and tubular damage in the kidney was documented after PO BID administration of 100 mg\/kg. In contrast, in mice treated PO BID using 10 mg\/kg, the intestinal architecture was intact and no atypical histopathological changes were observed in other organs, while clinical biochemistry and haematological analyses did not identify any changes indicating considerable toxicity. The results provide a scaffold for using OM-153 as a potential anti-cancer treatment and additional preclinical and clinical evaluations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/520c2587-967f-4684-b890-633ab1069aa0\/@z03B8ZDj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutics,Wnt signaling,Colon cancer,Toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15119"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shoshy Alam Brinch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enya Amundsen-Isaksen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Espada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Aizenshtadt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lone Holmen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clara Hammarström<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Merete Høyem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanne Scholz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gunnveig Grødeland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sven T.

FDA approval of TIVSOVO<sup>(R)<\/sup> (IDH1 inhibitor) has validated the clinical importance of targeting tumor metabolism in cancer. Although MCT1-targeting small molecule inhibitor is currently under investigation for lymphoid cancers, the therapeutic efficacy of this compound is compromised by compensatory overexpression of MCT4 by tumor cells. Therefore, there is a need for a dual MCT1\/4 inhibitor to target cancer. We have developed a first-in-class orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor that targets lactate transport through MCT1 and MCT4 transporters. In 4T1 syngeneic model, we observed a significant dose-dependent reduction of tumor growth by NGY-B treatment that also correlated with serum lactate levels. Immunoprofiling of tumors revealed that NGY-B promoted anti-tumor immune response in 4T1 tumor bearing mice indicating simultaneous immune activation. Also, the combination of NGY-B with a checkpoint inhibitor led to greater efficacy and overall survival in this model suggesting a potential combination therapy in the clinic. Furthermore, we demonstrated the direct tumor cell killing effect of NGY-B in multiple human CDX and PDX models. Therefore, NGY-B intervenes two key hallmarks of cancer - tumor metabolism and anti-tumor immunity, and provides a novel modality to therapeutically target cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fb6c8faf-74a2-465d-b452-ee8946694e22\/@z03B8ZDj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Tumor therapy,In vivo ,syngeneic, PDX and CDX models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15517"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sambad Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Goreczny<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Bowman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Duffy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daliya Banerjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanath Wijerathna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Dzuris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerui Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shih-Ying Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhishek Tyagi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kounosuke Watabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaime Escobedo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Sandanayaka<\/i><\/presenter>.

Earlier we have shown that a defined GAG sequence of six residues, but not four or eight residues, inhibits colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) by inducing activation of p38 MAPK. To transform this sequence into a drug-like molecule, we developed a synthetic mimetic of the GAG sequence, labeled as G2.2, which was also found to selectively target CSCs over bulk adherent tumor cells. Unfortunately, G2.2&#8217;s oral bioavailability was low. To improve upon its drug-like properties, we pursued a hypothesis-driven analog design to derive three lipid-modified analogs (LMAs). Across a panel of &#62; 15 patient-derived colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, which could be stratified according to their clinically-relevant consensus molecular subtypes, LMAs showed enhanced potency while retaining selectivity against CSCs in spheroid inhibition assays. Both G2.2 and LMAs displayed better inhibition of cell lines with mesenchymal phenotypes and metabolic dysregulation. Microarray-based screening against more than a dozen receptor tyrosine kinases led to identification of IGF1R as a potential receptor of the synthetic GAG mimetics. To ascertain these screening results, biophysical studies were performed to clarify preferred soluble and\/or cell surface target receptors. In line with microarray results, G2.2 preferentially bound to IGF1R in comparison to its soluble ligand IGF-1. G2.2 also preferred IGF1R as compared to an alternative receptor FGFR1. Further, LMAs bound to IGF1R with improved affinities as compared to parent mimetic G2.2, which could explain anti-CSC inhibition results. Unexpectedly, detailed fluorescence titrations revealed that IGF1R affinity of LMAs is minimally impacted by salt concentration, suggesting that these GAG mimetics utilize non-ionic forces in binding, which support the selectivity of target engagement. Overall, this work proves a powerful proof of concept that synthetic GAG mimetics, such as G2.2 and LMAs, present a unique class of anti-cancer therapeutics with high potential for selective elimination of the tumor initiating subpopulation of CRC cells in patient tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/08401089-f107-4826-8478-a15b234d91a3\/@z03B8ZDj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,Cancer stem cells,Colorectal cancer,Tumor initiating cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15518"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Connor O'Hara<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shravan Morla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravikumar Ongolu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nirmita Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rio Boothello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhaumik Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Umesh Desai<\/i><\/presenter>.

DHL harbor translocations in MYC and BCL2 or BCL6, THL contain translocations in MYC\/BCL2\/BCL6, and DEL are characterized by high expression of MYC and BCL2. Menin is a scaffold protein that drives oncogenic function through its regulation of genes such as <i>HOXA9<\/i>, with distinct effects on transcription that are directed by various cofactors. A recent study reported that knockdown of <i>HOXA9<\/i> resulted in marked growth inhibition of multiple myeloma (MM) cells (Chapman et al., 2017). We previously reported the ability of irreversible menin inhibitor, BMF-219, to modulate <i>MYC <\/i>expression and exhibit high potency against DHL DLBCL preclinical models. Moreover, we demonstrated that MYC and its co-factor MAX, regulate differential gene expression in BMF-219-treated leukemia cells. Here, we demonstrate the anti-tumor activity of BMF-219 in HGBCL and MM preclinical models harboring various mutational backgrounds. BMF-219 exhibited high potency against THL and DEL cell lines, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.27 &#956;M and 0.37 &#956;M, respectively. Both models achieved &#62;90% growth inhibition with single-agent treatment. Notably, BMF-219 was multi-fold more potent and exerted dramatically greater growth inhibition compared to clinical reversible menin inhibitors in all DLBCL cell lines tested, including an expanded panel of DHL cell lines. In <i>ex vivo <\/i>studies, an R-CHOP refractory THL patient sample and an R-EPOCH refractory MYC-amplified DLBCL patient sample were highly sensitive to BMF-219 treatment, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.15 &#956;M and 0.2 &#956;M, respectively, and demonstrated complete growth inhibition at 1 &#956;M exposure. In contrast, two clinical reversible menin inhibitors demonstrated much lower potency (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 0.96 &#956;M and 6.3 &#956;M in the MYC-amplified model, and IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 5.63 &#956;M and not calculable for the second reversible inhibitor in the THL model). MM cell lines harboring mutations in TP53, KRAS and NRAS were all sensitive to BMF-219 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the range of 0.25 &#956;M to 0.5 &#956;M and achieved 100% growth inhibition at 1 &#956;M exposure. Combination treatments of BMF-219 with standard-of-care agents in MM cell lines were also tested. Notably, BMF-219 demonstrated single-agent efficacy (IC<sub>50<\/sub> values between 0.1 &#956;M and 0.3 &#956;M) against a panel of newly diagnosed and R\/R <i>ex vivo<\/i> MM samples, including a p53-deleted clinical profile. Collectively, our data demonstrate the novel and robust anti-tumor activity of BMF-219 in HGBCL and MM preclinical models that represent categories of high unmet need. BMF-219 exhibits multi-fold higher potency and complete growth inhibition in these preclinical models compared to clinical reversible menin inhibitors, demonstrating its unique anti-tumor potential in these cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ad0fb26-69d2-4b07-b1b3-f21d5906b874\/@z03B8ZDj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Menin,Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL),Multiple Myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15520"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Priyanka Somanath<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Law<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James T.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins that mediate cellular responses to endogenous (amines, cations, lipids, peptides, glycoproteins) and exogenous (light, tastants, odorants) stimuli. Altered signaling pathways associated with GPCRs are implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases, such as CXCR3\/4\/5, S1PR1\/2\/3, GPR34 in lymphomas. Olfactory receptors (ORs) are GPCRs, initially identified and characterized for their expression in olfactory neurons but now recognized as expressed in different tissues. OR51E1 is known as prostate specific G protein coupled receptor 2 (PSGR2) due to its expression in prostate cancer, OR2B6 and OR2W3 are expressed in breast cancer, and OR51E1 in melanoma. OR13A1 has been included in the double-hit expression signature reported in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Ennishi et al 2019). Here, we studied OR13A1 in lymphoma cell lines and clinical specimens.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>RNA-Seq and real-time PCR for evaluating the expression of ORs in DLBCL cell lines. Gene expression data for clinical samples obtained from public dataset phs001444.v2.p1. OR13A1 silencing performed with both siRNAs (OCI-Ly1, U2932) and doxycycline-inducible shRNAs (U2932); viability assessed after 3 days using MTT and for longer with Incucyte live imaging. Computer modelling performed based on available ligands for the murine orthologue Olfr211 and similar known GPCRs structure.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. Only one OR per cell line was usually expressed, as reported for olfactory cells. Using RNA-Seq and real-time PCR, OR13A1 gene appeared the most abundantly expressed in lymphomas cell lines compared to others ORs. Its expression was seen in 35\/47 B cell lymphoma lines, with higher expression in germinal center B cell (GCB) DLBCL than activated B cell like (ABC) DLBCL (P 0.03). A similar pattern was observed in patients: higher expression in GCB than ABC and in EZB than MCD (P &#60; 0.001). OR13A1 also appeared higher in normal GC cells than in na&#239;ve and memory B cells. Among GCB DLBCL patients, OR13A1 expression was associated with inferior outcome. Silencing of OR13A1 with siRNAs in GCB and ABC DLBCL cells caused &#62; 50% reduction in cell viability, and pERK downregulation. Viability data were confirmed using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system and live cell imaging instrument. Natural compounds reported as ligands for the murine orthologue Olfr211 or <i>in silico<\/i> identified to bind as agonists (ex: tyramine) increased cell line growth and compounds predicted to bind as antagonists (ex: cyclohexanone) decreased the cell viability in the presence but not in the absence of the GPCR.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>. OR13A1 gene appeared more abundantly expressed in lymphomas compared to others ORs, higher in GCB than ABC DLBCL and with a possible impact on clinical outcome. Genetic and chemical experiments showed that this GPCR has an essential function in lymphoma cells and could represent a novel therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e14f8adb-f59f-4cce-aec8-5b30b41be47f\/@z03B8ZDj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),olfactory receptor,Natural products,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18161"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Giulio Sartori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luciano Cascione<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Milos Matkovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroaki Matsunami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Cavalli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Francesco Bertoni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
