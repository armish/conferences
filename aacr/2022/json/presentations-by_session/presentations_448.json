[{"Abstract":"Adult glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadly form of malignant brain cancer. A broad relationship between tumor progression and neuronal stimulation in the microenvironment is known in peripheral tumors, but only a few interactions between neuronal cues and GBM cells have been characterized. By combining <i>in utero<\/i> electroporation (IUE) with CRISPR\/Cas9 and piggyBac transposase genetics, we have developed an endogenous, immunocompetent, in vivo model with which to study these interactions in a native tumor context. Combining this model with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) we interrogated tumor-neuron interactions. We assessed molecular and physiological changes in tumors during neural stimulation through tumor development with single cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. We examined expression data in populations present under stimulation that did not appear or appeared later in control tumors. These data showed axon guidance genes, a family of genes associated with directed cell motility, were upregulated in these populations. To functionally test these findings, we performed a barcoded screen of axon guidance genes in the IUE model followed by individual confirmation with gain and loss of function of individual genes. We found Sema4F affects infiltration of tumors as well as overall survival. Currently we wish to study the abrogation of this infiltration with Sema4F knockout in the context of DREADD stimulation. Completion of this study will provide new insights into neuronal interactions driving tumor progression in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/420b1a61-5974-49ad-ba91-e3365f477b0b\/@r03B8ZLt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Mouse models,Invasiveness,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11556"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emmet J.

While it has been shown that ovarian cancer cells invade towards mature adipocytes in vitro, the contribution of stromal cells that reside in the omentum is not well understood. We hypothesize that preadipocytes, the precursor cells that give rise to omental adipocytes, are important mediators of cancer progression in the omental tumor microenvironment as they have a pro-inflammatory secretome that is distinct from that of mature adipocytes. To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested whether preadipocyte secreted factors altered tumorgenicity of ovarian cancer cells using colony formation and cell viability in vitro and a limiting dilution in vivo in a subcutaneous mouse model. The mouse studies showed that low dilutions of cancer cells require preadipocytes for engraftment and tumor formation. A transplantation assay showed that cancer cells require the presence of preadipocytes for sustained tumor formation capacity. In vitro co-culture assays revealed that preadipocytes secrete factors that increase clonogenicity and extend cell viability in serum-free conditions. To identify signaling pathways induced by preadipocytes we co-cultured cancer cells with either primary human omental preadipocytes or differentiated mature adipocytes derived from the same female donor and performed RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We identified differentially expressed genes in cancer cells that were unique to preadipocyte co-culture, including DCN, MMP2, COL6A2 and COL12A1, genes involved in extracellular matrix organization. The most significantly upregulated gene was insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), which has functions in insulin-like growth factor signaling and ECM interactions. Ongoing studies using CRISPR edited cancer cells suggest IGFBP5 mediates the enhanced tumorigenesis of cancer cells in the presence of preadipocytes. Our findings highlight the role of preadipocytes in the ovarian tumor microenvironment and implicate IGFBP5 as a preadipocyte-mediated gene. Future studies will determine if there is a link between the upregulation of IGFBP5 and modulation of extracellular matrix proteins that promote cancer progression. Understanding these processes will enable the design of more effective therapies for treating ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40777cb2-1670-47cc-9dd8-3b67a5ebaa4f\/@s03B8ZLu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adipocytes,Extracellular matrix,Tumor microenvironment,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11557"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer A.

Despite progress in research, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in North America and is the most frequent type of cancer for women. Better treatments and diagnostic tools have increased breast cancer survival rates, but there is still a fundamental lack of understanding in tumor progression. Previous studies show the normal mammary microenvironment can influence non-mammary cells and tumor-derived cancer cells to participate in normal mammary gland development. The tumorigenic cells lose their tumor-forming capabilities and are &#8220;redirected&#8221; into phenotypically normal, non-tumorigenic cells. The purpose of this study is to obtain knowledge of the mechanisms that play a role in cancer cell redirection and therefore be able manipulate those mechanisms for therapeutic treatment in a clinical setting. Our hypothesis is that microenvironmental elements control whether a tumorigenic cell will enter a redirected state. We have developed and validated an <i>in vitro<\/i> model to mimic the mammary microenvironment to study cancer cell redirection. We found that when cancer cells that overexpress HER2+ are redirected in our cancer redirection model, phospho-HER2+ is silenced. We use HER2+ phosphorylation as a marker for cancer cell redirection though not a mechanism for cancer cell redirection.<br \/>Materials and Methods: HER2+ breast cancer cells and normal breast epithelial cells (BECs) were co-cultured in ratios of 1:1 or 1:50. Monocultures of breast cancer cells and BECs were used as controls. Western analysis and immunostaining was used to assess attenuation of HER2<sup>+<\/sup> and phospho-HER2<sup>+<\/sup> receptors and RNAseq was used for pathway analyses. Images were taken using a Leica confocal microscope. For comparison of 2 or more groups, a one-way analysis of variance was performed. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.<br \/>Results and Discussion: We found that the redirected cells underwent a phenotype shift in which the redirected cells adopted a normal mammary epithelial phenotype based on gene expression profiles. Furthermore, when HER2+ breast cancer cells were redirected in vitro they lost their tumor-forming potential in vivo. Signal pathway analyses revealed that redirected cancer cells are adopting a normal phenotype compared to breast cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusions: These results indicate that epithelial cells provide signals that influence HER2+ breast cancer cells to undergo a shift in phenotype. The phenotypic shift in cancer cell redirection includes multiple intracellular signaling pathways that may be the key towards effective cancer treatment.<br \/>Acknowledgements: This research was supported by South Carolina Idea Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (SC INBRE).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a015ad09-228d-4940-9a01-5a0a21c0ad26\/@s03B8ZLu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,HER2\/neu,Microenvironment,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11558"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Caroline J.

We found consistent and plastic network responses to polarization durations and WGP treatments compared to those of the mouse counterparts. Consistent responses included enhanced <sup>15<\/sup>N<sub>2<\/sub>-tryptophan catabolism to quinolinate, <sup>2<\/sup>H<sub>2<\/sub>-glucose oxidation to ribose\/ribulose-5-phosphate, and conversion of <sup>13<\/sup>C<sub>5<\/sub>-glutamine to itaconate in response to pro-inflammatory (M1) versus anti-inflammatory (M2) stimuli. WGP robustly induced the buildup of <sup>2<\/sup>H<sub>2<\/sub>-glucose-derived 6-phosphogluconate, -lactate, and -IMP, <sup>13<\/sup>C<sub>5<\/sub>-glutamine-derived fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and increased enrichment of <sup>2<\/sup>H-labeled UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in M2-M&#934;&#8217;s. However, the Krebs cycle activity was variably enhanced by M2 stimuli or WGP treatment. The consistent effects were related to increased release of proinflammatory IM effectors IL-1&#946;\/CXCL10\/IFN&#947;\/TNF&#945; by M1-M&#934;&#8217;s and enhanced release of IL-1&#946;\/TNF&#945; to above M1-M&#934;&#8217;s levels in WGP-treated M2-M&#934;&#8217;s while boosting the latter in anti-inflammatory IL-10 release and maintenance of NAD<sup>+<\/sup> synthesis. They were also related to lower phagocytosis in M1-M&#934;&#8217;s and WGP-treated M2-M&#934;&#8217;s versus M2-M&#934;&#8217;s. Together with the expression changes of key protein regulators, we suggest enhanced tryptophan catabolism with blocked NAD<sup>+<\/sup> and UTP synthesis to be key to the consistent changes in immune functions in response to M1 stimuli. Likewise, increased glucose utilization via glycolysis and the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, and blockade of glutamine-fueled N-linked glycosylation could be linked to reversion of M2 to M1-type immune functions. Reprogrammed Krebs cycle and glutamine conversion to UTP occurred variably in WGP-treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> organotypic tissue cultures (OTCs) of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which could reflect variable M1 repolarization of tumor associated M&#934;&#8217;s. This in turn correlated with IL-1&#946;\/TNF&#945; releases and compromised tumor status, making patient-derived OTCs a unique model for studying variable immunotherapeutic efficacy in cancer patients. In conclusion, consistent and variable IM metabolic responses were evident in four human donors&#8217; M&#934;&#8217;s. WGP repolarized some M2 to M1-type responses while boosting other M2-type responses.

Previous studies from our group have discovered a novel interaction between KRAS and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) and have uncovered a significant role of this interaction in regulating KRAS signaling. Knockout of AGO2 in genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS driven pancreatic and lung cancer dramatically impacted tumor progression. Intriguingly, in pancreatic cancer loss of AGO2 expression resulted in early pancreatic intraepithelial lesions (PanINs) that failed to progress to PDAC. We observed increased senescence in these AGO2 knockout lesions that abrogated PDAC progression. Further, there was pronounced infiltration of immune cells in pancreata lacking AGO2 in comparison to wild type. We particularly observed a 20-fold increase in natural killer (NK) cells population in pancreata lacking AGO2. This instigated us to evaluate potential role of AGO2 in regulating immune microenvironment in pancreatic cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis of AGO2 knockout SW1990 PDAC cells revealed significant upregulation of inflammatory and interferon response pathways. We observed increased expression of several signaling proteins implicated in immune activation pathways. Further characterization of these knockout cells indicated upregulation of MHC proteins that consequently added to mechanistic insights. Additionally, we are also exploring syngeneic models of pancreatic cancer and we will present findings from our ongoing studies to evaluate the impact of AGO2 knockout on immune axis. Overall, our findings suggest potential involvement of AGO2 in regulating immune microenvironment in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8dbf4670-e84d-41e0-8268-b250d04e5b2f\/@s03B8ZLu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immunomodulation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11570"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer Hon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carson Kenum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pushpinder S.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at an elevated risk for developing colon cancer. Macrophages are important members of tumor microenvironment (TME) and promote inhibition of anti-tumor immunity by activation of immune checkpoints and other neo-antigens expressions. However, paracrine signals regulating these checkpoint expressions in macrophages need to be determined. Macrophage-derived WNT ligands play important role in tissue homeostasis in multiple organs. In the present study we have demonstrated that inhibition of macrophage-derived WNT promotes inflammation-induced colon cancer. In both the mice model and human <i>in vitro<\/i> model we have shown that the absence of macrophage-derived WNT promotes immunosuppressive microenvironment with upregulation of immune checkpoint expressions in tumor-associated macrophages and T cells.

The current standard of care includes maximal surgical resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Yet &#60;5% of GBM patients survive more than five years. This indicates a desperate need for more effective treatments, such as immunotherapy for GBM patients. Unfortunately, most immunotherapy trials, including vaccines, adoptive cellular therapy, CAR-T cells, and checkpoint blockade, showed only modest benefits in GBM patients. A major barrier to immunotherapy efficacy is GBM&#8217;s immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of few tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs; &#60;5%) but abundant myeloid cells, making it an immune cold tumor. By contrast, immune hot tumors, characterized by abundant tumoricidal effector T cells necessary to mount a meaningful attack, have consistently responded better to immunotherapy. Hence, a better definition of the heterogeneous cell types in the GBM microenvironment and their function is urgently needed. Fortunately, single cell transcriptomics approaches provide comprehensive and high-resolution cellular and molecular understanding to resolve this heterogeneity. Here we report an integrated, multiregional and -dimensional single cell transcriptomic analysis of 201,986 human glioma and immune cells derived from 44 tissue fragments from 18 human glioma patients. In doing so, we map GBM cellular heterotypia and spatial, molecular, and functional heterogeneity of glioma associated immune cells. We report extensive spatial and molecular heterogeneity of glioma cells, microglia, macrophages, and T cells within the same tumor samples in low grade gliomas, primary GBMs, and recurrent GBMs. Importantly, our analysis of 83,479 glioma infiltrating myeloid cells identifies 9 molecularly distinct myeloid subtypes: 4 microglial, 4 bone marrow derived macrophage and dendritic cells subtypes. Importantly, in multiple independent glioma patient cohorts, 5 of these myeloid cell subtype gene signatures were independent predictors of patient survival. We also provide evidence that cell:cell communication between glioma and immune cells is more robust than glioma:Tcells, indicating that myeloid cells form a communication hub <i>in vivo<\/i>. Additionally, we identified <i>S100A4<\/i> as highly expressed in immunosuppressive macrophages and T cells, and provide <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>evidence that S100a4 plays a critical role in promoting immunosuppressive phenotypes in glioma associated leukocytes. This study not only provides the first comprehensive single cell atlas of GBM to include both glioma and immune cells from same samples but also demonstrates its utility in elucidating cell:cell communication among different cell types <i>in vivo<\/i> and discovering new therapeutic targets for this poorly immunogenic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e47ab079-33d0-4319-991b-aa717f43ce33\/@s03B8ZLu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Glioma,Immune checkpoint,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11572"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nourhan Abdelfattah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Parveen Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caiyi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jia-Shiun Leu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William W.

These assays produce not only an estimate of the abundance of immune cells in the TIME, but also their spatial locations; however, there are currently few approaches to analyze the spatial context of the TIME. Thus, we have developed a framework for the spatial analysis of the TIME using Ripley&#8217;s K, coupled with a permutation-based framework to estimate and measure the departure from complete spatial randomness as a measure of the interactions between immune cells. This approach was applied to mIF data collected on tissue microarrays (TMA) and intratumoral regions of interest (ROIs), defined as &#62;90% tumor cells based on pancytokeratin expression and morphology, selected from whole tissue sections from high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients (HGSOC) in the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (94 subjects on TMAs resulting in 263 tissue cores; 93 subjects with 260 ROIs; 27 subjects included in both TMA and ROIs). Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for stage and age of diagnosis, were constructed to determine the association of abundance and spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs; CD3+), cytotoxic T-cells (CD3+ CD8+), and regulatory T-cells (CD3+ FoxP3+) with overall survival. For all models, the referent group was women with no positive cells for the marker of interest. In the analysis of ROIs, HGSOC patients with high abundance and low spatial clustering of TILs (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.069, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01-0.35) and cytotoxic T-cells (HR and CI not estimable as no deaths observed) had the best survival. This finding of better survival in patients with high abundance and low clustering of TILs and cytotoxic T-cells was replicated in the analysis of TMAs (HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.31-0.85 for TILs and HR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.02-0.53 for cytotoxic T-cells). We also demonstrated the models with both abundance and spatial information was more informative than abundance alone (p &#60; 0.01 for CD3+ and CD3+CD8+ in both ROIs and TMAs). High co-localization of regulatory T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells showed best overall survival on both ROI and TMAs (HR=0.49, 95% CI = 0.28-0.88 and HR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.25-0.71, respectively). The model with spatial co-occurrence information was significantly better than the model with only abundance (p &#60; 0.05). These findings underscore the prognostic importance of evaluating not only immune cell abundance but also the spatial contexture of the immune cells in the ovarian TIME. The use of our framework for spatial analysis of the TIME and immune cell clustering may be applicable in other cancers and provide a novel approach to identification of biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c39d3d92-5693-4383-a4df-105f790bab6a\/@s03B8ZLu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Statistical approach,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11573"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alex C.

Among them, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Since targeted therapy for breast cancer relies on the three receptors, treatment outcomes have been worst in TNBCs. However, clinical benefit of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone was demonstrated in the KEYNOTE-355 and IMPASSION-130 trials in terms of overall survival, opening new avenue for patients with metastatic PD-L1+ TNBC. After several studies with ICIs, researchers found that the tumor microenvironment affects the response rate of immunotherapies.<br \/>Therefore, to unravel the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment of TNBC patients, we collected 28 TNBC samples from 6 public single cell RNA sequencing breast cancer studies.<br \/>Results: From 124,301 cells populating tumors and tumor-microenvironment (TMEs), we first identified epithelial cells separately. Using epithelial cells alone, we identified the Baylor-proposed TNBC molecular subtype of each patient. This approach with epithelial cells revealed that 3 basal-like immune-activated (BLIA), 11 basal-like immune-suppressed (BLIS), 5 luminal- androgen receptor (LAR), and 9 unclassified subtypes. By comparing cell number and cell-cell interactions, the heterogeneity of TME-consisting cell populations between the TNBC subtypes was analyzed. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed their difference in activation, expansion, and exhaustion programs across patients. Among the subtypes, the LAR subtype had less amount of exhausted CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells. This finding was consistent with cell-cell interaction analysis. In the case of the LAR subtype, the interaction between regulatory T cells and CD8 T cells was less active than other subtypes. Also, the interaction between cytotoxic cells (T cells and NK cells) and regulatory T cells was less active in the LAR subtype. Additionally, tumor cells in the LAR subtype seem to inhibit cytotoxic cells to a lesser extent. When we repeated our analyses using whole cells including epithelial and immune-stromal cells, the molecular subtypes of each subject were changed (7 of 19, 36.8%). 4 of 11 BLIS were changed to BLIA, 1 of 11 BLIS were changed to mesenchymal (MES), and 2 of 5 LAR were changed to MES. Characteristics of immune cells in the epithelial-based LAR subtype were conserved in the whole cells-based MES.<br \/>Conclusions:This extensive meta-analysis of public single cell RNA sequencing analysis enhances our knowledge about the heterogeneity and dynamics of the tumor microenvironment. These results offer insights about potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for TNBC depending on their subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6fab123a-5579-4fd7-92bc-2e19cfaab8a8\/@t03B8ZLv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,TNBC,Tumormicroenvironment,Meta-analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11574"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyungsoo Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung Gwe Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soong June Bae<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chihhao Chu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung Hwan Ji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jee Hung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joon Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the context of ovarian cancer (OC), chronic stress promotes tumor growth, chemoresistance and modulates immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Moreover, previous work from our team suggests that chronic stress promotes an increased inflammatory response in OC. Our data show an altered CD4+\/CD8+ T-cell ratio and a heterogeneous expression of exhaustion markers in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Therefore, we hypothesized that chronic stress results in chronic inflammation and an immunosuppressed TME. To address this, we obtained ascites from 66 patients with HGSOC and measured cytokine levels using a comprehensive Cytokine\/Chemokine immunoassay. Cortisol, corticosterone, and stress hormone metabolites (metanephrine and normetanephrine) levels from ascites were measured by ELISA. CD8+ T-cells isolated from OC patient ascites were stimulated with epinephrine, and flow cytometry was used to measure co-expression of CD38 activation marker and Granzyme B, an essential mediator of CD8+ T-cell killing capacity. To further establish the impact of chronic stress on tumor progression, we subjected IG10 or ID8 tumor-bearing C57\/BL6 female mice to daily restraint stress. Mice were sacrificed 8-12 weeks after inoculation, data collected, and ascites stored. Results showed an increase in inflammatory cytokines (Eotaxin, IL-6, and IL-7) in recurrent tumors of HGSOC patients. IP-10 and IFN-&#947; were negatively associated with cortisol levels. Moreover, normetanephrine levels positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, MCP-1, MCP-3, VEGF, GRO, and IL-7. Metanephrine was also positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines: SCD40L, FGF-2, and MIP1&#945;. Ascites-derived CD8+ T-cells treated with epinephrine showed decreased co-expression CD38 and Granzyme B. Additionally, data show that daily restraint stress led to increased tumor growth in ID8 and IG10 syngeneic mouse models of OC. Ascites derived from our animal models suggest a positive correlation of inflammatory cytokines VEGF, TNF&#945; and Eotaxin, and corticosterone levels in ID8 tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest a role for stress hormones in inflammation and immunosuppression. In conclusion, inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in recurrent HGSOC ascites samples. Cytokines that regulate T-cell function were negatively associated with cortisol levels, while stress hormone metabolites correlated with higher inflammatory cytokines.

Macrophages are highly abundant immune cells in the prostate cancer TME. Macrophage phenotypes can be modeled on a continuous spectrum of M1-like (anti-tumor macrophages) to M2-like (pro-tumor macrophages) and most macrophages in the prostate cancer TME are M2-like. Efferocytosis, the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, is a pro-tumor function of M2-like macrophages. We have developed a flow cytometry assay to quantify efferocytosis of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. With both cell line-based THP-1 macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs), we observe that M2 macrophages efferocytose LNCaP cells more than M1 macrophages. Based on literature from other models and contexts, efferocytosis further supports the M2-like phenotype. Efferocytosis also prevents the apoptotic cell from progressing to secondary necrosis, which would attract an M1-like macrophage phenotype. Due these aspects, we hypothesize efferocytosis in the prostate cancer TME is a tumor-promoting function of macrophages. Following efferocytosis of LNCaP cells by M2 HMDMs, we detect a decrease in the M1-like, anti-tumor marker CD80 and an increase in M2-like, pro-tumor markers CD206 and PDL1. Due to this role in modulating macrophage phenotype, we hypothesize targeting efferocytosis will slow prostate cancer growth and promote an anti-tumor immune infiltrate, including M1-like macrophages. MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates efferocytosis by binding phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. At both the protein and mRNA level, we detect higher MerTK expression in M2 than M1 THP-1 macrophages and HMDMs. Upon addition of apoptotic LNCaP cells, we observe an increase in phosphorylated MerTK (active form), suggesting the role of MerTK in prostate cancer cell efferocytosis. Currently, we are targeting MerTK to block prostate cancer cell efferocytosis <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We have generated a <i>Mertk<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>, Hi-Myc mouse model on the FVB\/N background. This prostate cancer GEMM will be used to assess the role of MerTK across different stages of prostate cancer progression. We will be comparing tumor size and immune infiltration between <i>Mertk<\/i><sup>+\/+<\/sup> and <i>Mertk<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> Hi-Myc mice aged to 2 months, 6 months and 12 months. We predict that the <i>Mertk<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice will have smaller tumors and an overall anti-tumor immune infiltrate compared to <i>Mertk<\/i><sup>+\/+<\/sup> mice in this model due to lack of efferocytosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc1471b3-9f12-4927-aa07-68b4327aa362\/@t03B8ZLv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Prostate cancer,Phagocytosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11609"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kayla V.

Bioinformatic analysis of scRNA was used to infer immune cell functionality.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>CD3+ T cell frequency was equivalent between CNS cancer lineages. Within gliomas T cells were confined to the perivascular space and the infiltrating edge. In lung metastasis, T cells are confined to the tumor stroma. CD163+ macrophages predominate in brain metastasis throughout the TME (p&#60;0.05), while CD68+ monocytes (CD68+, CD11c+CD68+, and CD11+CD68+CD163+) are more common in gliomas (p&#60;0.05). T cell dyad and cluster immune interactions were more common in the absence of nuclear STAT3 expression. T cells usually interact with CD163+ macrophages as dyads in metastasis at the brain interface (p=0.031) and within tumor (p=0.0009); in clusters throughout the TME (interface: p=0.024; tumor: p=0.01; necrosis: p=0.045), and as STAT3+ dyads and cluster interactions in the tumor (p&#60;0.05). Immune suppressed CD11c+CD163+ dendritic cells (tumor: p=0.036; and necrosis p=0.020) predominate in metastasis. In contrast, gliomas typically lacked dyad and cluster interactions except for T cell and CD68+ dyads in the tumor (p=0.023). Bioinformatic analysis of CD45+ scRNA seq data revealed that the majority of innate immune populations express both pro-inflammatory and immune suppressive genes and that subsets of CD68+ and CD11c+CD68+ cells expressed markers such as TMEM119, P2YR13 and CX3CR1 that identify microglia.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Current therapies are targeted to cell populations and singular pathways. Immunosuppressive macrophages dominate within the TME and targeting this population may create an environment that favors T cell activation and effective immune responses.

More intensive therapy leads to higher complete responses, which means an organ-preservation approach can be used. Insights in the biology of tumor response are essential for a successful implementation of such strategies, as different treatments may lead to specific tumor responses. In this study we aim to explore treatment-specific responses of tumor microenvironment and how these are related to patient outcome.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum who had received one of five different treatment regimens between 2015-2019 were included; no neo-adjuvant therapy (NT), neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), neo-adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT), neo-adjuvant radiotherapy with a long interval (LRT) or short interval (SRT). In order to minimize heterogeneity we excluded cT1 tumors, cT4 tumors as well as stage IV rectal cancers. Consecutive slides were stained for HE, LC3-II (autophagy stain) and a multiplex immunofluorescence VECTRA panel for CD8, CD3, CD20, Foxp3, CD11c and pan-CK AE 1\/3. Tumor response was scored by two independent investigators.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 80 rectal cancer patients were included. Median age was slightly biased, with older patients in the SRT groups and younger patients in the CT group (p=0.03). Less regression and more lymph-node involvement was seen among the CT group, while higher angioinvasion and lymph node involvement was seen in the SRT group. A fragmented pattern of response was more prevalent in CT and RCT treated patients (&#62;73% of cases), whereas a shrinkage pattern of response was predominant in RTL treated patients (64% of cases). Furthermore, autophagic activity in tumor cells was increased in RCT treated patients, especially compared to NT and CT. When analyzing the tumor immunophenotype, differences were found according to specific treatment regimens. RCT treated patients seemed to have lower stromal CD4+ cells, Foxp3+ cells and CD11c+ cells. The latter were found to be especially decreased in treatments will longer intervals (CT, RCT, LTR) compared to those with no treatment or immediate surgery (NT and SRT). The specific relations within the network of immune cells and how these relate to autophagy and the patterns of response are currently being evaluated. Thus, further results will follow shortly.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We demonstrated treatment-specific differences in the immune microenvironment landscape of rectal cancer patients. We found higher autophagic activity in patients who received RT treatment, especially significant in the RCT group. Lower immune cell density was observed in longer wait intervals, stressing the importance of immune recovery. Understanding the immune landscape after a specific therapy will shed light on to future treatment decisions, as using immunotherapy in combination with established treatments is the future of personalized therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/64485123-1407-48f7-b9eb-4a84f25e2cd5\/@k03B8ZLw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Tumor microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11612"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cristina Graham Martinez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yari F.

Aim of the project was to analyze the impact of TME on HCC versus CRLM. In particular, Tregs were evaluated in tumor (TT), peritumoral (PT) tissue and peripheral blood (PB) of liver tumor to identify immune mechanisms and therapeutic targets.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tregs were characterized on PB\/PT\/ TT cell suspension from 40 HCC and 34 CRLM by flow cytometry (FOXP3, CD25, CD4, CD45RA, CTLA-4, CXCR4, PD-1, ICOS and ENTPD1). PB-, PT- and TT-Tregs were isolated by Dynabeads Regulatory T-cell kit and tested for the capability to inhibit CFSE-labeled autologous T effector (Teff) proliferation. Tregs were also treated with Pep R29, a new CXCR4 antagonists, before coculturing with Teffs. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess the expression of cyto-chemokines in PT and TT samples (IL-15, Arginase, CCL5, CXCL12).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In HCC\/CRLM-PB higher number of CXCR4 (p&#60;0,001\/p&#60;0,05), CTLA-4 (p&#60;0,001\/p&#60;0,05), PD-1 (p&#60;0,001\/p&#60;0,05), ICOS (p&#60;0,05\/0,06% vs 0,03%) and ENTPD-1 (p&#60;0,001\/p&#60;0,05) expressing Tregs was detected as compared to healthy donors (HD). In HCC\/CRLM-TT higher number of FOXP3<sup>hi<\/sup>CD45RA<sup>-<\/sup>Activated Tregs subpopulation (p&#60;0,01\/p&#60;0,05) and higher CXCR4-positive Tregs (p&#60;0,05) were observed as compared to PT. Moreover, Tregs from HCC showed higher expression of ICOS (p&#60;0,05) and ENTPD1 (p&#60;0,05) as compared to CRLM. In terms of function, TT-Tregs exert a stronger immunosuppressive effect on Teffs proliferation than PT-Tregs (p&#60;0,05) as shown by IL-35 cytokine secretion (150 vs 15 pg\/mL\/p&#60;0,05). Interestingly, HCC-Tregs more powerfully inhibit Teffs proliferation at the tumor site and also in periphery. Expression of TME cyto-chemokines responsible of immunity promotion (IL-15) or inhibition (CXCL12, CCL5, Arginase) and tumor features, such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are under evaluation. Preliminary data showed higher CCL5, Tregs recruiting, in HCC as compared to CRLM suggesting a more suppressive TME in HCC. Based on high % of CXCR4-positive Tregs in HCC and CRLM (PB-HCC\/CRLM: p&#60;0,001 and TT-HCC\/CRLM: p&#60;0,01), ex vivo PB-Tregs were treated with Pep R29. CXCR4 targeting re-induced Teffs proliferation (PB-HCC -\/+ Pep R29:12% vs 32%, p&#60;0,001; PB-CRLM-\/+ Pep R29:18,3% vs 49%, p&#60;0,01) and decreased Tregs-derived IL-35 secretion (PB-HCC -\/+ Pep R29: 106vs 16,5pg\/mL, p&#60;0,05; -\/+ Pep R29:70 vs 0,6pg\/mL, p&#60;0,01).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>These data suggest a more suppressive TME in HCC compared to CRLM and highlighted CXCR4 antagonism as a potential strategy to overcome Tregs-mediated TME immunosuppressive function in HCC and CRLM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9714a9f4-3d62-4a68-9293-31449be4ca7f\/@k03B8ZLw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver,Tumor microenvironment,CXCR4,Regulatory T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11613"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Daniela Castaldo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Santagata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppina Rea<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Napolitano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Crescenzo D'Alterio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rita Guarino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vittorio Albino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Belli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Cutolo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Izzo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Stefania Scala<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The role of the ageing microenvironment in melanoma progression is now recognized where aged stromal cells undergo cellular and molecular changes that are tumour permissive. However, sex-based differences in melanoma incidence and outcome have also been observed even when adjusted for several prognostic factors including age, with men having poorer outcomes compared to women. While the mechanisms underlying this disparity are not well understood but attributed to sex-specific behaviors as well as to the biologically intrinsic differences. In addition, most preclinical studies have ignored the contribution of the host sex and age to therapy response, with majority of the studies typically performed in 6-8 week old male mice. Dermal fibroblasts (dFs) are established to have profound impact on melanoma progression. We examined if both sex-dependent and age-related changes in dFs can alter the course of melanoma tumor growth, visceral metastasis, dormancy and variable responses to targeted therapy. We find that age-matched female dFs undergo early replicative senescence accompanied by reduced proliferation and morphology change. Despite being senescent, age-matched female dFs showed reduced SASP characteristics. This was assessed by testing dFs derived conditioned media on melanoma cells in spheroid invasion and resistance to BRAF\/MEK inhibition which showed elevated expression of invasive drivers and oxidative stress from aged male dFs derived conditioned media. This was also apparent in vivo in syngeneic immunocompetent C57Bl\/6 mice that showed reduced tumor growth and increased invasion specific to the aged male host. Our data provides an integrated view of how age and sex attributes of dFs within the microenvironment contribute to disease progression. Bridging this knowledge gap will improve patient stratification and assist in tailoring the therapy and achieve gender-equitable healthcare.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45d25cd0-8595-4017-9af8-9c5d1b1040c4\/@k03B8ZLw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,Senescence,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11653"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yash Chhabra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Fane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Huser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Zabransky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan Brezka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gloria Marino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexis Carey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashani Weeraratna<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. A growing body of evidence suggest PDAC rely on mitochondrial function (oxidative phosphorylation, OXPHOS) for survival. However, PDAC liver metastases have been reported to have higher levels of glucose uptake compared to primary tumors suggesting that PDAC liver metastases may rely on glycolytic metabolism. Therefore, the relative metabolic and cellular profiles of primary and metastatic PDAC (mPDAC) remain unclear and the involved regulatory pathway(s) have not been elucidated. Our previous studies showed that liver endothelial cells (ECs) secreted soluble factors to promote the survival of colon cancer cells in a paracrine fashion. The influence of the liver EC microenvironment on mPDAC growth and metabolism has not been elucidated. In this study, we investigate the paracrine effects of liver ECs on the survival and metabolic profiles of PDAC and elucidate the involved mechanism(s).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Primary liver ECs were isolated from non-neoplastic liver. Conditioned medium (CM) from liver ECs were collected and then applied to PDAC cells, with CM from PDAC as control CM. Effects of CM on PDAC cell proliferation were measured by the MTT assay. Changes in phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) between PDAC CM and EC CM treated PADC cells were determined by a Phospho-RTK Array kit and then validated by Western blotting. Effects of EC CM on PDAC metabolism was assessed by ATP production with CellTiter-Glo and oxygen consumption rate with Agilent Seahorse Mito Stress Assay.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Compared to PDAC CM, liver EC CM promoted proliferation in different PDAC cells. We found that human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3, also known asERBB3) was only expressed and activated in BxPC-3 cells (HER3+ve), in which the HER3-AKT signaling pathway was activated by EC CM. Furthermore, blocking HER3 activation with a humanized HER3 antibody, seribantumab, significantly blocked EC CM-induced AKT activation and cell proliferation. Moreover, depletion of neuregulin (NRG) from EC CM attenuated HER3-AKT activation and indicated that EC-secreted NRG might play a role in promoting PDAC growth. Furthermore, EC CM decreased the levels of ATP production and O<sub>2<\/sub> consumption in PDAC cells, suggesting that EC cells reprogram PDAC metabolism away from OXPHOS mitochondrial metabolism.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Liver EC-secreted factors promoted PDAC growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, and HER3 was expressed in a subset of PDAC cells and mediated EC-induced proliferation. Moreover, EC reprogramed PDAC metabolism towards glycolysis, and inhibiting the activation of HER3 shifted PDAC metabolism to OXPHOS. Our findings provide a new insight to develop new combination of HER antibody and OXPHOS inhibitor for treating patients with HER3+ve mPDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9931049e-c3cf-4ebd-97a3-6bfdfab59c75\/@k03B8ZLw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Liver endothelium,Metabolism,HER3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11664"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wei Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel'le Wright<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moeez Rathore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mehrdad Zarei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Winter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

As immunotherapies have thus far proven ineffective in this disease, we sought to establish the determinants of immune recognition, avoidance and evasion in disease natural history to gain insight into the co-evolutionary processes underlying malignant progression and host immunity. Accordingly we linked mutational processes and anatomic sites of tumor foci as determinants of tumor microenvironment (TME) cellular phenotypes within and between patients using genome-based stratification of homologous recombination proficient (HRP) and deficient (HRD) disease subtypes, and profiling single cell phenotypes from ~1 million cells including cancer cells, T cells, myeloid cells and fibroblasts derived from single cell RNA sequencing, and in situ spatial profiling of histopathology, cancer cell, T cell and macrophage states of 160 tumor sites obtained from 42 treatment-naive patients. Mutational processes in HRD-Dup (<i>BRCA1<\/i> mutant-like) tumors were associated with cancer cell-intrinsic JAK\/STAT signaling and predominance of highly-differentiated dysfunctional CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the TME; HRD-Del (<i>BRCA2<\/i> mutant-like) tumors were associated with cancer cell-intrinsic NF-&#954;B and TNF&#945; signaling and expansion of M2-type macrophages; and foldback inversion (FBI, HRP) tumors were associated with cancer cell-intrinsic TGF&#946; signaling and overall immune exclusion, with a predominance of naive\/central memory-like T cells. Increased neoantigen burden and HLA loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were defining genomic features of the HRD, but not FBI tumors. These mechanisms of escape from immune predation, with distinct signalling activity and losses of HLA allelic diversity in HRD tumors, connect evolutionary selection with immunological phenotypic states. Multi-region sampling revealed substantial spatial variation, highlighting site-specific properties of the ovary and fallopian tube as putative &#8220;immune-privileged&#8221; sites. These results establish that in patients with widespread intraperitoneal disease, the local properties of organ sites may determine malignant cell selection and immune pruning. Furthermore, we observed that spatial cellular topology is a major determinant of tumor-immune interactions by in situ protein measurements, revealing ubiquitous PD1-PDL1 interactions in HRD tumors. Together, our findings yield mechanistic insights for how distinct mutational processes in HGSOC lead to diverse patterns of within- and between- patient variation in immune resistance, which can be exploited to optimize future immuno-therapeutic treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/579d5142-6bc7-42c9-87ee-65c95591d506\/@k03B8ZLw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Tumor microenvironment,Cancer genomics,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11674"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ignacio Vázquez-García<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Uhlitz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Ceglia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamie L.

Melanoma occurrence and severity increase with age while the anti-tumor responses decrease. There have been robust responses to immunotherapy treatments, however, there remains a subset of patients who do not benefit from these modalities. Understanding more about immune cell development and age-related changes in the bone marrow can improve patient outcomes. Our hypothesis suggests that during aging, changes in Wnt signaling reshape the aged bone marrow niche, driving precursor cells to become suppressive. This ultimately decreases the anti-tumor response to melanoma due to the skewing of hematopoiesis to yield decreased immune function. In a young and aged setting, we assess the effect of a Wnt inhibitor, sFRP1, on the development of immune cell subtypes by using flow cytometry. We have preliminarily observed <i>in situ<\/i> that sFRP1 is increased in the aged bone marrow through immunohistochemical staining. We also saw a decrease in CD4 and CD8 T-cells and an increase in CD11b positive myeloid cells in the tumors of young mice treated with recombinant sFRP1 compared to age-matched mice treated with PBS by using immunohistochemical staining. We hypothesize that the increase in sFRP1 in the bone marrow niche will impact immune cell development in the niche and the immune response at the tumor site. As a future direction, we plan to investigate combination treatments of anti-sFRP1 with immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1. These insights could lead to improve outcomes for elderly patients with melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c619f168-4d85-4fc1-b841-81e6038bd110\/@k03B8ZLw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Wnt signaling,Adipocytes,Bone marrow,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11702"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexis Erasta Carey<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yash Chhabra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Fane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Hueser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gloria Marino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Zabransky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashani Weeraratna<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite recent advancements in screening, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, the biology of aggressive LUAD is still poorly understood, and in-depth characterization associated with LUAD histologic subtypes and progression are needed. In this study, we sought to measure the immune environment associated with different LUAD subtypes using Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). IMC has emerged as a powerful new tool that enables the multiplex imaging of more than 50 markers simultaneously, quantify multiple protein expressions at a single cell level, and preserve tissue spatial information. We stained a tissue microarray of early stage LUAD patient samples, representing different LUAD subtypes, with a panel of 21 antibodies. These antibodies are designed to phenotype immune cell subsets, as well as using Ki67 to stain for highly proliferative epithelial cells. This will allow us to better understand how different immune cells are interacting with each other, as well as how they interact with highly proliferating epithelial cells. The resulting ablated samples generate images containing antibody intensity and coordinates, which we then perform cell segmentation to generate single cell data. The marker expression is then quantified, and single cell data analyzed using HistoCAT. Cell neighborhood interactions are analyzed based on spatial relationships, and similarly interacting cells are grouped into phenoclusters. Our results suggest that a Ki67 high phenocluster within solid LUAD subtypes have fewer macrophages (CD68, CD163) and T cell populations (CD8, CD4, FOXP3), however, are enriched for plasma B cells (CD20) and immune suppressive populations (PD1, PDL1). In contrast, a Ki67 high cluster within lepidic subtypes are enriched for of macrophage (CD68) and T cell populations (CD8, CD4, FOXP3). Using IMC, we have begun to identify immune subset shifts in LUAD. This early analysis of LUAD using IMC begins to shed light on the immune regulation that may indicate progression and\/or guide intervention approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/345c2de4-066d-41e6-bc30-921548d8dc91\/@k03B8ZLw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenocarcinoma,Microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11703"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhanhao Xi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roxana Pfefferkorn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Burks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Beane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Mazzilli<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently approved by FDA, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy showed marginally improved survival and only in a few patients, suggesting an inert immune tumor microenvironment (TME) and the existence of SCLC subtypes. Therefore, there is a significant need to develop more effective therapies for SCLC. In addition to the nearly universal biallelic inactivation of Rb and Tp53 genes in human SCLC tumors, comprehensive genome-wide screening studies have identified major co-occurring mutations in PTEN, CREBBP, EP300, SLIT2, MLL, COBL, and EPHA7 genes. Among them, SLIT2 showed the highest level of genomic abnormalities defined by a pronounced clustering of mutations and frequent genomic loss. However, the role of Slit2 in SCLC has not been defined yet. By using genetically engineered human SCLC cells overexpressing Slit2 or recombinant Slit2 (rSlit2) protein, we show that Slit2 inhibits SCLC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion properties and tumor sphere formation ability of drug-resistant SCLC cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. The mechanistic studies have identified inhibition of AKT and &#946;-catenin mediated signaling pathways by Slit2 overexpression. Next, we implanted human SCLC cell lines into the immunocompromised NSG mice subcutaneously followed by treatment with rSlit2 or sterile saline. Analysis of tumor volume over the 4 weeks showed that rSlit2 treatment significantly reduced the growth of SCLC tumors. Further analysis of tumors showed that rSlit2 treated tumors harbor less M2-like CD206+ macrophages. Overall, these results suggest that Slit2 possesses tumor suppressive properties and could be developed as a novel therapeutic agent against SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor biology,Macrophages,Tumor suppressor,Spheroids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11705"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dinesh K.

Currently, targeting the AR pathway, chemotherapy or immune-based therapies are major options but only provide a modest improvement in overall survival. RNA binding proteins have been shown to regulate AR expression in the progression of PCa. We and others have demonstrated that RNA binding protein RBM3 is upregulated in various solid tumors including PCa. We have also shown that RBM3 binds to 3&#8217;UTR of mRNAs of tumor-promoting factors and increases their mRNA stability and translation. However, the role of RBM3 in PCa is not well evaluated. We first analyzed the expression levels of RBM3 in the TCGA database. There was a significant increase in RBM3 expression even in cancers with a Gleason score of 6 upto Gleason 10 cancers. To confirm this we performed RT-PCR analyses of a prostate cancer cDNA panel. There was a significant increase in RBM3 expression in the PCa tissues compared to normal control. We used LNCaP and its derivative cell line C4-2B which show features of progressed disease such as metastatic capability and hormone independence. RT-PCR and western blot analyses demonstrated significantly higher RBM3 levels in C4-2B cells as compared to LNCaP cells suggesting a role for RBM3 in tumor progression. The tumor microenvironment also plays a very important role in prognosis of PCa. Specifically, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to increase metastatic potential and increase tumor angiogenesis. To determine the levels of RBM3 expression and its effects on macrophage infiltration, we mined the TCGA database using TIMER2.0 software. There was a positive correlation of RBM3 expression with infiltration of both M1 and M2 macrophages. To further study the effect of interactions between PCa cells and TAMs, we used immortalized THP1 monocytes, which can be activated to M1 and M2 macrophages. We observed that just converting the THP1 cells to M1 or M2 macrophages increased RBM3 expression in both cell types. Also, when M1 and M2 macrophages were treated with conditioned media from LNCaP or C4-2B cells, there was an induction in the expression of RBM3. Similarly, when conditioned media from M0, M1, M2 activated THP1 cells were applied to LNCaP and C4-2B cells, there was an increase in RBM3 expression in the PCa cells. This suggests a positive cross-talk between the macrophages and PCa cells. We evaluated the cytokine profile in the conditioned media from M1 and M2 macrophages and determined that while M1 macrophages had increased levels of CXCL10, M2 macrophages showed higher levels of IL4 and IL10. Moreover, PCa cells have higher levels of CXCR3, the receptor for CXCL10. Together, these data suggest that crosstalk between TAMs and cancer cells in the PCA microenvironment plays a significant role in increasing RBM3 expression, which in turn enhances global translation of disease progression related genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,RNA binding protein,macrophage,tumor microenvironment ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11707"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Afreen Asif Ali Sayed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Standing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prasad Dandawate<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shahid Umar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roy Jensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Parikh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shrikant Anant<\/i><\/presenter>.

The purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms by which lipid metabolism in prostate cancer cells influences the tumor immune microenvironment, with emphasis on the activation of macrophages. Our hypothesis that fatty acid synthase-driven <i>de novo<\/i> lipogenesis promotes immune evasion <i>via <\/i>alternative M2-like macrophage activation was tested using human monocyte (U937)-derived macrophages co-cultured with prostate cancer cells in the presence of fatty acid synthase inhibitors. Monocytes were differentiated to macrophages <i>in vitro <\/i>using phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate for 48 hours prior to co-culture with prostate cancer cells. Macrophage polarization following co-culture with prostate cancer cells was evaluated using multi-parameter flow cytometry to detect established M1 (CD80, CD86) and M2 (CD163, CD206) markers. Furthermore, the expression of fatty acid synthase and pan-macrophage marker CD68 in human prostate tumor tissue microarrays was evaluated using multiplex immunohistochemistry. The lipogenic enzyme and macrophage staining correlated with disease progression, reaching peak levels in metastatic tissues. These findings indicate that tumoral fatty acid synthase is an important mediator of tumor-immune crosstalk, particularly in the context of aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer. These data further suggest that fatty acid synthesis represents a targetable complement to immune-enhancing therapies by modulating tumor cell metabolism, underscoring the need for further evaluation of agents targeting lipid metabolism in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10ac65e1-da21-4de0-b424-de68bce32d39\/@m03B8ZLx\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Lipid metabolism,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11709"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shannalee R.
