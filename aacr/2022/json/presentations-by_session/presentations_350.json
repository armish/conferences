[{"Abstract":"Receptor occupancy (RO) assays are used to quantify the binding of therapeutic antibodies to their targets on the cell surface. This method can be used to in early drug discovery to determine the antibody binding capacity (ABC) of drug candidates to cells in culture to hone the desired drug characteristics during candidate screening or lead optimization. This method can also be used in xenografts or patient tissues to create pharmacodynamic (PD) data that directs the efficacy hypothesis and biomarker selection for clinical trials. The current approaches use flow cytometry on fresh specimens, which introduces many technical and logistical challenges and does not retain spatial information about the tissue. Here we introduce a new, simple method which can be performed on Formalin Fixed, Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) cells or tissues. This approach eliminates the challenges of flow cytometry methods, provides the type of quantitative data needed, and maintains the tissue contexture to study the effects of immune-directing antibodies in patient tissue samples. We describe a method for developing a standard curve to determine antibody binding capacity (ABC) using our Quanticell &#8482; fluorescent nanoparticle technology. We demonstrate this in a typical bispecific antibody use case, where both the immune-directing (CD3) and targeting (Her2) arms of the bispecific are modulated to create the desired efficacy characteristics. We demonstrate the establishment of a standard calibration curve for Her2 (BT474 \/ Her2+) and CD3 (Jurkat \/ CD3+) in cells with titrated amounts of anti-Her2 and anti-CD3 antibodies which target the extracellular domain necessary for these studies. We also show how the same Quanticell assay can be used in clinical tissue, to evaluate the localization of the drug targets and immune cells within the tissue context of human patient samples necessary to understand how pharmacodynamic properties of the drug can modulate immune contexture changes. The Quanticell&#8482; method is a simple immunohistochemistry (IHC) based method which allows extremely sensitive detection of therapeutic antibodies bound on FFPE fixed cells or tissue, which thus does not require the use of flow cytometry in fresh tissues, allowing simple use from early discovery through clinical research studies. Importantly, the Quanticell&#8482; method is capable of detecting a very large and linear dynamic range of analyte concentration to allow full quantification of ABC for RO studies. Critically, the Quanticell&#8482; method retains the tissue context, allowing for simultaneous and spatial evaluation of multiple analytes such as the target of the antibody and the immune contexture. This method allows for a consistent method for RO studies that can be applied to early discovery, translational, and clinical research to optimize drug efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a3ebe85-0942-4b2a-8f2e-70fd8ee3f568\/@r03B8ZDN\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunohistochemistry,Antibody engineering,Receptors,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12187"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Atsuro Tatsumi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keisuke Morichika<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Morel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omid Ghasemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroyuki Yokota<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Joseph S.

Multiple studies have described the tumor-promoting activity of specific aberrant cis-splicing variants and misregulation of trans-acting splicing factors in patients. Hence, the identification of aberrant splicing patterns has the potential to translate into actionable biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets, particularly for treatment insensitive cancers such as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Envisagenics&#8217; SpliceCore is an innovative cloud-based platform that integrates machine learning (ML) algorithms with high performance computing to analyze large RNA-seq datasets to predict biologically relevant, novel, and highly prevalent tumor-specific alternative splicing (AS) changes. Using SpliceCore, we have analyzed &#62;2500 RNA-seq samples from different breast cancer subtypes as well as normal breast tissue and identified several AS derived therapeutic targets with the potential to translate into therapeutic candidates for TNBC. Here, we report a novel, alternatively spliced isoform that is present in 60.5% of TNBC patients and correlates with poor overall survival. This cytoplasmic protein was previously described as a regulator of the TGF&#946; pathway; therefore, we have validated the isoform switching action in a TGF&#946; dependent tumor progression model and demonstrated the activity of Splice Switching Oligos (SSO) to modulate its effect. We observed that this AS was correlated to a differential response on subcellular localization for phSmad2\/3, Smad2\/3 and TGF&#946;RI. Pretreatment of the TNBC cells with SSO before TGF&#946; pathway activation modulates its proliferation response by affecting gene expression of p21, c-Myc and Smad7, leading to a decrease of cells in the G2 mitotic phase of the cell cycle and a loss of cell viability after the SSO treatment. More importantly, migratory response induced by TGF&#946; in TNBC cells was significantly inhibited by SSOs. Pre-treatment with SSO-0205 before TGF&#946; activation downregulated gene expression of Angiopoietin-like 4, Integrins &#945;5 and &#946;3, TGF&#946; associated migration markers, which was followed by a 55% decrease in cell migration. Our state-of-the-art ML technology, SpliceCore, has proven its ability to uncover novel disease-specific AS targets and to design splice correcting oligonucleotides for subsequent therapeutic development. Our data provides experimental proof of concept that has uncovered a novel therapeutic target for TNBC, whose aberrant splicing contributes to TNBC pathogenesis by misregulation of the TGF&#946; pathway. Moreover, SSOs predicted by SpliceCore were able to correct the aberrant splicing downstream effect, thereby uncovering a novel alternative splicing targeted approach for treating TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/af74af83-efe5-43e3-8b9f-0c05d5ca4bc3\/@r03B8ZDN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Splice variants,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12216"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"13878b4e-f972-4ade-93af-f9109f6f9cff","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13878b4e-f972-4ade-93af-f9109f6f9cff\/@r03B8ZDN\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Miguel A.

Among the reagents used to characterize biological systems at the protein level, antibodies are routinely applied, and engineered versions have proven useful for treating multiple therapeutic indications. We have generated a human proteome wide toolbox of polyclonal antibodies, identifying three antigenic 14mer sequences within each of the 20,000+ open reading frames at N-terminal, middle and C-terminal regions. Using a high throughput SPR system, Carterra LSA, we are able to define average on-rates, off-rates, and K<sub>D<\/sub>&#8217;s for pAb&#8217;s generated to important cancer regulators and biomarkers, including KRAS, STAT3, and Gli1. Due to the small size of the peptide targets, the kinetics of the observed interactions with polyclonal antibodies exhibit remarkable 1:1 fit typically observed when measuring monoclonal antibody affinities. The platform is a sensitive system capable of both identifying multiple antibody-antigen interactions with K<sub>D<\/sub> in the nanomolar to picomolar range, but also as a mass screening tool for developing <i>de novo<\/i> antibody pairs. We define the kinetic characteristics of these antibody reagents relative to performance in western blotting specifically. Improving the characterization of such widely used tools is critical for advancing translational opportunities into use in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5306acc-e0d8-4bf4-9c8d-5136aa936d46\/@r03B8ZDN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Biomarkers,Target discovery,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12192"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sergei Bibikov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Rosenfeld<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kevin J.

Blocking the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1 unleashes the immune system and enhances anti-tumor responses. Immunotherapy using PD-1 blockade has led to a paradigm shift in cancer drug discovery, due to its durable effect against a wide variety of cancers. However, despite its tremendous clinical success in cancer treatment, a significant fraction of patients and tumor types remain unresponsive to this therapy. This has led to the development of combination therapies combining PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors with a broad range of clinically active treatments including those targeting other IC receptors. A major challenge in immunotherapy drug development is the lack of quantitative and reproducible functional assays as existing methods rely heavily on primary immune cells and are highly variable. Here, we report the development of a suite of cell line-based reporter bioassays for monoclonal antibody targeting human PD-1\/PD-L1, or bispecific molecules target PD-1\/PD-L1 and a co-stimulatory receptor (e.g., 4-1BB, OX40, ICOS) or an immune inhibitory receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIGIT). A mouse PD-1\/PD-L1 assay and a human PD-1\/PD-L2 assay are also developed and can be used in parallel with human PD-1\/PD-L1 assay to address preclinical study and assay specificity. Each of these assays consist of two engineered cell lines: a T effector cell line that express a luciferase reporter driven by specific promoter\/response elements responding to the intracellular signals mediated by the T cell receptor (TCR), PD-1 and the second IC receptor, and an artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs). Particularly, the combination bioassays are able to measure the synergetic effect of PD-1 blockade with a second IC inhibitor receptor blockade or a costimulatory receptor activation. These reporter-based assays reflect the mechanisms of action for the therapeutic drugs of interest and are sensitive and quantitative. They are prequalified according to ICH guideline and demonstrated the performance characteristics (specificity, precision, accuracy, and linearity) to be used as potency assay for product release and stability studies during immunotherapy drug development and manufacture.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4a3c2c05-78a4-461e-9da5-c4f42f6f4175\/@s03B8ZDP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,PD-1,Cancer immunotherapy,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12197"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jamison Grailer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Gilden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Garvin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pete Stecha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Hartnett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Steven Edenson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mei Cong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi-jie Jey Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Whole mice or individual organs were optically cleared following novel protocols, which we termed <i>Rapid Optical Clearing Kit for Enhanced Tissue Scanning<\/i> (<i>ROCKETS<\/i>). The procedures enabled processing of mouse organs and entire bodies for LSFM. For the GI tract, we developed <i>3D-Swiss rolls,<\/i> a method that enables fixation, clearing and imaging of intestines in a compact form as a whole. The new procedures allowed us to investigate the biodistribution of G.8.8R in the entire mouse body and highly detailed in individual organs.<br \/>Results: The <i>ROCKETS<\/i> concept achieved full transparency of any mouse organ, the entire GI tract and whole mouse bodies. All positive organs were easily identified in scans of whole mice, thereby providing excellent guidance for scanning of positive individual organs at higher magnifications. We detected G8.8R bound to all normal cuboidal and columnar epithelia, as well as in lymphoid organs and were able to reproducibly score binding levels. All reported EpCAM+ tissues in mice were accessed by G8.8R after intravenous application and binding was restricted to basolateral membranes of epithelia, as expected from published expression analyses. Moreover, we detected G8.8R in tissues that were reported EpCAM- or were not investigated, e.g. gustatory papillae of the tongue, choroid plexi in the brain or lingual mucous salivary glands. <i>3D-Swiss rolls<\/i> of the GI tract revealed a highly heterogeneous binding pattern in the stomach, while the pattern along the small intestine was overall homogeneous. All binding was restricted to basolateral membranes of epithelial cells. We detected a general gradient of signals, decreasing from the bottom of the crypts to differentiated cells in all tissues, corresponding to described EpCAM downregulation with progressing differentiation. Furthermore, we first describe significantly increased signals at the common bile duct, major and minor duodenal papillae, as well as the mucosa in proximity of Peyer's patches (PP).<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>The developed <i>ROCKETS <\/i>toolbox allowed for simple preparation of mouse organs and bodies for high-quality LSFM imaging. Our investigations of the highly heterogeneous biodistribution of G8.8R revealed previously unknown EpCAM binding locations, which may have far-reaching implications for EpCAM-targeting therapeutics in general, many of which failed in clinical studies due to dose limiting toxicities. In the future, the developed LSFM-imaging platform may contribute valuable data to preclinical drug development studies of any targeted therapeutic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c01f3be1-280c-41fb-8b5f-a92e0461cf52\/@s03B8ZDP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Biodistribution,Ep-CAM,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12240"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joerg P.

Cytosolic DNA is sensed by the cyclic-GMP-AMP <u>synthase<\/u><u><\/u>-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, and in the case of tumors, activation of this pathway has potential to both positively and negatively modulate cancer development. Activation of the STING pathway is a key prerequisite for type I IFN production that is needed for either endogenous or treatment-induced cancer immune responses, and reduced cGAS-STING expression is associated with poorer survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, invasive breast ductal carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Intrinsic activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in the tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes cancer cell-intrinsic senescence and recruitment of immune cells, resulting in antitumor effects. For cancers that are difficult to treat and characterized by immune tolerance, combination therapies of STING agonists with immune checkpoint inhibitors represents a new paradigm in disease management. To date, only two early clinical trials of the STING agonist ADU-S100 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors are underway (NCT02675439 and NCT03172936). To progress clinical trials more rapidly and with better safety outcomes for patients with advanced treatment-refractory metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas, being able to reliably screen a variety of STING agonists in different types of <i>in vitro<\/i> cancer models is of paramount importance. We have previously reported a novel functional assay that is capable of demonstrating the potency level of different STING agonists, based on the IFN&#946; response in THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells. We further investigated the role of newly developed STING agonists and clinical compounds in phenotypic <i>in <\/i>vitro cancer cell and TME models to inform on oncotherapeutic development. STING-expressing cancer cell lines, chosen based on microarray mRNA expression, were treated with agonists and assayed for cGAS-STING activation status using a fully automated platform for high-content imaging. <i>In vitro<\/i> analysis demonstrated high phospho-STING activation at 4 hours. In the BioMAP&#174; Oncology Colorectal TME model, STING activation increased IL-6 release and the effect on other primary immune and tissue remodeling biomarkers will be discussed. Preclinical studies indicate that STING agonists, used as adjuvants in combination with other agents or radiation therapy, suppress tumor progression, reduce cellular toxicity, and eliminate metastases in breast and pancreatic cancer models. Phenotypic assays that provide human, translational data early in discovery are a valuable tool to accelerate progress in this area.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c94e49af-e2eb-4a6a-a990-f607e177b3b2\/@s03B8ZDP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Tumor microenvironment,Cytokines,Phosphorylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12248"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Satheesh K.

However, it is difficult to study the unique features of human immune cells in mice, and cell lines are often transformed or immortalized by genetic modification. Organoid platform has emerged as a powerful tool which maintains the architectures and distinctive functions of a specific organ. Although organoids still fail to model immune system accurately, co-cultures of organoids and lymphocytes may have promising applications. In this study, we developed a unique methodology to use organoids for understanding the role of epithelial cell-immune cell interactions in cancer. Using this immune-organoid tool we tested the infiltration and efficacy of TILs generated from patient tumor cells. We also tested if checkpoint blockade could amplify the immune cell infiltration in tumor using this organoid platform bringing hope for further application of this technology in immunotherapy. Single cell suspensions were prepared from patient tumor biopsy and seeded in ultra-low attachment (ULA) microplates in appropriate media to generate organoids. TILs were isolated from the same tumor and rapidly expanded in appropriate media. Tumor organoids and TILs were incubated with PD-L1 and CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody respectively for check point blockade. RFP-stained TILs were then seeded into inserts of a transwell receiver plate using specific tumoroid:TIL ratio. After 48 h organoids were analyzed by 3D Z-stack imaging and morphometric analysis with Cytation 5 software to quantify the lymphocyte infiltration. Using this immune organoid model, we were able to quantify the number of TILs that infiltrates inside the tumor organoids generated from a melanoma and a pancreatic cancer patient. We also found that PDL-1 checkpoint Blockade in tumor cells enhanced the TIL infiltration inside organoids. Moreover, we were able to isolate the infiltrated lymphocytes from the tumor organoids and characterized them by analyzing different markers and cytokines using FACS, RT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry. Therefore, this study has potential to be an excellent preclinical model for human tumors, translating basic cancer research to clinical practice as well as providing a new meaning to precision medicine by identifying and validating novel immune therapies for individual cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b3e0a2b2-75ee-4877-bb6a-3069a5b92ea9\/@s03B8ZDP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12246"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tithi Ghosh Halder<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shelby Rheinschmidt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trason Thode<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Sampson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Rodriguez del Villar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Serina Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexis Weston<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohan Kaadige<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffery Trent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Altin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Moser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erkut Borazanci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Gordon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Larson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raffaella Soldi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>.

A possible modality is to assess drugs sensitivity directly in the patients, by introducing small drug delivering devices in tumor sites for a very short period and then looking at the local anti-tumor effect. Here, we present the design of an innovative drug eluting device and its test with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib as an example of small molecules.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Mathematical models considered factors related to drug (MW), physical properties, desired concentrations in surrounding tissue, polymers and tissue physical features to identify the optimal polymers and the drug loading for the desired release profile over 24h. <i>In vitro<\/i> proliferation was measured with the MTT assay, <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments done in NOD-SCID mice (license TI05\/2021), and immunohistochemistry on FFPE xenograft sections stained for Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 (CASP-3).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Device was designed as an arrow-shaped cylinder, with flat end and flatter sections to be filled with the drug-eluting polymers. Prototypes were built in nylon6,6, a biocompatible but stable polymer. Ibrutinib was incorporated in low MW polyester poly-&#949;-caprolactone (PCL) as biopolymer by solvent casting. Polymeric coating onto devices was done with a dedicated automatic device.Devices loaded with biopolymer and different concentrations of ibrutinib or &#8220;empty&#8221; biopolymers were first <i>in vitro<\/i> tested using diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines. Over 72h, devices with drug inhibited proliferation of the ibrutinib-sensitive TMD8 and OCI-Ly10 cell lines, but not of the ibrutinib-resistant SU-DHL-2 and U2932. No effect was seen with devices with ibrutinib-free biopolymers. Devices, empty or loaded with ibrutinib (5&#956;g), were then inserted in xenografts of ibrutinib-sensitive cell line OCI-Ly10 and ibrutinib resistant U2932. After 24h, mice were sacrificed and xenografts analyzed. By Ki67 and CASP-3 a reduced cell proliferation and an increased apoptosis in the region surrounding the device was observed in the ibrutinib-sensitive xenografts, conversely nor reduced cell proliferation nor apoptosis induction were identified in the ibrutinib-resistant xenografts.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We have created a prototype of a device that can locally release drugs allowing the evaluation of anti-tumor activity, optimizing cures tailored to single patient.

In particular, tumor panels that cover a range of histotypes and molecular subtypes have been previously developed, such as the NCI-60, however they utilize cell lines and, in some cases, a 2D cell culture format, which limit their translatability to preclinical and clinical trials. Moreover, the biological complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has revealed a need for more translatable 3D <i>in vitro<\/i> tumor models that reflect the <i>in vivo<\/i> physiological outcome to therapies, particularly with the explosion of immunotherapy programs in drug discovery which target the immune compartment of the TME. Here, we describe for the first time a 3D in vitro PDX panel comprising 30 distinct PDX models in coculture with fibroblasts and PBMCs in engineered extracellular matrix hydrogels that display distinct similarities to the three compartments of the TME - tumor, stroma, and immune cells. Histotypes in the panel include, amongst others, Non-small cell lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, gastric, melanoma, and renal cancers. The panel is constructed in a high throughput 96-well format and rapidly assays tumor growth delay and other endpoints such as apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner across various drug modalities such as small molecules, biologics and cell therapy. The panel has been tested against targeted therapy (Docetaxel, Cisplatin) and immunomodulatory agents (Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab) and the results correlate to the corresponding PDX in vivo data. Interestingly, cisplatin treatment displayed an average size reduction of &#62;30% for melanoma but a varied response in NSCLC tumors. And, several NSCLC responded more favorably to checkpoint inhibitors, however, the lung epidermoid PDX demonstrated no significant response. Moreover, subsequent cytokine analysis and immunofluorescence staining of several models revealed protein signatures of cancer-associated fibroblasts and CD3+ sequestration in the tumor stroma in some 3D models, suggesting the fibroblasts&#8217; critical role in regulating the immune response. In short, the 30-PDX Panel described here represents a large step forward towards achieving translatable efficacy data at the earliest stages of drug discovery where little is known about the mechanism of action for a particular therapeutic agent or combination of agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/415923cc-9106-454a-9e2d-48e6960a83ef\/@s03B8ZDP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,3D models,Cancer immunotherapy,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12241"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kolin C.

Here, we investigated the growth inhibitory activities of the pan-Akt inhibitor ipatasertib and the CDK4\/6 inhibitor abemaciclib in combination with other targeted agents. Twelve well-characterized patient-derived cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Patient-Derived Models Repository (https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov\/models\/database.htm) and seven established cell lines from the NCI-60 tumor cell line panel (https:\/\/dtp.cancer.gov\/discovery_development\/nci-60\/cell_list.htm) were grown as multicellular 3D complex spheroids. The complex spheroids, a mixture of tumor cells (60%), endothelial cells (25%), and mesenchymal stem cells (15%), were grown for 3 days before drug(s) were added. All agents were tested both alone and in combinations at multiple concentrations up to their reported clinical C<sub>max<\/sub> value and cell viability was assayed using CellTiter-Glo 3D seven days after drug exposure. While abemaciclib had minimal activity as a single agent, ipatasertib was noticeably selective for tumor cells harboring activating PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway variants. Dual inhibition of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR and RAS\/MEK\/ERK pathways was one of the most effective combinations. For example, the combination of ipatasertib with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib or the ERK inhibitor ravoxertinib resulted in additive and\/or synergistic cytotoxicity in over half the complex spheroid models screened. The V600E variant-specific BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the KRAS G12C selective inhibitor sotorasib in combination with ipatasertib showed activity in the one BRAF V600E and two KRAS G12C variant containing complex spheroid models, respectively. Another effective ipatasertib combination was vertical inhibition of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway with the mTORC1\/2 kinase inhibitor sapanisertib, which demonstrated additive and\/or synergistic responses across multiple complex spheroid models. For abemaciclib, the most successful combination was with the CDK2\/7\/9 inhibitor BMS-387032, which achieved greater than one log of cytotoxicity in the majority of the complex spheroid models. For the combination of abemaciclib and selumetinib, there was a high correlation between the responses of two patient-derived cell lines grown as complex spheroids and their corresponding patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Additional PDX studies are planned for promising drug combinations from this <i>in vitro<\/i> screen. This project was funded in part with federal funds from the NCI, NIH, under contract no.

Such passenger genes are involved in essential cellular activities. We hypothesized that co-amplification of passenger genes create cancer-specific collateral therapeutic vulnerabilities. To test this, we analyzed one of the most commonly amplified gene locus near <i>MYCN<\/i>, which is amplified in nearly 25% of neuroblastoma and around 5% of all cancers. We observed that <i>DDX1<\/i>, a DEAD-Box helicase, is the most frequently co-amplified passenger gene in <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified cancers. Using CRISPR\/Cas9 loss-of-function screen results from the Cancer Dependency Map across 739 human cancer cell lines, we reveal that cells with <i>DDX1<\/i> co-amplification are highly dependent on the mTOR complex 1(mTORC1). Mechanistically, western blot and immunoprecipitation analyses shows that DDX1 expression leads to higher mTORC1 pathway activity through the interaction between DDX1 and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase(alpha-KGDH) in mitochondria. DDX1 hijacks alpha-KGDH complex, thereby impairing the function of the Krebs cycle by interfering with the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-coA. Live cell metabolomics shows accumulated alpha-ketoglutarate in turn activates mTORC1 pathway to promote the ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation(OXPHOS) to maintain cell survival. Consequently, interference with mTORC1 function reduced ATP production and led to accumulated alpha-KG leading to cell death, specifically in DDX1 expressing cells. This suggests that co-amplification of a passenger gene can result in collateral vulnerabilities in cancers, which has the potential to transform future therapeutic target discovery in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/802d9dd0-c87a-4f39-83aa-f4329fdffb9f\/@s03B8ZDP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Neuroblastoma,Target discovery,Cancer metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12244"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yi Bei<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marieluise Kirchner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Brame<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raphaela Fritsche-Guenther<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Koeppke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anja Heeren-Hagemann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Mertins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Dörr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anton George Henssen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Historically, logistical and technological limitations have hampered the scale of phenotypic small molecule screening across genomic diverse models. Until recently, large scale phenotypic screening across many cell lines, reflecting the somatic diversity in cancer, has not been possible. The PRISM technology does allow for a high-throughput approach to phenotypic viability screening by pooling cell lines and deconvoluting their response to small molecules using unique integrated DNA-barcodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we report on the results of a large phenotypic screening effort to identify novel small molecules and targets that can expand our knowledge on cancer vulnerabilities and can spur development of phenotypic drug discovery. A library of 18.000 compounds was assembled based on structural diversity and ability to induce gene-expression changes. Of these 18.000 compounds, around 3.500 were found to reduce cell viability of at least 5 cell lines in the PRISM assay. Of the cytotoxic compounds, we did not identify many small molecules that correlated strongly with CRISPR KO dependency data from project Achilles, and instead found that gene-expression correlations hold much more predictive value. By using additional approaches, we were able to identify the target of select novel cytotoxic small molecules and their respective mechanism-of-action. To our surprise, we have identified few compounds that act as canonical inhibitors of cancer drivers, and instead found compounds that act as molecular glues, prodrugs or inhibitors of more general cellular processes. These findings make a strong case for large scale phenotypic viability screening across genomically diverse models as a complementary approach to target identification next to target based drug discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/64142ba9-d775-4b57-8041-fba0bc6e2e2f\/@t03B8ZDQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phenotype,Target discovery,Screening,Biomarker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12245"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lucian De Waal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Larpenteur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cong Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Bryan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mustafa Kocak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corrie Aghia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua Bittker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anita Vrcic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward McBride<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha Bender<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kalea Gore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenghao Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aviad Tsherniak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aravind Subramanian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daphne Koller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffery Settleman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris C.

These techniques traditionally rely on manual centrifugation-based protocols for cell washing and suspension preparation, hampering researchers&#8217; access to the reproducibility and scalability benefits of automation. We have developed a suite of cell suspension preparation systems that enable semi and full automation of cell washing protocols. These Laminar Wash<sup>TM<\/sup> technologies robustly, gently, and efficiently remove debris, dead cells, and unbound reagent using laminar flow and liquid handling robotics, rather than turbulent and harsh pelleting-plus-pipetting methods. Adaptation of standard protocols to Laminar Wash automation typically improves repetitive immunostaining processes and workflows, in terms of reduced hands-on time and inter- and intra-operator variability. We demonstrate the superior live cell retention and reproducibility of Laminar Wash over centrifugation in processing murine and humanized mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for flow cytometry. Furthermore, we show how Laminar Wash improves flow cytometry data quality, in terms of debris removal and separation of immune cell subsets for both PBMCs and TILs. Overall, these results show how Laminar Wash methodology assists in standardizing sample preparation for cytometric analysis, an important and unmet need in cancer immunotherapy discovery and manufacturing workflows.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb845c98-3140-4ab6-b936-c099daed0120\/@t03B8ZDQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Tumor microenvironment,Assay development,Sample preparation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12249"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melvin Lye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Eberle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ann Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoffrey K.

Despite the HPV vaccination efforts, the number of oropharyngeal cancers (OSCCs) has been steadily increasing especially in males. Standard of care primarily focuses on the surgical removal of cancerous tissues followed by chemoradiation therapy. However, the recurrence rate of OSCCs remains fairly high as the tumor frequently develops therapy resistance and more effective therapeutic regimens are needed. The chronic inflammatory state yet paradoxical immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment has been regarded as a cause of therapy resistance and suggested as a potential therapeutic target. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) contribute to pro-inflammatory tissue responses. TLR2 present in the OSCC tumor appears to play important roles in regulating immune responses and promoting pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. GM-1111 is a synthetic glycosaminoglycan-based anti-inflammatory molecule that potently inhibits PRRs such as TLR2 and NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, GM-1111 inhibits multiple angiogenic molecules - CXCL12, VEGF, and FGF2. We hypothesized that GM-1111 might be able to reduce OSCC tumor growth by simultaneously disrupting pro-inflammatory as well as angiogenic signaling. To test this hypothesis, male CD1 nude mice bearing FaDu cell tumor in the back were treated with either (1) vehicle, (2) GM-1111 (30 mg\/kg, q.d., s.c.), (3) vehicle with irradiation (2 Gy\/day x 5 days), or (4) GM-1111 with irradiation 17 days. Established tumors grew in two phases from slow for the initial 7 days to fast growths during the remaining days. Irradiation- or drug-induced tumor regression was observable about 5 days after the last radiation therapy (day 10). Compared to the vehicle only (1) treatment group, GM-1111 treated animals (groups 1 <i>vs<\/i>. 2: <i>p<\/i> = 0.0032; groups 1 <i>vs.<\/i> 3: <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001; groups 1 <i>vs.<\/i> 4: <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001) demonstrated significantly reduced tumor growth. These results suggest that GM-1111 has a potential to reduce OSCC and further confirm our previous orthotopic human tongue SCC-25 cell xenograft study data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b1315f3a-db93-4815-b17a-7cb068771d87\/@t03B8ZDQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Squamous cell carcinoma,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor neovasculature,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12195"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Won Yong Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frida Ponthan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen T.

Here, we applied a depletion-dependent ABPP for serine hydrolase (SH) profiling in 30-&#956;m thickness cryosections of optimal-cutting-temperature (OCT)-embedded tissue of advanced lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD).<br \/>(b) For the proof-of-concept, we profiled SH activities in advanced LUAD disease. We retrospectively analyzed hydrolase activity differences with prognostic values related to aggressive phenotype based on clinical data collected over the course of disease progression. Interestingly, detection of proteins correlating by active-enzyme capture uncover their functional links with the metabolic SHs related to the enhanced palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle of lipoproteins in aggressive LUAD. In contrast, the standard DDA-MS analysis of on-bead-depleted enzymes detected 95 SH&#8217;s of which less than 60 enzymes were quantified based on spectral counting.<br \/>(c) We found enhanced activities of dozen SHs in all LUAD tumors. Remarkably, the activity of 11 hydrolases emphasized by IAH1, ABHD12, LYPLA2 and MST1 discriminate aggressive tumors at the time of diagnosis. Functional analysis leveraging enzymes and associated co-depleted proteins revealed catabolic processing of lipoproteins and enrichment of enzymes displaying increased de-palmitoylase activities. This is interesting because multiple isoforms of RAS protein (K-RAS, H-RAS and N-RAS), the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers including LUAD (i.e. 30% of LUADs contain somatic K-Ras mutation), attain oncogenic properties only in depalmitoylated state which favor protein intracellular trafficking by detachment from hydrophobic plasma membrane. In line, mutant K-Ras protein co-localize on outer mitochondrion membrane and interact with glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase-1 and -2) only in depalmitoylated state. This interaction induce K-Ras oncogenic properties and increased glucose uptake and glycolysis even in the presence of abundant oxygen (Warburg effect). Curiously, we observed co-depletion of mitochondrial proteins including glycolytic hexokinase 2 with several lipases displaying increase depalmitoylase activity in short LUAD survivals.<br \/>(d) Surprisingly, an evident disagreement in the activity of enzymes involved in lipolysis and protein depalmitoylation (i.e. IAH1, ABHD12, LYPLA2) was discovered between LUAD survival subtypes. These essential metabolic differences were uncovered by our standard proteomic analysis<b> <\/b>and to our knowledge have not been reported<b>. <\/b>Since the inhibitors of serine lipases are promising targets in other RAS-mutant carcinomas, this metabolic vulnerabilities discovered in aggressive LUAD can be explored as promising therapeutic strategies in lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dedb9dd5-6bf7-4ddb-968d-958b5a2a14d7\/@t03B8ZDQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Proteomics,Adenocarcinoma,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12196"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tatjana Sajic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephan Arni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rudolf Aebersold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sven Hillinger<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, the majority of patients demonstrate innate or acquired resistance that must be characterized and overcome to induce successful treatment. Advancements in human reverse translation and scaled in vivo CRISPR screening have uncovered novel molecular and genomic correlates of resistance, and promising druggable mechanisms - driven by highly complex interactions between tumor cells and the immune system. It is this core biology that must be disentangled to build the treatment paradigms of the future. Here we demonstrate a technique for massively parallel prioritization of new immuno-oncology hypotheses using industrial-scale experimentation and machine learning. Leveraging high-content imaging data from whole-genome CRISPR knockout and a library of &#38;gt;250,000 compounds, a deep learning model was trained to construct a batch-invariant low dimensional representation of each perturbation. Millions of perturbations in multiple cell types were embedded in a unified representation space that was leveraged to increase the rate of discovery, accelerate reverse translation, yield novel biological insights, and guide the advancement of lead molecular series through SAR. Here we highlight multiple discovery programs driven by inferred relationships between small molecules and gene knockout with translation from inference to in vivo efficacy. Specifically, we prioritize molecules with activity in STK11-deficient tumors and additional immune checkpoint sensitizers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/118ab3d3-2a93-4749-9116-3ecfc5946814\/@t03B8ZDQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Machine learning,Drug discovery,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12250"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ashish Bhandari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Michael F.

In 2021, the American Cancer Society (ACS) reported that there will be 281,550 new cases of breast cancer in U.S. and about 43,600 women will be expected to die from the disease. Unfortunately, the recovery rate from advanced breast cancer by current available drug treatment is unacceptably low. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop more effective and less toxic small drug molecules with a unique mechanism of action. Chromones are benzannulated oxygen containing heterocyclic compounds that are widely distributed in nature and have a <i>gamma<\/i>-pyrone ring. Natural and synthetic molecules having chromone scaffold displayed interesting pharmacological activities such as anti-cancer, anti-HIV, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities with low toxicity. In continuation of our current research work, we report the synthesis of substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline chromone carboxamides. Modifications of the chromone scaffold at pyrone ring by attaching substituted tetrahdyrosioquinolines were carried out to prepare compounds with a potential of acting as anti-breast cancer agents. The starting material, substituted chromone-2-carbonyl chloride was obtained by the acylation reaction of corresponding carboxylic acids using phosphorous pentachloride in dry cyclohexane. An equimolar amount of acyl chloride was slowly added to a stirred solution of corresponding substituted N-aminoisoquinoline in dry THF, in the presence of triethyl amine and refluxed at 70 degrees C that led to the formation of the ylides. The ylides were reduced using sodium borohydride to yield the desired substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline chromone-2-carboxamides in moderate to good yields. The synthesized compounds were characterized by NMR, IR, and elemental analysis. These compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects on MBA-MB-231 ER-ve breast cancer cell lines using a Synergy HTX multi-mode reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA) with excitation\/emission wavelength settings at 550\/580. Compound N-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2-(1H0-yl)-6-methyl-4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxmaide showed the most potent cytotoxicity with an IC<sub>50 <\/sub>value 0.82 microgram\/mL on MDA-MB-231 cell line.

Despite the advances, there is a need for protocols that can quickly generate patient-relevant 3D models for high-throughput drug screening and for diagnostic drug sensitivity testing. Ideally, such methods should be cost-effective, provide multi-parametric data to reveal distinct phenotypes, have single cell resolution to reveal heterogeneity and cell interactions, meet diagnostic timeframes and be miniaturized to allow the analysis of many drugs and combinations with small numbers of primary tumor cells. Here, we aimed to develop a robust technology for high-throughput <i>ex vivo<\/i> drug sensitivity testing for functional precision medicine using OC tissue and ascites samples (mostly high-grade serous carcinoma) from patients. We present a scalable drug screening platform: DET<i>E<\/i>CT (Drug Efficacy Testing in <i>Ex-vivo<\/i> 3D Cultures), where tumor-derived patient cells can be rapidly screened within one week from sampling. Using this information patient-specific drug combinations are subsequently designed and tested with these data available within 9 days. This is much faster than with most screening protocols for organoids and PDC models where many weeks or months are required for establishment of the models and expansion of the required numbers of cells. We have currently tested the efficacy of 58 selected chemo- and targeted drugs in 5 doses using high content imaging and then a complete dose-matrix of 3 combinations at step 2. We report robust drug screening data in 15 out of 18 OC patient samples, which has resulted in a functional taxonomy of patient samples and a taxonomy of drugs based on their efficacy across patient samples. Some of the most common responses were seen for the BCL-XL inhibitor A-1331852 (9\/15 patients), Topotecan (7), Dactinomycin (7), Omipalisib (6) and Omacetaxine (6). All but 2 drugs showed efficacy in at least one OC sample, suggesting heterogeneity and opportunities to make use of unique drug response patterns. Combination screening revealed that Carboplatin and A-1331852, a BCL-XL inhibitor, showed increased efficacy in 3 of the 5 tested patient samples. In conclusion, our 3D HT-drug testing assay DET<i>E<\/i>CT with a combination screening capability could in the future be useful for guiding individualized treatment in a clinical setting as well as for identifying existing and emerging drugs and drug combinations for repurposing in OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7dfaf606-eb85-4ecf-b4df-ab26f2ce2093\/@t03B8ZDQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Drug sensitivity,Assay development,Ex vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12242"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emma Åkerlund<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Greta Gudoityte<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabeth Moussaud Lamodiere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Carlson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emelie Wallin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josefin Fernebro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olli Kallioniemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Päivi Östling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrika Joneborg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brinton Seashore-Ludlow<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the process of identifying new therapeutic antibodies is routinely hampered by limitations in the traditional discovery process, including immune tolerance of highly homologous genes, and challenges with antibody sequence humanization, clone selection and drug efficacy and safety evaluation. RenMice&#8482; HiTS (Hyperimmune Target Specific) is a collection of chromosome engineered mice with fully human immunoglobulin variable domains replacing mouse counterparts, each with a specific drug target gene knocked out. The goal of the RenMice&#8482; HiTS platform is to overcome the challenges of traditional antibody drug discovery and increase the diversity of antibody paratopes and sequences which recognize functional epitopes. Immunization of target-specific RenMice&#8482; generates a greater diversity of antibodies, including those that recognize the conserved regions between the antigen and the endogenous proteins of the immunized host. The platform is ideal for challenging targets, such as proteins with high homology between human and mouse, or multi-pass transmembrane proteins (eg. GPCRs\/ion channels). The platform can be used to generate antibodies that cross-react with human, monkey, dog, and mouse targets, using a hybrid immunization strategy with both human and mouse\/dog antigen. Generation of these species cross-reactive antibodies allows for high-throughput in vivo efficacy screening using wild-type mice. It is also possible to predict the preliminary response and toxicity in dogs with these cross-reactive antibodies. Thus, selection of the best antibody candidate based on in vivo efficacy and safety allows for a streamlined and successful preclinical phase. In conclusion, the RenMice&#8482; HiTS platform facilitates the generation of antibodies with better developability properties that recognize challenging targets and novel epitopes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b8b7341-e385-46b7-8453-d70be178722e\/@t03B8ZDQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Immunotherapy,Transgenic mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12251"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaoqian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shujin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Tianquan Jin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Ji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Heme carries out a vital role in mitochondrial energy generation through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by acting as a cofactor or prosthetic group for complexes II, II, and IV in the electron transport chain. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in the US. Our lab has previously shown that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells exhibit an elevated heme flux characterized by elevated heme synthesis and import. This increased heme flux correlates with an enhanced oxygen consumption and ATP production. To target this elevated heme flux, we have engineered recombinant bacterial HasA hemophores as heme-sequestering proteins (HeSPs). HeSPs bind to and sequester heme with an extremely high (pM) affinity, thereby disrupting this elevated heme flux. HeSPs display potent anti-tumor activity in mouse models of NSCLC and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we utilized the <i>Pichia pastoris<\/i> expression platform to achieve high-yield expression. <i>P. pastoris<\/i> is a methylotrophic yeast that has minimal endogenous protein secretion and potentially high-yields for heterologous protein expression, due to a tightly regulated alcohol oxidase gene (AOX1). The <i>P. pastoris<\/i> expression platform is generally easier to handle and requires simpler fermentation conditions than mammalian cell cultures, making it an ideal candidate for expression of recombinant bacterial proteins without endotoxin contamination.We utilized a secretion signal to direct secretion of HeSP2 into the culture medium to allow for easier protein purification. Purification was performed through ion exchange chromatography. We utilized native PAGE and heme-binding spectrum to verify that these yeast-expressed HeSPs adopt a similar conformation to those expressed in bacteria and maintain their heme-binding activity. HeSPs expressed through this <i>P. pastoris <\/i>expression system demonstrated remarkable anti-cancer efficacy in proliferation assays on NSCLC cells and SCLC (small cell lung cancer) cells. Experiments are underway to test their anti-tumor efficacy in mouse models. These experiments may suggest a novel approach to generate effective anti-cancer agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a4ed07ea-5746-4fb5-8284-38bbbe91dde8\/@u03B8ZDR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18154"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Narges Salamat<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adnin Ashrafi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tianyuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zakia Akter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanling Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Unlike artificial model systems such as cell lines, primary cancer samples recapitulate the complexity of the original microenvironment consisting of cancer cells as well as stromal and immune cells; this is especially important when evaluating IO targets and signalling pathways. Supported by our previous success predicting therapy for late stage haematological cancer patients in the EXALT-I trial using AI-supported functional single cell quantification of drug action (Kornauth <i>et. al.<\/i> 2021) we set out to systematically reveal novel targets and pathways in OC using small molecule drugs (SMDs) as tools.<br \/>Single cell phenotypic screening of OC MPAs (malignant pleural effusion and ascites) was enabled by the quantification of drug effects using an end-to-end scalable deep learning driven image analysis tool chain. This custom state-of-the-art AI software is critical to enable robust primary cell screening given the diversity of cells within each sample. This revealed anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), as well as structurally related targets and pathway associated proteins, as being potential novel targets in a subset of OC patient samples. There is sparse literature evidence for therapeutic utilisation of the ALK pathway in OC, and the diversity of responses indicates a further novel patient selection method.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>MPAs from OC patients (n = 20) were collected and the sensitivity of the cancer cells to 85 SMDs was evaluated using high content microscopy. Individual cells were segmented and classified using convolutional neural networks and drug responses were estimated from the resulting cell counts. The integration of these results with whole exome and RNA sequencing guided target and pathway prioritisation.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Screening for novel sensitivities using SMDs as tools uncovered inhibitors of ALK and related targets as having strong cancer cell cytotoxic effects, recapitulated in solid tumour biopsies. Transcriptomic profiling revealed pathway correlations to ALK inhibitor sensitivity, however non-annotated polypharmacological effects of each drug cannot yet be excluded.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Quantifying SMD sensitivity in a disease relevant model system identified ALK as a promising and overlooked target in OC, providing an upstream and potentially more specific target to the recently suggested MEK, PI3K and STAT3 (Papp<i> et. al. <\/i>2018, Izar et al. 2020). While further work to confirm the target is required, this study supports a notion of patient-centric drug development using disease relevant models and deep learning. Our work introduces a novel patient-centric tool to advance understanding of the OC target landscape and provides a resource for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ba7769b-d398-4054-bfd9-432db9607854\/@u03B8ZDR\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug sensitivity,ALK,Deep learning,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18155"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Irene Gutierrez-Perez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joost Van Ham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentin Aranha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rin Okumura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabeth Waltenberger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabella Alt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Baumgaertler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maja Stulic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edgar Petru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Minichsdorfer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Hefler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Lafleur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikolaus Krall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thorsten Füreder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Ian Vladimer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Sehlke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bojan Vilagos<\/i><\/presenter>.

The core click chemistry technology is agnostic to therapeutic agent or indication. The modular nature of the platform allows targeting strategies based on tumor&#8217;s location, antigens, or both to be combined with therapeutics utilizing multiple mechanisms of action to deliver highly effective treatments tailored to each patient.<br \/>The lead clinical candidate SQ3370 consists of a tetrazine-modified sodium hyaluronate biopolymer (SQL70) that is injected at the tumor site and followed by multiple systemic doses of trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-modified protodrug based on doxorubicin (Dox). Efficient covalent reaction between tetrazine and TCO moieties activates the protodrug and releases active Dox. SQ3370 provides enhanced safety and efficacy in preclinical models compared to conventional Dox, and is being evaluated in a Phase I study in advanced solid tumors (NCT04106492).<br \/>The efficacy of SQ3370 is from biopolymer-induced activation of protodrug at the tumor site. Data will be presented from mice treated with biopolymer injected peritumorally versus distal-to-tumor, prior to protodrug dosing. Results show significant improvement in tumor growth inhibition and survival in peritumorally-activated SQ3370 compared to distally-activated SQ3370 or conventional Dox. Quantification of protodrug activation in a pharmacokinetic model in rats showed at least 10 to 20% of the protodrug dose is activated by the biopolymer, resulting in over 300 times higher exposure of Dox to tumor versus systemic (plasma) exposure.<br \/>New TCO-modified protodrugs have been synthesized and preclinical results for the candidate based on monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) paired with SQL70 will be presented. TCO-MMAE was selected for in vivo evaluation because of its high cytotoxicity-attenuation (93-fold) in vitro. In naive mice, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TCO-MMAE, given as 5 daily doses after an injection of SQL70 biopolymer, was established at 20-times higher than the MTD of conventional MMAE. The antitumor efficacy of TCO-MMAE will be evaluated in future studies.<br \/>In addition, preliminary results on the use of tetrazine-conjugated antibodies as a targeting agent capable of treating disperse disease when paired with an appropriate TCO-protodrug will be presented.<br \/>In conclusion, the CAPAC platform is a novel approach that enables targeting of injectable and non-injectable tumors. CAPAC expands the therapeutic potential of anticancer drugs by increasing exposure to tumors and minimizing systemic adverse effects. The CAPAC platform can also be combined with other therapies to modulate the immune response and modify the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/328e9661-48d5-4906-adc5-7517b5c6f81f\/@u03B8ZDR\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-02 Biochemical modulators of the therapeutic index,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Chemistry,Cancer therapy,Prodrugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18395"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jesse M.

The goal is the development of the drug-loaded microparticles (MPs) for direct intratumoral injection as a treatment option for patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced tumors. Because the MPs are injected directly into the tumor, a higher dose of the chemotherapeutic should reach the cancer cells and minimal, if any, should enter the patient&#8217;s systemic circulation, which would increase efficacy and decrease systemic toxicity compared to systemic drug infusions. Methods: Gemcitabine-loaded MPs (GMPs), paclitaxel-loaded MPs (PMPs), and blank (no drug) MPs (BMPs) were formulated using a water in oil in water (W\/O\/W) emulsion. The human PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 were treated with GMPs and PMPs alone, or in combination, for three or six days with BMPs used as the control. After the treatment course, MTS cell viability assays were performed to assess the cytotoxicity of the different treatments, or cells were collected for flow cytometry to analyze apoptosis and cell cycle phase. Cells were also treated with free gemcitabine and paclitaxel to determine the IC<sub>50<\/sub> and compare cytotoxicity to the MPs treatments via cell viability assays and flow cytometry. Additionally, patient derived PDAC organoids were treated with GMPs and PMPs alone, or in combination, for five days with BMPs as the control. After five days, organoid viability was assessed via CellTiter-Glo enabling comparison with free drug treatments. Results: Treatment with the different MPs regimens results in significant cell death in both cell lines and organoids as compared to the controls. MIA PaCa-2 cells were more sensitive to free gemcitabine and GMPs treatment than PANC-1 cells. However, both cell lines were similarly sensitive to free paclitaxel and PMPs treatment, with PANC-1 cells displaying more sensitivity to paclitaxel-based treatments than gemcitabine-based treatments. The combination MPs treatment performed similarly to the GMPs treatment in both cell lines. The treated organoid lines did not have statistically significant differences in their sensitivities to the different MPs treatments. Conclusion and Future Directions: Using <i>in vitro<\/i> assays, we assessed the effects of the drug-loaded MP treatments on the viability of PDAC cell lines and patient derived organoids. Next steps will involve cell cycle and apoptosis analysis utilizing flow cytometry of the two cell lines after exposure to the MPs treatments. Additionally, the sensitivity of the organoids to MPs treatments will be compared to free drug treatments to assess the efficacy of MPs therapy over traditional therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8c8a6952-7d43-4e26-9064-625d46475e77\/@u03B8ZDR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Microparticles,Gemcitabine,Paclitaxel,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19406"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stanley Soroka<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis Plenker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hardik Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amber Habowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Tuveson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Martello-Rooney<\/i><\/presenter>.
