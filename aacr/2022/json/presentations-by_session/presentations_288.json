This study seeks to detect and quantify intra-tumoral heterogeneity deriving from the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition using a multi-round, multiplexed immunofluorescence staining approach to delineate EMT states at a single cell resolution in primary tumor specimens to aid in pathological patient diagnosis. Despite major advances in our understanding, the contributions of EMT research to improvements in diagnostic pathology or cancer therapy have been minimal. One reason for this gap stems from our inability to accurately detect and quantify epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity in primary tumor specimens. Secondly, the significance of recently identified intermediate or partial EMT states to predicting tumor prognosis and therapy response are unclear. To study the role of various states within the EMT spectrum and their regulatory networks, the heterogeneous breast cancer cell line, SUM149PT, was used to derive six single cell clones encompassing the spectrum of EMT states, from epithelial to mesenchymal. Interrogation of this model system <i>in vivo<\/i> has revealed increased tumor growth and metastatic potential in the intermediate EMT states when compared to the extreme epithelial and mesenchymal states. To further elucidate EMT states <i>in vivo<\/i>, we employ a 6-marker multi-round immunofluorescence-based staining approach to identify cells that reside in various states along the EMT spectrum. We subsequently used cell-segmented, entropy-based approach and weighted phenotype analysis on these tumors with the purpose of scoring heterogeneity and overall EMT state. Notably, this analysis segregated stromal infiltrates and their contributions to aggregate EMT scoring, which has been a major hurdle in using EMT as a scoring metric in patient samples. Overall, SUM149 clone-derived tumors held true to the relative EMT states of the starting cell populations; intermediate-derived tumors displayed high heterogeneity while epithelial and mesenchymal clone-derived tumors had lower levels of heterogeneity, despite retaining different EMT scores. Decoupling of heterogeneity and EMT state in this way provides two metrics to assess potential metastatic ability of a tumor. This staining method and analysis has been successfully applied in a preliminary set of patient tumors, showing promise for these two factors, E-M Heterogeneity and EMT score, as a tumor prognostic indicator to inform therapeutic decision-making. In the future, this staining and quantification shows promise as a means of predicting patient prognosis and informing potential treatment options based on targeting EMT states.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Metastasis,Heterogeneity,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meredith S.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover novel molecular mechanisms that contribute to TNBC metastasis such as <i>N<sup>6<\/sup><\/i>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6<\/sup>A) RNA modification. To do this, we conducted a selective CRISPR-cas9 screen of 14 m<sup>6<\/sup>A-regulators and identified an m<sup>6<\/sup>A reader protein, YTHDC1, as an essential gene for the survival of MDA-MB-231 cells. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset showed that patients with poorer prognosis had elevated YTHDC1 expression, which supports a tumor-promoting role of YTHDC1. <i>In vitro<\/i>, genetic depletion of YTHDC1 significantly impaired Transwell migration and invasion of human TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and SUM159) cells. <i>In vivo<\/i>, YTHDC1 overexpressing TNBC cells engrafted into the mammary fat pad of NSG mice formed greater numbers and larger sizes of lung metastatic nodules compared to control. Conversely, YTHDC1 knockout (KO) cells produced fewer and smaller lung metastatic nodules compared to control. Together, our <i>in<\/i> <i>vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> data demonstrate YTHDC1&#8217;s role in promoting TNBC metastasis. To identify high confidence YTHDC1 targets, we conducted three layers of transcriptome-wide sequencing with MDA-MB-231 cells: RNA-seq (profiling differential gene expression and nuclear export), m<sup>6<\/sup>A-seq (profiling m<sup>6<\/sup>A methylation in mRNA), and RIP-seq (profiling YTHDC1 binding sites in mRNA). Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in MDA-MB-231 YTHDC1 KO cells identified pathways related to metastasis and TGF-&#946; signaling, which is consistent with our phenotypic observations. Overlapping the three sequencing datasets identified SMAD3 as a YTHDC1 target mRNA. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 KO impairs the nuclear export of SMAD3 mRNA, resulting in reduced protein levels of this critical effector of TGF-&#946; signaling. YTHDC1 KO significantly reduced Transwell migration and invasion of TGF-&#946; induced TNBC cells and the expression of TGF-&#946; responsive genes such as <i>SNAIL<\/i>, <i>IL11<\/i>, <i>FN<\/i>, and<i> CTGF<\/i>. Overexpression of SMAD3 was able to rescue the impaired migration and invasion of YTHDC1 KO TNBC cells and restore the expression of TGF-&#946; responsive genes following TGF-&#946; treatment. We also demonstrated that the oncogenic role of YTHDC1 is mediated through its recognition of m<sup>6<\/sup>A, as m<sup>6<\/sup>A-binding defective mutants of YTHDC1 were unable to rescue impaired Transwell migration and invasion of YTHDC1 KO TNBC cells. In summary, our study reveals that TNBC metastasis is mediated at least in part through YTHDC1&#8217;s function in promoting SMAD3 expression to augment the TGF-&#946; signaling cascade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,TGF-&#946;,RNA modification,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brandon Tan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keren Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Prince<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangchan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Qing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhicong Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun-Wei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianjun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Maternal obesity often results in an increased risk of offspring developing obesity. Chronic inflammation and immunosuppression found in obese patients have been linked to ovarian cancer (OvCa). OvCa is the most lethal gynecological malignancy among women and approximately 12% of OvCa patients are obese. Poor survival rates are attributable to women presenting with advanced disease with disseminated intraperitoneal (i.p) metastasis at diagnosis. Metastatic tumor cells shed from the primary tumor and preferentially home to the mesothelium of the omentum and other peritoneal organs producing secondary lesions. Developmental programming suggests that perinatal nutritional influences can alter gene expression in offspring. A pre-clinical murine model of diet-induced obesity that included maternal cohorts of C57BL\/6 mice (dam) with intact host immunity fed either a control diet (CD; 10% fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 40% fat) and the resulting offspring fed either diet was utilized to explore diet induced genetic and physical modifications. Body composition analysis revealed differences in weight and lean mass was dependent on offspring diet alone and fat mass was dam diet dependent among CD fed offspring. Second harmonic generation microscopy demonstrated a larger area of collagen mesh-work between fenestrations in the omentum of HFD fed mice as well as an increase in anisotropy. Additionally, a tumor study was performed using either CD or HFD fed offspring to quantify site-specific metastatic success to the adipose-rich tissues of the peritoneal cavity. Mice were injected i.p. with fluorescently tagged syngeneic ID8 murine OvCa cells and disease progression was tracked for 8 weeks. Abdominal organs were dissected, imaged, and organ-specific tumor burden quantified. Overall, offspring fed a HFD displayed an increase in organ-specific tumor burden relative to offspring fed a CD, regardless of dam diet. Furthermore, HFD offspring from HFD dams displayed higher omental tumor burden than HFD offspring from CD dams. In addition, HFD fed mice accumulated more ascites fluid than CD fed mice, however variances were independent of dam diet. Comparison of ascites cytokine expression revealed CXCL13, a dominant chemokine in adipocytes, was significantly increased in mice only exposed to a HFD suggesting an additive effect of both maternal and offspring obesity. Interestingly, increased CXCL13 expression has been reported in OvCa cell lines and in clinical samples. Together, the results suggest maternal obesity or subsequent exposure to a HFD can influence ovarian cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Obesity,Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tyvette Hilliard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phillip Petrasko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yueying Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marwa Asem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeff Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gifty Marfowaa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brooke Kowalski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elinor Schnautz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morgan McCabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>M.

Breast cancer patients diagnosed with brain metastasis have limited therapeutic options and, therefore, a dismal prognosis with a median survival time of ~10 months. Recent studies have suggested that metastatic cells extravasate and grow along the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a favorable microenvironment called the pre-metastatic niche. However, the early steps leading to the onset of breast-to-brain metastasis are poorly understood, limiting the development of strategies to prevent, detect and treat premetastatic or early-stage lesions. It is now well accepted that extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanoparticles secreted from cancer cells, can travel to distant organs, activate resident cells and promote the remodeling of the extracellular matrix and significantly impact organ-specific metastatic spread. Using our mouse model of breast to brain metastasis, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that EVs derived from brain-seeking breast cancer cells (Br-EVs) breach the intact BBB via transcytosis, are taken up by astrocytes and cause a significantly increased incidence of brain metastasis. Within this context, we are studying the interactions between Br-EVs and brain endothelial cells (ECs), the latter being a key functional component of the BBB. Utilizing primary human ECs and using a transwell assay established in our laboratory as an <i>in vitro <\/i>model of the BBB, we have identified the mechanism(s) through which Br-EVs modulate EC endocytic metabolism in favor of increased vesicle recycling and transcytosis. Our mechanistic studies demonstrate that ECs treated with Br-EVs show a significant decrease of multiple target proteins, all of which are involved in the long-recycling loop of the endocytic vesicles. Br-EVs mediate, at least in part, their effect through the delivery to the target cells of a specific subset of micro RNAs. As a result, Br-EVs upregulate EC basal transcytosis rate promoting their transfer to the brain parenchyma. These findings indicate that Br-EVs can alter BBB basal metabolism and help to prepare a microenvironment, better known as the pre-metastatic niche, that promotes and sustains the survival and growth of breast cancer metastases in the otherwise hostile brain microenvironment. These results increase our understanding of the early events that facilitate breast-to-brain metastasis and have the potential to identify key regulators in the early steps of brain metastasis formation. Our mechanistic studies will also inform and contribute to the development of EV-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the early management of breast cancer patients with brain metastasis.

Bone is a unique metastatic microenvironment because of complex interactions among numerous distinct cell types such as osteo-blasts, -clasts, -cytes and marrow immune cells in physiological and pathological conditions. Imbalanced bone homeostasis by diverse factors such as the sympathetic nerve system (SNS) activation, potentially contribute to the progression of bone metastasis, yet precise mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the effects of beta 2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR) activation in osteoblasts induced by prolonged SNS stimulation on anti-tumoral immunity in bone metastasis. We treated female Balb\/C with chronic immobilization stress (CIS; 2 h. daily) and found that CIS increased syngeneic intra-tibial 4T1 bone metastasis growth as well as the number of CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>Gr1<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) counterbalancing anti-tumoral cytotoxic T cells in bone microenvironment. A &#946;2AR-specific inhibitor (ICI-118551) or MDSC depletion using anti-Gr1 antibodies reversed CIS-induced bone metastatic tumor growth. More importantly, 2-week CIS <i>pre-<\/i>treatment increased EDU<sup>+<\/sup> MDSC proliferation in the bone marrow, contributing to subsequent bone metastatic tumor growth and micro-metastatic seeding in intra-tibial and intra-cardiac tumor injection models, respectively. When CIS was administered after the establishment of bone metastatic tumors, the pro-tumorigenic effects were marginal. In osteoblast-specific &#946;2AR knockout mice (<i>Adrb2<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i>; <i>murine 2.3kb Col1-Cre<\/i>C57BL6 mice), CIS did not increase MDSC proliferation compared with littermate floxed controls, suggesting that &#946;2AR in osteoblasts upregulates MDSC in bone microenvironment. RNA-sequencing transcriptome analysis of saline- or clenbuterol (a selective &#946;2AR agonist)-treated murine osteoblasts showed that interleukin-6 (IL6) was the most significantly increased cytokine. Indeed, CIS or clenbuterol treatment increased IL-6 expression <i>in vivo<\/i> (immunohistochemistry) and <i>in vitro <\/i>(cultured osteoblasts), respectively.

The presence of cytotoxic immune cells, specifically CD8+ T cells, in breast tumors is associated with better patient outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into breast tumors could improve the treatment and enhance patient overall survival. Utilizing a novel HSF1 activity gene signature, we observed that HSF1 activity was negatively associated with the presence of CD8+ T cells in breast cancer patients. Both CIBERSORT analysis of TCGA data as well as direct assessment of patient primary specimens demonstrated that patient tumors with high HSF1 activity had lower numbers of CD8+ T cells. To functionally test this relationship, HSF1 was knocked down in 4T1 breast cancer cells and grown orthotopically in BALB\/c mice. Tumors with HSF1 knockdown showed lower tumor volumes and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration. We further tested the effect of CD8+ T cells on the growth of HSF1 knockdown tumors by depleting CD8+ T cells in BALB\/c mice. HSF1 knockdown tumors were significantly larger with CD8+ T cell depletion suggesting a functional role for HSF1 to inhibit CD8+ T cell infiltration and protect the tumor from immune-mediated killing. To investigate the mechanism by which HSF1 affects CD8+ T cells, we investigated whether HSF1 affects chemotactic cytokines. We found that loss of HSF1 significantly increased secretion of CCL5, a known chemoattractant for CD8+ T cells. Loss of HSF1 also increased mRNA levels of CCL5, suggesting a transcriptional effect on CCL5. To test the importance of CCL5 in the phenotype of HSF1 knockdown, a transwell migration assay was performed wherein T cells from BALB\/c mice were placed in the upper chamber of a transwell chamber and the lower chamber contained conditioned medium from 4T1 cells with knockdown of HSF1 with or without knockdown of CCL5. The lower chamber was subjected to flow cytometry for CD3\/CD8 to identify CD8+ T cells and we observed that loss of HSF1 increased migration of CD8+ T cells and this was ablated with additional loss of CCL5. These results suggest CCL5 is a significant mediator for the recruitment of CD8+ T cells when HSF1 is lost in cancer cells. We propose the model whereby high HSF1 activity in breast cancer cells suppresses expression and secretion of the chemo-attractant cytokine CCL5 that ultimately leads to a decrease in CD8+ T cells in breast tumors microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immune cells,Cytotoxic T cell,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Curteisha LeeAnn Jacobs<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sakhi Shan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen-Cheng Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Carpenter<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here we show that prostate and breast cancer patients harbor contingents of tumor cells with high expression of CX3CR1, OCT4a (POU5F1) and NANOG. Impairing CX3CR1 expression or signaling hampered the formation of tumor spheroids by cell lines from which we isolated small subsets co-expressing CX3CR1 and stemness-related markers, similarly to patients&#8217; tumors. These rare CX3CR1<sup>High<\/sup> cells show transcriptomic profiles enriched in pathways that regulate pluripotency and endowed with metastasis-initiating behavior in murine models. Cancer cells lacking these features (CX3CR1<sup>Low<\/sup>) were capable of re-acquiring CX3CR1-associated features over time, implying that MICs can continuously emerge from non-stem cancer cells. CX3CR1 expression also conferred resistance to docetaxel, and prolonged treatment with docetaxel selected CX3CR1<sup>High<\/sup> phenotypes with de-enriched transcriptomic profiles for apoptotic pathways. These findings nominate CX3CR1 as novel marker of stem-like tumor cells and provide conceptual ground for future development of approaches targeting CX3CR1 signaling and (re)expression as therapeutic means to prevent or contain metastasis initiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Breast cancer,Prostate cancer,metastasis-initiating cells ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jieyi Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony DiNatale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramanpreet Kaur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Marchioli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darin Ipe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Castelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher McNair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaurav Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olimpia Meucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Fatatis<\/i><\/presenter>.
