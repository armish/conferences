FD Ibr + Ven provides deep, durable responses (Ghia, ASCO 2021; Wierda, J Clin Oncol 2021). Here, we report efficacy and safety of FD Ibr + Ven in pts with high-risk features.<br \/>Methods: Pts aged &#8804;70 y with previously untreated CLL received 3 cycles of Ibr then 12 cycles of Ibr + Ven (Ibr 420 mg\/d orally; Ven ramp-up to 400 mg\/d orally). Pts in the FD cohort received no further treatment. Pts in the MRD cohort were randomized to subsequent treatment according to MRD status, including a placebo arm for pts who achieved confirmed undetectable MRD (uMRD) with 12 cycles of Ibr + Ven. Data from the FD cohort and MRD cohort placebo arm were pooled for pts with high-risk features (del(17p), TP53 mutated, or unmutated IGHV) treated with FD Ibr + Ven.<br \/>Results: Of 202 pts treated with FD Ibr + Ven in the FD cohort (n=159) or MRD cohort placebo arm (n=43), 129 pts had high-risk features (Table). Median time on study for these pts was 28.7 mo (range 0.8-45.1). 94% of pts completed planned treatment with Ibr and Ven. Median treatment duration was 13.8 mo (range 0.7-24.9) for Ibr and 11.1 mo (range 9.9-22.1) for Ven. Best response rates of CR and uMRD in peripheral blood and bone marrow were high (Table). The 18-mo landmark estimate for duration of CR was 95%. 24-mo PFS rate was 94%, which was similar to pts without high-risk features (97%). Only 3% of pts discontinued Ibr or Ven due to AEs. The AE profile of Ibr + Ven in pts with high-risk features showed no new safety findings for this FD regimen (Table).<br \/>Conclusion: First-line Ibr + Ven for a fixed duration provides durable treatment-free remissions and sustained PFS in pts with CLL. These clinical outcomes are maintained in pts with high-risk features, with PFS rates that were similar to pts without high-risk features.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{89BA6ED6-F5A0-44BA-8CC4-D116E6D3E029}\"><caption>Table.

ZN-c3 has demonstrated significant <i>in vitro<\/i> antitumor activity in multiple cell lines and xenograft models.<br \/>Methods: ZN-c3-001 (NCT04158336) is an open label, multicenter, Phase I dose escalation and expansion study evaluating the safety and clinical activity of ZN-c3 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, refractory to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available. Oral, daily ZN-c3 dosing was escalated from 25 mg to 450 mg once daily (QD), with a recommended phase 2 dose of 300 mg QD. Here we report preliminary safety and efficacy results for subjects with USC who received ZN-c3 at doses &#8805;300 mg QD.<br \/>Results: As of October 28, 2021, a total of 78 subjects were enrolled across all tumor types. For USC, there were 12 subjects who received ZN-c3 at doses &#8805;300 mg QD and were evaluated for safety. Median duration of treatment was 12 weeks (range, 2 - 33 weeks). The safety profile for this subgroup is comparable to the overall patient population with 11 of 12 subjects reporting at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). TRAEs grades 1-4 occurring in &#8805;3 subjects, by decreasing frequency, included nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dehydration, and anemia. Grade &#8805;3 TRAEs occurring in &#8805;2 subjects included anemia and thrombocytopenia. These hematologic events were limited to 2 subjects each. Nine of the 12 subjects had measurable disease and at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment; 3 subjects (33.3%) had confirmed partial response and 5 (55.6%) had stable disease as their best overall response. Disease control rate, defined as those with complete response, partial response, and stable disease, was 88.9%. One subject with partial response achieved complete response at subsequent tumor assessment.<br \/>Conclusions: ZN-c3 appears to be safe and well-tolerated as a single agent at oral doses &#8805;300 mg QD and demonstrated clinical activity in subjects with recurrent or advanced USC. Safety results in these subjects were consistent with those of the full study population. The ongoing dose expansion study is enrolling USC patients. The preliminary efficacy signal will be confirmed in a dedicated phase 2 study (ZN-c3-004, NCT04814108) in this patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"WEE1,Solid tumors,Phase I,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Funda Meric-Bernstam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pavani Chalsani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirva Mamdani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus Viana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruth Lambersky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Pultar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony W.

Biomarker analyses from TRESR (NCT04497116) identified predictors of sensitivity to RP-3500.<br \/>Methods: Biomarker data were centrally assessed from: Tumor\/normal sequencing including zygosity analysis (SNiPDx targeted NGS panel), ctDNA, and ATM IHC. Correlations with clinical outcomes: Overall Response (OR: RECIST 1.1 confirmed\/unconfirmed CR\/PR, PSA or CA125 response), PFS, and CBR (OR or therapy duration &#62;16 weeks [w]) were assessed.<br \/>Results: 120 pts (ovarian [n=22], prostate [n=22], breast [n=17], pancreatic [n=12], other [n=47]) with LOF alterations (<i>ATM<\/i> [n=44], <i>BRCA1<\/i> [n=25], <i>BRCA2<\/i> [n=15], <i>CDK12<\/i> [n=9], RNASEH2 [n=5], <i>PALB2<\/i> [n=5], <i>SETD2<\/i> [n=5], other [n=12]) were enrolled based on local tumor NGS (n=71), germline testing (n=29), ctDNA (n=13), or IHC (n=7). Prior therapies included PARPi (39\/120) and platinum (81\/120). Locally and centrally assessed biomarker status were concordant for tumor NGS (45\/46), germline (20\/20) and ctDNA (7\/8). Alterations were germline in 50\/88 (57%) and somatic in 36\/88 (41%) pts; clonal hematopoiesis was the source of <i>ATM<\/i> LOF in 2\/88 (2%) pts. Gene zygosity was biallelic in 49\/68 (72%) and monoallelic in 19\/68 (28%) tumors. ATM protein loss was detected in 11\/13 (85%) biallelic (discordance explained by missense mutations) and 5\/8 (63%) monoallelic <i>ATM<\/i> LOF. Reversions were detected at baseline in 6 pt tumors (<i>BRCA1<\/i> [n=3], <i>BRCA2<\/i> [n=1], <i>PALB2<\/i> [n=1], <i>NBN<\/i> [n=1]). In pts receiving RP-3500 &#62;100mg and &#8805;1 response evaluation, OR was 13% (13\/98; responses in tumors with <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>BRCA1<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, <i>CDK12<\/i>, <i>RAD51C<\/i>, <i>SETD2<\/i> genotypes); CBR was 47% in 77 pts with follow-up &#62;16w , mPFS was 15w; 40\/98 pts remain on RP-3500 (up to 50+w). CBR was &#62;60% and mPFS not reached on 17 pts with ovarian tumors. Compared with monoallelic loss, tumors with biallelic loss had significantly higher CBR (20\/34 [59%] vs 1\/10 [10%], p=0.01) and trend for longer mPFS (19w vs 6w, p=0.08). CBR was 64% (7\/11) vs 0% (0\/3) in biallelic vs monoallelic tumors with <i>ATM<\/i> LOF (p=0.19), and 64% (7\/11) vs 0% (0\/2) in tumors with <i>BRCA1<\/i> LOF (p=0.19). Two pts with post-PARPi <i>BRCA1<\/i> reversions had treatment durations of 17w and 29w.<br \/>Conclusions: RP-3500 has clinical activity across STEP<sup>2<\/sup> genotypes including those pretreated with PARPi and with <i>BRCA1<\/i> reversions. IHC is an imperfect surrogate for <i>ATM <\/i>zygosity. <i>ATM<\/i> alterations originating from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) can be misdiagnosed as tumor derived. High concordance of local and central testing supports the use of local NGS to identify LOF alterations. Improved CBR with RP-3500 therapy in tumors with biallelic LOF supports the use of gene zygosity as a predictor of benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,ATM,BRCA,DNA damage repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy A.

Men had received 1-2 taxane-based chemotherapy regimens and progressed on &#8805;1 novel hormonal therapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate ([ORR] per RECIST 1.1; blinded independent central review [BICR]). Exploratory ad hoc biomarker analyses assessed gLOH and associations with antitumor activity.<br \/>Methods: gLOH was calculated as previously described (Sokol <i>et al<\/i>., <i>JCO Precis Oncol<\/i> 2020; PMID: 32903788). Of 104 men in the HRR-deficient measurable disease population (hereafter referred to as the efficacy population), 55 were evaluable for gLOH, 45 were non-evaluable for gLOH, and four lacked central lab gLOH results. Potential association of gLOH high\/low status with response was explored using two high\/low thresholds: 8.8% based on literature showing that this threshold optimally distinguished prostate cancers bearing <i>BRCA<\/i> biallelic alterations from <i>BRCA<\/i>-wildtype (Sokol <i>et al<\/i>., <i>JCO Precis Oncol<\/i> 2020; PMID: 32903788), and an agnostic threshold based on the median gLOH score in TALAPRO-1 (9.2%) in the gLOH-evaluable efficacy population. Data cutoff was Sept 4, 2020 (primary completion date).<br \/>Results: gLOH ranged from 1.39% to 30.2% in the gLOH-evaluable efficacy population. Based on the 8.8% gLOH threshold, ORR was significantly higher for gLOH-high (53.3% [16\/30], 95% confidence interval [CI] 34.3-71.7%) vs gLOH-low (12.0% [3\/25], 95% CI 2.5-31.2%; odds ratio [OR] 8.381, 2-sided <i>P<\/i>=0.0017; Fisher&#8217;s exact test). Similar results were yielded based on the 9.2% gLOH threshold. Next, potential associations of gLOH score with response within HRR gene alteration groups of the efficacy population were explored using the 8.8% threshold. Within the <i>BRCA2<\/i> group, ORR was robust regardless of gLOH status, but was significantly higher for gLOH-high (70.6%, 12\/17) than for gLOH-low (23.1%, 3\/13) (<i>P<\/i>=0.0253). Within the <i>ATM<\/i> group, ORR was numerically higher for gLOH-high (50.0%, 2\/4) than gLOH-low (0%, 0\/6), but not significantly (<i>P<\/i>=0.1333). Radiographic progression-free survival (RECIST 1.1; BICR) in the gLOH-evaluable efficacy population was numerically superior for gLOH-high versus gLOH-low using either threshold (hazard ratio 0.68), but not significantly.<br \/>Conclusions: Based on these retrospective, exploratory analyses of TALAPRO-1, gLOH-high status was associated with response within the gLOH-evaluable efficacy population. Further exploration of gLOH as a candidate predictive biomarker for talazoparib in prostate cancer is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,DNA damage response,genomic loss of  heterozygosity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Johann S.

We analyzed alectinib treatment in a pan-tumor population with <i>ALK<\/i> alterations from MyPathway (NCT02091141), a multi-basket study assessing approved therapies in non-indicated advanced solid tumors with relevant alterations.<br \/>Methods: Enrolled patients (pts) were &#8805;18 yrs old and had metastatic tumors with <i>ALK<\/i> gene rearrangements, putative activating non-synonymous <i>ALK<\/i> mutations, and\/or <i>ALK<\/i> gene amplification. Pts received alectinib 600 mg PO BID. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR; complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]). Other endpoints included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR; CR + PR + stable disease [SD] &#62;4 mos), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety.<br \/>Results: By the 11-18-2021 data cutoff, 21 pts with various tumor types had been enrolled and treated (<i>ALK<\/i> mutations or amplification, n=11 [52.4%]; <i>ALK<\/i> rearrangements +\/- other <i>ALK<\/i> alterations, n=10 [47.6%]). Pts had a median of 2 (range, 1-5) prior lines of therapy. In the 10 pts with <i>ALK<\/i> rearrangements, there were 3 PRs (30.0%) with a median DOR of 6.8 mos (Table). An additional 3 pts in this group had SD &#62;4 mos; DCR was 60.0% (6\/10). In contrast, there were no responses among the 11 pts with <i>ALK<\/i> mutations or amplification. Confirmed ORR for the entire group was 14.3% (3\/21), and DCR was 42.9% (9\/21). Median PFS was 8.2 mos in pts with <i>ALK<\/i> rearrangements vs 1.8 mos for those with other <i>ALK<\/i> alterations. Alectinib-related adverse events (AEs) were observed in 85.7% of pts, with 3 (14.3%) experiencing grade 3 AEs (anemia; hypokalemia; and changes in AST, ALT, and\/or blood creatinine levels). AEs were consistent with the known alectinib safety profile.<br \/>Conclusions: Although the number of pts is small, alectinib appears active in those with non-NSCLC advanced solid tumors with <i>ALK<\/i> rearrangements. As in NSCLC, cancers with <i>ALK<\/i> mutations or amplification were not responsive to ALK inhibition.<br \/>Table.

JDQ443 is a selective, covalent, orally bioavailable, investigational KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>inhibitor that irreversibly traps KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> in the inactive, GDP-bound state. JDQ443 is structurally unique and forms novel interactions with KRAS in the switch II pocket.<br \/>Methods: KontRASt-01 (NCT04699188) is a Phase Ib\/II, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial of JDQ443 as monotherapy or in combination with TNO155 (SHP2 inhibitor) and\/or tislelizumab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody). Primary objectives of dose escalation are to assess safety and tolerability, and identify the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and\/or recommended doses (RDs) and regimens for future studies. The primary objective of dose expansion is to assess efficacy. Key inclusion criteria: advanced, <i>KRAS G12C<\/i>-mutated solid tumors; previous standard-of-care treatment; age &#8805;18 yrs; ECOG PS 0-1. Key exclusion criteria for the JDQ443 monotherapy arm: active brain metastases, prior KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor treatment. Here, we present preliminary results for JDQ443 monotherapy dose escalation.<br \/>Results: As of Nov 3, 2021, 39 pts were treated with JDQ443 PO continuously across 4 dose levels: 200 mg once daily (QD) (n=10), 400 mg QD (n=11), 200 mg twice daily (BID) (n=11), and 300 mg BID (n=7). Median age was 60 yrs (range 26-76), median prior lines of therapy was 3 (range 1-7), and indications included NSCLC (n=20) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (n=16). Median duration of exposure was 9.1 wks (range 0.9-21), with ongoing treatment in most pts (61.5%) at the time of cut-off. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 25 (64.1%) pts. Most TRAEs were Grade (Gr) 1-2. Four Gr 3 TRAEs occurred in 4 (10.3%) separate pts; there were no Gr 4-5 TRAEs. The most common TRAEs (occurring in &#8805;10% of pts) were fatigue (25.6%), nausea (15.4%), edema (12.8%), pruritus (10.3%), and vomiting (10.3%). There was one DLT (Gr 3 fatigue) and one treatment-related serious AE (Gr 3 photosensitivity reaction), each in separate pts treated at 300 mg BID. TRAEs led to dose reduction in 1 pt and discontinuation in 1 pt. A MTD was not reached. The RD was declared as 200 mg BID. At the RD, PK and PD modeling for JDQ443 predicted average KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> target occupancy of &#62;90% in &#62;82% of pts. Using an efficacy cut-off date of Dec 13, 2021, for the 20 pts with NSCLC among the same 39 pts, the ORR (confirmed complete response or partial response) by RECIST 1.1 was 30.0% (6\/20) across dose levels and 43.0% (3\/7) at the RD. Additional data will be available at the time of presentation.<br \/>Conclusions: JDQ443 demonstrates an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with early signs of clinical activity in pts with NSCLC. Enrollment is ongoing to NSCLC and CRC dose-expansion groups for JDQ443 monotherapy at the RD, and to JDQ443 + TNO155 dose escalation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL01-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,KRAS,Precision medicine,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel S.

SCC244 is a highly selective and potent oral MET inhibitor. This is the first report of data from an ongoing single-arm phase II study of SCC244 in NSCLC patients with <i>MET<\/i>ex14 mutations (GLORY study).<br \/>Methods: GLORY study is an open label, international, multi-center, single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SCC244 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring <i>MET<\/i>ex14 mutations which was confirmed by central laboratory. The enrolled patients have either failed one or two prior lines of systemic therapies or been not eligible\/refused chemotherapy after being well-informed. SCC244 was taken orally at a dose of 300 mg once daily in 21-day treatment cycles until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Tumor was evaluated every 6 weeks for the first 8 treatment cycles and every 9 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent review committee (BIRC) per RECIST 1.1, secondary endpoints include ORR by investigator assessment (INV), duration of response (DoR), time to response (TTR) and safety etc. Post-hoc analysis was done to explore the intracranial anti-tumor activity.<br \/>Results: At data cut-off on May 6<sup>th<\/sup>, 2021, a total 73 patients screened from 163 patients in 42 sites were treated at 300 mg QD dose and had &#8805;2 post-baseline tumor assessments or discontinued for any reason. 69 of them were with <i>MET<\/i>ex14 mutation confirmed by central laboratory. In the 69 patients, ORR by BIRC was 60.9% (95% CI: 48.4%, 72.4%) overall, 66.7% (95% CI: 50.5, 80.4) and 51.9% (95% CI: 31.9, 71.3) in treatment na&#239;ve and previously treated patients respectively. Median DoR was 8.2 months (95% CI: 4.8, NE) and median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI: 4.2, NE), tumor response from 30 of 42 responders was still ongoing. The response occurred fast with a median TTR of 1.4 months (range: 1.2, 4.2). Partial response was observed in 8 of 10 patients with brain metastasis. 5 patients who had brain metastasis selected as targeted lesion had intracranial response by INV with a median intracranial tumor shrinkage of 57% (range: 34%, 71%). The most common (&#8805;20%) treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were peripheral edema, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, hypoalbuminemia, ALT increase and vomiting. The incidence of &#8805; grade 3 TRAEs was 43.8%. TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 6.8% patients, among which peripheral edema was the most common (4.1%).<br \/>Conclusions: The data shows high and robust efficacy of SCC244 in NSCLC patients with <i>MET<\/i>ex14 mutations across treatment lines and encouraging intracranial anti-tumor activity. The safety profile was favorable with manageable toxicity. The data supports SCC244 as a valuable targeted treatment option for <i>MET<\/i>ex14 NSCLC patients. <u><\/u>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,SCC244,METex14 mutations,efficacy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shun Lu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongfeng Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianya Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koichi Goto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xingya Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Sakakibara-Konishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazumi Nishino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanaka Kentaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuhong Min<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dingzhi Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongqian Shu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chengzhi Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaorong Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chong Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiuwei Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lejie Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoling Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>AiMin Zang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haruki Kobayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiping Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiuwen Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Terufumi Kato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shoichiro Yamamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Shinno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyan Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanqiu Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanping Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qitao Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziping Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masahiro Kodani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jialei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meiqi Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diansheng Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Tanaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuto Yoneshima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minghui Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiuxia Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meng Li<\/i><\/presenter>.
