[{"Abstract":"Background: CT-P16 is a proposed biosimilar to FDA approved reference bevacizumab (BV), namely Avastin<sup>&#174;<\/sup>. This trial (NCT03676192) compared the efficacy and safety of CT-P16 and BV in patients with metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: This double blind, randomized, multicenter study randomly assigned patients to CT-P16 or BV with carboplatin and paclitaxel, up to 6 cycles (Induction Period), followed by maintenance CT-P16 or BV monotherapy until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) during the Induction Period. ORR includes complete or partial responses based on RECIST v1.1 assessed by an independent reviewer. Secondary endpoints were Quality of life (QoL), PK, safety, and immunogenicity.<br \/>Results: A total of 689 patients were randomized (CT-P16: 342, BV: 347). The baseline characteristics were well balanced. ORRs were similar between the two treatment arms and the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk ratio estimate (0.7368, 1.3572) and 95% CIs for risk difference estimate (&#177;12.5%) were within the equivalence margin in both ITT (intent-to-treat) and PP (per-protocol) sets. QoL results (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13) and PK parameter (C<sub>trough<\/sub>) were comparable between the two treatment arms. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious AEs (TESAEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs leading to death was similar between the two treatment arms (96.2% vs. 92.4%, 19.4% vs. 20.1%, 15.1% vs. 14.5%, and 6.4% vs. 6.4% for the CT-P16 and BV treatment arm, respectively). The incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies was comparable (14.2% vs. 16.0%).<br \/>Conclusions: This study demonstrated that CT-P16 is equivalent to BV as measured by ORR in patients with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the lung. Other endpoints including PK, QoL, safety and immunogenicity were comparable.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{56BA9A9A-0E0B-40DD-A76A-BBE6C6829316}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Primary endpoint<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>ITT<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>PP<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>CT-P16<\/b> <b>(N=342)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>BV<\/b> <b>(N=347)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>CT-P16<\/b> <b>(N=318)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>BV<\/b> <b>(N=303)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">Independent reviewer<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR (%) 95% CI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">42.40 (37.16 - 47.64)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">42.07 (36.88 - 47.27)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">45.28 (39.81 - 50.75)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">47.19 (41.57 - 52.82)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Risk ratio estimate (90% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">1.0136 (0.8767, 1.1719)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.9662 (0.8387, 1.1132)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Risk difference estimate (%) (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.40 (-7.02, 7.83)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">-1.90 (-9.80, 6.00)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">Investigator<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR (%) 95% CI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">43.86 (38.60 - 49.12)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">39.19 (34.06 - 44.33)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">46.54 (41.06 - 52.02)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">43.89 (38.31 - 49.48)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Risk ratio estimate (90% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">1.1234 (0.9683, 1.3032)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">1.0648 (0.9209, 1.2313)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Risk difference estimate (%) (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">4.87 (-2.53, 12.26)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">2.90 (-4.99, 10.79)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5d0835a2-c1d0-4c72-9b78-61640f681ce2\/@s03B8ZYA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Bevacizumab,Targeted therapy,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20290"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuichiro Ohe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Bondarenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoran Andric<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuriy Ostapenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tudor Ciuleanu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fedor Moiseenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamta Makharadze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergii Shevnya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alona Oleksiienko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eduardo Yañez Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>SungHyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>KeumYoung Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TaeHong Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sijin Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JiEun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>MinJi Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claire Verschraegen<\/i><\/presenter>.

We report results from pts aged 65-75 years.<br \/>Methods: In RATIONALE-304, eligible pts (18-75 years) were treatment-na&#239;ve and had locally advanced or metastatic non-sq NSCLC. Pts were stratified by disease stage and programmed death-ligand 1 expression, and randomized 2:1 to receive TIS (200 mg intravenously [IV]) plus platinum (carboplatin AUC 5 or cisplatin 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV) plus pemetrexed 500 mg\/m<sup>2 <\/sup>every three weeks for 4-6 cycles followed by maintenance TIS plus pemetrexed (Arm A), or platinum pemetrexed for 4-6 cycles followed by maintenance pemetrexed (Arm B). Progression-free survival (PFS) by independent review committee (IRC), objective response rate (ORR), and safety were assessed in pts aged 65-75 years.<br \/>Results: In total, 97 pts aged 65-75 years were randomized to Arm A (60 pts) or Arm B (37 pts). The median age of pts was 68.0 years, and 76 pts (78.4%) were male. PFS was longer, and ORR higher, in Arm A vs Arm B (Table). Overall, 59 pts in Arm A, and 37 pts in Arm B experienced &#8805; 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). In Arm A, Grade &#8805; 3 TEAEs occurred in 43 (72.9%) pts aged 65-75 years vs 150 (67.6%) aged &#8805; 18 years, and in Arm B, 18 (48.6%) pts aged 65-75 years vs 59 (53.6%) pts aged &#8805; 18 years. TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of any component of study treatment occurred in 19 (32.2%) pts in Arm A, and 5 (13.5%) pts in Arm B. 21 (35.6%) pts receiving TIS experienced &#8805; 1 immune-related TEAE.<br \/>Conclusions: Observed improvements in PFS and ORR support the treatment benefits of TIS in combination with platinum and pemetrexed chemotherapy in pts aged 65-75 with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

Here, we report on the non-sq population.<br \/>Methods: 805 patients with histologically confirmed, advanced NSCLC with progressive disease during or after &#8805; 1 platinum (Pt)-containing chemotherapy regimen were randomized (2:1) to TIS 200 mg or D 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal. Histology (sq vs non-sq) was a randomization stratification factor. Dual primary endpoints were OS in the ITT and PD-L1 &#8805; 25% populations. A prespecified IA was conducted after ~426 deaths (76% of planned events). Efficacy and safety were assessed in 435 randomized patients with non-sq histology.<br \/>Results: Baseline characteristics of non-sq patients were balanced between treatment arms and similar to the ITT population. As of August 10, 2020, at median follow-up of 20 and 17 months (mo), respectively, median (95% CI) OS was longer with TIS (18.6 mo [15.41, 23.16]) vs D (13.8 mo [9.43, 17.94]) in the non-sq ITT population, and objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) were also improved for TIS vs D (Table). 95.5% (TIS) and 97.9% (D) of patients had &#8805; 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 39.0% (TIS) and 70.9% (D) of patients had &#8805; Grade 3 TEAEs.

Given disease characteristics, standard of care treatment\/prognosis differ between histologic types of NSCLC. Here we report the data on the sq population.<br \/>Methods: 805 patients (pts) with histologically confirmed, advanced NSCLC with progressive disease during or after &#8805; 1 platinum (Pt)-containing chemotherapy regimen were randomized (2:1) to TIS 200 mg IV or D 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal. Histology (sq vs non-sq), was a stratification factor for randomization. Dual primary endpoints were OS in the ITT and PD-L1 &#8805; 25% populations. The IA was conducted after ~426 deaths (76% of planned events). Efficacy and safety were assessed in 370 randomized pts with sq histology.<br \/>Results: Baseline characteristics of sq pts were balanced between treatment arms and similar to the ITT population. As of August 10, 2020, at median follow-up of 19.0 and 19.3 months (mo), respectively, median (95% CI) OS was longer with TIS (16.0 mo [13.8, 18.9]) vs D (11.3 mo [8.7, 12.7]) in the sq ITT population, and progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) were also improved for TIS vs D (Table). 95.1% (TIS) and 99.1% (D) of pts had &#8805; 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 38.1% (TIS) and 79.5% (D) of pts had &#8805; Grade 3 TEAEs. The most common TEAEs were anemia, cough and alanine amino transferase increased (TIS arm), and anemia, alopecia, and neutrophil count decreased (D arm).<br \/>Conclusions: TIS prolonged OS with a favorable safety profile in pts with advanced sq NSCLC who progressed after a Pt-containing regimen. The data are consistent with the overall ITT population.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{89FE0AD3-5A02-4E08-93B4-BC7109E59FE3}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Efficacy*<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>TIS (n=248)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>D (n=122)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median OS, mo (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">16.0 (13.80, 18.86)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">11.3 (8.67, 12.68)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OS HR (95% CI)<sup>†<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">0.58 (0.436, 0.761)<br>P &lt;

Among pts enrolled in China, pembro prolonged OS (HR; 95% CI) vs chemo in pts with PD-L1 TPS &#8805;50% (0.63; 0.43-0.94), TPS &#8805;20% (0.66; 0.47-0.92), and TPS &#8805;1% (0.67; 0.50-0.89). We present efficacy and safety outcomes with an additional 14 calendar mo of follow-up in Chinese pts in KEYNOTE-042.<br \/>Methods: Pts enrolled in China in the KEYNOTE-042 global (NCT02220894) and China extension (NCT03850444) studies were randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg Q3W for &#8804;35 cycles or carboplatin+paclitaxel or pemetrexed with optional pemetrexed maintenance (nonsquamous only). Primary endpoints were OS in pts with PD-L1 TPS &#8805;50%, &#8805;20%, and &#8805;1%. Eligible pts who completed 35 cycles of pembro could receive a second course of pembro. No alpha was allocated to the China extension analysis.<br \/>Results: 262 pts with PD-L1 TPS &#8805;1% were randomized in China to pembro (n = 128) or chemo (n = 134). Median time from randomization to data cutoff (Apr 28, 2021) was 47.2 (range, 39.8-56.1) mo. Pembro prolonged OS (HR, 95% CI) vs chemo in pts with PD-L1 TPS &#8805;50% (0.66, 0.45-0.95), &#8805;20% (0.68, 0.49-0.93), and &#8805;1% (0.67, 0.51-0.89; Table). 19.5% and 68.8% of pts in the pembro and chemo groups experienced treatment-related grade 3-5 AEs. Among 22 pts who completed 35 cycles of pembro, ORR was 81.8% (95% CI, 59.7%-94.8%); estimated OS rate 4 y after randomization was 69.1%. At data cutoff, 79 pts in each group had begun subsequent therapy; 4 pts began a second course of pembro.<br \/>Conclusion: Similar to the global KEYNOTE-042 study, first-line pembro continues to prolong OS and provide durable response in pts in China with advanced\/metastatic PD-L1-positive NSCLC without <i>EGFR\/ALK<\/i> alterations after nearly 4 y of follow-up. Pembro monotherapy remains a standard of care in these pts.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{0D547914-9FDA-4E12-8155-CB8A585D70BD}\"><caption>Table<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>PD-L1 TPS &#8805;50%<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>PD-L1 TPS &#8805;20%<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>PD-L1 TPS &#8805;1%<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Pembro<\/b> <b>n = 72<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Chemo<\/b> <b>n = 74<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Pembro<\/b> <b>n = 101<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Chemo<\/b> <b>n = 103<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Pembro<\/b> <b>n = 128<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Chemo<\/b> <b>n = 134<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OS, median (95% CI), mo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24.5 (17.4-34.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.8 (10.1-18.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.9 (17.4-27.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.5 (10.1-17.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20.2 (17.4-25.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.5 (10.1-17.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OS, HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.66 (0.45-0.95)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.68 (0.49-0.93)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.67 (0.51-0.89) <\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OS 4-y rate (95% CI), %<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23.4 (13.5-34.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.6 (6.1-24.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22.5 (14.2-31.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14.4 (8.0-22.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.3 (14.1-29.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12.7 (7.2-19.7)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR<sup>a<\/sup> (95% CI), %<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">41.7 (30.2-53.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24.3 (15.1-35.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">34.7 (25.5-44.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24.3 (16.4-33.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">32.0 (24.1-40.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24.6 (17.6-32.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DOR, median (range), mo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16.5 (1.4+ to 47.1+)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.7 (1.6+ to 46.9+)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16.5 (1.4+ to 47.1+)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.9 (1.6+ to 46.9+)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16.0 (1.4+ to 47.1+)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.9 (1.1+ to 46.9+)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DOR &#8805;2-y, %<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">36.9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">34.0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">37.4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">36.7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"7\">DOR, duration of response;

Results of the phase 1b KEYNOTE-029 trial showed promising antitumor activity in advanced melanoma with pembro combined with a CTLA-4 inhibitor. This ongoing, open-label, multiarm phase 1\/2 study (NCT03179436) evaluating the CTLA-4 inhibitor Qmab + pembro showed antitumor activity as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC and for previously treated extensive-stage SCLC. Data from the efficacy expansion phase in pts with advanced melanoma that progressed on a PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor are presented.<br \/>Methods: Pts with unresectable stage III-IV melanoma and confirmed progressive disease (PD) per iRECIST within 12 wk of the last dose of a PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor given alone or in combination for &#8805;2 doses (combinations with CTLA-4 inhibitors were not allowed) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive Qmab 25 mg IV Q6W with or without pembro 400 mg IV Q6W; 100 pts in the Qmab + pembro arm and 40 pts in the Qmab monotherapy arm were planned for enrollment. Treatment in both arms was given for up to 18 cycles (~2 y) or until PD, toxicity, or pt withdrawal. Pts who had PD after &#8805;2 Qmab monotherapy cycles could crossover to Qmab + pembro. Tumor imaging was assessed Q9W to wk 54 and Q12W thereafter. Primary end points were safety and ORR by BICR per RECIST v1.1. Secondary and exploratory end points included DOR and PFS by BICR per RECIST v1.1 and OS.<br \/>Results: 151 pts were enrolled (n = 111, Qmab + pembro; n = 40, Qmab monotherapy); median time from first dose to database cutoff was 7.7 mo. In all pts, median age was 64 y; 66% of pts were male, 33% had <i>BRAF<\/i>-mutant tumors, and 50% had elevated LDH. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 87 pts (78%) in the Qmab + pembro arm and 24 pts (60%) in the Qmab monotherapy arm; grade 3\/4 TRAEs were reported in 16 pts (14%) and 3 pts (8%), respectively. The most common TRAEs were pruritus (26%), fatigue (14%), diarrhea (14%), and rash (13%). No treatment-related deaths occurred in either arm; 5% of pts discontinued because of TRAEs. Confirmed ORR was 9% (95% CI, 4.4-15.9) with Qmab + pembro (1 CR, 9 PRs) and 3% (95% CI, 0.1-13.2) with Qmab monotherapy (1 PR). Median DOR was not reached (NR; range, 2.0+ to 13.8+ mo) with Qmab + pembro. DOR was 1.9+ with Qmab monotherapy. Median PFS was 2.1 mo (95% CI, 2.1-3.2) with Qmab + pembro and 2.1 mo (95% CI, 2.1-2.5) with Qmab monotherapy; 6-mo PFS rates were 21% and 13%, respectively. Median OS was NR (95% CI, 11.2 mo to NR) with Qmab + pembro and 7.8 mo (95% CI, 6.3 to NR) with Qmab monotherapy; 6-mo OS rates were 74% and 73%, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Qmab + pembro was generally well tolerated and provided modest antitumor activity in pts with advanced melanoma that progressed on a PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor. This combination and a coformulation of Qmab + pembro will be further investigated in the KEYMAKER-U02 study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2b09753-1932-460f-adc4-2935bfa7d852\/@t03B8ZYB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anti-PD-1,Cancer immunotherapy,CTLA-4,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20296"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanjeev Deva<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacek Mackiewicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephane Dalle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen Gogas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iwona Lugowska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfonso Berrocal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander M.
