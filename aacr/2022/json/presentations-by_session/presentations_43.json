Compared to European American men (EAM), African American men (AAM) have 2-3 times higher prostate cancer mortality rates. Prostate tumors in AAM were observed to undergo an early transformation from latent into clinical disease and be more aggressive when diagnosed. Furthermore, men of African Ancestry from the Caribbean and South America demonstrate high incidence and mortality rates similar to AAM, suggesting a possible ancestral basis for some of these expected outcomes. The underlying etiology of racial disparity is multifactorial and includes genetic, tumor biology, socioeconomic and environmental factors. The genomic landscape of PCa has been well-defined but remains controversial in explaining the higher PCa incidence and mortality in AAM. Previous studies suggested that tumor subtypes or gene expression profiles had the greatest influence on overall racial\/ethnic survival accounting for 24% of the disparities in PCa and remains even when controlled for access to care and stage at presentation. Moreover, the tumor microenvironment plays an essential role in tumor progression, aggressiveness, therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. Specifically, African American prostate tumors predominantly have upregulation of immune-inflammatory gene signature that has a critical role in driving aggressive PCa in this cohort. Additionally, the association of the genomic findings with patient Ancestry and other characteristics such as tumor biology and transcriptomic alterations remains poorly understood. Here <b><u>we hypothesize<\/u><\/b> that African Ancestry drives aggressive PCa and lead to genetic alterations characterized by upregulation of unique Immune-inflammatory signature in AAM of African descent. The <b><u>significance of our study<\/u><\/b> is that it provides new perspectives on the fact that men of African descent are affected by a systemic inflammatory process characterized by changes in the immune system that increases the risk of lethal PCa. The <b><u>study's overall objective<\/u><\/b> is to understand the relationships between genetic Ancestry, immune-inflammatory signature, and distinct tumor biology in AAM and men of African descent compared to EA men, focusing on strategies that help with prevention and therapeutic intervention. <b><u>Specifically, we pursued the following aims:<\/u><\/b> <b>Aim I<\/b>: Assess the presence of unique immune-inflammation signature in men from African Ancestry with prostate cancer compared to European Ancestry men. <b>Aim II:<\/b> Evaluate how the presence of the immune-inflammatory signature relates to genetic Ancestry and disease aggressiveness. <b>Aim III:<\/b> Understand the true picture of tumor microenvironment in AAM\/ African men compared to European Ancestry men. <b><u>To address our hypothesis<\/u><\/b>, we performed a genome-wide sequencing (Whole-Exome Sequences (WES) and RNA sequences for a total of (n= 185) patients obtained from three cohorts with treatment-naive PCa who self-reported race (SRR) as 45 AAM, 93 West African (Nigerian), and 47 EAM. We surmised that this combination has the power to address the racial disparities of PCa and reveal some of the reasons that underlie these population differences. Our lab has recently pioneered an ancestry analysis pipeline using RNA sequencing data that has been validated with genotyping Ancestry. To verify the self-reported race, we used ADMIXTURE to engender a quantitative estimate of each individual ancestral composition. The raw reads from RNA sequencing were aligned to the GRCh38 genome using STAR aligner (latest version). Next, the gene-level expression was measured from STAR counts using Ensembl gene annotation. The resulting datasets were then analyzed for differential gene expression using EdgR\/DESeq2 and enriched pathways based on the patient's Ancestry, race, and Gleason Score using GSEA and EdgR gene ontology function. Additionally, we conducted a descriptive statistical analysis of the study population where the patients were stratified by race\/Ancestry and pathology stage. Out of 185 total, 25 samples paired WES (normal tumor paired) were matched with RNA Sequences samples. We measured the percentage of qualified genetic Ancestry using SNVs from the matching paired WES and RNA sequences samples to determine the association of mutations and gene expression. To verify our analysis, we used another WES (tumor only) and RNA Seq dataset with a total of 65 patients (n=65) who self-reported race as 28 AAM, 33 EAM, and 4 unknown SRR. Out of 65 total samples, 47 samples with WES (tumor only) were matched with RNA Sequences. <b><u>Our results demonstrate<\/u><\/b> that prostate patients with African Ancestry are diagnosed at a younger age and show advanced pathology stage compared to patients with European Ancestry. Most of our cohorts who self-reported as AA or Nigerian, their Ancestry assigned to African Ancestry (Ancestry proportion &#62; 70%) with either Bantu subpopulation in Sub-Saharan area (western central Africa) and\/or Yoruba (Nigeria) subpopulation. Furthermore, we found that patients with African Ancestry have a high association with mutations such as AR-related mutation, with SPOP mutation as one of the top mutations. Other associated mutations include FOXA1, PTEN, TP53, and EPHB2. Our differential gene expression analyses revealed that gene sets such as interferon-gamma, complement cascade, and FCGR activation (JAK1, HLA-DRA, IRF1, AIFT1, IFITM1, FCGR) are positively enriched (p-value 0.05), while gene sets such as metabolism and Diabetes (ATF4, CD69, KLF9) are negatively enriched (p-value 0.05) in African men. Interestingly, T cell activation markers such as CD3E, IL6, CD69, CD8A&#38;B, and CD4 are downregulated, while T- cell exhaustion markers such as LAG3, KLRG1, CD274 (PD-L1), and CD160 are upregulated in patients with high African Ancestry compared to European Ancestry patients. <b><u>In summary<\/u><\/b>, our study is the first to perform whole-exome sequencing (WES) on Nigerian men with prostate cancer tumors. Our study provides new insight into understanding how genetic Ancestry and immune-inflammatory signature could contribute to PCa racial disparities in AA and African men cohorts from African Ancestry. Furthermore, our findings could lead to new therapeutic strategies using anti-inflammatory drugs and immune modulators to decrease the global disease burden, especially among men at high risk for PCa, such as AAM. Since genome, transcriptome, and metabolite have complementary roles when performing a biological function, moving forward, we will use multi-omics methods to integrate data obtained from different omics levels in order to understand the interrelation and influence on the disease processes. In parallel, we will use the Akoya-Codex system to examine whether the immune-inflammation signature drives aggressive PCa or the tumor itself induces an aggressive microenvironment in AAM\/African cohort. Akoya Codex system is a highly multiplexed system of immunohistochemistry on tissue sections. Codex analysis is coupled with spatial omics at the single spatial resolution that simultaneously stains FFPE tissue with up to 40 markers and measures the distance of each cell\/marker to other cell types within a tumor mass.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Nigerian, African American,Disparities, Ancestry, WES,RNA Sequences, CODEX,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isra A.
