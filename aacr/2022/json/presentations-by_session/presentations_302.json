[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Nanoparticles are a modular technology with great promise for cancer treatment, but one obstacle for clinical implementation is a lack of predictive biomarkers to identify patient groups most likely to benefit from specific nanoformulations. We developed a massively parallel pooled screen to investigate genomic factors underlying NP-cancer cell engagement, and report here the identification of a predictive biomarker that is both formulation-specific and cancer lineage agnostic.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We interrogated the interactions of 35 fluorescent nanoparticle formulations (15 liposomal and 25 polymeric) against 488 pooled, barcoded cancer cell lines using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and binned cells based on strength of association. After sequencing, the relative barcode abundance in each bin was used to generate an association score for each nanoparticle-cell line pair. We identified features predictive of NP-cancer cell association by interfacing this score with multi-omic data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Using machine learning model predictions, we identified thousands of candidate biomarkers both across and within formulations. Expression of the lysosomal transporter SLC46A3 was the top ranked random forest feature for all liposome formulations and was prioritized for further study. Univariate analyses confirmed the significance of this candidate biomarker and indicated a negative relationship, such that <i>low <\/i>expression of SLC46A3 is highly correlated with <i>high<\/i> nanoparticle association. This inverse relationship held true across all 22 cancer lineages screened and was recapitulated in a non-pooled screen of 13 cancer cell lines with a range of native SLC46A3 expression. To determine whether modulating SLC46A3 expression is sufficient to negatively regulate uptake of liposomes, we developed a toolkit of engineered cell lines by knocking out SLC46A3 in high-expressing T47D cells and inducing overexpression in low-expressing LOXIMVI cells. Consistent with our hypothesis, we show that SLC46A3 expression is inversely correlated with uptake of liposomal, but not polymeric, nanoparticles. To evaluate the potential clinical utility of SLC46A3 as a biomarker, we tested <i>in vivo<\/i> delivery of an FDA-approved nanoparticle analog, the drug-free version of liposomal irinotecan, to LOXIMVI flank tumors via intratumoral injection and intravenous administration. For both administration methods, we show that low tumor expression of SLC46A3 correlates with significantly improved delivery of liposomal nanoparticles.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We identified SLC46A3 as a negative regulator of liposomal nanoparticle delivery to cancer cells both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Given that liposomal nanoparticles comprise the majority of FDA approvals for cancer indications, we propose SLC46A3 may be a clinically actionable biomarker for patient stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4ef886e4-8b72-4836-a2a5-23426acc6c5d\/@x03B8ZAN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Biomarkers,Drug delivery,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13794"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joelle P.

A significant effort is needed to understand the genetic landscape of this disease to develop novel therapeutic strategies and modalities. Recently, the Bindra laboratory found that a truncation mutation in the gene <i>PPM1D<\/i>, found in ~30% of DIPG cases, causes global epigenetic alterations that lead to therapeutic vulnerabilities. They found that mutant PPM1D activity results in loss of the NAD+ biogenesis protein NAPRT that can be therapeutically targeted by inhibitors of another protein in the NAD+ biogenesis pathway NAMPT (NAMPTi), providing a viable therapeutic strategy for these cancers. Some NAMPTis have been FDA-approved for clinical usage, but present with systemic and retinal toxicity. Moreover, while there are few NAMPTis that can pass the blood brain barrier through systemic delivery, studies show diminished concentrations at the target site. Together, current studies show that the use of NAMPTis for precision targeting of CNS cancers such as DIPG with mutant PPM1D status is a promising therapeutic strategy, but impractical given the limitations of these drugs. However, recent developments in drug delivery systems offer a chance to overcome these issues. Tools such as nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery and unique injection set-ups such as convection-enhanced delivery (CED) allow for drugs such as NAMPTis to be reconsidered for clinical usage. To circumvent the challenges presented by these drugs, we have developed and characterized nanoparticles that encapsulate NAMPTis (NAMPTi-NP) and use CED for sustained intratumoral delivery. Thus far, we have fabricated and optimized PLA-PEG copolymeric nanoparticles capable of encapsulating the NAMPTi, GMX-1778. We characterized these nanoparticles based on (1) hydrodynamic diameter, (2) zeta potential, and (3) stability within an artificial cerebrospinal fluid <i>in vitro<\/i> solution. We have performed both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> assays to determine the functionality of the NAMPTi-NPs through (1) cellular uptake studies via immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, (2) functional analysis via NAD<sup>+<\/sup> quantification, (3) short- and long-term cell viability assays to determine sensitivity to the NAMPTi-NP, and (4) <i>in vivo <\/i>biodistribution studies to assess sustained retention of NAMPTi-NP with CED intracranial injections. We find that NAMPTi-NPs have immediate and sustained cellular uptake, loss of NAD<sup>+<\/sup> post-treatment indicating effective targeting, and enhanced sensitivity in long-term viability studies in mutant PPM1D models. Lastly, these NAMPTi-NPs display prolonged retention in brain tissue compared to free drug injection over time. With further <i>in vivo<\/i> validation, this NP-based strategy will be a powerful tool for targeting mutant PPM1D DIPG and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b34c9e99-e32e-44df-a288-e8f3920cb2dc\/@x03B8ZAN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Metabolism,Drug delivery,Brain tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13795"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew Murray<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yazhe Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ranjini K.

Despite intensive efforts over many years, the prognosis is essentially unchanged. The primary reason is failure of otherwise effective therapy to reach the tumor, due to the blood brain barrier (BBB). To circumvent this functional barrier, we have developed CD99 and CD276 targeted irinotecan (Ir) containing liposomal nanoparticles (TNS: Targeted NanoSpheres) TNSs effectively penetrate the BBB and selectively bind to GBM cells while largely bypassing normal brain tissue. CD99 or CD276 targeted Ir-TNSs prolonged survival five-fold over free Ir treated animals in bi-weekly single dose level studies. Normal tissue levels were negligible, and no treatment-related toxicity was observed. QD dose intensification induced tumor regression in animals with progressive tumor. Anti-tumor effect was equivalent for either CD99 or CD276 Ir-TNSs. These results imply that intracranial therapy with otherwise effective drugs that do not pass the BBB is both feasible and shows superior efficacy over free drug therapy. Further, widespread expression of CD276 by many malignancies implies this therapy could be effective for metastatic brain tumors and extra-cranial malignancies as well.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c2e3e69-51ee-436b-b1a8-d38cc263a551\/@x03B8ZAN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Brain tumors,Targeted drug delivery,Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13796"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>HyungGyoo Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon Nagy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryon Upton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Triche<\/i><\/presenter>.

Metastatic cancer remains to this day one of the most difficult areas in oncology to treat and diagnose. Current standardized treatments consist of systemically administered chemotherapeutics, which are not targeted to the diseased areas and oftentimes cause significant side effects. Therefore, novel treatments such as targeted immunotherapies are under development. The S100A9 protein is upregulated in the tumor microenvironment and it plays an important role in tumor metastasis, aggressiveness, and tumor immunosuppression. It is present not only in the pre-metastatic tumor environment, but is also heavily secreted and expressed after metastatic tumor establishment has occurred. This makes S100A9 a prime target in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings; yet, targeted immunotherapies against S100A9 have never previously been explored. CPMV has been shown in the past to be immunostimulatory when injected directly into the tumor with the ability to recruit immune cells for tumor cell killing. However, metastatic tumors cannot be treated through intratumoral injections; therefore, the current work utilizes systemically-administered S100A9-targeted CPMV nanoparticles. Biodistribution studies indicate that S100A9-targeted CPMV homes to the lung while confocal imaging of S100A9 and S100A9-targeted CPMV within the lungs of tumor-inoculated mice demonstrates co-localization. We further demonstrate using flow cytometry that after CPMV homes to the lungs, immune cells such as neutrophils and dendritic cells are recruited to the lungs, and macrophages are polarized towards their antitumor M1 phenotype.

The field of three-way junction (3WJ) based RNA nanoparticles has advanced rapidly and shows promise as an effective <i>in vivo<\/i> siRNA delivery system. This aim of this study is to explore the potential of 3WJ-pRNA nanoparticles for specific and efficient delivery of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> siRNA to NSCLC cells harboring a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation to effectively silence KRAS oncogenic activity.<br \/><b>Experimental design:<\/b> Multifunctional EGFRapt-3WJ-siKRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> nanoparticles were prepared using bottom-up self-assembly approach, and characterized by agarose gel shift assay, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis system (TGGE).

They have shown significant potential in pancreatic cancer (PC) clinical trials when combined with chemotherapy. It is pertinent to know that although TTFields-chemotherapy combination definitely enhances the treatment efficacy, it also results in chemotherapy induced severe adverse effects. To resolve this, we earlier reported development of Gemcitabine loaded self-assembling cationic-anionic polymer nanoparticles (S-CAP NPs) capable of achieving TTFields-triggered targeted drug release at the PC tumor site. Initially, four S-CAP NPs [C4 and C7 from chitosan- bovine serum albumin (Chitosan-BSA) S-CAP NPs; P5 and P8 from polyethylenimine- bovine serum albumin (PEI-BSA) S-CAP NPs] were shortlisted [Table 1 - particle size: ~ 200 nm; % encapsulation efficiency (EE): 55-65%]. For proof-of-concept studies, effect of TTFields on the % EE and % cumulative drug release of the S-CAP-NPs was investigated. The studies revealed (Table 1) significant reduction (p value &#60; 0.05) in the % EE of S-CAP NPs within 48h TTFields treatment, confirming that the TTFields destabilize the NPs triggering targeted drug release. Similarly, In vitro drug release studies showed significant increase (p&#60; 0.01) in rate of drug release from S-Cap NPs in presence of TTFields. The cell inhibition assay confirmed the synergism in cell apoptosis wherein PEI-BSA S-CAP NPs showed higher efficacy compared to chitosan-BSA S-CAP NPs. Further, additional stability studies continued over a period of 18 months confirmed stable formulations. In vivo acute and chronic toxicity studies are underway to identify the most optimum dose of S-CAP NPs for further in vivo efficacy studies. To summarize, S-CAP-NPs present a promising avenue to achieve targeted chemotherapy in conjunction with TTFields.

The survival rate of patients with this form of cancer is about 8%. The physiological barrier of the tumor microenvironment composed of a dense stroma and disorganized blood vessels creates a barrier for early identification and treatment of this deadly disease. In recent years, nanoparticle-based controlled delivery systems were developed to exploit the pathophysiology of biological systems such as acidic tumor microenvironment or the altered tumor-specific enzymes to improve the diagnosis and treatment efficacy. Here, we demonstrate the collagenase IV-mediated tumor site-selective release of the IR-780 imaging probe from the M-Ge-SDC1 nanoparticles, revealing the feasibility of the collagenase IV (MMP-9) responsive target specificity for diagnosing pancreatic cancer by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging.<br \/>Methods: Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with wormhole pore topology were synthesized and were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surface of MSN was conjugated with Gelatin-A to obtain M-Ge. The M-Ge particles were loaded with propidium Iodide (PI) or IR780 infrared imaging dye. The M-Ge surface was further conjugated with Syndecan-1 (SDC1) to improve the target specificity to release imaging cargo from the nanoparticles. Female athymic mice were orthotopically implanted with S2VP10 tumor cells. After a week of tumor implantation, mice were intravenously injected with M-Ge-SDC1 nanoparticles containing IR780 dye and were imaged with MSOT and AMI.<br \/>Results: In the current study, Mesoporous silica nanoparticles with 27 nm diameter were synthesized. The Gelatin-A crosslinking on the surface of MSN particles as a gatekeeper was developed that could degrade upon contact with collagenase IV in the tumor microenvironment. The conjugation of SDC1 further improved the tumor specificity. The athymic mice orthotopically implanted with S2VP10 cells closely resemble human PDAC. Our results demonstrated that intravenous delivery of M-Ge-SDC1 nanoparticles could enzymatically degrade (MMP-9) and release IR780 at the tumor site and conjugation of SDC1 further improved the tumor specificity to detect the orthotopically implanted pancreatic tumors (p&#60;0.0001,n=5).<br \/>Conclusion: Due to the lack of effective screening tools, PDAC has the lowest survival rate and limited therapeutic efficacy for current FDA-approved drugs compared to other malignancies. Innovative technologies to develop engineered nanoparticles with active targeting moiety and dynamic imaging technology can overcome these limitations. Implementing such systems can enhance PDAC detection that can be translated into the clinic to improve health care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a3c40f9-2431-4697-91d9-38e9f9033d85\/@y03B8ZAP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Molecular imaging,Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13803"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Abhilash Samykutty<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Molly McNally<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William M.

Although docetaxel (DTX) and other anti-mitotic chemotherapeutic drug are considered the first line drugs for PCa patients; the resulting side effects and drug resistance increase the demand for an alternative such as natural compounds for effective treatment. However, the natural compounds that achieved remarkable height to overcome drug resistance, their bioavailability and targeted delivery during treatment has become a new challenge. As prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptors are expressed on the surface of most PCa cells, we anticipated that these receptors may provide the potential target for effective therapy. Considering these, we employed the natural compound, thymoquinone (TQ)-encapsulated planetary ball-milled nanoparticles (PBM-NPs) formulated with starch (FDA approved, natural polysaccharides) inner core and biocompatible and biodegradable co-polymers poly (&#949;-caprolactone)\/ poly (ethylene glycol), functionalized with a PSMA aptamer (A10), which can selectively recognize and bind to PSMA membrane. The functionalities of this strategy were analyzed by targeting A10-TQ-PBM-NP in DTX-resistant cells (C4-2B-R and LNCaP-R), which overexpresses PSMA protein and multidrug resistance (MDR) gene ABCB1, and validated through flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and western blot techniques. The results showed that the aptamer-based nano delivery of a TQ can modulate the cellular and molecular pathways responsible for DTX resistance in PCa cells through the EGFR and ZEB1 dependent mechanism. The A10-TQ-PBM-NPs counteract ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter-mediated chemoresistance in PCa cells. In both cell lines, these NPs rapidly internalized and induced significant cell death at five times lower concentrations than non-conjugated PBM-TQ-NP. Further, A10-TQ-PBM-NPs have high selectivity to the PSMA receptor and downregulated the EGFR dependent pathway, Akt-1, ERK1\/2, NF-kB, STAT3, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in both C4-2B-R and LNCaP-R cells, thus constraining cell survival, proliferation, and migration. The A10-TQ-PBM-NP bioconjugates also reveal remarkable efficacy and reduced toxicity as measured by body weight loss in the LNCaP-R cells xenograft mice. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that targeting PCa cells with PBM-NPs may reverse the MDR and could be used as potential therapeutic options for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0540af61-9a72-4d8d-9da5-914a078a17af\/@y03B8ZAP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Nanoparticle,Natural products,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13804"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Santosh Kumar Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manoj Kumar Mishra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajesh Singh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Trametinib-induced MEK inhibition in KRAS-mutant (KRAS<sup>mt<\/sup>) lung cancer, however, results in compensatory MAPK pathway re-activation through fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). Combining MEK inhibition with FGFR1 inhibition should thereby combat this compensation; nonetheless, systemic administration of combination therapy faces its own set of challenges. Such challenges include delivering appropriate kinase inhibitor concentrations to target tumor tissue while avoiding dose-limiting additive toxicities.<br \/>Although previous work has identified that combination therapy involving trametinib and FGFR inhibitor (FGFRi) ponatinib synergistically inhibits growth and proliferation of KRAS<sup>mt<\/sup> cells, ponatinib interacts with a variety of targets and may mediate its synergistic effects via mechanisms not specific to FGFR1. To improve the efficacy at which we target KRAS<sup>mt<\/sup>\/FGFR-compensatory lung tumors, we encapsulated trametinib with a variety of FGFR1-specific inhibitors to form P-selectin-targeted nanoparticles. By formulating these nanoparticles, compensatory MAPK pathway activation through FGFR1 can be more efficaciously inhibited. Concurrently, greater concentrations of kinase inhibitor combinations can be locally delivered to lung tumors while mitigating toxic side effects that occur from systemic free drug. Here we show that these MEKi-FGFRi combination nanoparticles can be formulated to efficaciously inhibit growth and proliferation in KRAS<sup>mt<\/sup>\/FGFR-compensatory cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/90f99b77-2b57-4ba6-b8c2-6ab1772e1cdc\/@y03B8ZAP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Ras,Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13805"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arianna R.

DNA nanostructures are promising drug delivery platforms for targeted cancer therapy due to their highly programmable molecular interactions, precisely defined geometry, stoichiometry, as well as outstanding biocompatibility. However, most DNA nanostructures are taken up by cells through endocytosis pathway, resulting in the subsequent endo- and lysosomal trapping and degradation. Here we design a smart DNA nanorobot that will go through endocytosis-independent pathway with tumor target specificity and therapeutic effects for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been reported that disulfide units are able to mediate cytosolic uptake of DNA and RNA molecules by disulfide exchange reactions with thiol groups on the cell membrane protein. Therefore, we site-specifically modify disulfide units onto the inside surface of DNA nanorobot. 24-helix DNA origami nanotube is used as drug delivery vehicle. To achieve target specificity, we use HER2 affibody, a short peptide that has high binding affinity [K<sub>D<\/sub>=22pM] to HER2 protein that overexpressed on the cell membrane of breast cancer cells, and truncated HER2 protein as a temporary lock-and-key to close DNA nanorobot. In this way, DNA nanorobot can only be opened when it reaches tumor cells that overexpress HER2 protein which has a higher binding affinity to HER2 affibody. The inner disulfide units will be exposed to mediate cytosolic uptake of DNA nanorobot. To achieve potent therapeutic effect, we use therapeutic siRNAs\/shRNAs as drugs due to their efficient target gene silencing, splice modulation and gene activation potentials. Cytosolic uptake of siRNAs\/shRNAs by DNA nanorobot could maximize their target knockdown effect since siRNAs\/shRNAs silencing occurs primarily in the cytoplasm. We use atomic force microscope (AFM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorimeter to characterize the formation of the DNA nanorobot. The cellular uptake of DNA nanorobot is evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and flow cytometry. Use RT-qPCR and western blot to test the gene and protein knockdown effect. In the future, we will do <i>in vivo<\/i> experiment on tumor xenograft mice and assess the antitumor effect of DNA nanorobot. Our current results demonstrated that DNA origami modified with disulfide units can directly get internalized into the cytoplasm of cells. In addition, protecting disulfide units inside the DNA origami nanotube can block the cytosolic uptake. Therefore, our DNA nanorobot has the potential to be an efficient and safe drug delivery platform for cancer therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/18a2eb85-b46f-48da-9777-cb05e891aae2\/@y03B8ZAP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,DNA,RNAi,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13806"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lu Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Current therapies for HNSCC include surgical resection, chemotherapy (CT), and radiotherapy (RT). For locally advanced\/unresectable HNSCC, the CT-RT combination (&#8220;chemoradiation&#8221;) has been shown to be more effective than CT or RT alone, and is currently the standard of care. Intratumoral (IT) chemotherapy-based chemoradiation has the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional systemic CT-RT that severely affects a patient&#8217;s quality of life. For realization of maximum benefits from IT CT-RT, our team has developed a radiation-controlled drug release nanoparticle formulation (paclitaxel (PTX) and CaWO<sub>4<\/sub> nanoparticles (CWO NPs) co-encapsulated within a capsule formed by poly(ethylene glycol)-poly (lactic acid) (PEG-PLA), named &#8220;PEG-PLA\/CWO\/PTX NPs&#8221;). This unique formulation releases PTX only when it is exposed to X-ray irradiation. We have previously reported that IT-administered PEG-PLA\/CWO\/PTX NPs stay within the tumor for at least a month, producing significant therapeutic effects in terms of tumor suppression and survival in mouse models of HNSCC. This work demonstrates the effect of PTX stereochemistry on radiation-controlled release of the drug from a nano polymer matrix system (PEG-PLA\/CWO\/PTX NPs). The stereoisomertic characteristics of PTX products from two different manufacturers (&#8220;PTX-S&#8221;, and &#8220;PTX-B&#8221;) were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, circular dichroism and 2D HMQC\/NOESY NMR measurements. In their unencapsulated (free) state, PTX-S and PTX-B were comparable in their ability to kill cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. However, they were found to be significantly different in water solubility; PTX-S (water solubility &#8776; 4.69 &#956;g\/mL) is about 19 times more water soluble than PTX-B (water solubility &#8776; 0.25 &#956;g\/mL). This difference in water solubility was found to cause a large difference in X-ray-triggered release kinetics of the PTX loaded within the PEG-PLA\/CWO\/PTX NPs in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> environments; PTX-S is released from PEG-PLA\/CWO NPs significantly faster upon X-ray irradiation than PTX-B. This difference in release kinetics produced an interesting difference in their time-dependent therapeutic effects; at short times (&#60; 1 month), concurrent PEG-PLA\/CWO\/PTX-S NPs produced a greater tumor suppression effect; on the other hand, PEG-PLA\/CWO\/PTX-B NPs had a longer lasting radio-sensitizing effect. In summary, the stereoisomers of PTX exhibit significantly different PK characteristics when used with controlled release carriers, even though they are pharmacologically indistinguishable in their unformulated form.<b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03d8796b-e893-4fff-bbfc-36a44ea1a49d\/@y03B8ZAP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Paclitaxel,Nanoparticle,Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13807"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kaustabh Sarkar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Torresgrossa-Allen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark P.

The treatment of PanCa is highly challenging due to the extremely poor response to existing therapeutic options. Highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment in pancreatic tumor causes suboptimal delivery of therapeutic agents in tumors that eventually resulted to chemo-resistance. Piperlongumine (PL) is a natural alkaloid isolated from the long pepper, Piper longum L., and has shown substantial cancer-preventive and therapeutic efficacy against variety of cancers. However, delivering its effective concentration in pancreatic tumors has been challenging. In this study, we have synthesized and characterized a novel nano-formulation of PL composed of a PLGA core (PLGA-PL), stabilized with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and coated with poly-L-lysine (PLL), and evaluated its therapeutic effects against PanCa.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The various physicochemical approaches (FT-IR, DSC, TEM, TGA, and HPLC) was used to characterize the PLGA-PL formulation for particle size, chemical composition, and drug loading efficiency. Cellular uptake of PLGA-PL was achieved in incubation with PLGA-PL in PanCa cells. Further, the therapeutic efficacy of PLGA-PL was determined by using various in vitro assays (MTS, wound healing, boyden chamber, cell cycle and apoptosis assays) using PanCa cells. The effects of PLGA-PL on various key oncogenic signaling pathways were evaluated by qRT-PCR, Western blot, confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our novel PLGA-PL formulation has an average size of 110 nm in dynamic light scattering and a zeta potential range of -6.52 to -7.68 mV with excellent PL loading efficiency. Cellular uptake and internalization studies show that PLGA-PL escapes lysosomal degradation, allowing for effective endosomal release into the cytosol. PLGA-PL showed superior anti-cancer activity in various PanCa cells (BxPC-3, HPAF-II, AsPC-1, Panc-1, and MIA PaCa-2) compared to free PL. Moreover, PLGA-PL showed a remarkable inhibition of the migration and invasion potential of PanCa cells. Furthermore, PLGA-PL more effectively inhibited the components of the Shh pathway and Gli targets as determined by qPCR and Western blot analysis. Additionally, PLGA-PL treatment targets cancer stem cells by regulating pluripotency, maintaining stemness factors (Oct-4, Sox2, Nanog and c-Myc), and limiting tumor sphere formation.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Taken together, our results demonstrate that PLGA-PL nanoformulation exhibits superior anti-cancer potential than free PL against and could be used as a novel therapeutic modality for the management of PanCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd12d1af-8080-4ac7-8e51-3f1018b1efa2\/@y03B8ZAP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Nanoparticle,Gli1,Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13808"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vivek Kumar Kashyap<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Godwin P.

A defect in the hematopoietic pathway results in the uncontrolled proliferation of B-cell and T-cell lymphocyte precursors. Treatments for ALL are patient-specific and are determined based on prognostic factors such as age, minimal residue disease, and genetic alterations. Nano-sized liposomes are drug-delivery vehicles used to enhance the delivery of drugs to target cells. The composition, size, and overall charge of nanoliposomes are determinants of targeting and influence the degree of drug uptake selectivity. The objective of this study was to design, optimize, and characterize novel cell membrane lipid-extracted nanoliposomes (CLENs) for pediatric ALL and to evaluate the degree of selectivity in comparison to relevant controls.<br \/>Methods: The ALL-cell line, CCRF-CEM, was the chosen model for ALL disease and drug selectivity studies. CCRF-CEM cells were cultured and expanded in vitro for cellular extraction purposes. The CCRF-CEM cell lipid extract (LE) was included to prepare CCRF-CEM CLENs. Phase I of evaluation included physiochemical characterization and cellular uptake studies of preparations of CLENs, including 0 to 40 mol% of CCRF-CEM LE content. Phase II of evaluation fixed the optimal LE content determined from the Phase I studies and varied the cholesterol (Chol) content (0 to 40 mol%). The control cell lines used in the study represent other hematological diseases, RPMI 8226 (multiple myeloma), K-562-GFP (chronic myeloid leukemia), and U937 (lymphoma). Conventional lipid ingredients used in preparing CCRF-CEM-CLENs include DOPC, Chol, and DPPE-rhodamine for fluorescence studies using a fluorescence microplate reader.<br \/>Results: The optimal composition (and ratio of components) for CCRF-CEM CLENs was DOPC\/Chol\/LE (85\/10\/5). Results support a significant uptake of preparation types consisting of 0% LE compared to 5% LE content (p=0.01). A similar effect was observed between 0% and 10% Chol content (p&#60;0.001). The steady inclusion of Chol (2, 5, 10%) increased the cellular uptake of CCRF-CEM CLENs by CCRF-CEM cells, above which the cellular uptake decreased. The average mean diameter for the optimized preparation type was 182 &#177; 44 nm (n=5). The average zeta potential was -9 &#177; 6 mV (n=5). Cell selectivity studies revealed an increase in the uptake of the optimized CCRF-CEM CLENs by CCRF-CEM cells when compared to U937 (p=0.002) and RPMI 8226 (p=0.002) control cells. No statistical significance was observed in uptake of the same preparations by CCRF-CEM, when compared to K-562-GFP cells (p=0.09).<br \/>Conclusion: ALL-CLENs has demonstrated promising preliminary results. Future studies will investigate mechanisms underlying formulation and cellular properties.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b9391800-7744-4a83-a04b-1f565d14bae1\/@y03B8ZAP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Drug delivery,Nanoparticle,Liposomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13809"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andre Yonan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Jacques<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thanaphorn Feinberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tafaswa Fletcher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Campbell<\/i><\/presenter>.

Multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are potential therapeutics targeting specific signaling pathways that contribute to cancer progression, including sarcomas. Osteosarcoma is the most common pediatric tumor with a worldwide incidence of 3.4 cases\/million annually but without effective treatment. Of the TKIs, Ponatinib demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity; however, it received an FDA black box warning for potential side effects. New treatment and delivery systems must be identified to use Ponatinib clinically. Our laboratory developed novel biomimetic nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized from activated leukocytes called Leukosomes. Leukosomes maintain leukocyte tropism towards inflamed endothelium and can encapsulate and effectively release Ponatinib. We aimed to validate Leukosome technology&#8217;s therapeutic potential to specifically target and inhibit primary murine osteosarcoma growth and reduce detrimental side effects. In a 3D sarcosphere model, we observed effective penetration and internalization of NPs in both murine (RF379, 577) and human patient derived xenograft (PDX94, PDX202) osteosarcoma cell lines. Leukosome exhibited 20% increased targeting versus control liposomes. Cell viability decreased 20% after treatment with Ponatinib IC50. Leukosome-Ponatinib IC50 also induced complete inhibition of murine sarcosphere formation and ~60-80% reduction of cell viability. We developed an osteosarcoma orthotopic mouse model by intratibial injection of murine F420 osteosarcoma cells. After 3 weeks, tumor was detected and the mice were injected with Ponatinib NPs. Leukosome showed increased tumor targeting and penetration 1 and 3 hours post-NP injection. Intravenous tail injection of Ponatinib was lethal due to drug-related toxic effects, while intraperitoneal injection of Ponatinib was well tolerated. Conversely, intravenous injection of Ponatinib-loaded NPs did not show toxic effects. In vivo efficacy studies demonstrated that 3 weeks of Ponatinib treatment (2 treatments\/week) inhibited tumor growth and increased survival. Similar results were also observed after Leukosome Ponatinib treatment, despite 10 times less Ponatinib in NPs than in free drug. Overall, these results show that leukocyte-derived membrane proteins enhance the accumulation of Ponatinib at the tumor site and surrounding inflamed tissue. While limited Ponatinib encapsulation in NPs remains an open challenge, this formulation underlies the possibility of reducing drug dosage and side effects. Thus, suggest Leukosome&#8217;s translational potential as a new targeted drug delivery approach with better outcomes and fewer complications for osteosarcoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c4041061-64ca-4d40-989a-d22d166698ae\/@y03B8ZAP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Osteosarcoma,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18148"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Federica Giordano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefania Lenna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riccardo Rampado<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gherardo Baudo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Massaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Rivera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enrica De Rosa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason T.
