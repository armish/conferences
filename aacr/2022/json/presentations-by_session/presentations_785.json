[{"Abstract":"Background: MET dysregulation is a poor prognostic factor in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping (<i>MET<\/i>ex14) mutations occur in ~3% of patients with NSCLC. There is limited evidence of the efficacy of standard therapies, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, in patients with <i>MET<\/i>ex14-mutated advanced NSCLC. Capmatinib, a MET inhibitor (METi), is approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic <i>MET<\/i>ex14-mutated NSCLC, based on the results of the phase 2 GEOMETRY mono-1 study. Results (data cutoff: September 18, 2020) of this study in patients with <i>MET<\/i>ex14-mutated NSCLC treated with capmatinib showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 66.7% in first line (N=60), 51.6% in second line (N=31) and 40.6% in second- or third-line (2\/3L; N=69). GeoMETry-III (NCT04427072) is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, global, phase 3 trial that is further evaluating the efficacy and safety of capmatinib vs docetaxel in the 2\/3L setting in patients with <i>MET<\/i>ex14-mutated NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: This study began enrollment in September 2020 and is currently recruiting adult patients with EGFR wild-type, <i>ALK<\/i>-negative, stage IIIB\/IIIC\/IV <i>MET<\/i>ex14-mutated NSCLC, who have progressed on 1 or 2 prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced\/metastatic disease and are candidates for single-agent docetaxel. Other eligibility criteria include &#8805;1 measurable lesion per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of &#8804;1 and no prior treatment with any METi or hepatocyte growth factor-targeting therapies. Patients with neurologically unstable, symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases or those requiring increasing doses of steroids &#8804;2 weeks prior to study entry to manage CNS symptoms are excluded. Around 90 patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive either oral capmatinib 400 mg twice daily or intravenous docetaxel 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> every 21 days. Randomization is stratified by number of prior lines (1 or 2) of systemic therapy. Patients meeting protocol-specified eligibility criteria can cross over from the docetaxel to the capmatinib arm after blinded independent review committee (BIRC)-confirmed progressive disease as per RECIST 1.1.The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) by BIRC per RECIST 1.1. The key secondary endpoint is ORR by BIRC per RECIST 1.1. Other secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed ORR and PFS; duration of response, time to response and disease control rate (DCR) by BIRC and investigator; overall survival; safety; pharmacokinetics; patient-reported outcomes; overall intracranial response rate, intracranial DCR, duration of- and time to- intracranial response by BIRC per the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases criteria in patients with baseline CNS lesions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c034bc3d-f5ea-4b2c-85e9-09dde9ced108\/@z03B8ZZ2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-03 Phase III clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Capmatinib,MET exon 14 skipping mutation,MET inhibitor ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20364"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pierre Jean Souquet<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang-We Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johan F.

Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 mAb, significantly improves OS versus chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the first-in-human study (NCT02964013), the combination of vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab had a manageable safety profile and showed promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC naive to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy; ORR was 31% and 25% in patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) &#8805;1% and less than 1%, respectively. The current phase 3 study (KeyVibe-003; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04738487) is comparing first-line treatment with MK-7684A, a co-formulation of vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab, versus pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with PD-L1-positive metastatic NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: This<b> <\/b>randomized, multicenter, double-blind study is enrolling adults with pathologically confirmed, previously untreated, metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS &#8805;1% (centrally confirmed). Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, an ECOG PS of 0-1, have no <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations or <i>ALK<\/i> or <i>ROS1<\/i> gene rearrangements, and have no active or untreated CNS metastases. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous treatment with vibostolimab 200 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W or pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) or until PD, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness, or investigator decision. Patients who stop treatment after a CR or after completing 35 cycles and subsequently have PD can receive up to 17 additional cycles (approximately 1 year) of their randomized therapy. Randomization is stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), PD-L1 TPS (1%-49% vs &#8805;50%), and region of enrollment (East Asia vs non-East Asia). The dual primary endpoints are PFS, per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR), and OS. Secondary endpoints include ORR and DOR per RECIST v1.1 by BICR, patient-reported outcomes, and safety. Radiographic imaging occurs at baseline, Q9W from randomization through week 54, and then Q12W until PD, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or death. Health-related quality of life is assessed using validated patient-reported outcome instruments including the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30. AEs are graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0.

TNBC and Germline BRCA (gBRCA) breast cancer share certain phenotypic and molecular similarities, with gBRCA mutations seen in 10% to 20% of TNBC patients. Homologous recombination deficient tumours, especially those caused by germline or somatic BRCA mutations, are thought to be particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.<br \/>Aim: To establish if the addition of Olaparib to neoadjuvant Platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of basal TNBC and\/or gBRCA breast cancer is safe and increases efficacy.<br \/>Trial design: 3-stage open label randomised phase II\/III trial of neoadjuvant Paclitaxel and Carboplatin +\/- Olaparib, followed by clinicians' choice of Anthracycline regimen. Stages 1 and 2: Randomisation (1:1:1) to control (3-weekly carboplatin AUC5\/weekly with paclitaxel 80mg\/m2 for 4 cycles), or to one of two research arms. These use an identical chemotherapy regimen and also include different treatment schedules of Olaparib 150mg BD for 12 days. Stage 3: Randomisation (1:1) to either the control or research arm chosen following stage 2. End-points: Stage 1: Safety; Stage 2: Schedule selection based on pCR rate and Olaparib completion rate using a &#8220;pick-the-winner&#8221; design. Stage 3: pCR rate. This trial includes an optional pathway (PARTNERING) for patients with evidence of residual disease after six chemotherapy cycles. This aims to establish if the addition of new agents (ATR inhibitor and PD-L1 inhibitor) improves treatment response.<br \/>Eligibility criteria: Aged 16-70; histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer; ER-negative, HER2-negative with TNBC basal phenotype or gBRCA positive, HER2-negative irrespective of hormone status; stage T1-4 N0-2; performance status 0-1; treatment within 6 weeks of diagnostic biopsy; biomarker scores: TILs, CK 5\/6, EGFR +\/- AR.<br \/>Statistical methods: The recruitment of TNBC non-gBRCA and gBRCA patients is independent. Enrichment design is applied with an overall significance level 0.05(&#945;) and 80% power. A minimum of 780 patients will be included to detect an absolute improvement of 15% (all patients and TNBC non-gBRCA cohort) and 20% (gBRCA patients) by combining Olaparib with Platinum based chemotherapy. A minimum of 478 TNBC non-gBRCA and 188 gBRCA patients will be recruited. Each PARTNERING cohort will consist of 15 patients.<br \/>Current Enrollment: Since May 2016, 756 patients from 30 sites have been enrolled. Stages 1 and 2 are completed. An IDSMC review identified no safety concerns and Research Arm 2 was selected. This arm involves Olaparib administration on days 3-14. Stage 3 Phase I (recruitment of non-gBRCA and gBRCA patients) completed in December 2021. Stage 3 Phase II (recruitment of gBRCA patients only) remains open to patients to UK and internationally. 5 patients have been enrolled in PARTNERING.<br \/>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03150576","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30246459-2b85-42f6-b993-dadc7bf47470\/@z03B8ZZ2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-03 Phase III clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),PARP inhibitors,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20368"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"dfe5c534-ad79-4693-a39c-24729bf5ef84","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dfe5c534-ad79-4693-a39c-24729bf5ef84\/@z03B8ZZ2\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lynsey Drewett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen A.

Pembrolizumab has shown clinical activity across many stages of bladder cancer, and ongoing phase 2 studies (ANZUP 1502, NCT02662062; NCT02621151) of pembrolizumab + CRT are promising. The global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 KEYNOTE-992 study (NCT04241185) will be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab + CRT in patients with previously untreated MIBC who opt for bladder preservation.<br \/>Methods: Key patient eligibility criteria are age &#8805;18 years, histologically confirmed cT2-T4a, nonmetastatic MIBC, and decision to pursue bladder-preserving therapy. Approximately 636 patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive CRT + either pembrolizumab 400 mg or placebo. Pembrolizumab or placebo will be administered intravenously (IV) every 6 weeks for up to 9 doses. Patients will be stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score (0 or 1 vs 2), PD-L1 combined positive score (&#60;10 vs &#8805;10), T stage (T2 vs T3 or T4), and geographic region (US vs Europe vs rest of world). CRT regimen must be determined before randomization. The following radiotherapy (RT) regimens are permitted: conventional RT consisting of 64 Gy at 2 Gy\/fraction over 6.5 weeks (whole bladder with or without pelvic nodes) or hypofractionated RT consisting of 55 Gy at 2.75 Gy\/fraction over 4 weeks (whole bladder only). The following radiosensitizing chemotherapy regimens are permitted: cisplatin monotherapy (35 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV weekly), 5-fluorouracil (500 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on days 1-5 and days 22-26) + mitomycin C (12 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on day 1), and gemcitabine monotherapy (27 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV twice weekly). Efficacy will be assessed by cystoscopy (&#177; biopsy), by CT or MRI with blinded independent central review, and by urine cytology at 10 weeks after CRT, then every 12 weeks until the end of year 2, and every 24 weeks thereafter. The primary end point is bladder-intact event-free survival, defined as time from randomization to residual\/recurrent MIBC, nodal or distant metastases, radical cystectomy, or death from any cause. The key secondary end point is overall survival. Additional secondary end points are metastasis-free survival, time to any non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, time to cystectomy, and safety. The study is enrolling at sites in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4b65b64b-5f58-4f3e-9a94-145b335f5770\/@z03B8ZZ2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-03 Phase III clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,PD-1,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21051"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Neal D.
