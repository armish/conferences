The impact of drugging all KRAS mutants will be substantial. Based on a recent analysis (Hofmann et al., Cancer Discovery 2022), drugging all KRAS mutants has the potential to almost double the patient population eligible for precision oncology approaches.Conceptually, there are two classes of KRAS medicines: selective drugs which target one specific mutant allele while sparing wild-type KRAS and pan-drugs which target a spectrum of alterations. These first inhibitors (sotorasib and adagrasib) are selective KRAS drugs which target the KRASG12C mutant and have clinically validated KRAS as a cancer drug for KRASG12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The success of addressing a previously elusive KRAS allele has fueled drug discovery efforts for all KRAS mutants. Of particular interest is the targeting of KRASG12D, the most prevalent KRAS alteration, occuring in 26% of KRAS cancers. KRASG12D does not offer medicinal chemists the druggability advantage of a nucleophilic cysteine at the rim of the switch II pocket to which inhibitors can covalently and irreversibly bind, but rather contains the non-nucleophilic aspartic acid residue, resulting in a significantly greater druggability challenge. Despite this higher hurdle the first clinical candidate (MRTX1133) and advanced lead compounds have been described.The complementary positioning of recently described therapeutic approaches selectively or broadly addressing KRAS mutants will be highlighted. Given that pan-KRAS concepts will address extensive unmet needs, a significant focus in the field now also lies on therapeutics with a broad KRAS mutant coverage. We have previously disclosed that pan-KRAS inhibitors can potently inhibit cancer cells driven by amplification of the KRAS gene. Amplification of the KRAS wild-type gene is the fourth most prevalent KRAS alteration in cancer, accounting for around 7% of KRAS cancers. Pre-clinical efficacy data, both in vitro and in vivo, in KRAS wild-type amplified gastroesophageal cancers will be summarized.Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are an exciting new class of drug molecules which degrade, rather than inhibit, their targets. PROTACs are bifunctional small molecules consisting of target and E3 ligase binding portions linked together which induce a target-PROTAC-ligase ternary complex, directing the ubiquitin proteasome system to degrade the target protein. In contrast to classical small molecule drugs, PROTAC-driven degradation not only removes the entire protein but also functions in a sub-stoichiometric nature. The talk will summarize our discovery of pan-KRAS(off) PROTACs, which potently degrade the majority of major KRAS mutants.Based on the recent progress the field has made in drugging KRAS and in starting to understand mechanisms of aquired resisistance, we can be optimistic that it will be possible in the long-term to complete this task and put an end to KRAS cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Norbert Kraut<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
