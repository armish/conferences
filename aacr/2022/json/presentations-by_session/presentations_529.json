[{"Abstract":"Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world, of which about 80% are esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). Mutation or amplification of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> frequently occurs in ESCC patients, indicating PI3K&#945; is a promising target for ESCC treatment. CYH33 is a novel PI3K&#945;-selective inhibitor, which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors including advanced ESCC. PI3K&#945; inhibitors including CYH33 and the marketed alpelisib displayed highly variable activity against the proliferation of a panel of ESCC cells, reflecting the heterogeneity of ESCC. We sought to discover predictive biomarkers for the efficacy of PI3K&#945; inhibitors in ESCC by evaluating its activity to against the growth of a panel of 16 clinically relevant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We found that PDXs<i> <\/i>with<i> CCND1<\/i> amplification were more sensitive to CYH33, which was consistent with the positive correlation between CYH33 activity and CyclinD1 expression in PDXs detected by tissue microarray. As Cyclin D1 plays a critical role in G1\/S transition in cell cycle progression, proteins regulating G1 phase were profiled in ESCC cells. Elevated expression of Cyclin D1, p21 and Rb was found in CYH33-sensitive cells compared to those in resistant cells, indicating intact G1\/S regulation in sensitive cells. Accordingly, CYH33 significantly arrested sensitive cells at G1 phase, while it had little effect in resistant cells. The cellular level of p21 as well as p21 bound to the CDK4\/6-Cyclin D1 or CDK2-Cyclin E complex increased upon CYH33 treatment in sensitive cells, which was accompanied with decreased phosphorylation of Rb. Though CYH33 had little effect on the mRNA level of p21, its treatment prolonged the half-life of p21 protein in sensitive cells. CYH33 was found to impede the interaction between the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2 and p21 in sensitive cells, resulting in decreased ubiquitination of p21. However, CYH33 failed to stabilize and accumulate p21 in resistant cells. In conclusion, we found that ESCC cells with intact G1 phase regulation were more sensitive to CYH33. CYH33 arrested sensitive ESCC cells at G1 phase via inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation of p21 by SKP2, which further resulted in decreased activity of CDK4\/6 and CDK2 as well as Rb phosphorylation. These findings revealed the insight mechanism of the differential activity CYH33 against ESCC and provided potential candidate biomarkers for the treatment of ESCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a877166d-b7e0-47c5-98fe-aed1f078cfc5\/@B03B8ZR9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Cell cycle mechanisms of anticancer drug action,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,CYH33,CCND1,p21,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17624"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yuxiang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Xu Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanyan Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingyang Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuemei Qiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Biyu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lan Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaoxiang Ge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Landian Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangyin Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunhao Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linghua Meng<\/i><\/presenter>.

First, we indicated the cytotoxic effect was induced by AF in human CRC (HT29) cells. The suppression of metastasis ability including migration and invasion were found to be suppressed by AF treatment group using transwell assay. Also, in colony formation assay, AF inhibited the proliferation of CRC cells. The tumor suppressor gene p53 was upregulating with AF treatment, and the cell cycle related protein, such as CyclinD1 and CDK4 were all downregulated by AF which identified by Western blotting assay. Additionally, AF induced apoptosis in CRC cells were detected by Western blotting and flow cytometry with cleaved caspase-3, -8, -9 and Annexin V\/PI assay. Moreover, Western blotting results indicated that DNA damage proteins (cleaved PARP-1 and ATM) were upregulated by AF. The nucleus translocation of caspase-dependent mitochondria initiated apoptotic protein (EndoG and AIF) were induced by AF in CRC cells. In animal experiments, the CRC tumors volume were effectively reduced in AF treatment groups as compared to non-treated control.

Internalization of HER2-T-DXd followed by DXd release is a crucial process for T-DXd to exert its antitumor activity. T-DXd induced robust and durable responses in HER2 mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in DESTINY-Lung01 study, including those with low HER2 expression levels (Li BT, <i>et al.<\/i> NEJM 2021). One hypothesis of this T-DXd sensitivity of HER2 mutant NSCLC cells involves the potential of enhanced receptor and ADC internalization in these cells (Li BT, <i>et al.<\/i> Cancer Discov 2020). To examine this possibility further, we investigated the effect of HER2 mutations on T-DXd internalization and DXd release in transgenic cells expressing various HER2 mutants, as well as on T-DXd sensitivity <i>in vivo. <\/i><br \/>Methods: We established transgenic NCI-H322 cells expressing wild-type (WT) HER2 or various HER2 mutants and evaluated T-DXd internalization in these cells. Antitumor activity of T-DXd was examined in xenograft mouse models of transgenic NCI-H322 cells and compared between WT and each mutant. DXd concentration in tumor was also determined. In addition, <i>in vitro<\/i> internalization activity and antitumor activity of T-DXd were evaluated using NCI-H1781, the NSCLC cell line harboring an endogenous HER2 mutation (G776delinsVC).<br \/>Results: Transgenic NSCLC cells expressing various HER2 mutants showed higher T-DXd internalization than WT HER2 expressing cells. There also was a negative correlation between the surface HER2 expression level and T-DXd internalization among various mutants and WT expressing cells. In xenograft models with transgenic cells, some HER2 mutant models showed higher response to T-DXd than WT HER2 model, with greater than 2-fold increase in G660D, YVMA, G776delinsVC, V777_G778insGSP, and V842I. Tumor DXd concentration was positively correlated with the antitumor activity. In an endogenous HER2 mutant NSCLC cell line (NCI-H1781), T-DXd also showed high internalization activity and potent antitumor activity.<br \/>Conclusion: <i>In vitro<\/i> study with transgenic NSCLC cells suggested that T-DXd internalization in HER2 mutant tumors was more efficient than in WT HER2 tumor. Some of those HER2 mutant cell lines showed increased T-DXd sensitivity and higher payload release in the tumor <i>in vivo<\/i>, suggesting the enhanced internalization played a role in the mechanism of T-DXd sensitivity in these HER2 mutant transgenic NSCLC cells. Some mutants may be more or less clinically relevant. However, the relationship between the <i>in vitro<\/i> internalization efficiency and <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity in each mutant was not consistent among different mutants, thus these results need to be interpreted cautiously.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/020f5193-7ce0-42fe-a19f-786b091a9d99\/@B03B8ZR9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),HER2,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17627"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Atsushi Yamasaki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Misa Ikuta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manabu Abe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tsuneo Deguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuki Kamai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenji Nakamaru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshinori Agatsuma<\/i><\/presenter>.

The anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (<i>BCL-2<\/i>) gene is commonly dysregulated in DLBCL due to various mechanisms such as chromosomal translocation t(14;18)(q32.3;q21.3), copy number alterations and gene amplifications; however, targeting BCL-2 with a selective inhibitor, venetoclax, led to response in only a minority of patients. Thus, we sought to identify a novel combination partner for venetoclax to improve response to therapy. Previously with dynamic BH3 profiling, we found that DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA) could increase BCL2 dependence in DLBCL cells. Here, we investigate the activity of the HMA decitabine with venetoclax in DLBCL.<br \/>Methods: We utilized BH3 profiling, a functional assay to assess the mitochondrial priming of cells for apoptosis and the dependence of cells on various anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Other standard techniques included Western blot, cell cycle (BrdU\/7-AAD), CellTiter-Glo, and Seahorse XF cell mito stress test. The DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, HBL1, OCI-Ly3, OCI-Ly1, Karpas 422, SUDHL4, Toledo, OCI-Ly7) and double hit lymphoma (DHL) patient-derived xenograft cell lines were used to investigate the <i>in vitro <\/i>anti-cancer activity of decitabine and venetoclax.<br \/>Results: Through BH3 profiling, we found heterogenous dependence of DLBCL, consistent with the variable expression of multiple anti-apoptotic proteins in DLBCL assessed by Western blot. DLBCL cells were less sensitive to single BH3 mimetic treatment (venetoclax, S63 (MCL-1i) and A133 (BCL-xLi)). Using dynamic BH3 profiling (which assesses the change in priming induced by <i>ex vivo<\/i> drug treatment), we found that decitabine primes DLBCL cells for apoptosis and increases BCL-2 dependence. Consequently, decitabine increases the sensitivity of DLBCL cells to venetoclax, as the combination of decitabine and venetoclax synergistically induces apoptosis and suppresses cell proliferation. Decitabine has previously been shown to increase TGF-&#946; signaling in DLBCL by restoring the expression of a downstream target, SMAD1. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of TGF-&#946; signaling only partially antagonizes the anti-cancer activity of decitabine, implicating other anti-cancer mechanisms of decitabine. Indeed, we found that decitabine also induces DNA damage and leads to cell cycle arrest in DLBCL cells. Furthermore, decitabine promotes activation of the key apoptotic effector proteins, BAK and BAX. Additionally, we found that this combination also suppresses oxidative phosphorylation, thus restricting the energy supply for DLBCL cells.<br \/>Conclusions: The HMA decitabine sensitizes DLBCL cells to venetoclax <i>in vitro <\/i>through increasing apoptotic priming and BCL-2 dependence. This combination is worthy of further study in <i>in vivo<\/i> model systems.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b7094711-e062-45a9-a382-37059abffb7f\/@B03B8ZR9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Decitabine,Venetoclax,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17628"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Matthew S.

Specifically, both MAPK and PI3K pathways are implicated in resistance to standard of care (SOC) CDK4\/6 inhibitors in hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC). RSK2 is expressed in 80% of HR+ BC, therefore we hypothesized that disrupting these critical pathways with PMD-026 could overcome resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibitors through cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and downstream target inhibition alone and in combination with SOC SERD fulvestrant. In preclinical studies and a Phase I\/Ib clinical trial in metastatic BC, PMD-026 demonstrated a good safety profile, making it an ideal candidate for the CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistant HR+ BC population. Here in we demonstrate that PMD-026 inhibits growth of HR+ BC cell lines MCF-7 and T47D <i>in vitro<\/i> at IC50 values ranging from 3.7 to 10.1 &#181;M, resulting in dephosphorylation of the RSK downstream effector YB-1 and induction of apoptosis through PARP cleavage. Comparatively, the MAPK pathway remains active in the presence of fulvestrant, as indicated by the expression of pYB-1. We determined that PMD-026 synergizes with fulvestrant in the MCF-7 model <i>in vitro<\/i> with a combined drug index (CDI) of 0.73 to 0.92. The next step was to determine if this combination is effective in cells resistant to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. For that purpose, MCF-7 and T47D cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib (Ibrance) up to 2 &#181;M for several months. The generated Ibrance resistant cell lines (MCF-7-IBR, T47D-IBR) are insensitive to Ibrance up to 2 &#181;M, but their parental counterparts have IC50 values ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 &#181;M. In addition, cross-resistance to an additional CDK4\/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib (Verzenio), was observed in the resistant cell lines, but the parental lines remained sensitive at IC50 values ranging from 0.15 to 0.25 &#181;M. Most importantly, both parental and resistant cell lines remained sensitive to PMD-026 at similar IC50 values, indicating that CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistance does not affect PMD-026 sensitivity. PMD-026 was then tested in combination with fulvestrant in anchorage independent conditions in the MCF-7-IBR cells. It was determined that this combination was highly synergistic with CDI ranging from 0.55 to 0.79. Together, these data support the application of PMD-026 and fulvestrant as a novel method to stop the growth of HR+ BC with acquired resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. Additionally, given that the MAPK pathway is upregulated in response to PI3K inhibition, the PMD-026 and fulvestrant combination is a potential alternative treatment for HR+ BC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e8c0679-d942-4c04-8ede-b409b2e459a2\/@B03B8ZR9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Drug resistance,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17629"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aarthi Jayanthan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lambert Yue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>My-my Huynh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerrit Los<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra E.

While compounds that target the cyclin-associated kinases are approved for clinical use, attempts to target the protein-protein interactions between cyclins and their substrates, such as E2F, have so far been unsuccessful. Using structure-guided design we have developed cell-permeable macrocycle compounds that selectively inhibit the RxL-mediated binding of substrates to Cyclin A.<br \/>We used NCI-H1048, an Rb-\/- SCLC cell line, to study the effects of these Cyclin A targeting macrocyclic compounds on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. Proliferation of H1048 cells was inhibited ~90% at 100nM of compound A whereas no inhibition was observed at up to 10 uM in WI-38 cells, a human non tumor lung fibroblast cell line, or with an inactive isomer of compound A in NCI-H1048 cells. Cyclin A inhibition in H1048 cells resulted in accumulation of cells at G2\/M, an increased proportion of cells with 4C DNA content by FACS, hyperphosphorylation of RPA and upregulation of both phosphorylated histone H3 (pHH3) and phosphorylated FOXM1 (pFOXM1). Substantial apoptosis (10 to 20-fold) measured using caspase 3\/7 activity was induced after just 4 hours incubation of H1048 cells with Cyclin A inhibitors. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies in a murine H1048 xenograft model showed reduction in tumor growth. We analyzed sensitivity to these compounds in tumor cell lines representing multiple indications and observed inhibition of cell proliferation at 1 uM or below in 6 out of 10 SCLC cell lines, where all of the responding cell lines were Rb dysfunctional. Sensitivity to these compounds in a larger panel of SCLC and other cancer cell lines is currently under investigation to further evaluate the broader utility of cyclin inhibition.<br \/>Macrocycle inhibitors that inhibit Cyclin A RxL-mediated substrate binding have demonstrated G2\/M accumulation and apoptosis in Rb -\/- SCLC <i>in vitro<\/i><i> <\/i>consistent with synthetic lethality, and anti-proliferative effects <i>in vitro<\/i> and<i> in vivo<\/i>. Inhibiting cyclins is mechanistically distinct from strategies that inhibit cell cycle kinases, and is expected to be clinically useful, hence the compound series is being optimized for clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/284c14af-2d15-425e-9e7e-02e216cc9577\/@C03B8ZRa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Cell cycle mechanisms of anticancer drug action,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle inhibitors,Cyclin,Antitumor activity,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18563"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pablo D.

The diverse clinical and molecular characteristics drives high level of heterogeneity in breast cancer. Overall change in the epigenome triggers oncogenic activity of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) causing changes in gene expression that leads to cancer progression. EZH2 is the catalytic member of the Polycomb group protein complex that provides the active site for covalent methylation reactions. High expression of EZH2 is strongly associated with aggressive TNBC phenotypes, compared to other non-TNBCs. Development of resistance to EZH2 inhibitors limit their therapeutic use. Studies have shown that dopamine receptor (DR) agonists and antagonists alter TNBC cell growth in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Our objective was to investigate if a combination of a D1R agonist with an EZH2 inhibitor was effective to attenuate TNBC cell proliferation. Docking studies were performed using Schrodinger software and visualization software to determine the affinity of GSK126 and SKF38393 towards EZH2. TNBC cells were treated individually and combined with EZH2 inhibitor, GSK126, and D1 agonist SKF38393 for cell viability and immunoprecipitation. Insilco analysis using docking studies revealed that SKF38393 actively interacts in the same region where GSK126 binds to EZH2 i.e. the catalytic site. Combination treatment of TNBC cells with GSK126 and SKF38393 caused synergistic inhibition of cell viability, suppressed the H3K27 trimethylation activity, and inhibited invasion of TNBC cells. Immunoprecipitation of EZH2 in the presence of GSK126 and SKF38393 dissociated the association between EZH2, EED, and SUZ12 in MDA-MB-231 cells. We report that combination of GSK126 and SKF38393 may have an enhanced efficacy in inhibiting the catalytic function of EZH2. The combined treatment of TNBC cells with GSK126 and SKF38393 inhibit TNBC proliferation by disrupting EZH2 functions.

In some cases, devices have been developed that mimic the electromagnetic fields (EMF) that are emitted from people delivering biofield therapies. However, it is not clear if EMFs are the mechanism of action. We previously reported that biofield therapy significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells in vitro and their relevant animal model mediated through inflammatory and immune pathways. We expanded this research to examine the effects of human biofield therapy on the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and explored relevant mechanisms. Cell viability of human pancreatic cancer Panc-1 and mouse pancreatic cancer Panc02 cells was measured by PrestoBlue assay. Cell cycle was measured by PI staining and cell voltage potentials were assessed using DiBAC4 staining. It is well-established that cancer cells have distinct bioelectrical properties and most have depolarized cell voltage potentials that support cell proliferation. Expression of cell signaling proteins was determined by Western blot. We found that Panc-1 and Panc02 cells exposed to biofield treatment for 15 and 30 mins, respectively, resulted in significantly lower viability compared to that of sham control. These experiments were replicated 12 times for Panc-1 cells and 6 times for Panc02 cells. We further observed that the experimental exposure significantly increased G1 phase population of Panc-1 cells (sham control=43.7% (0.8) vs treatment=55.0% (0.8%), p&#60;0.001). In contrast, Panc02 cells exposed to biofield therapy had significantly higher population of G2\/M cells than that of sham control group (sham control=22.5% (0.5) vs treatment=27.7% (1.1), p&#60;0.001). We found that biofield therapy resulted in a 36.7% reduction in cell voltage potentials as measured by the intensity of DiBAC4 staining in Panc-1 cells compared to that of sham controls (p&#60;0.01). Finally, the treatment down-regulated pAkt expression and the pAkt\/Akt ratio by 45.3% and 43.8%, respectively, in Panc-1 cells in comparison with the sham control group. The effect of biofield therapy on cell signaling proteins measured by Reverse Phase Proteomic Array in Panc-1 cells and the growth of human Panc-1 mouse orthotopic model is ongoing and the results will be presented at the meeting. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to biofield therapy results in reduced growth of pancreatic cancer cells which might be in part mediated through modification of the cell cycle - differentially for different cell types, reductions in cell voltage potentials suggesting hyperpolarization of cells, and down regulation of PI3K\/Akt pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2b3f3b00-5170-44f2-9fb6-efad4fc61d0a\/@C03B8ZRa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Biofield therapy,Cell cycle,Cell voltage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18566"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peiying Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharmistha Chakraborty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phuong Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meng Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Cusimano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daoyan Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Prinsloo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorenzo Cohen<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the outcome is highly contextual and personalized with consistently low response rates. Understanding the mechanistic barriers at single cell levels is key for novel candidate selection. Here we describe Dexter<sup>TM<\/sup> microfluidic platform that can create highly parallel nanobioreactors on a chip to study cellular functions and interactions at the single cell level. Using microliter volumes of live tumor and human PBMC, we showed modulation of dynamic tumor-immune crosstalk at single cell level.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The Dexter<sup>TM<\/sup> microfluidic platform was used for functional characterization at single cell resolution. The platform integrates an array of nanoliter sized droplets with cell encapsulation, multicolor fluorescence imaging and selective cell retrieval. PBMC, RBC and cancer cells were fluorescently (CFSE, PKH) labelled and used to interrogate effector cell functions following exposure to immune modulating milieu in nanoliter droplets. CD8+T cells were activated and labelled. Individual and clustered tumor cells were challenged with stimulated PBMC. Finally, using bioinformatic tools, we construct a Tumor immune Interactive Network (TiIN) and simulate perturbation.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our data confirmed preservation of surface markers, T cells and tumor-immune specific intracellular and surface events including cell-cell contacts at the level observed before their encapsulation in microfluidic droplets. Both size and intensity of the signals were maintained without significant loss. Platform displayed critical events like antigen presentation, tumor-probiotic interface, T cell engagement with microbeads similar to APC dimensionalities and function. Both spiked tumor and immune cells showed high degree of recovery. Spatially resolved dynamic profiling in this platform further revealed immune phenotypic plasticity and vulnerabilities of tumor cells upon exposure to immune checkpoint agents. Finally, we, measured the killing of tumor cells by using different effector : target ratio that complement hot and cold niche. We observed differential killing of target when T cells were primed using immunomodulators.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data highlights the versatility of Dexter<sup>TM<\/sup> platform in deciphering mechanistically critical tumor-immune interactions while parallelly resolving single cell events. This offers suitable means of profiling response to novel immunooncology candidates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5765f90-687d-4e51-b49f-475b93a9dd53\/@C03B8ZRa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,T cell,Immune checkpoint,Microfluidics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18567"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ashwin Lal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ranjeet Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhay Sane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rushil Manglik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi R.

New, more efficient treatment strategies are still in urgent demand. Shikonin (SHI) from Traditional Chinese Medicine has exhibited anti-tumor properties in several tumor entities. Thus, in the current investigation we evaluated the impact of SHI on progressive growth and metastatic behavior, not only in therapy-sensitive (parental) but also in therapy-resistant RCC cells. Parental and sunitinib-resistant RCC cells, Caki-1, 786-O, KTCTL-26, and A498, were treated with SHI. Tumor cell growth, proliferation, clonogenic capacity, cell cycle phase distribution, induction of cell death (apoptosis and necroptosis) and the expression and activity of regulating and signaling proteins were evaluated. Moreover, the adhesion and chemotactic activity of the RCC cells after exposure to SHI were investigated. SHI did not affect cell motility but led to significant inhibition of progressive tumor cell growth in both therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant RCC cells. Thereby, SHI significantly inhibited the growth, proliferation and clone formation in parental and sunitinib-resistant RCC cells by G2\/M phase arrest through down-regulation of cell cycle activating proteins, blocking cell division. Furthermore, SHI induced apoptosis and necroptosis by activating necrosome complex proteins. Concomitantly, SHI impaired the Akt\/mTOR pathway, pivotal for cell survival and growth. Thus, SHI may hold promise as an additive option in treating patients with advanced and therapy-resistant RCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a467286-c1b5-43a2-8bfd-c954168a3c37\/@C03B8ZRa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Therapy resistance,Growth inhibition,Natural products,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18568"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eva Juengel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sascha D.

Although the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody treatment has resulted in outstanding responses in patients with multiple myeloma, a significant portion of patients still failed to respond and nearly all patients eventually relapsed. The mechanism of resistance has been partially associated with downregulation of CD38 expression. In addition, CD38 is broadly expressed on normal lymphoid, myeloid, as well as red blood cells (RBCs). To effectively target CD38 on tumor cells, we hypothesize that a bispecific antibody against a tumor associated guide antigen (TAG) and CD38 could achieve tumor specificity and improve potency. ICAM-1, an Ig-like cell adhesion molecule, is highly expressed in multiple myeloma, lymphoma and a subset of solid tumors. Antibody against ICAM-1, bersanlimab (BI505, BioInvent), was well-tolerated, but only showed limited clinical efficacy in MM patients. We generated bispecific CD38 x ICAM-1 antibodies with different formats and geometries and compared their <i>in-vitro<\/i> activities on ICAM1<sup>high<\/sup> tumor cells with low to medium CD38 expression. Our results showed that the asymmetric 1+1 format has potent ADCC and ADCP activities on ICAM-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD38<sup>medium<\/sup> or ICAM-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD38<sup>low<\/sup> cells. Fc modifications further improved ADCC activities of the bispecific antibody. To further understand the impact of antigen densities, we tested ADCC activities on a selected set of myeloma and lymphoma cell lines with a range of CD38 and ICAM-1 expressions. We observed superior ADCC activity on cells with extremely low CD38 expression. Moreover, we showed that the bispecific antibody reduced NK fratricide and RBC binding comparing to the bivalent CD38 antibody. Most importantly, the CD38 x ICAM1 bispecific antibody demonstrated potent tumor inhibition activities in <i>in-vivo<\/i> myeloma and lymphoma models. These studies suggested that CD38 x ICAM-1 bispecific antibody has multiple modes of action for treating lymphoma and multiple myeloma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8794bf59-3844-44e4-8c00-463d34a92764\/@C03B8ZRa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD38,Bispecific antibody,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18569"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaocheng Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oi Kwan Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leonard Post<\/i><\/presenter>.

Wild-type p53 (WTp53) may be activated in the presence of either DNA damage or ROS. Upon activation, WTp53 may upregulate the transcription of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members capable of triggering mitochondrial membrane permeabilization or lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP), ultimately resulting in apoptosis. We have previously reported of DOX-induced LMP between WTp53 and mutant p53 (MUTp53) breast cancer cells. The goals of this study were to establish (1) the role of p53 in the initiation of DOX-mediated LMP and (2) whether p53 is critical to the onset of cytotoxicity.<br \/>Methods: Studies were conducted using DOX at a range of concentrations and durations in both WTp53 (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-361) and MUTp53 (MDA-MB-231 and T47D) breast cancer cells. LMP was demonstrated using fluorescence microscopy as the cytosolic release of a 10 kDa AlexaFluor-488 Dextran conjugate that was preloaded into lysosomes. Viability was determined by MTT. Cytotoxicity was determined by trypan blue. Experiments were conducted in the presence of pifithrin-&#945; p53 inhibitor to establish the importance of p53 towards DOX cytotoxicity.<br \/>Results: Significant LMP was determined as early as 0.5 h in both of the WTp53 cell lines at 10 &#956;M. MDA-MB-361 cells demonstrated a greater degree of LMP with 1 &#956;M DOX showing significant LMP by 2 h, an effect that was not observed in MCF-7 cells until 6 h. The earliest onset of notable LMP in MUTp53 MDA-MB-231 cells occurred at 6 h with 10 &#956;M DOX only. T47D cells did not demonstrate notable LMP at this time. By 24 h, both WTp53 cell lines demonstrated LMP across all of the tested concentrations of DOX, while both MUTp53 cell lines only demonstrated notable LMP for 10 &#956;M DOX. At this same time, notable reductions in cell viability for the tested range of concentrations were observed for all cell lines except for T47D cells. Overall, the inhibition of p53 reversed notable LMP in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-361 cells across all of the tested conditions. Similarly, reduced viability was reversed following the inhibition of p53.<br \/>Conclusions: These results indicate a role of p53 in LMP in WTp53 cells. Furthermore, the combination of p53 and LMP seem necessary for the induction of cytotoxicity in WTp53 cells. Under circumstances of MUTp53 expression, cells promote a pro-oncogenic response with a lesser potential for LMP, MMP, and cytotoxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82c0247e-5666-47d0-a1d4-dbbf70c36246\/@C03B8ZRa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Doxorubicin,Lysosome,p53,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18571"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachel Nicoletto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clyde M.

In particular, mutations in PIK3CA and ESR1 are common in advanced settings and can potentially drive resistance to aromatase inhibitors, including when combined with CDK4\/6 inhibitors. With the goal of improving patient outcomes, next-generation endocrine agents and PIK3a-specific inhibitors are being developed and are in active clinical studies. Importantly however, the molecular underpinnings of how such agents combine with one another, and with CDK4\/6 inhibitors, have not yet been fully explored.<br \/>Here we profiled the latest generation molecules, inavolisib (GDC-0077), a PIK3a-specific inhibitor, and giredestrant (GDC-9545), a full estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist and selective ER degrader, in combination with palbociclib, a CDK4\/6 inhibitor. Specifically, we evaluated the transcriptional and phenotypic effects of these molecules on PIK3CA mutant MCF7 cells expressing either ESR1 wild-type (WT) or ESR1-Y537S. Cells were treated with single-, double-, or triple-agent inavolisib, giredestrant, and palbociclib and were harvested at 24 and 96 hours for transcriptional profiling by both bulk and multiplexed scRNA-sequencing, or assayed for viability.<br \/>In both WT and mutant (MUT) cells, expression of cell cycle-related genes was reduced at 24h upon treatment with single-agent palbociclib, but rebounded to baseline by 96h. Combination with giredestrant induced the expected downregulation of ER activity at both 24 and 96h. Notably, the combination further reduced the expression of cell cycle-related genes compared to palbociclib alone. Surprisingly, the repression of cell cycle-associated genes driven by the combination of giredestrant and palbociclib was sustained through 96h in WT cells but not in MUT cells, despite sustained repression of ER activity. Addition of PIK3a-inhibitor inavolisib to the palbociclib\/giredestrant combination further reduced expression of cell cycle-related genes in both WT and MUT cells to an extent not achieved by any other treatment variation in this study. Most importantly, the triple-combination also prevented the rebound of cell cycle genes in the ESR1-MUT, consistent with a sustained response. Analysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed a substantial heterogeneity in the vehicle-treated population. While giredestrant treatment results in a particularly profound impact on transcriptional programs, heterogeneity is maintained. Together, our data provide mechanistic support for ongoing triple-combination studies in HR+ breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fde4d790-8665-441b-b894-05d13c4cfacc\/@C03B8ZRa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hormone-related cancer,SERD,Palbociclib,Expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18572"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Taylor Marohl<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenille Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jane Guan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Melo Carlos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiqi Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Hafner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ciara Metcalfe<\/i><\/presenter>.

Additionally, several equally prevalent hallmarks have been identified in recent analyses of cellular phenotypes as the stress phenotypes of cancers. A novel hallmark of cancer RNA deregulation has been newly proposed as another hallmark of cancer within this group of stress phenotypes. However, the development of cancer therapies targeting RNA deregulation has only just begun. Indeed, small molecules that attack the RNA maturation processes and produce aberrant RNA are currently under development. We developed orally available, selective, and a first-in-class pan- CDC-like kinase (CLK) inhibitor, CTX-712, currently in phase 1 clinical trials for advanced, relapsed or refractory malignant cancers. CTX-712 dephosphorylates serine and arginine-rich proteins and induces primarily skipped exon type of splicing changes, resulting in the generation of RNA deregulation stress. In multiple preclinical models, excessive RNA deregulation stress caused cancer cell death and tumor growth inhibition. To explore the patient selection biomarkers for CTX-712, in vivo efficacy survey analysis has been conducted on breast, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric and lung cancer models from patient derived xenograft (PDX) library with a detailed clinical information. Besides the efficacy investigation, the preclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis on tested PDX models were also performed to confirm plasma\/tumor PK and PD (target CLK inhibition in xenografted tumors). Importantly, tested PDX models could be divided to sensitive (T\/C on the most sensitive model = -71.1) and insensitive (T\/C on the least sensitive model = 67.7), and the correlated tendency was observed between the efficacy and the inhibition magnitude of intratumor PD marker, production of exon skipped aberrant mRNA. To clarify the differences of sensitivity among tested PDXs will lead us to identity patient selection biomarkers of CTX-712. Therefore, whole transcriptome RNA sequencing, exome sequencing, and other approaches have been applied to reveal the differences of sensitivity among tested PDXs. Through this study on multiple PDXs, integration of drug responsiveness, and genomic\/transcriptomic profiling may provide prediction markers for treatment responsiveness of CTX-712.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e98a7b1a-bb51-476d-8a5b-0f4a1a0ea995\/@u03B8ZRb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Small molecule drugs,Biomarkers,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18573"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daisuke Morishita<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shigehiro Yagishita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akio Mizutani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroko Yamakawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunsuke Ebara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akinobu Hamada<\/i><\/presenter>.

The randomized phase 1b\/2 study (GO29365) showed that the complete response rate in the Pola plus bendamustine (B) and rituximab (R) (Pola+BR) arm was significantly higher than the control BR arm in patients with relapsed\/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r\/r DLBCL) (Sehn et al., 2020). Based on these results, the Pola+BR has been approved in various countries. However, it is not clear whether the Pola combination regimen is effective in patients with Pola-refractory lymphoma. Investigating this could provide insight into effective treatment strategies against r\/r DLBCL. Therefore, we analyzed the combination effect of Pola+R on complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), one of the major mechanisms of R, in the DLBCL cells with low sensitivity to Pola as a model for Pola-refractory lymphoma (referred to as Pola-refractory cells).Methods. For the CDC assays, calcein-AM stained cells were incubated with R in medium containing 15% normal human serum, and fluorescence intensity was measured. Expression levels of protein were determined by flow cytometry or immunoblotting. For in vivo experiments, human SU-DHL-8 cells were injected subcutaneously into C.B-17\/Icr-scid\/scidJcl mice. Human IgG, Pola (2 mg\/kg), or R (30 mg\/kg) was administered intravenously on Day 1.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that three-day-pretreatment with Pola enhanced cell-surface expression of CD20 and R-induced CDC sensitivity in SU-DHL-8 Pola-refractory cells in vitro. A similar combination effect was observed in HT and SU-DHL-2 cells. Pola also increased CD20 expression on the SU-DHL-8 xenografted tumors and significantly enhanced antitumor activity by combination with R in this model. Both AKT and MEK specific inhibitors attenuated the Pola-induced increase of CD20 and CDC sensitivity, suggesting that phosphorylation of AKT and ERK after Pola treatment was required for this combination efficacy. To examine which part of Pola is responsible for regulating these signals, we used anti-human CD79b antibody SN8, a parental antibody for Pola, and its payload MMAE. SN8 increased the phosphorylation of AKT but inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK. In contrast, MMAE potentiated phosphorylation of ERK but weakly attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT. Taken together, these results suggest that Pola, which consists of SN8 and MMAE, may cancel the negative effect of each, and enhance CD20 expression and CDC sensitivity.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In these Pola-refractory cells, pretreatment with Pola enhanced CD20 expression and R-induced CDC sensitivity. Combination treatment of Pola+R enhances antitumor activity in the Pola-refractory xenograft mouse model. These results provide a novel rationale for the combination of Pola+R in Pola-refractory lymphoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41c140dc-e9bf-4c73-8bf4-80753b2049dc\/@u03B8ZRb\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,CD20,Rituximab,Polatuzumab vedotin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18574"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Natsumi Kawasaki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasushi Yoshimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shigeki Yoshiura<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus, exploring and developing novel tumor-specific agents for treating pancreatic cancer is a critical need. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is elevated in the pancreatic cancers whereas it lacks in associated normal tissues. Therefore, NQO1 bioactivatable drugs are promising due to tumor-selective killing NQO1-positive cancer cells. Our previous studies have revealed that the novel NQO1 bioactivatable drug - deoxynyboquinone (DNQ) is ten-fold more potent than the prototypic NQO1 bioactivatable drug &#946;-lapachone to efficiently kill NQO1-positive cancer cells. However, DNQ causes a severe side effect action - high-grade methemoglobinemia that limits its clinical usefulness. Here, we developed a novel DNQ derivative, isopentyl-deoxynboquinone (IP-DNQ), which selectively killed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells in an NQO1-dependent way with an extremely low IC50 (0.1 &#181;M). IP-DNQ evoked massive ROS production and oxidative DNA lesions, resulting in PARP1 hyperactivation and mitochondrial catastrophe. Furthermore, we also observed that IP-DNQ induced G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest and promoted programmed necrosis and caspase-dependent apoptosis co-existing in IP-DNQ-treated NQO1-positive pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, IP-DNQ treatment caused extremely low side effect of methemoglobinemia, significantly suppressed tumor growth and extended mice lifespan in orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenograft model. In summary, our findings offer a novel potential therapy against NQO1-positive pancreatic cancers and enable mechanism-based synergy with other anticancer drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6021a60c-0456-43ae-b2b8-6d851fd32767\/@u03B8ZRb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor agents,DNA damage,Mitochondria,Cell cycle checkpoints,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19017"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiumei Huang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingxiang Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew W.

Inflammation induced by treatments including chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) can also promote immune checkpoint upregulation and consequent tumor immune escape. However, whether the acute inflammation associated with standard chemotherapy and RT can engage distinct immune checkpoints to further support tumor persistence remains unknown. Using an <i>in vivo <\/i>screening platform in which tumors were irradiated with high-dose &#947;-radiation, we identified the B7-related immunoglobulin superfamily protein butyrophilin 1A1 (BTN1A1) as an acute stress-inducible immune checkpoint. Herein, we aimed to investigate how BTN1A1 contributes to post-irradiation intratumoral immunosuppression. To assess BTN1A1 induction in response to &#947;-radiation, human cell lines were exposed to a range of radiation doses, and cell death and BTN1A1 expression were examined by flow cytometry. Radiation promoted apoptosis and BTN1A1 expression in a dose-dependent manner, and PD-L1 was downregulated by increasing the dosage of &#947;-radiation. As radiation-induced cell death results in cytosolic DNA accumulation within tumors, which in turn activates the production of type I interferons (IFNs) via the cGAS\/STING pathway, we examined the effect of BTN1A1 on cGAS and STING expression. BTN1A1 overexpression in human prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells suppressed cGAS and STING expression. IFNs can promote antigen presenting cell activation, thus priming T cell responses. We then examined the impact of BTN1A1 overexpression on type I IFN production as assessed via qRT-PCR, revealing that BTN1A1 overexpression enhanced IFN-&#946; expression in the presence of the STING agonist cGAMP. BTN1A1 was also found to harbor a C-terminal B30.2 domain that was able to specifically interact with xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), an oxidizing enzyme involved in purine metabolism. BTN1A1 expression induced high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have the potential to be more toxic in lymphocytes as compared to tumor cells, and BTN1A1 knockdown decreased these ROS levels. In light of these observations, we assessed the combination therapeutic efficacy of RT and anti-BTN1A1 antibodies in a syngeneic murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model system, revealing that these two treatments exhibited synergistic anti-tumor activity. FACS and IHC further confirmed that BTN1A1 was upregulated within tumors following irradiation. Together, these data offer new insights regarding the immunomodulatory role of radiation-induced BTN1A1 within tumors, providing a more robust foundation for the development of BTN1A1 as an immunologic target for cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dae05bf4-05c6-4c1f-ae49-53b9d92ceeed\/@u03B8ZRb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-03 Interactions of new agents with radiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Antitumor agents,Radiotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21346"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"0d7fd994-9f79-4054-8bc3-807d9e6edc1c","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d7fd994-9f79-4054-8bc3-807d9e6edc1c\/@u03B8ZRb\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ezra Chung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young-Seung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven H.

In this regard, our lab had previously discovered a small molecule, Inauhzin (INZ C), as a potent non-genotoxic p53 activator. In an effort to improve the bioavailability and efficacy, we have now encapsulated the INZ C small molecule in a chitosan\/cyclodextrin nanoparticle delivery system. Evaluation of <i>in vitro\/in vivo <\/i>activity and protien expression suggests nanoparticle encapsulation of INZ-C (n-INZ-C) improved p53 induction and inhibition of cell growth in lung and colorectal cancers<i>, <\/i>while maintaining a minimal effect for MEF and Wi38 normal cells. These results are consistent with the significantly reduced cellular uptake observed for normal cells as compared to the cancer cells. H\/E staining of tissues for mice treated with n-INZ-C reveals no toxicity to other organs as well. Additionally, n-INZ-C demonstrates the ability to block migration of cells <i>in vitro<\/i> as demonstrated by both wound healing and trans-well migration assays. Our <i>in vivo <\/i>pharmacokinetic evaluation suggests nanoparticle encapsulation doubles the half-life of INZ-C from 2.5 to 5 h. These results suggest that nanoparticle encapsulation improved activity and bioavailability of INZ-C while maintaining the non-toxic nature of INZ-C in normal cells. In addition, we unveiled GRP78 as a potential new target of INZ-C and found out that knockdown of GRP78 can alleviate the inhibitory effect of INZ-C on lung and colorectal cancer proliferation. Further studies now focus on revealing the mechanism of enhanced cellular uptake for INZ-C in cancer cells as comapred to normal cells. Thus, these results demonstrate that we have established a nanoparticle system that could enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of INZ-C as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic and also identified a novel target of INZ-C.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/386e092b-e1e2-4c2d-a26c-323e5864f8fb\/@u03B8ZRb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,GRP78,Nanoparticle,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21507"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nimisha Bhattarai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jieqiong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoxiao Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linh Helmers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Paruch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiwei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kun Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alun Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janarthanan Jayawickramarajah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Binghe Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shelya Zeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Lu<\/i><\/presenter>.
