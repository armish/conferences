The recent development of Base Editor technology allows nucleotide-level manipulation, enabling fine-scale investigation of endogenous loci. The low upfront costs of generating a pooled base editing library, coupled with the small scale and relative ease of executing such screens, makes the financial barrier to entry for such experiments low while also not requiring deep experience with screening.<br \/>One application of this technology is screens that aim to identify resistance mutations in putative targets of small molecules, which provides excellent evidence that the phenotype is caused by on-target activity of the small molecule. This has heretofore typically been an extraordinarily laborious and time-consuming experimental path, by either slowly cultivating spontaneous drug resistant mutants or by generating and screening large scale ORF-variant pools. Base editor screens are well-suited to vastly accelerate this process.<br \/>Using both A&#62;G and C&#62;T base editors, coupled with variants of the SpCas9 enzyme, we have conducted drug resistance screens with small molecules that target the anti-apoptotic proteins <i>MCL1, BCL2L1, <\/i>and <i>BCL2,<\/i> as well as the DNA repair regulator <i>PARP1. <\/i>These screens identified resistance residues that were also observed in clinical samples, illustrating the utility of this approach. Additionally, base editor screens are excellent tools for studying genetic variants, as we will demonstrate with screens identifying loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1, BRCA2<\/i>, and <i>TP53<\/i>. We anticipate that the tools and methodologies described here will facilitate the investigation of impactful variants at a finer and deeper resolution for any locus of interest.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Bcl-2 protein family,Therapy resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Audrey Griffith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annabel Sangree<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priyanka Roy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruth Hanna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>John Doench<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
