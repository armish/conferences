[{"Abstract":"<b>INTRODUCTION<\/b>: Advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) relies on surgery and radiation for cure; with ~30% experiencing locoregional failure. Earlier studies suggest OCSCCs resist radiation response by suppressing senescence. <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, coding for p16<sup>INK4a<\/sup> (p16), a CDK4\/6 inhibitory protein, is among the most commonly lost tumor suppressors in OCSCC. Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) is an understudied key regulatory protein in OCSCC whose activation, similar to Rb, is controlled by CDK4\/6. FOXM1 activity not only impacts cell proliferation, but also promotes DNA damage repair and suppresses senescence. The current study examines how FOXM1 signaling plays a critical role in resistance to radiation in OCSCC. We demonstrate that CDK4\/6 inhibition improves radiosensitivity in OCSCC via senescence as a result of FOXM1 suppression.<br \/><b>METHODS<\/b>: Microarray data were analyzed to investigate FOXM1 levels in OSCC tumors. Basal FOXM1 levels in immortalized OCSCC cell lines (HN5 and Cal27) were evaluated using western blot. Cells were treated with palbociclib, radiation (RT), or combination (1&#181;M palbociclib and 4 Gy (P+RT)) to examine the effects on senescence and FOXM1 signaling. &#946; galactosidase colorimetric (&#946;-gal) staining was used to evaluate senescence. Western blot was used to measure protein levels and QPCR to measure FOXM1 expression. To demonstrate senescence as a function of FOXM1 inhibition, knockdown assays (KD) were performed with siRNA targeting FOXM1. To further eliminate off target drug effects knockdown was also performed with siRNA targeting CDK4\/6.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b>: FOXM1 was upregulated ~2.2-fold in OCSCC tumors vs. matched normal mucosa samples (N=43, p=2.85008E-06). FOXM1 protein was upregulated 7-fold (HN5) and 5-fold (Cal27) compared to normal oral keratinocytes (HOK16B). &#946;-gal staining revealed a dose dependent senescence induction in OCSCC, where P+RT vs. RT showed a robust 5-fold (HN5) and 3-folds (Cal27) increase. Interestingly, FOXM1 protein and transcript expression doubled in samples treated with RT. P+RT vs. RT demonstrated a decrease in FOXM1 protein levels in HN5 (10-fold) and Cal27 (3-fold), with corresponding decreases in mRNA levels. Knockdown of FOXM1 induced senescence, which further increased when combined with radiation: siFOXM1+4 Gy resulted in 60% (HN5) and 50% (CAL27) &#946;-gal positive cells. Compared to untreated controls, CDK4\/6 KD demonstrated a 2.5 and 10-fold decrease in FOXM1 protein levels in HN5 and CAL27, respectively. Furthermore, a concurrent inhibition of CDK4\/6 with RT not only resulted in a decrease in FOXM1 expression but also resulted in a near-complete senescence in treated cells (95% &#946;-Gal staining).<br \/><b>CONCLUSION<\/b>: Suppressing FOXM1 directly or via CDK4\/6 inhibition appears to make OCSCC more susceptible to RT via potentiating senescence. We propose inhibition of FOXM1 as a rational and potentially effective strategy to sensitize OCSCC to radiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30a8f742-0b85-4cfb-88ac-19cd1504481c\/@p03B8ZNi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-01 Modulators of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,FOXM1,Radioresistance,Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15674"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nitisha Shrivastava<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yisrael Wallach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael B.

The most common MET mutation is in exon 14, which results in deletion of the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of the receptor, leading to enhanced signaling. Mutation at Asp-1000 in the juxtamembrane region has also been reported and can lead to inhibition of apoptosis and cell proliferation. MET is involved in multiple pathways associated with radiation response. Therefore, we investigated the effects of inhibiting MET in combination with radiation in two preclinical non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastasis patient derived xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/>Methods: Surgically obtained tissue was implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. Histology and DNA loci were compared between original tumor and PDX. DNA sequencing was performed on tumors for mutation analysis. In vivo growth responses to the MET inhibitor capmatinib or savolitinib with and without radiation were assessed. Radiation was delivered in 10 daily fractions of 2 Gy. Drug was administered by oral gavage daily 1 hour prior to radiation at a dose of 2.5 mg\/kg for savaolitnib or 20 mg\/kg for capmatinib for 10 days. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to evaluate MET signaling and proliferation.<br \/>Results: PDXs were successfully established from two patients with MET mutated NSCLC brain metastases: a lung adenocarcinoma with a MET exon 14 skipping mutation and a lung sarcomatoid carcinoma with adenocarcinoma component with an Asp-1000 frameshift mutation. Morphologically, strong retention of cytoarchitectural features was observed between original patient tumors and PDXs. Short tandem repeat analysis confirmed 100% matching of alleles between patient tumors and PDXs. DNA sequencing confirmed METex14 and MET Asp-1000 frameshift mutation. In the METex14 PDX, savolitinib alone significantly inhibited tumor growth with a growth inhibition value of 46% (p&#60;0.01). Combination of savolitinib and radiation significantly delayed growth compared to vehicle control, savolitinib alone or radiation alone (p&#60;0.001). The absolute growth delay was 42.4 days for savolitinib plus radiation treatment compared to 9.3 days for savolitinib alone and 28.2 days for irradiation. In the MET Asp-1000 PDX, capmatinib and radiation significantly delayed growth compared the other treatment arms (p&#60;0.01). IHC demonstrated inhibition of phospho-MET and pS6 and a decrease in Ki67 with MET inhibition.<br \/>Conclusion: Inhibition of MET enhanced the effect of radiation in our two preclinical <i>in vivo<\/i> MET mutated NSCLC brain metastasis models.

It effectively blocks the non-homologous end-joining pathway for repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and has shown strong synergy with ionizing radiation (IR) and DSB-inducing chemotherapy. We recently reported that M3814 overactivates the ATM\/p53 signaling axis, reinforces cell cycle checkpoint arrest, and promotes durable premature senescence in irradiated p53 wild-type cancer cells. This unique property of peposertib permits to turn the bulk of irradiated cancer cells into nearly uniform senescent cell population. Using this experimental model, we examined the immunological effects and potential therapeutic applications of IR+peposertib induced senescence. Gene expression analyses of IR+peposertib treated A549 cells showed activation of multiple immune-related genes in the senescent cells, consistent with a strong STING-driven inflammatory response. Multiple secreted cytokines were found substantially elevated in culture media compared to IR controls. Co-culture of IR+peposertib induced senescent cells with PBMCs from healthy volunteers coupled with FACS analyses and live imaging revealed stimulation of the T-cell compartment and killing of senescent but not control cells. Further co-culture experiments with isolated NK cells showed accelerated killing of the senescent IR+peposertib treated A549 cells as compared to controls. These results indicated that IR+peposertib induced inflammatory signaling in senescent A549 cells can stimulate an immune response in vitro, resulting in the effective elimination of both treated and naive A549 cells. We also explored a pharmacological \"two-hit\" approach. Viability assays and time-lapse imaging showed that the senescent, IR+peposertib treated A549 cells were sensitive to several reported senolytic agents. Of those, the BCL-X<sub>L<\/sub> inhibitor A-1331852 was most effective at killing peposertib-promoted senescent A549 cells. Our experiments revealed that selective inhibition of DNA-PK in irradiated p53 wild-type cancer cells provides a powerful mechanism for induction of senescent cancer cells with an immunostimulatory secretory phenotype in vitro. In addition, these cells can be selectively targeted by senolytic agents, suggesting that triple combination radiotherapy with DNA-PK inhibitors and senolytics could offer a potential new approach to the treatment of locally advanced tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9cff2c0a-5f54-4b63-b426-4d94c481f5e6\/@p03B8ZNi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-01 Modulators of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA double-strand break,Radiotherapy,Senescence,Serine\/threonine kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15679"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Carr<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qing Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chien-Fei Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank T.

While advancements in radiation therapy have improved life expectancy and patient outcome, exposure to radiotherapy causes normal tissue toxicity and damage to the central nervous system, resulting in cognitive impairment and negative patient side effects. In the hippocampus, the memory processing center of the brain, radiotherapy-induced elevated glutamate levels lead to over-excitation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and thus cell death. To investigate the NMDAR, we repurposed a NMDA subtype specific inhibitor (Ifenprodil) and treated non-tumor mice before radiation. We found that Ifenprodil rescues cell death and cognition by inhibiting the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors and preventing over-excitement-induced excitotoxicity, despite presence of high glutamate levels. In order to relieve glioma patients of the negative side effects of radiotherapies, we aim to further investigate the critical role of NR2B inhibition in non-tumor and tumor-bearing mice to reduce excitotoxicity and prevent damage to the central nervous system, opening avenues for therapeutic targeting and drug development. To accomplish this, we designed promotor-specific plasmids, only activated when present in their designed neuronal cell types, to initiate CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing and knock out the NR2B subunit of NMDAR. With NR2B knocked out across 5 different cell types, we exposed hippocampal organotypic slice cultures, derived from non-tumor mice, to 2 Gy radiation and ran flow cytometry to reveal which neuronal NR2B subunits play critical roles in excitotoxic phenotypes. To further these findings, we utilized a recently developed in-utero-electroporation mouse model that produces glioblastomas in immunocompetent mice by inactivating select tumor-suppressor genes via CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing at embryonic day 14.5. By applying different CRISPR\/Cas9 gRNAs into our tumor-bearing mice, we can not only explore the robust role of NR2B inhibition in tumor brains with varying expressions, but also shed light onto how NR2B inhibition protects normal brain while leaving tumors radiosensitive. In conclusion, this work seeks to further develop our understanding of radiotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in order to prevent cognitive impairment and negative side effects in patients, improving their quality of life. Ultimately, the results from our findings will lead to the advancement of targeted drug development and therapeutic options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/94cd26d1-245b-4e9a-ab3d-cf98e5836986\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-01 Modulators of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Radiosensitivity,Targeted drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15680"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jesus Castro Jr.<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariana Gaelzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Welford<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the absence of distant metastasis, re-irradiation is the main curative-intent treatment option available for these patients, but the risk of severe adverse effects and tumor resistance of heavily irradiated patients are challenges to this therapy. On the other hand, the combination between re-irradiation with chemotherapy or immunotherapy is a scenario not extensively studied in the literature. Current existing models have been developed in immunodeficient mice, where the effect of immunotherapy cannot be assessed. To address this issue, we have developed and characterized a lung cancer model of radiation resistance, which can be used in syngeneic mice with fully functional immune system. To this aim, we have generated a mouse adenocarcinoma radioresistant cell line (Lacun3 RR) from previously characterized Lacun3 adenocarcinoma cells. This radioresistant cell line was generated after several rounds of radiation (8 Gy) administered to the parental Lacun3 cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Clonogenic and apoptotic assays confirmed that Lacun3 RR were more resistant to radiotherapy than the parental cell line, within the 2-4 Gy range. In addition, <i>in vivo<\/i> assays performed by subcutaneous injection of these cells showed that Lacun3 RR were completely refractory to 10 Gy irradiation, whereas a significant reduction in tumor volume (~60%) was found for parental Lacun3-derived tumors. Phenotypic characterization of these cells showed that Lacun3 RR cells had increased properties of cancer stem cells (CSC), with significantly higher ability to form tumorspheres. Lacun3 RR cells also showed increased CSC markers (ALDH1, NOTCH1) and slightly lower proliferation rates <i>in vitro<\/i> than Lacun3 cells. Cell signaling analysis revealed an increase in phosphorylated (p)p38 MAPK and pAKT basal and post-irradiation levels, and lower pH2AX (suggesting less DNA damage) in Lacun3 RR cells. RNAseq and DNAseq (Whole Exome Sequencing) were performed in both cell lines. As expected, we found that a substantial number of genes differentially expressed were significantly related to DNA repair, cell cycle regulation and spindle formation. Mutational burden was estimated from the DNAseq, revealing a similar global tumor mutational burden for both cell lines. However, some mutations were exclusively found in Lacun3 RR cells. The tumor microenvironment and tumor immune populations are currently being investigated in this model. In conclusion, we have developed a mouse model to study radiation resistance in a context of complete immunity, which could be highly valuable to study possible synergistic effects of radiotherapy and immunotherapy of re-irradiated NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ec93b62-998f-4870-b593-457820de4667\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioresistance,Bioinformatics,Stemness,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15682"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sergio León<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diego Serrano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Esther Redín<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Barranco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maeva Houry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Expósito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ibón Tamayo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Montuenga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Alfonso Calvo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Javier Aristu<\/i><\/presenter>.

In patients with advanced rectal cancer, this approach is used as neoadjuvant therapy to reduce local recurrence risk. However, RT has a small impact on metastasis formation, which remains an obstacle in clinical practice, being responsible for the high mortality rates. Also, local tumor recurrence after RT tends to be more aggressive, with shorter survival expectancy. This suggests that RT surviving cells develop resistance mechanisms that allow their survival and increase metastatic potential. Despite efforts in this field, the knowledge concerning the post-irradiation behavior and the radioresistant cancer cells phenotype is still limited. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to the acquisition of this resistant phenotype to improve therapeutic success. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of surviving cells that were submitted to a clinically relevant treatment protocol of hypofractionated irradiation. The cell lines were chosen due to the different levels of genomic instability and genetic mutations and were exposed to 25 Gy delivery in 5 daily fractions. Irradiation surviving cells (ISC) from both cell lines, SW-480 and HCT-116, gain resistance to re-irradiation, increasing their autophagic process and assuming a polyploid giant cancer cell phenotype. In addition, HCT-116 ISC became senescent, while SW-480 ISC show an increase in mesenchymal markers and a decrease in epithelial markers. Long-term evaluation of the ISCs confirmed senescence in HCT-116, while SW-480 exhibited a transient dormancy state, resuming its growth after 14 days. SW-480 ISC also generates a heterogeneous progeny with three distinct phenotypes: rounded and highly proliferative cells, elongated mesenchymal cells, and polyploid giant cancer cells. Furthermore, both ISC enhance the secretion of extracellular vesicles and cytokines (like IL-8, MCP-1, VEGF, and GM-CSF) in a cell-specific manner. Based on these results and the identification of proteins and pathways differentially regulated in ISCs we can contribute to the identification of therapeutic targets for neoadjuvant therapies, in order to improve the prognosis of CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/428c96c9-b302-46f6-b933-7b1deee19c01\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Colorectal,Radioresistance,Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15685"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Josiane Weber Tessmann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murilo Ramos Rocha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renata Ivo Vasconcelos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danielle Lazarin-Bidoia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raphael Rodrigues Corrêa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafael Soares Lindoso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulo Emílio Corrêa Leite<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Celso Vataru Nakamura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Andres Morgado-Diaz<\/i><\/presenter>.

RT promotes the release of neoantigens, damage-associated molecular patterns and cytokines leading to cytotoxic T cell infiltration and enhancing immune surveillance. However, RT-induced anti-tumor response is sometimes hampered by inhibitory signals that suppress T cell function and facilitate tumor immune evasion. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SERPINB3\/SCCA1) is highly expressed in epithelial cancers including cervix, head and neck, lung, and esophagus, and often associated with poor prognosis. We found that overexpressing mSerpinb3a in Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LL2\/mB3a) promoted tumor growth compared to LL2 transduced with control vector (LL2\/C). Prior to RT, increased MDSCs, TAMs, and Treg cells were observed in LL2\/mB3a tumors compared to LL2\/C, and is associated with a shorter RT-induced tumor growth delay in LL2\/mB3a. The total number of infiltrating T cells was significantly reduced in LL2\/mB3a and LL2\/C at 2 days post-RT, with recovery by 5 days post-RT. However, CD8+ T remained low in the LL2\/mB3a tumors and showed decreased proliferative capacity compared to LL2\/C infiltrating T cells. Importantly, while RT improved the functionality in LL2\/C-infiltrating T cells, as shown by <i>ex vivo<\/i> stimulation resulting in increased TNF and INF&#947; production compared to non-RT LL2\/C-infiltrating T cells, the same improvement was not observed in LL2\/mB3a-infiltrating T cells. In human T cell <i>in vitro <\/i>assay, SERPINB3 inhibited T cell activation by suppressing CD69, and CD25 expression, resulting in impaired proliferation capability. Further study on the association between SERPINB3 and immunosuppression showed that LL2\/mB3a had increased suppressive chemokine CXCL1 and S100A8\/A9 expression compared to LL2\/C tumors and RT further enhanced expression of these chemokines in LL2\/mB3a tumors. Likewise, human cancer cells overexpressing SERPINB3 also secreted high levels of CXCL1\/8 and S100A8\/A9. This chemokine induction was found regulated by elevated phosphorylation of STAT1\/3 in SERPINB3-expressing cancer cells, while inhibiting STAT signaling by Ruxolitinib significantly suppressed the SERPINB3-dependent chemokine expression. We found that cervical cancer patients with high pre-treatment serum SCCA level (&#62;16.1 ng\/ml) and p-STAT3 level is associated with worse outcome with cancer specific survival at 2 years of about 10% compared to patients with serum SCCA &#60;16.1 and low pSTAT3 of 95%. Our findings indicate that SERPINB3 high tumors produce high levels of suppressive chemokines through STAT signaling, leading to MDSCs, macrophages, and Treg infiltration, which dampen T cell functionality and mitigate the effect of radiation therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/edffd3a2-ac3d-47e5-af26-a4eac96a1293\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation,Chemokines,Squamous cell carcinoma,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15687"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liyun Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victoria Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Songyan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Freeman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pippa Cosper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Spina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Schwarz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Markovina<\/i><\/presenter>.

Radiation therapy (XRT) plays a vital role in multidisciplinary treatment approaches. Although XRT has been found to reduce breast cancer recurrence and mortality rate, like all other therapeutics, XRT contains some risks. Radiation can increase the mortality rate due to the risk of ischemic heart diseases. As part of an overall effort to understand the interaction between different types of radiations (e.g., radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) with &#946; or &#945;-particle emitters) and DNA double-strand break repair (DSB) repair pathways, we observed that impairment of DNA DSB by DNA-PKcs inhibitor (NU7441) fragmented HER2-positive BC spheroids in the presence of XRT. This could be possibly due to the modulation of cellular adhesion protein mediated by DNA-PK inhibition. In this study, we aim to assess the spheroids fragmentations and also measure the cell viability and levels of a cell adhesion protein, &#946;1-integrin in irradiated HER2-positive monolayer cells, to get a mechanistic view for XRT and NU7441 combinatorial action so as to compare with &#946;- or &#945;-emitter RPT.<br \/>Methods: In brief, NT2.5 BC spheroids were formed in agarose-coated 96-well plates. For both spheroids and monolayer cells, half of the media was replaced with fresh media containing 1 nM-5&#956;M of NU7441 every other day. A colorimetric cell viability kit was used to measure cell viability and western blot analysis was performed to measure the &#946;1-integrin level, which was normalized against &#946;-actin.<br \/>Results: Microscopic analysis suggested that XRT increased spheroid fragmentations in the presence of NU7441 compared to the XRT alone. Interaction between XRT and NU7441 (6.68% of the total variation, P&#60;0.0001) was found for the cell viability data, where XRT (74.07% of the total variation, P&#60;0.0001) and NU7441 (5.07% of the total variation, P&#60;0.0001) both regulated cell viability on their own. Western blot data suggest that &#946;1-integrin level was reduced for 8 Gy XRT and 5 &#956;M NU7441 combination compared to the no XRT and vehicle combination. Moreover, 2-way ANOVA analysis revealed that XRT plays a role to regulate the &#946;1-integrin level in NT2.5 monolayer cells (57.61% of the total variation, P&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: XRT increased BC spheroids fragmentations when DNA damage was inhibited by a small molecule inhibitor. XRT and NU7441 both regulated NT2.5 cell viability with an interaction between them. Furthermore, XRT reduced &#946;1-integrin level in monolayer NT2.5 cells. The XRT and NU7441 combination may induce fragmentations by decreasing cell viability and adhesion proteins. Future studies assessing the mechanisms of XRT and DNA PK inhibitor in BC spheroids and <i>in vivo<\/i> are warranted to confirm these results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c09cdd1-763e-41a1-9fea-ea1bfc38a7e9\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-07 Radiobiology research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Radiation therapy,Spheroids,integrin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15688"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mahmud Hasan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ioanna Liatsou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Sgouros<\/i><\/presenter>.

The xCT-inhibitor sulfasalazine (SAS) sensitizes cancer cells by blocking xCT-mediated cystine uptake, and thereby glutathione (GSH) synthesis protecting against radiation-induced oxidative stress. However, SAS has limited clinical potential as a radiosensitizer due to side effects and low bio-availability. Using SAS as a starting point, we previously developed synthetic xCT-inhibitors through scaffold hopping &#38; structure optimization aided by structure-activity relationship analysis (SAR). Notably, the compound DC10 exhibited potent inhibition of GSH synthesis. In this study, we validated DC10 as a radiosensitizer in the xCT-expressing cancer cell lines A172, A375 &#38; MCF7 in vitro &#38; in mice harboring melanoma xenografts. After DC10 treatment, we measured 14C-cystine uptake in the cancer cell lines using liquid scintillation counting, and intracellular levels of GSH &#38; reactive oxygen species (ROS) using luminescence assays. We performed immunoblotting for &#947;H2AX &#38; ATM to assess DNA damage after treatment with DC10 and radiotherapy. We then assessed the effect of adding DC10 to radiation upon cancer cell colony formation. Blood samples from mice treated with DC10 underwent biochemical analysis to assess toxicity. Finally, mice with A375 melanomas in the flank, received DC10 and radiotherapy in combination, as monotherapies or no treatment. Notably, DC10 reduced cystine uptake and GSH synthesis &#38; increased ROS levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, DC10 interacted synergistically with radiation to increase DNA damage &#38; reduce colony formation. Mice receiving DC10 were clinically unaffected, whereas blood samples analyses to assess bone marrow suppression, liver or kidney toxicity revealed no significant differences between mice &#38; untreated controls. Importantly, DC10 potentiated the anti-tumor efficacy of radiation in mice with melanoma xenografts. We conclude that DC10 acts as a radiosensitizer, is well tolerated, &#38; mediates its effect by inhibiting cystine uptake, leading to GSH depletion and increased oxidative stress. Thus, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using synthetic xCT-inhibitors to overcome radioresistance. The expression of xCT in multiple tumor types further implies it represents a target generic to cancer rather than confined to tumor subtypes. Hence, this therapeutic concept could be applicable to a wide range of radioresistant malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/85b7db09-a796-416f-aa22-7459659d9145\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-08 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitivity,Redox,Structure-activity relationships,Malignant melanoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15691"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shahin Sarowar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Davide Cirillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo Jativa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mette H.

Thus, more effective radiosensitization strategies are needed. We performed a radiosensitizer screen paired with transcriptomic and proteomic data to identify potential mediators of RT resistance and identify novel therapeutic targets.<br \/>Methods: Microarray and RPPA data were used for gene\/protein expression and pathway analysis. Clonogenic survival assays were performed to assess radiosensitization and calculate relative enhancement ratios (rERs) with MDM2 inhibitors navtemadlin (AMG-232) and alrizomadlin (APG-115) in p53 wild-type (WT) and mutant (MT) models of estrogen receptor positive (p53 WT: MCF-7, p53 MT: T47D) and triple-negative BC (p53 WT: CAL-51, p53 MT: MDA-MB-231). AlamarBlue was used to determine IC<sub>50<\/sub> concentrations of MDM2 inhibitors. Clonogenic and IC<sub>50<\/sub> experiments performed in parallel with p53 CRISPR knockout models of p53 WT cell lines. DNA damage response was assessed with &#947;-H2AX Immunofluorescence microscopy. Flow Cytometry with Annexin V staining was used to evaluate apoptosis and Propidium Iodide staining for cell cycle progression. Light microscopy with &#946;-gal staining was used to evaluate senescence. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy of combination therapy was evaluated with CAL-51 and CAL-51 p53 CRISPR xenograft models.<br \/>Results: An MDM2 inhibitor (JNJ-26854165) was nominated as an effective drug in treatment for RT-resistant BC cell lines (R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.43, p value &#60;0.01) in our novel radiosensitizer screen. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis in non-overlapping p53 WT BC cell lines treated +\/-RT identified apoptosis, cell cycle, and p53 signaling as the top pathways induced in p53 WT cell lines by RT. MDM2 was significantly overexpressed after RT compared to no RT in p53 WT cells. Cell growth was decreased by MDM2 inhibition with navtemadlin and alrizomadlin in p53 WT cells (IC50s: 264-592nM) and not in p53 MT cells (IC50s &#62;10&#956;m). MDM2 inhibition radiosensitized p53 WT cells (rERs: 1.81-2.85) but not p53 MT cells (rERs: 1.00-1.03). This phenotype was reversed in p53 CRISPR knockout cells (rERs: 1.06-1.12). MDM2 inhibition in combination with RT demonstrated delayed DNA damage repair compared to RT alone. p53 WT cells demonstrated increased G1 cell cycle arrest with RT and combination therapy. Combination MDM2 inhibition and RT resulted in increased apoptosis and senescence in p53 WT cell lines. <i>In vivo <\/i>xenograft studies are ongoing.<br \/>Conclusions: These results demonstrate the combination of RT and MDM2 inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy in patients with p53-wild type breast cancer, regardless of hormone receptor status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/682581a0-278a-48e9-ace4-64a648c6b1d4\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-08 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitization,MDM2,Breast cancer,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15692"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Charles A.

In this study, we evaluated how pre-existing or genetically engineered deficits in DNA damage response genes (<i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>, <i>RAD51, RB1, XRCC6, TP53)<\/i> influence radiosensitization.

In an MCF-7 isogenic model of <i>BRCA2<\/i> knockout, CDK4\/6i-mediated radiosensitization was abolished compared to Cas9 control or parental cell lines. In ER+ BC cell lines (MCF-7-p53 wt, T47D-p53 mutant), transient or genetic knockdown of <i>RAD51<\/i> prevented CDK4\/6i-induced radiosensitization. The total quantity of RT-induced RAD51 foci increased <i>in vitro<\/i> following overexpression of RB-a tumor suppressor and downstream target of CDK4\/6.

Moreover, immunoprecipitation of RAD51 in ER+ (MCF-7) and TNBC (MDA-MB-231) cells exhibited an interaction with RB. Conversely, loss of the NHEJ-associated protein Ku70 (<i>XRCC6<\/i>) was synergistic with palbociclib + RT in MCF7 (rER: 1.76-2.44) and T47D (rER: 1.61-3.88) cells.

Cancer cells lacking catalase function fail to clear H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> resulting in increased tumoricidal load. In addition, complex interactions through redox signaling and immune interplay are suggested mechanisms of action. Our pre-clinical studies with the SODm GC4419 (AVA) indicated that increased inflammatory, TNF&#945;, and apoptosis signaling contribute to treatment synergy that was most effective at hypofractionation (<i>Sci Transl Med.<\/i> 13:593). The analogue GC4711 (GC) is currently in clinical trials for SBRT against NSCLC and pancreatic cancer. However, optimal combination schedules and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we present optimized combination schedules using human lung tumor xenografts regarding drug administration timing and dosage, as well as local and abscopal tumor control in a syngeneic lung tumor model. Further, we tested various cell stress and immune pathways to identify targets of synergistic IR-drug interaction.<br \/>Methods: Female athymic nude and C57BL\/6 mice were inoculated with H1299 and LLC, respectively. H1299 tumors were irradiated with 10-15 Gy and GC was given once or twice daily (24 or 2x20 mg\/kg, respectively) over 5 days, including untreated controls. LLC tumors were set up as an abscopal model and mice received combination treatment with GC and 15 Gy, 15 Gy only, or GC only, including untreated controls. In vitro, lung cancer cell lines were pre-treated with AVA or GC 30 min prior to IR and assayed for various immune or DNA damage-related endpoints.<br \/>Results: The anti-tumor efficacy of single or double GC administration showed nonlinear dose-dependence indicating complex drug-IR interplay. Optimal drug administration appears to be around 3 hours prior to irradiation while time-of-day of treatment has no observable effect in this model. In the LLC double tumor model, GC in combination with IR induced significant and pronounced abscopal tumor control. In vitro, analysis revealed GC action related to e.g. 53BP1, yH2AX, Akt, R-loop formation and replication stress, and interaction with various immune pathways.<br \/>Discussion and Conclusions: The radiotherapeutic effect can be vastly increased with superoxide dismutase mimetics, both within and outside the treatment field. Combination therapy requires screening of schedules regarding timing, drug dosage, and IR dose and fractionation to achieve optimal tumoricidal effects. SODm synergize with IR acting on various molecular targets that can be harnessed to overcome treatment resistance. Secondary tumor control is a promising new venue for IR-SODm combination therapy. Moreover, redox-immune interaction opens new therapeutic applications with combined immune checkpoint inhibitors for unprecedented tumor control and cure rate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b15aba99-ad89-4199-b2c2-8d427d3b6b50\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-08 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Radiosensitization,Synergism,Redox,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15695"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Britta Langen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurentiu Pop<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zengfu Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moito Iijima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Nicholson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingming Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael D.

Herein, we plan to utilize a novel three stage nanotechnology-chemoradiation combinatorial approach for enhancing catastrophic cell death in pancreatic tumors and reducing normal tissue toxicity. T-GNP has cytotoxic effect at tumor site and can specifically sensitize tumor tissue for radiation. In this work, we used our GNP-based pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) -specific drug delivery platform using a plectin-1-targeting peptide (PTP) (patent: US2018\/0333432 A1) to demonstrate the cytotoxicity of the nanocomplex <i>in vitro<\/i>. In PANC-1 cancer cell model, using traditional gold-standard clonogenic assay, we show 2-AZ-2-DG has radiation-mediated cytotoxicity which is further augmented by T-GNP. These results align with our hypothesis and the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy electron-induced aminyl radical production data presented here. This radiation-produced auger electrons from T-GNP likely increased formation of RNH&#8226; which result in enhanced cell kill. This <i>via<\/i> H-atom abstraction reactions that might cause DNA-strand breaks and\/or crosslink formation leading to lesions that could induce apoptosis of cancer cells.<br \/>This nanotool paraphrased as I-RaGAZ, Integrated radiation induced T-GNP - 2-AZ-2-DG anti-tumor action, will be very useful for treating deep-seated tumors with minimum collateral damage. This approach, integrated radiation-mediated azido tumor cure (I-RaGAZ), has vast global cancer treatment potential considering the dual mode of damaging the tumor tissues and protecting the normal tissues\/organs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/085eea9c-2155-4065-97a1-cc5c84a93d02\/@q03B8ZNj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-08 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Radiosensitization,Chemosensitization,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15696"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rao V.
