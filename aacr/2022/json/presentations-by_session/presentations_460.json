[{"Abstract":"There is a need for new <i>in vitro<\/i> systems that enable pharmaceutical companies to collect more physiologically-relevant information on drug response in a low-cost and high-throughput manner. For this purpose, three-dimensional (3D) spheroidal models have been established as more effective than two-dimensional models. Current commercial techniques, however, rely heavily on self-aggregation of dissociated cells and are unable to replicate key features of the native tumor microenvironment, particularly due to a lack of control over extracellular matrix components and heterogeneity in shape, size, and aggregate forming tendencies. In this study, we overcome these challenges by coupling tissue engineering toolsets with microfluidics technologies to create engineered cancer microspheres.<br \/>Specifically, we employ biosynthetic hydrogels composed of conjugated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and fibrinogen protein (PEG-Fb) to create engineered breast and colorectal cancer tissue microspheres for 3D culture, tumorigenic characterization, and examination of potential for high-throughput screening (HTS). MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were used to create breast cancer microspheres and the HT29 cell line and cells from a stage II patient-derived xenograft (PDX) were encapsulated to produce colorectal cancer (CRC) microspheres.<br \/>Using our previously developed microfluidic system, highly uniform cancer microspheres (intra-batch coefficient of variation (CV) &#8804; 5%, inter-batch CV &#60; 2%) with high cell densities (&#62;20&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/ml) were produced rapidly, which is critical for use in drug testing. Encapsulated cells maintained high viability and displayed cell type-specific differences in morphology, proliferation, metabolic activity, ultrastructure, and overall microsphere size distribution and bulk stiffness. For PDX CRC microspheres, the percentage of human (70%) and CRC (30%) cells was maintained over time and similar to the original PDX tumor, and the mechanical stiffness also exhibited a similar order of magnitude (10<sup>3 <\/sup>Pa) to the original tumor.<br \/>The cancer microsphere system was shown to be compatible with an automated liquid handling system for administration of drug compounds; MDA-MB-231 microspheres were distributed in 384 well plates and treated with staurosporine (1 &#956;M) and doxorubicin (10 &#956;M). Expected responses were quantified using CellTiter-Glo&#174; 3D, demonstrating initial applicability to HTS drug discovery. PDX CRC microspheres were treated with Fluorouracil (5FU) (10 to 500 &#956;M) and displayed a decreasing trend in metabolic activity with increasing drug concentration. Providing a more physiologically relevant tumor microenvironment in a high-throughput and low-cost manner, the PF hydrogel-based cancer microspheres could potentially improve the translational success of drug candidates by providing more accurate <i>in vitro<\/i> prediction of <i>in vivo<\/i> drug efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/645514c8-435d-4797-a1b4-490913f3dbdc\/@v03B8ZMt\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,In vitro Cancer Model,High-throughput screening,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14412"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth A.

PDXs (Patient-Derived Xenografts), developed in immune-compromised mice, have proven their relevance in the study of aberrations leading to the development and progression of cancer, to the mechanisms linked to tumor resistance and to the identification of novel therapies. Despite being a fundamental step to generate new knowledge on cancer, the use of PDXs shows some technical disadvantages such as long engraftment time and\/or low growth rate, thus raising economic and ethical concerns. Huge efforts are being done to develop cell-based alternatives systems reproducing the tumor complexity combined with suitable methods. To this aim, we have developed 50+ PDX-derived cell lines (PDXDCs) from our proprietary 200+ PDX collection. These lines are currently used as two-dimensional (2D) cultures to perform drug screening in an affordable, timewise, and cost-effective way. While well designed, drug-tailored 2D screenings can predict drug behavior <i>in vivo<\/i>, they present limitations as they are unable to reproduce cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, two important parameters that contribute to the regulation of drug accessibility and oxygen diffusion <i>in vivo.<\/i> To encompass those limitations and give access to a wider range of experimental methods we have generated three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models by taking advantage of LifeGel technology, consisting of protein-based hydrogels that modulate matrix density and stiffness to mimic the organ of origin-specific extracellular environment. Thanks to its versatility we successfully developed spheroid cultures from PDXDCs from various indications, including breast cancer cells from different histological subtypes. Tumor cells plated on LifeGel adopted 3D spheroid-like structures in a few days. These structures showed heterogeneous morphology and size depending on the tumor type and the hydrogel composition. As spheroids can be passaged <i>in vitro <\/i>by digestion, we could easily expand them and perform drug screening that will be presented and compared to 2D and <i>in vivo<\/i> results. The aim of this project is to develop a collection of PDX-derived spheroids recapitulating PDXs characteristics. This collection will give the opportunity to perform high-content drugs screening to select the best candidate drugs to be retained for further preclinical <i>in vivo<\/i> studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7d72ff57-585e-44f5-ae4f-5aeac2aa7061\/@v03B8ZMt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Spheroids,3D cell culture,3D models,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14413"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Agnieszka Pietrzyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilie Indersie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Deas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Gabriel Judde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcin Krzykawski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Stefano Cairo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Although well characterized ACC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) have proven to be a useful model to study disease mechanisms and therapeutic sensitives, animal drug studies are relatively low throughput, costly, and take months to accomplish. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> 3D cell culture can provide a high-throughput, less costly, and significantly faster platform for these drug studies but are hampered by the rarity of tissue. To address this unmet need for models of rare tumor types we developed 3D spheroid (3D-XPDX<sub>s<\/sub>&#8482;) and microtumor (3D-XPDX<sub>mt<\/sub>&#8482;) models of ACC using PDX as the primary tissue source. ACC PDX cells readily formed spheroids in our 3D-XPDX<sub>s<\/sub>&#8482; platform, remained viable for up to 14 days, and maintained disease-relevant biomarkers such as MYB and c-kit. 3D-XPDX<sub>mt<\/sub>&#8482; represent a more complex model of ACC by incorporating extracellular matrix. ACC 3D-XPDX<sub>mt<\/sub>&#8482; displayed tumor-like morphologies concordant with the parental tumors and exhibited MYB and c-kit biomarker expression for up to 56 days in culture. Drug response profiling (DRP) was performed using the 3D-XPDX<sub>s<\/sub>&#8482; ACC model with KIYATEC&#8217;s validated KIYA-PREDICT&#8482; DRP platform. The screening panel consisted of drugs and drug-like compounds currently in use or under investigation for use in ACC, including broad-spectrum chemotherapies and targeted agents. Individualized drug responses were noted for each model as they exhibited differential sensitivities to DNA-damaging agents, microtubule stabilizers, and c-kit targeting kinase inhibitors mirroring the diversity of clinical outcomes. KIYA-PREDICT&#8482; also identified drugs and drug-like compounds that uniformly inhibited viability. This is significant because there is currently no standard of care drugs for ACC, as few, if any have demonstrated homogenous responses in test populations. Monensin has been shown to inhibit activity of the MYB transcription factor, making it an attractive candidate drug for the treatment of ACCs which have a high prevalence of MYB activating alterations. In our study, monensin was effective in all three models with IC50 concentrations in the low micromolar range. These results correlate well with immunohistochemical staining of MYB in ACC 3D-XPDX<sub>s<\/sub>&#8482; and 3D-XPDX<sub>mt<\/sub>&#8482;. Taken together, this data represents a new <i>ex vivo<\/i> 3D cell culture platform for the study of ACC biology and potential therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e0d2cc0-8fa0-4eb4-ba5c-b2d01667e777\/@v03B8ZMt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),3D cell culture,Preclinical testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14414"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melissa Millard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa M.

Due to challenges associated with surgical removal, resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy, and highly invasive nature of the tumor, GBM typically recurs rapidly near the primary tumor site, and the only widely-used therapeutic agent against GBM, temozolomide (TMZ), is merely effective. Previously, we have shown that a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel platform can support addition of brain-mimetic molecules and formation of vascular networks to study GBM behavior. In this study, we assess GBM response to TMZ using a unique set of isogenically matched GBM cell lines (8MGBA-WT vs. 8MGBA-TMZres; 42MGBA-WT vs. 42MBGA-TMZres) that exhibit TMZ responsiveness (WT) or resistance (TMZres) along with disparate proliferative and invasive patterns in two-dimensional culture. This study seeks to define changes in invasion and proliferation in response to TMZ within three-dimensional gelatin hydrogels.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 8MGBA-WT, 8MGBA-TMZres, 42MGBA-WT, and 42MBGA-TMZres cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (100 &#956;M TMZ continuously applied to 8MGBA-TMZres). Cells were encapsulated in GelMA hydrogels and cultured for 8 days with daily media change. After 24 hours, TMZ doses between 0 - 500&#8239;&#956;M were applied to the gels and maintained for 7 days with daily media change. Growth rate inhibition (GR) statistics were determined after 7 days of culture. Relative cell count was assessed with the alamarBlue assay. GBM cell spheroids incapsulated in GelMA hydrogels were generated to measure relative invasion of wild type (WT) vs. TMZres lines. Spheroid outgrowth area was quantified with image analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We observed changes in proliferative and invasive phenotypes between the cell lines consistent with 2D cell culture. Notably, 42MGBA-TMZres cells exhibited proliferative advantage, while 8MGBA-TMZres exhibited invasive advantage. GR analysis revealed apparent differences between WT and TMZres lines with the following GR50 values: 41 &#956;M, 8MGBA-WT; 150 &#956;M, 8MGBA-TMZres; 77 &#956;M, 42MGBA-WT; 339 &#956;M, 42MGBA-TMZres. These results provide insight into potential common pathways between the &#8220;go&#8221; or &#8220;grow&#8221; phenotypes that can be used as therapeutic targets for GBM.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We have shown that a GelMA hydrogel platform can be used to assess GBM response to TMZ in 3D culture. This model provides insight into rapid tumor cell proliferation and diffusive local invasion. Further, this platform will be advanced to include a previously-developed model of GBM perivascular niche; this next-generation model will be used to benchmark the effect of perivascular niche on GBM therapeutic resistance and invasion. Hence, ongoing experiments aim to develop a vascularized hydrogel model of GBM to benchmark new TMZ variants hypothesized to overcome perivascular-induced resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2df81286-9f01-4d84-af94-0dd90fc481ca\/@v03B8ZMt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Temozolomide,Drug-discovery screen,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14415"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Viktoriia Kriuchkovskaia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brendan A.

The goal of our research is to use a three-dimensional in vitro model to acquire in-depth understanding of the unique environment of brain tumors to find new biomarkers of disease and develop more efficient therapeutic approaches. We are interested in revealing potential associations between common genetic tumor mutations and the capacity to remodel the extracellular microenvironment. The understanding of the multiple sources of tumor heterogeneity is crucial to improve current therapeutic approaches. Glioblastomas (GBM) present a very poor prognosis, they exhibit high infiltration into brain parenchyma, impairing surgical resection and leading to recurrence. Brain extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in glioblastoma invasion and therapeutic resistance. In particular, the aberrant biosynthesis of the main component of brain ECM, hyaluronic acid (HA), has been associated to pathological conditions (1). In this study, we investigate the influence of tumor extracellular HA in glioblastoma progression and resistance to a targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib). We have established engineered brain tumor biomaterials based on functionalized gelatin hydrogels decorated with covalently bound HA. This biomaterial approach can monitor the response of patient-derived xenograft cell populations with different molecular signatures in combination with microfluidic devices (2, 3). We have found that the combinatorial treatment of anti-CD44 and erlotinib show synergistic effect in some EGFR overexpressing tumors containing HA (2). Moreover, we can investigate the signaling mechanisms associated to these phenotypic alterations. Different signaling pathways are altered in the tumor cells depending on the microenvironment as they respond to an EGFR and CD44 inhibitor. While the decrease in invasion and proliferation in gelatin-only matrices comes from the negative regulation of ERK pathway, HA plays a favorable role in the inhibition of EGFR, through STAT3 deactivation (4). The MW and abundance of HA are mediated by the activity of HA synthases and hyaluronidases. HAS2 can produce very high molecular weight species and seems to play a significant role in cell invasion and cancer progression. In these HA-rich tumors we find a heterogeneous profile of MW distributions secreted by different tumor types, additionally we learnt that EGFR inhibition led to the secretion of high MW HA, associated to the upregulation of HAS2. We reveal here the importance of the tumor-associated HA biosynthesis as a mechanism of cancer cells to adapt to drug insults. The ability to manipulate tumor ECM can improve therapeutic outcomes and restrict glioblastoma growth and infiltration. (1) Monslow J. Front. Immunol. 2015; 6:231.(2) Pedron S. Adv.

Patient-derived cell-based 3D cancer models are highly valuable tools for cancer research and drug development. Primary tumor-derived models can recapitulate tumor heterogeneity and morphology, as well as complex genetic and molecular composition accelerating drug development and drug testing. However, the complexity of performing 3D assays remains a hurdle for adopting these methods for compound screening. In the present study we describe automation of imaging and cell culture methods that enables scaling up complex 3D cell-based assays and compound screening.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We developed an integrated workcell that includes a confocal imaging system, an automated CO<sub>2<\/sub> incubator, an automated liquid handler, and a Collaborative Robot combining different instruments. Workcell allows automation of compound testing, culture monitoring, and evaluation of phenotypic effects of drugs with high content imaging. Tumoroids were formed from primary cells isolated from a patient-derived tumor explant, TU-BcX-4IC, that represents metaplastic breast cancer with a triple-negative breast cancer subtype. Cells were expanded in 2D format, then tumoroids were formed by plating 2,000 cells per well in U-shape low attachment 384 plates. Tumoroids (200 &#956;m in diameter) were formed 48 hr after plating and were treated with 165 compounds of approved cancer drugs from the NCI library at multiple concentrations (10 nM to 100 &#956;M). Compound dilutions, additions, media additions, and staining were performed using liquid handler. During incubation with compounds, tumoroids were monitored daily using transmitted light imaging. For end point assay tumoroids were stained with viability dyes and imaged using automated confocal imaging system. Advanced image analysis included 3D reconstitution and complex phenotypic evaluation of tumoroids.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We characterized multiple quantitative descriptors that can be used for studying tumor phenotypes and compound effects including characterization of size and integrity, cell morphology and viability, as well as determining presence and expression levels for various cell markers. Concentration-dependent effects of numerous compounds were observed across multiple read-outs that indicate cytotoxic effects, with 8 compounds demonstrating effects at 10 nM (e.g, romidepsin, trametinib, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and panobinostat). These compounds include HDAC inhibitors and proteosome inhibitors.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We demonstrated methods for increased throughput and automation in 3D cancer assays and compound screening, and also analysis approaches and descriptors that provide information about cell phenotypes and compound effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f9e4785-8d23-47f6-999e-e20b34303d5e\/@v03B8ZMt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Breast cancer,Assay development,High-content screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14417"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Oksana Sirenko<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angeline Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Courtney K.

Predicting these parameters pre-clinically is essential to determine efficacious doses required in clinical treatment. The PK\/PD\/efficacy relationship has traditionally been characterized in xenograft models, owing to an absence of viable <i>in vitro<\/i> alternatives. However, murine\/human PK parameters can vary for many compounds. To explore PK\/PD\/efficiency relationships on 3D tumor models and organoids, we have developed a microphysiological system (MPS) able to mimic or reverse translate clinical\/<i>in vivo<\/i> drug exposure (PK) profiles on an <i>in vitro<\/i> system. The MPS can deliver up to two different drugs to tumor models in monotherapy or combinations, using customizable PK profiles and treatment schedules, by stepwise addition and removal of cell culture medium in a regular 24-well plate format. We first recapitulated the <i>in vivo<\/i> PK\/PD relationship for a PI3K inhibitor (BYL719- t<sub>1\/2<\/sub> 6 hours, equivalent to 50 mg\/kg murine oral dose), used to treat an A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma model. Following BYL719 exposure in the MPS device cellular p-AKT levels (biomarker of PI3K pathway activity) fell by up to 90%, but then recovered to pre-dosed levels over a 24-hour period as drug concentrations in the tumor reduce, as observed <i>in vivo<\/i>. This effect lacks in standard <i>in vitro <\/i>bolus experiments. Next, we explored whether the MPS could recapitulate <i>in vivo<\/i> effects of combining topoisomerase inhibitors with DNA-damage-response inhibitors (DDRi) in the treatment of colorectal tumors. Being almost non-toxic to normal cells, DDRi&#8217;s enhance DNA damage induced by topoisomerase inhibitors. 3D colorectal tumor models were treated by the MPS device for six days with monotherapy or combination therapy of the two compounds (SN38 Cmax = 20 nM, DDRi Cmax = 162 nM), recapitulating their <i>in vivo<\/i> PK profiles. Viability assays showed the benefits of combination therapy (viability 48.5% vs controls) over topoisomerase inhibitor monotherapy (viability 58.3% compared vs controls), with efficacy rates consistent with <i>in vivo<\/i> observations, rather than static 2D <i>in vitro<\/i> cultures which were over predictive. Overall, our MPS is able to accurately capture PK\/PD\/efficacy relationships using <i>in vitro<\/i> cultures. This approach will enable a greater understanding of drug properties and optimal treatment regimens to ultimately enable better design of clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/92fd2db4-7f2b-4074-a9cf-67250add7d21\/@v03B8ZMt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacodynamics,Microfluidics,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14419"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tudor Petreus<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomasz Kostrzewski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dharaminder Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Hughes<\/i><\/presenter>.

The clinical relevance of PDX thus offer several advantages over other commonly used tools such as cell lines and genetically modified mice. Many large collections of PDX have been developed across a wide range of tumor types that profile the genetic diversity of each disease and the ability to bank PDX material allows repeated generation of mice for <i>in vivo<\/i> drug screens. As a result, PDX are used in several parts of the drug development pipeline, including early cancer biology studies, biomarker development, evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, and assessing\/overcoming drug resistance. However, there remain drawbacks to this approach, most notably the large number of mice required for comprehensive drug screens and the associated time and costs. One approach to streamline PDX model selection and <i>in vivo<\/i> study execution would be to predict <i>in vivo<\/i> drug responses by assessing responses to the same drugs in an <i>ex vivo<\/i> platform utilizing PDX-derived dissociated tumor cells. KIYATEC&#8217;s KIYA-PREDICT&#8482; PDX assay is a 3D spheroid-based <i>ex vivo<\/i> platform that has been used to screen a wide range of drugs and tumor types to predict drug responses in primary patient-derived tumors and PDX-derived tumors, including several PDX from XenoSTART&#8217;s extensive library of XPDX models. Here, we dissociated XPDX-derived tumors from a panel of 20 breast, ovarian, and lung cancer models provided by XenoSTART and evaluated their <i>ex vivo<\/i> responses to a panel of chemotherapy agents in our 3D KIYA-PREDICT&#8482; assay. After exposure to drugs for 3-7 days, viability was assessed and both IC50s and percent survival values were calculated. The percent survival was then compared to <i>in vivo<\/i> drug response data provided by XenoSTART, and correlations between <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>ex vivo<\/i> data were assessed. Drug responses were highly correlative between <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models, including the ability to recapitulate palbociclib resistance and platinum and taxane response. These results indicate that the KIYA-PREDICT&#8482; PDX assay is a valuable tool to incorporate into drug development pipelines to accelerate the screening of new drug compounds on a wide range of clinically relevant samples and to guide selection of PDX models for <i>in vivo <\/i>studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b7a495c9-58bc-424c-9ee9-ac70f92eef51\/@v03B8ZMt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Ex vivo,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14420"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aaron L.

Some 3D assays are performed to study individual spheroids over time, where a majority of these assays rely on maintaining a single spheroid in each well of a 96-well round-bottom ultra-low attachment plate, limiting the number of spheroids in a study. Other assays may gather population-level data from large ensembles of spheroids grown together, but the information about individual differences amongst the spheroids is lost. Important kinetic information may also be lost for destructive endpoint assays such as MTS or MTT. Here, we describe the development of a 3D image cytometry assay that is capable of generating kinetic data for thousands of breast cancer spheroids at the individual level. T47D spheroids are grown and maintained in a 24-well Aggrewell<sup>TM<\/sup>400 plate and imaged using the Celigo image cytometer. Each well contains more than 1000 subwells that both aid in spheroid formation and constrain each spheroid to a specific location. Using the spheroid location data, we are able to track and monitor the growth of each spheroid over 7 days. Furthermore, we investigate the dose-dependent effects on spheroid viability of 6 anti-cancer drugs (Doxorubicin, Everolimus, Gemcitabine, Metformin, Paclitaxel and Tamoxifen) using calcein AM and propidium iodide (PI). To validate the viability measurement results, we utilize the CellTiter96&#174; MTS assay as an orthogonal method to compare the dose-dependent trends using both the calcein AM and PI fluorescence intensities as well as the spheroid sizes. This work may lay a foundation for the investigation of other spheroids, organoids, or tissue samples, significantly increasing the number of spheroids analyzed per condition, improving the statistical analysis, and adding more parameters to further analyze the spheroids.

For most tumors aerobic glycolysis is a major driver of cancer progression, resistance to therapy, poor patient outcome. Lactate, a product of glycolysis, plays a role in tumor progression and is linked to drug resistance in breast cancer. Patient-derived 3D cell models are valuable tools for research, drug development and personalized medicine, because they recapitulate features of tumor microenvironment. Therefore, monitoring metabolite dynamics and lactate production in physiologically relevant patient-derived models provides valuable data for understanding metabolic perturbations during disease progression, drug response and resistance. In this study we assayed the glucometabolic changes in response to anti-cancer drugs in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumoroids. Our approach utilizes an automated 3D assay system. The Pu&#183;MA system with microfluidic flowchips allows for <i>in situ<\/i> supernatant sampling, sensitive luminescence Lactate-Glo assay and high content imaging.<br \/>Methods: Tumoroids were formed in ULA plate from primary cells from a TNBC biopsy, TU-BcX-4IC (4IC). Single tumoroids were assayed in flowchips in the Pu&#183;MA system. The workflow comprised of a) measuring pre-treatment tumoroid viability with RT-Glo assay b) time-course automated supernatant sampling for measuring lactate using Lactate-Glo assay and c) post-treatment imaging of viability response for IC50 calculation.<br \/>Results: RT-Glo assay of 4IC tumoroids showed sufficient signal-to-background ratio of 44 and signal-to-noise ratio of 690. Before treatment, the coefficient of variation of signal from samples was 26% indicating high starting uniformity of tumoroid size and viability, which is important for the validity of the conclusions. Treatment of 4IC tumoroids for 48 hr with paclitaxel, romidepsin (HDAC1\/2 inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK1\/2 inhibitor) showed varying sensitivities to these drugs. IC<sub>50<\/sub> values for romidepsin and trametinib were ~10 nM, as compared to paclitaxel &#62;1 &#956;M, which is much greater than typically reported for breast cancer models. This is consistent with previously published taxane resistance of 4IC primary tumor. Tumoroid treatment of over 9 - 12 hr also resulted in statistically significant increase in lactate secretion for paclitaxel (p &#60; 0.05) and romidepsin (p &#60; 0.01) indicating drug-induced shift toward glycolysis.

However, cells grown in 2D cultures lack many of the structural, biological, and functional attributes of solid tumors, which contributes to the high clinical failure rates for biologic and small molecule drugs. Multicellular three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids are advanced models which more faithfully mimic the physiological tumor milieu and is more predictive of therapeutic efficacy than traditional monolayer cultures. However, the inability to generate and to analyze large numbers of intact spheroids with a simplified workflow remains a barrier in the adoption of 3D models for a wide range of applications. To overcome these barriers, we used the Velocyt&#174; large particle flow cytometer (Bennubio) to evaluate spheroid health in a well-established small molecule spheroid killing assay. The Velocyt technology rapidly and gently analyzes particles from 3 to 300 microns and comes with a suite of novel informatics tools purpose built for large particle analysis. To exemplify the use of large particle flow cytometry for the analysis of intact spheroids we generated uniformed-sized spheroids (~180 microns) from the H1650 human lung and HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines using microwell technology. Two to three days after spheroid generation, the spheroids were treated with increasing concentrations of staurosporine and other compounds. Spheroids were harvested at one to three days post treatment (depending on drug treatment) and stained with fluorescent cell viability and apoptotic dyes. Intact spheroids were analyzed for fluorescence and size using the Velocyt flow cytometer and between one and two thousand spheroids were assessed for each treatment in approximately three minutes. In untreated control spheroids, fluorescence was detected in a subpopulation of spheroids consistent with expected low levels of background apoptosis. In treated spheroids, an increase in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each particle indicated an increase in the number of non-viable and apoptotic cells in each spheroid. MFI increased nearly 6-fold with high concentrations of staurosporine compared to control spheroids, and dead cells were detected in nearly 100% of spheroids that were administered the highest staurosporine concentration. Using the size-based measurement parameters of the Velocyt, we also showed a decrease in overall spheroid size concurrent with increased numbers of spheroid fragments and single cells with increasing drug concentration. These data highlight that the use of 3D cell models combined with the Velocyt large particle flow cytometer is a powerful tool to help advance basic and translational cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/702b9ee7-0537-4395-97b4-6a18cd8191ff\/@w03B8ZMu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,Flow cytometry,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14424"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John P.

The NaviPlate contains a novel geometry to support the generation of cancer spheroids for robust and sensitive complex biological assays. Cells added to the NaviPlate spontaneously form spheroids, consistent with the cell line phenotype reported in the literature when using U-bottom multi-well formats. In addition, we have been able to perform assays such as cytotoxicity with a minimum number of 200 cells\/well, representing a 5-50-fold improvement on existing 3D cell culture assays.Using the NaviPlate, we examined the response to chemotherapy of four commonly used cancer cell lines: LNCaP, AR mutant lymph-node derived prostate cancer; A549, KRAS mutant\/EGFR wt NSCLC; HCT116, KRAS mutant\/p53 wt colon cancer; and MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer .First, the lines were exposed to three types of chemotherapy with distinct modes of action: 5-FU (DNA damage), Docetaxel (inhibition of microtubular polymerization) and Flavopiridiol (pan-CDK inhibition). Except for Flavopiridiol in A549 cells, all cell lines were resistant to chemotherapy, when grown in 3D, inside the NaviPlate. Furthermore, we were able to show that this resistance was dependent on the 3D formation of spheroids, as HCT116 cells exposed to chemotherapy before forming spheroids were still sensitive to treatment. Interestingly, in A549 cells, which form less tight spheroids, the effect of 3D clustering was less profound on the response to monotherapy. Lastly, we explored NaviPlate as a platform to identify best chemotherapy combination partners. We combined the three chemotherapies in all cell lines, with most combinations efficiently killing the spheroids. On note, the commonly used combination of 5-FU and Docetaxel had no statistically significant effect on the viability of either A549 or MDA-MB-231 cells.In conclusion, NaviPlate is an easy to use, cancer spheroid platform for the identification of chemotherapy combination partners and thus a useful tool for exploring personalized oncology approaches in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec93972d-57db-44b7-afdc-1b2669216e54\/@w03B8ZMu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-content screening,3D models,Chemotherapy,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14425"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elad Katz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maureen R.

Calcium transport and calcium channels regulate microcalcifications and are essential for breast cancer proliferation. The breast duct intraductal lumen, which is the origin of ductal carcinomas, has been shown to be a non-sterile environment. We hypothesize that the intraductal microbiome influences calcium handling and mineral deposition in breast cancer. Bacteria have been known to enhance the formation of mineral deposits, including calcium salts, in various non mammalian microenvironments via secreted factors or extracellular vesicle mediated nucleation. We performed a clinical study on a cohort of 150 women who received a suspicious mammogram and were subjected to a follow up biopsy, and we identified differences in calcium handling microbiota between patients who harbored a malignant disease with respect to benign controls. To mechanistically study the role of microbiota in breast cancer calcium handling, we developed a 3D spheroid model of ductal carcinoma in situ using the BT-474 cell line. When exposed to high concentrations of calcium in the culture medium (from 1.75 mM to 2.05 mM), spheroids developed calcium mineral deposits in a calcium dose dependent manner; deposits were identified in internal regions of the spheroid, which correspond to hypoxic areas of DCIS <i>in vivo<\/i>. Extracellular calcium deposition correlated with cell survival in face of a toxic calcium level. Spheroids were cultured under a continuous flow of <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus<\/i> LMS2-1-derived EVs over the course of two weeks. EVs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation; the 100K fraction was retained and characterized in terms of size, concentration, and protein content. EV treatment induced increased calcium export and mineral deposition in a dose dependent manner. Our findings support the hypothesis that <i>L. rhamnosus<\/i>-derived extracellular vesicles influence calcium regulation and mineral deposition in the hypoxic breast cancer milieu. More studies will be undertaken in the future to unveil molecular mechanisms that underlie this interaction, both at the cancer cell and the microbiota level.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2cc85d97-0439-46c1-8881-3696b8056861\/@w03B8ZMu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Spheroids,Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14427"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ngoc Bao Vuong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melany Alomia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Intisar Alruwaili<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fahad Alsaab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James L.

To better understand the genomic and phenotypic profiles of these models we analyzed Next Generation Sequencing data and phenotypic cell killing using a panel of FDA-approved agents. Our results showed that mRNA expression of several known cancer stem cell markers were upregulated in our PDCs in addition to multidrug resistance (MDR) genes. Drug resistance in the phenotypic assay was then correlated with stemness and MDR expression profiles. Finally, sequential PDCs (models developed from same patient at different stages in disease progression), in addition to PDCs developed from the same patient at multiple lesion sites, were compared in terms of genomic sequencing and drug responses.

Histologically, about 90% of the ovarian cancers have epithelial origin and more than 75% are characterized as high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Despite having a good primary response to the standard platinum-taxane based chemotherapy, almost all HGSOC patients experience a relapsed disease. The 5-year survival rate of ovarian cancer is only 38% globally, indicating need for the development of novel efficient treatments to fight the resistance. Here we have established a personalized drug screening and evaluation platform using HGSOC patient samples and medicines approved for treatment of different types of cancers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tissues collected from ovarian cancer patients were grown as 3-dimensional (3D) ex vivo long-term tumor organoid cultures. Seven HGSOC cell lines were additionally grown as spheroids or as xenograft tumors to establish them as 3D tumor organoid cultures for drug efficiency evaluation. Cancer stemness and further classification of samples were determined via immunofluorescent staining with relevant antibodies (pax8, Ki67, acetylated tubulin, p53, cytokeratin-8) and consequent high-throughput imaging using the ImageXpress Micro Confocal microscope (Molecular Devices). The images were analyzed and quantified using MetaXpress software. Organoid growth and response to tested treatments was validated via invasive growth and survival assays. Both assays were used to monitor resistance of organoids towards cisplatin and carboplatin treatment and towards suggested potential new treatments. Cancer drugs were selected according to suggestions based on RNA seq, DNA and\/or drug screenings done in cancer cell lines. A preclinical mouse model (in immunodeficient NOD\/Shi-scid\/IL-2R&#947;null (NOG) mice) was set up to be used for in vivo validation by monitoring the tumor growth in response to the treatment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Currently, 20 patient tumor samples received from Turku University Hospital, Finland (KH, JH) have been cultured in 4 different culture media to obtain highest possible survival rates for each sample. Organoids from ovarian cancer cell lines are characterized for their resistance to increasing concentrations of platinum treatment. Notably, organoid analysis protocols and screening conditions have been setup for the high-throughput microscopy. These include organoid growth, survival, and invasiveness\/ aggressiveness.

Bubble-assisted Focused Ultrasound (BAFUS) has proven effective in opening the BBB for treatment of glial tumors in adults and pediatric cases. BAFUS has been previously shown to disrupt noninvasively, selectively, and transiently the BBB in small animals in vivo. However, there is a lack of an in vitro preclinical model suitable for testing the genetic determinants of endothelial cell tight junction integrity and vulnerability to the physical disruption. Our BBB organ-on-chip platform will enable precision medicine of brain cancers through identifying patient-specific parameters by which to open the BBB allowing use of drugs and drug combinations otherwise unsuitable. We intend to sequence these in vitro models to verify that the genotype (alleles\/SNPs) of tight junction proteins contribute to BBB structure and integrity. To initiate this effort, we report the development of an ultrasound transparent organ-on-chip model populated by iPSC-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-EC) co-cultured with astrocytes. Western blot, immunocytochemistry, permeability, and transelectrical endothelial resistance (TEER) studies all convey expression of key EC proteins and marked barrier integrity. Further benchmarking of device-ultrasound interactions, successful iPSC differentiation, tight junction formation, and fabrication of nanobubbles and their assistance in ultrasound BBB disruption will be presented. Efforts are underway to analyze nine characteristic BBB tight junction genes from WGS data to determine associations between iPSC-EC genotype and phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f106369-3e0b-407f-b630-19faf8212022\/@w03B8ZMu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Blood-brain barrier,Tight junctions,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14434"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jayashree Iyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Akkad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nanyun Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sen Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Berens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederic Zenhausern<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Gu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Breast cancer patient microbiome analysis has demonstrated a correlation between dysbiosis and disease with proposed mechanisms including immune cell regulation, enhanced inflammatory signaling, and modulation of estrogen metabolism through the estrobolome. Current models lack the ability to study communication in one direction or to modulate single variables such as bacterial species or xenobiotic additions without the use of mouse models which suffer from poor translation and assessment opportunities. We have developed two microfluidic chips, one to model the gut microbiome using oxygen impermeable plastic for maintenance of anaerobic bacteria and another to culture breast cancer spheroids under constant flow. Current work has demonstrated viability and polarity maintenance in chip-cultured spheroids and initial development of polarized villus-like gut epithelium. Using these two chips, we will study the impact of breast cancer associated bacteria capable of estrogen metabolism on breast cancer tumorigenic potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82edd6ac-f086-418d-b234-4f784e02953a\/@w03B8ZMu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microfluidics,Microbiome,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14435"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Danielle S.

Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) cell model derivation is one of the CCLFs focus because it lacks well-characterized, publicly available models.Two major barriers existed in deriving NET cell models, including how to collect sufficient patient tumor tissue samples for the model derivation pilot and how to systematically iterate model derivation strategies since there is no prior knowledge for NET cell model generation success. Thus, we partnered with the MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Rare Cancer Research Foundation to collect patient tissue samples. All patient&#8217;s NET tissues were sequenced with a targeted Pan-Cancer panel to ensure high tumor content. To reduce fibroblast outgrowth, we combined an empirical rich media matrix (HYBRID technology) with a 3D spheroid culture system to initiate one sample in 16-64 conditions. The growing cultures at passage 3-5 were genomically credentialed to ensure the driver events matched with the original patient tissue. So far, we have received more than 70 NET samples. While several derived models are still under culture, we successfully generated 5 genomically verified NET tumor models, including small intestinal, pancreas, and liver subtypes. To phenotypically characterize these NET models, neuroendocrine biomarkers such as chromogranin A, synaptophysin, SSTR2, and VMAT 1\/2 were also evaluated using qRT-PCR and ELISA. We observed that these NET spheroid models display long doubling times (2-4 weeks) at later passages which limits their utility for large scale perturbation experiments and model sharing capability with the research community. While we are currently working on several strategies to improve the propagation ability in these models, 1 (out of 5) model has reached passage 15 with a 3 day doubling time. Genomic studies, such as RNAseq, will be performed to address the model transcriptome changes after overcoming growth plateaus. Here we showed that it is feasible to derive NET models from patient biospecimens using our HYBRID strategy. As we expand our NET cohort, we will further refine disease-specific model generation protocols for different NET types. Our goal is to share our model generation experience and make these tumor cell models publicly available to the research community in order to accelerate cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4423f375-5469-4282-a571-44cbf5edc612\/@w03B8ZMu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Cancer cell,3D models,Pancreas,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14436"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adel Attari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madison Liistro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Van Hare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Coleman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Heffernan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bianca Amador<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Meyerson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Boehm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Sellers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuen-Yi (Moony) Tseng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Angiosarcomas are aggressive and highly metastatic, resulting in a poor prognosis. Recurrent somatic mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> and genes involved in PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway such as <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>PIK3R1<\/i> are identified in angiosarcomas. However, angiosarcomas are genomically complex, and the oncogenic mechanisms are virtually unknown. Due to its rarity, establishment of experimental tumor models is an unmet need for angiosarcoma research. In this study, we used human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to develop a novel, reliable model for angiosarcoma recapitulating the genomic complexity and the tumor immune landscape. Specifically, we induced <i>TP53<\/i> mutations in human iPSCs using CRISPR\/Cas9 with validation of p53 deficiency by gene sequencing and Western blotting. We then established protocols to differentiate genetically engineered iPSCs to mesoderm and subsequently bi-potential hemangioblasts, which are considered the putative cell-of-origin of angiosarcoma. We found that isogenic wild-type (WT) and <i>TP53<\/i> mutant iPSCs were capable of generating hemangioblasts, with no significant differences in morphology or growth patterns observed between WT and mutant cells. Putative iPSC-derived hemangioblasts were CD34+ by flow cytometry and contained primitive endothelial cells with the capacity to form tube-like structures in Matrigel. RNA-seq data libraries were generated to profile global gene expression in non-differentiated cells, mesodermal precursors, hemangioblasts, and endothelial cells derived from WT and p53 mutant iPSCs during differentiation over time (day 0, 2, 5, 8). Principal component analysis revealed that gene expression patterns were altered between WT and p53 mutant cells during differentiation, representing distinct gene signatures unique to each cell type. Intriguingly, transcriptomic alteration of p53 mutant iPSC-derived cells was more variable than that of WT. Our data also showed that p53 mutation induced dysregulation of genes associated with chromosome maintenance, extracellular matrix organization, hemostasis, and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in iPSC-derived hemangioblasts when compared isogenic WT controls. Our data highlights the role that mutant p53 plays in the induction of genomic instability and transcriptional programs that regulate hemogenic and endothelial function during differentiation. Additionally, ATAC-seq data were generated from WT and p53 mutant iPSC-derived cells to determine chromatin accessibility dynamics and identify key transcription factors that activate convergent vascular tumorigenic pathways. We are currently generating iPSC harboring co-mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> in order to determine the phenotype and tumorigenic capacity of engineered iPSC-derived hemangioblasts in xenograft models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fb287e2d-33ca-4af5-80e3-89a332fadcb4\/@w03B8ZMu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,CRISPR\/Cas9,Induced pluripotent stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14496"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sophia Wenthe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelsie Becklin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brett Napiwocki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Kozurek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Branden Moriarity<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jong Hyuk Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

MCL respond relatively briefly to conventional chemotherapy and are characterized by frequent relapses (Dreyling et al., Ann Oncol, 2017). Therapy for MCL remains a challenge also due to limited cultivation time of primary cells. <i>In vitro<\/i> suspension culture of primary human MCL cells is not easily feasible (Bryant et al., Lab Invest, 2000) and cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis <i>ex<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i> (Zhang et al., Blood, 2012; Medina et al., Heamatologica, 2012). Useful <i>in vitro<\/i> MCL models that allow long-term culture of primary MCL cells could be helpful in the biological and therapeutic study of MCL. For this purpose, we established a 3D hydrogel culture model for cultivation of primary MCL cells that were first tested with cell lines. After 3 days of culture, the cells cultured in the hydrogel can successfully be analysed for cell viability (live-dead confocal laser scanning microscope-based assay, flow cytometry), metabolism (pH, glucose, lactate), and biomarker expression by immunohistochemistry. The 3D hydrogel cultivation model allows a variety of analytical methods, also because it is reversible and the cells can easily be separated as single cell suspension from hydrogel for further analytical purposes, such as flow cytometric analyses. Next, we cultured primary MCL cells in the alginate hydrogel 3D culture system. MCL cells were isolated from blood of different patients and separated by Ficoll centrifugation. The isolated cell population was identified as MCL cells by double-staining of anti-CD20 and anti-CD5 followed by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were further cultured in medium as conventional suspension culture or in alginate hydrogel as 3D culture. Cell death was assessed with AnnexinV by staining phospholipids of apoptotic cells, allowing flow cytometric quantification. All samples had less than 6% AnnexinV positive (+) cells at day 0 before the experiment started. After 2 days cultivation, primary MCL cells showed a strong induction of cell death in suspension culture with 65.5% (&#177;4.2%) AnnexinV+ cells versus 21.9% (&#177;0.6%) AnnexinV+ cells in 3D hydrogel culture. Subsequently after 3 days cultivation, 74.2% (&#177;12.2%) AnnexinV+ cells in suspension versus 33.5% (&#177;1.3%) AnnexinV+ cells in the hydrogel 3D culture were determined. Therefore, we conclude that our novel 3D culture system might be a more suitable cultivation method for primary MCL cells than conventional suspension culture in cell culture medium. We have developed a 3D cultivation system with alginate hydrogel that allows nearly tripling the <i>in vitro<\/i> cultivation time of primary MCL. This could pave the way for new long-term treatments in research in the future and serve a better understanding of the cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a988411-12d4-4c48-b8a8-17dce1c37c13\/@w03B8ZMu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mantle cell lymphoma,3D models,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14497"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kathrin Böpple<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annette M.

To address these issue, we are introducing our novel platform technology- Microtube Array Membrane-Hollow Fiber Assay (MTAM-HFA) that is based on combination of the patented MTAM membrane with unique microstructures; replacing the role of traditional hollow fibers enabled the entire HFA assay to be significantly improved in terms of clinical relevance, accuracy, reliability and cost resulting in unprecedented value propositions as an anti-cancer drug screening platform. In the current work, we have clinically demonstrated in several cases where the MTAM-HFA system is capable of accurately predicting clinical response in several Cancers-Lung, Breast and Colon cancers; with unprecedented flexibility of being screened against multiple drug class (including anti-PD1\/PDL1) in monotherapy and combination therapy settings. Despite being a phenotypic based assay, the test cycle of MTAM-HFA is only 7-10 days while maintaining a very low cost of up to 60% savings when compared to traditional models such as Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX). When screening ICBs, without the need to use Genetically Engineered Mice (GEM) translates to a cost savings of 98% just for the animal model alone. The combined value proposition of MTAM-HFA makes is a suitable system fulfilling the needs of multiple stakeholders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/34878aff-e66a-448d-8200-79533338c232\/@x03B8ZMv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Personalized medicine,Drug discovery,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14500"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Wan-Ting Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chee Ho Chew<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kang-Yuan Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsing-Lun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Po-Hao Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeng-Fong Chiou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kuan-Chou Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Po-Li Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Chien-Chung Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
