[{"Abstract":"Oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds) are getting much attention as cancer immunotherapy agents. Almost all OAds are based on human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) (OAd5). However, OAd5 has several drawbacks which possibly attenuate the anti-tumor effects of OAd5. More than 80% of adults have neutralizing antibodies against Ad5. The expression of coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR), which is the primary infection receptor of Ad5, often declines on malignant tumor cells. Previously, we have developed a novel OAd fully composed of human adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35) (OAd35) (Ono <i>et al.<\/i>, <b><i>Mol.Ther.Oncolytics<\/i><\/b><i>,<\/i> 2021). Only 20% or fewer adults have neutralizing antibodies against Ad35. Ad35 recognizes CD46, which is highly expressed on malignant tumor cells, as an infection receptor. OAd35 showed efficient tumor cell lysis activities in many types of tumor cells; however, the mechanism of anti-tumor effects of OAd35 remains to be fully evaluated. In this study, we examined the mechanism of anti-tumor effects of OAd35. Although OAd35 showed efficient tumor growth suppression at levels comparable to OAd5 following intratumoral administration in nude mice bearing H1299 human lung cancer xenografts, the genome copy numbers of OAd35 in the tumor were about 500-folds lower than those of OAd5 at 18 days after administration and were almost background levels. These data suggest that other mechanisms different from infection of tumor cells with OAd35 were involved in the anti-tumor effects of OAd35. Since previous studies reported that Ad35 efficiently activated innate immunity in natural killer (NK) cells, we examined whether OAd35-mediated activation of NK cells contributed to the anti-tumor effects of OAd35. Intratumoral administration of OAd35 resulted in efficient infiltration and activation of NK cells in H1299 tumors. In contrast, OAd5 did not apparently induce the infiltration and activation of NK cells in the tumors. OAd35-mediated activation and infiltration of NK cells were also found in B16 tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice. Next, in order to examine the roles of NK cells in the anti-tumor effects of OAd35, NK cells were depleted by intravenous injection of anti-GM1 antibody in nude mice, followed by intratumoral administration of OAd35. The depletion of NK cells significantly attenuated the anti-tumor effects of OAd35 on H1299 tumors. Furthermore, pretreatment with anti-GM1 antibody significantly increased the genome copy numbers of OAd35 in the tumor, suggesting that activated NK cells removed the OAd35-infected tumor cells. This study demonstrated that OAd35 significantly activated NK cells following intratumoral administration and that activated NK cells efficiently removed the tumor cells, leading to efficient tumor growth suppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/307e6220-c2c3-48bb-bbc2-c4dd9c8db9dc\/@z03B8ZGq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,Nude mice,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16975"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryosuke Ono<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kosuke Takayama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fuminori Sakurai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroyuki Mizuguchi<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, significant challenges remain in the accurate prediction of neoepitopes and the efficient delivery of the vaccine components for eliciting potent antitumor T cell responses. To overcome these challenges, we have developed novel vaccine platform designated BP1209, which is characterized by being composed of neoantigen peptides that contain a high affinity binding motif for human antibodies.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We developed vaccine with enhanced efficacy designed to form a complex with checkpoint antibodies. The vaccine instantly assembles a divalent peptide-antibody complex by simply mixing with therapeutic antibodies in physiological condition. We evaluated the efficacy of BP1209 vaccine in combination with DC-targeting antibodies <i>in vivo<\/i>. Next, we generated a series of neoantigen peptides in both murine and human origins using in-house bioinformatic algorithms and evaluated the advantages of BP1209 vaccine.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>BP1209 vaccine showed robust T-cell response and anti-tumor activity when combined with anti-CD40 agonistic antibody or atezolizumab compared with a control peptide vaccine or the antibody alone. Treatment of BP1209 murine neoantigen vaccine to syngeneic tumor bearing mice exhibited robust anti-tumor response resulting in complete tumor regression in therapeutic setting. Preclinical evaluation of neoantigen vaccines from murine and human tumors showed notably increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell response even for epitopes that do not respond with a conventional long peptide vaccine. Further analysis of DCs and T cells induced by BP1209 suggested that peptide delivery was mediated by increased cross-presentation of epitope peptides on DCs supported by DC maturation by the checkpoint antibody and increased vaccine peptide uptake by the antibody mediating peptide delivery. TCR repertoire analysis of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of vaccinated mice revealed remarkable accumulation of clonal CTLs in the BP1209 vaccinated group.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>BP1209 cancer vaccine dramatically improves T-cell response and anti-tumor activity over conventional long-peptide vaccines. We demonstrated that the enhancement of vaccine potency was achieved not only by the function of the antibodies on DCs but mainly by the increased antigen delivery to DCs. Enhanced T-cell response was more remarkable in CD8+ T cells, especially in clonal expansion of the CTL in TILs, suggesting that BP1209 vaccine facilitates antigen cross-presentation and inducing functional CTLs. Analysis using a number of predicted neoantigen peptides showed that the BP1209 vaccine enhances the vaccine efficacy independent of epitope sequences. Thus, our new platform of cancer vaccines provides a critical solution to enhance personalized neoantigen vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/faee51b4-20a2-413a-a3a7-ae9eb89f0fda\/@z03B8ZGq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Vaccines,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16976"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuji Mishima<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fumiko Isoda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noriko Matsumoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noriko Watanabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazushi Hiranuka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Yamada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norihiro Fujinami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manami Shimomura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshihiro Suzuki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tetsuya Nakatsura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norihiro Nakamura<\/i><\/presenter>.

Soluble multimeric forms of CD40L (sCD40L) act as an effective adjuvant to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. We previously developed a Her2\/Neu-LAMP DNA vaccine based on our proprietary UNITE<sup>TM<\/sup> (UNiversal Intracellular Targeted Expression) platform, which fuses a tumor-associated antigen with lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1). To increase T cell responses induced by this vaccine, we developed a bicistronic DNA construct in which both the tumor antigen (Her2) fused with LAMP and sCD40L were expressed separately. Secretion of CD40L was confirmed by transient transfection of 293T cells with plasmid DNA followed by ELISA for sCD40L in the cell culture supernatant. Intradermal vaccination of mice with bicistronic Her2-LAMP-sCD40L elicited significantly enhanced Her2-specific T cell and antibody responses compared with mice immunized with Her2-LAMP DNA. Intracellular staining revealed that inclusion of sCD40L in the vaccine induced potent antigen specific T cell IFN&#947; production, primarily in CD4 T cells. Furthermore, in a murine TSA breast cancer model, Her2-LAMP-sCD40L significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival in a therapeutic vaccine setting, suggesting that this novel bicistronic vaccine is an effective strategy to promote anti-tumor efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>. Ongoing studies are aimed at exploring vaccine-induced changes within the tumor microenvironment, including cytokine profiles, expression of PD-1\/PD-L1, and effect on myeloid derived suppressor cells and NK cells. This new approach in bicistronic DNA vaccine design using the UNITE<sup>TM<\/sup> platform may provide future therapeutic benefit for multiple Her2-expressing cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03d675ca-38c6-4470-a61c-5979c74b7a95\/@A03B8ZGr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2\/neu,sCD40L,LAMP,DNA vaccine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16978"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wei Shen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renhuan Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun-Ting Kao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohan Karkada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teri Heiland<\/i><\/presenter>.

For metastatic, unresectable or recurrent (m\/uR) HNSCC, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) was recently approved as a novel therapeutic option showing significant survival benefits compared to standard chemotherapy-based treatment. However, response to ICI is still limited to a small number of patients calling for further improvement of T cell-based immunotherapies. Peptide-based approaches, which rely on the specific immune recognition of tumor-associated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presented peptides, represent promising and low side effect treatment options. Peptide vaccination has been shown to enhance and induce long-term anti-tumoral immune responses and even clinical responses in HNSCC patients. However, current vaccines are either monovalent, based on patient-individual tumor-specific mutations or restricted to a single HLA allotype and therefore neither widely applicable nor suitable for reliable studies and large-scale production. In this study, using mass spectrometry (MS) -based immunopeptidome analysis of a large cohort of HNSCC patient (n = 30) tumor and adjacent benign samples, we established a tumor-associated off-the-shelf peptide warehouse for broadly applicable personalized therapies. The malignant dataset, comprising 91651 HLA ligands, was compared to adjacent benign and various benign tissues (www.hla-ligand-atlas.org) to identify tumor-exclusive antigens. Further antigen selection was based on allotype-specific high frequent presentation. In total, 23 frequently presented and tumor-exclusive HNSCC-associated peptides were selected for six of the most common HLA class I allotypes (A*01, A*02, A*24, B*15, B*35, B*40) covering &#62;75 % of the world population, as well as five HLA class II presented peptides binding various different HLA class II allotypes. Immunogenicity was validated by IFN-&#947; ELISPOT screening for spontaneous preexisting T cell responses targeting the respective peptides as well as by <i>in vitro<\/i> priming experiments of na&#239;ve T cells in HNSCC patients and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, immunopeptidome analyses identified these antigens in patient plasma samples providing first evidence for &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221; immunopeptidome analysis without the need of primary tumor tissue. A phase I study evaluating safety, immunogenicity as well as first efficacy of this warehouse-based vaccine in combination with ICI in HNSCC patients is currently being set up, with personalized peptide selection based on individual HLA-allotype and MS analysis of patient tumor\/plasma sample. In conclusion, we here designed a peptide warehouse that enables a polyvalent and widely applicable but still personalized peptide vaccination in HNSCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e999e7ee-27fe-4c19-99b1-d2bc04acf957\/@A03B8ZGr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Mass spectrometry,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16980"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Schroeder<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thorben Gross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annika Nelde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcel Wacker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jens Bauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Rieth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marissa Dubbelaar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lena Muehlenbruch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yacine Maringer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul-Stefan Mauz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Sailer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Philipp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sven Becker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Breuer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helmut R.

However, up to 30% of patients experience recurrence that frequently leads to the development of metastatic disease associated with poor outcome. Therefore, novel, effective and low-side effect treatment options are essential, in particular for elderly and frail prostate cancer patients not eligible for intense therapy. Whereas, immune checkpoint inhibitors showed limited efficacy in prostate cancer so far, targeted T cell-based approaches with bispecific antibodies and cancer vaccines achieved promising results in this tumor entity. In this study, we established a prostate-associated off-the-shelf peptide warehouse, using mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidome analysis of a large cohort of primary prostate tissue (n = 51), for the development of a broadly applicable personalized vaccine.<br \/>The prostate dataset (23 prostate cancer, 12 adjacent benign, 16 benign prostate samples) comprising 29,893 HLA class I and II molecules, was compared to the immunopeptidomes of various benign non-prostate tissues (HLA-Ligand Atlas) to identify prostate exclusive antigens. Further antigen selection was based on the high presentation frequency. In total, 30 frequently expressed and prostate exclusive HLA class I peptides restricted to the six common allotypes HLA-A*02, -A*03, -A*24, -B*07, -B*08 and -B*40, covering more than 76 % of the world population for at least one allotype, and five promiscuous HLA-DR restricted peptides found in up to 37% of prostates were selected. Immunogenicity was validated by IFN&#947; ELISPOT screening for preexisting T cell responses, as well as by <i>in vitro<\/i> priming experiments of na&#239;ve T cells in prostate cancer patients and healthy volunteers. The peptide warehouse will enable the formulation of personalized vaccines based on individual HLA allotype and immunopeptidome analysis of patient&#8217;s tumor samples in a reasonable time and cost frame within large cohort studies.<br \/>We provided first evidence for the feasibility of this approach by designing a personalized immunopeptidome-guided peptide vaccine for a patient with metastatic prostate cancer. The vaccine was adjuvanted with the toll-like receptor 1\/2 agonist XS15 emulsified in Montanide<sup>TM<\/sup> ISA51 VG and applied three times within a 12-week interval. Induction of a profound T cell response targeting 7\/9 (78%) vaccine<sub> <\/sub>peptides was observed one week after the second vaccination. T cell responses have been persisting for almost two years in the patient, and in combination with androgen deprivation therapy enabled persistent PSA remission. In conclusion, we designed an immunopeptidomics-guided peptide warehouse and provided first evidence for its personalized application in prostate cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/20e290d9-1a61-4283-9731-98f528f30592\/@A03B8ZGr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Immunotherapy,Peptides,Mass spectrometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16981"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yacine Maringer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lena Freudenmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annika Nelde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas S.

SV-BR-1-GM has been in clinical trials in a regimen including low-dose pre-dose cyclophosphamide to reduce immune suppression, and post-dose local interferon alpha to boost the immune response. The SV-BR-1-GM regimen has been administered alone or in combination with PD-1 inhibitors in patients with advanced breast cancer. We have noted that patients that match the SV-BR-1-GM cell line at least at 1 HLA allele are more likely to derive clinical benefit. Therefore, steps were taken to genetically modify the SV-BR-1 cell line to match more patients.<br \/><b>Methodology:<\/b> We focused on the least polymorphic HLA types in the population: HLA-A (Class I) and HLA-DRB3\/4\/5 (Class II). The published allele frequencies (Gragert 2013) for HLA-A and HLA-DRB3\/4\/5 were evaluated for the major demographic groups in the US. The following HLA alleles were selected: A*02:01, A*01:01, A*03:01, A*24:02, A*11:01, A*68:01, A*23:01, A*33:03 for Class I and DRB4*01:01, DRB3*02:02, DRB3*01:01, DRB5*01:01, DRB3*03:01, DRB5*01:02, DRB5*02:02 for HLA-DRB3\/4\/5. Based on population analysis, this combination of alleles should produce at least a single match in~ 99% of the population, with a ~92% match at Class I HLA-A alleles and a ~98% match at Class II HLA-DRB3\/4\/5 alleles. SV-BR-1 was modified using CRISPR technology deleting expression of the endogenous HLA-A and HLA-DRB3 alleles. Four lentiviral vectors were constructed to express the HLA alleles, along with the CSF2 gene (which encodes GM-CSF), using a 2A self-cleaving multi-gene expression system. Each lentiviral vector expressed 4 HLA types: 2 HLA-A and 2 HLA-DRB3\/4\/5 types.<br \/><b>Preliminary Data:<\/b> Following sequential CRISPR treatment, the SV-BR-1 cells were cloned, and one clone selected (clone 17) for further engineering. Lack of expression of HLA-A and HLA-DRB3 was confirmed using flow cytometry, and DNA sequencing. Clone 17 was subsequently transduced separately with the four lentiviral vectors each expressing four HLA genes as well as the CSF2 gene. Following selection and cloning, clones were evaluated by ELISA, flow cytometry and RT-PCR to confirm gene expression. Several clones that secreted GM-CSF and expressed both Class I and Class II HLA alleles have subsequently been transferred to GMP manufacturing. These modified breast cancer cell lines will be used in clinical studies designed to first evaluate the safety of intradermal inoculation with the irradiated cells and later combined with other agents to augment the immune response. Each patient will be treated with the cell line that matches them at least at one HLA allele.<br \/>Gragert L, et. al. <i>Hum Immunol. <\/i>2013;74(10):1313-1320.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cb7a8457-510c-498c-8b77-988f63eada99\/@A03B8ZGr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Immuno-oncology,Breast cancer,HLA class I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16982"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William V.

Yet, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to therapy. More specifically, failure of ICB has been linked to the absence of an anti-tumor immune response that can be boosted or revitalized. Cancer vaccines that are designed to elicit such response by educating the host immune system to recognize tumor antigens, are therefore considered a key next generation therapeutic modality for the treatment of human cancers.<br \/>Various vaccine platforms have been developed over the years, but recent advances in delivery technologies combined with the intrinsic qualities of the DNA matrix have positioned DNA vaccines as a safe and flexible alternative to other types of vaccine technologies. Vaccibody is developing DNA vaccines that allows specific targeting of tumors antigens to Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs), thus maximizing the elicited immune response.<br \/>Here we present a second-generation version of our DNA platform in which our vaccibody molecule can be co-expressed with immune-stimulatory proteins from one plasmid using a multicistronic design. Compared to the vaccibody molecule alone the simultaneous expression of selected immune stimulatory cytokines was shown to boost the overall immune response almost 3-fold to drive a potent anti-tumor response.<br \/>These data demonstrate the flexibility and potential of DNA vaccines as well as the advantages of combining an APC targeted delivery of tumor specific antigens together with a local production of immune stimulatory proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/228bb562-98cb-4f03-8056-a480a54660ee\/@A03B8ZGr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,DNA vaccine,Immunocytokines,Adjuvant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16983"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Audun Beraas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Pierre Dillard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Jing Wen Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Winther Wold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eirik Solbakken<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linn Guro Oslen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joel Benjamin Heim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stalin Chellappa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agnete Fredriksen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikkel Wandahl Pedersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stine Granum<\/i><\/presenter>.

Infection of cancer cells with oncolytic viruses reshapes the tumor microenvironment by activating anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity. A phase 1 clinical trial using oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGD (DNX-2401) to treat recurrent malignant gliomas demonstrated activation of CD8+ T-cells and significant clinical benefits for a subset of patients. However, both anti-virus and anti-tumor immune responses are contingent on the activation of respective clones of CD8+ T-cells, which compete for clonal expansion. Thus, overexpansion of T-cells against viral antigens reduces the frequency of subdominant clones against tumor antigens. We hypothesized that inducing immune tolerance for viral antigens will decrease anti-viral immunity and in turn derepress anti-tumor immunity, resulting in enhanced efficacy of cancer virotherapy. In this work, we used nanoparticles encapsulating adenoviral antigens E1A, E1B and hexon that distributed to liver resident macrophages (P&#60;0.0001) and induced peripheral immune tolerance. Functional experiments to restimulate immune cells with viral or tumor antigens showed that injection of nanoparticles induced virus-specific immune tolerance and redirected the focus of the immune response towards tumor peptides as measured by interferon-gamma secretion (P&#60;0.0001). Co-culture experiments also showed increased activation of immune cells against fixed tumor cells after nanoparticle treatment (P&#60;0.0001). Reduction of virus-specific T-cells and concurrent expansion of tumor-specific T-cell clones were further confirmed with E1A or OVA tetramers (P&#60;0.05). Flow cytometry analysis suggested increased anti-tumor responses were due to differences in T-cell clones and not due to other immune populations including natural killer cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (P=0.3). Importantly, virotherapy in combination with nanoparticle-induced immune tolerance towards viral antigens in tumor-bearing mice increased the overall survival and doubled the percentage of long-term survivors compared to virus treatment alone. Our data should propel the development of a future clinical trial aiming to maximize the potential of anti-tumor immunity during cancer virotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4927a8b6-c4c8-40d6-8e1b-277f2150b229\/@A03B8ZGr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Oncolytic adenovirus,Immuno-oncology,Immune tolerance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16984"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c41fcc31-8136-4eb9-9594-a980e3bdb384","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c41fcc31-8136-4eb9-9594-a980e3bdb384\/@A03B8ZGr\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dong Ho Shin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Debora Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa T.

The pan-cancer-specific oncolytic potency of NOV was confirmed in various human and mouse cancer cell lines (colon, lung, liver, pancreas, cholangiocarcinoma, cervical cancer, osteosarcoma, and melanoma). Vaccinia virus (VV) treatment directly induced early apoptosis in tumors within 24 h, and this effect was enhanced with further engineering; VGF and Tk deletion with Ang1 and TRAIL insertion. Meanwhile, treatment with the conventional anti-cancer drug cisplatin did not induce apoptosis. A virus-treated mouse colon\/lung cancer syngeneic model showed attenuated tumor growth, which was in accordance with the results of percent survival measurement, CD8 expression analysis, and TUNEL staining with advanced genetic engineering.

Central is the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) capable of presenting tumor antigens to T cells that can expand and kill tumor cells. However, the tumor is a harsh environment for the adaptive immune system and many of the conditions needed for the establishment of an immune response are lacking. Oncolytic viral therapy presents an opportunity to overcome the immunosuppression in tumors by destroying tumor cells, releasing antigens and immunostimulatory factors. The effects of the oncolytic virus can be further amplified by the introduction of transgenes expressed by the virus. LOAd oncolytic adenoviruses belong to a platform of Ad5\/35 adenoviruses that have replication restricted to tumor cells. The viruses express human immunostimulatory transgenes under a CMV promotor that enables expression in all infected cells. LOAd703, encoding trimerized (TMZ)-CD40L and 4-1BBL, is under clinical investigation in solid tumors. Herein we present the data from the investigation of our novel oncolytic adenovirus LOAd732 that encodes for three human transgenes; TMZ-CD40L, 4-1BBL and IL-2. Infection of the human cell lines Mel526 and Mel624 with LOAd732 led to cell killing as was evaluated by MTS viability assay and to expression of the transgenes, TMZ-CD40L, 4-1BBL and IL-2 evaluated by flow cytometry and ELISA. Moreover the immmunostimulatory function of LOAd732 was investigated by infecting immature dendritic cells, differentiated from CD14+ monocytes using GM-CSF and IL-4. Flow cytometry assay revealed that DCs infected with LOAd732 showed a mature profile with expression of activation markers and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD83, CD86, CD70, ICAM-1, and MHC molecules. Analysis of supernatants from the cultures with multiplex immunoassay (MDS technology) showed that LOAd732 DCs produce IL-12p70, IL-15, IL-21 and CXCL10. To assess the functionality of the DCs infected by LOAd732, the capacity of the cells to expand antigen-specific T cells were investigated in a CMV model system where DCs from CMV positive donors are pulsed with a CMV peptide and co-cultured with autologous T cells. LOAd732 infected DCs could expand CMV-specific CD8+ T cells. Since the tumor microenvironment often is immunosuppressive, TGF-&#946; and IL-10 was added to the co-cultures to model these conditions. The addition of the immunosuppressing cytokines did not affect LOAd732 capacity to expand the antigen-specific T cells.<br \/>In conclusion, LOAd732 infected DCs express activation markers and co-stimulatory molecules and produce cytokines necessary for the initiation of an immune response. Moreover the DCs are functional and can expand antigen-specific T cells and protect them from TGF-&#946; and IL-10 suppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a7ee6e6-e7bb-4ef7-9315-9d98e50078ae\/@B03B8ZGs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Dendritic cells,T cell,Interleukin-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16987"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"82ebd39f-2c29-4605-a602-24eb07c4e8f9","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82ebd39f-2c29-4605-a602-24eb07c4e8f9\/@B03B8ZGs\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jessica Wenthe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Eriksson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanja Lövgren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafael Moreno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramon Alemany<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelica Loskog<\/i><\/presenter>.

Displaying antigens derived from HER2 or HPV on the AAV capsid surface lead to strong humoral immune responses. However, the potential of AAVs as T cell inducing vaccines has been poorly investigated. Model antigens have been inserted into the capsid of AAVs to analyze T cell responses, but these studies rather focused on preventing vector immunity for an improved tolerance of gene therapies. By using this as a starting point, we set out to test AAVs as T cell inducing vaccines with the prospect of targeting cancer neoantigens. In first experiments, the general properties of the vaccination strategy were estimated by displaying the ovalbumin-derived model antigen SIINFEKL on the surface of adeno-associated virus-like particles (AAVLPs). Upon injection of the AAVLP-SIINFEKL vaccine, mice developed strong CD8+ T cell responses against the displayed antigen. Highest immune responses were achieved by subcutaneous hock injection of AAVLPs, adjuvanted by Montanide ISA 51 VG. SIINFEKL-specific T cell responses peaked around three weeks after vaccination, whereas a memory subset remained present for long term. The anti-tumor efficacy of the vaccine was shown by injecting SIINFEKL-expressing B16F10 melanoma cells subcutaneously into mice, in which the tumor was completely rejected after vaccination. Interestingly, the induction of CD8+ T cell responses and the tumor protection depended on the presence of CD4+ T cells. Accordingly, T helper epitopes were identified in the AAVLP capsid sequence. In addition to the initial tests, a set of murine neoantigens, derived from B16F10 cells, were displayed on AAVLPs. In direct comparison to a peptide vaccine, which did not have an effect on tumor growth, the AAVLP vaccine had a significant impact on the tumor growth rate. In conclusion, AAVLPs show promising effects as T cell vaccines. The vaccination strategy can be used to induce cytotoxic T cell responses in general and anti-tumor effects in particular. AAV capsid-specific helper epitopes is one inherent advantage, since the AAVLP vaccine delivers immune stimulation within the viral particle itself. Thus, antigen-displaying AAVLPs could be an alternative to current gold standards in the field of neoantigen vaccines and have a prospect for future clinical applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3027cfea-35f0-43e3-bed7-961753d1219e\/@B03B8ZGs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Vaccines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16988"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lasse Neukirch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Patrick Schmidt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inka Zörnig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dirk Jäger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silke Uhrig-Schmidt<\/i><\/presenter>.

To enhance these responses, there has been renewed emphasis in developing different types of cancer-specific vaccines to stimulate and direct T cell and B cell immunity to important oncologic targets, such as the oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is expressed in ~20% of breast cancers (BC). In our previous work we used a DNA plasmid vaccine targeting HER2, which utilized a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP) domain to traffic HER2 antigen to endolysosomal compartments. We demonstrated that this approach was more effective at eliciting antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and provided a significant but limited survival benefit in an endogenous mouse model of HER2+ BC compared to a HER2-wild type vaccine.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In our current study, we explored the use of this modified antigen construct using different vaccine modalities, including DNA plasmid, adenoviral (Ad), modified vaccinia ankara (MVA), and self-replicating RNA vaccines to identify effective vaccine platforms to elicit HER2-specific immunity and anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, we have tested the combination of these modalities in homologous and heterologous vaccine boosting regimens to determine an optimal strategy to elicit anti-tumor immunity in vivo.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In our studies, plasmid and MVA vectors elicited suboptimal immune priming responses, in comparison to Ad and self-replicating RNA vectors that elicit significant HER2-specific T and B cell responses upon vaccination. While timing of boosting is critical, our results reflect that certain platforms (e.g., plasmid DNA vectors) are capable of homologous boosting capacity, while others (e.g., Ad vectors) elicit more robust T and B cell responses to capsid epitopes, limiting homologous boosting capacity for HER2-specific immunity. Significantly, using an endogenous model of metastatic HER2+ BC, we have found that heterologous vaccination with different HER2-LAMP targeted vectors can elicit significantly augmented HER2-specific T and B cell responses that translated into more effective anti-tumor immunity. This immunity proved capable of eliciting tumor regression in ~80% of vaccinated mice, compared to 0% using homologous HER2-WT plasmid vaccination, 30% using homologous HER2-LAMP plasmid vaccination, or 50% with HER2-WT heterologous vaccination.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>These data demonstrate the potential of utilizing heterologous vaccine platforms encoding LAMP-based endolysosomal trafficking vaccines to elicit HER2-specific immunity and effect anti-tumor responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a71dfdb0-5e30-4ab4-93fa-3d2137945d75\/@B03B8ZGs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,HER2,Immunotherapy,Antitumor effect,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16989"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robert D.

Recently, several phase 1 clinical trials have reported encouraging therapeutic effects of oncolytic viruses in adult and pediatric patients with malignant gliomas. To further improve the therapeutic outcome of viroimmunotherapy, we have developed Delta-24-RGDOX (DNX-2440), a replication competent adenovirus encompassing the T-cell activator OX40L in the genetic backbone of Delta-24-RGD. We have previously reported the effect of Delta-24-RGDOX in murine brain tumors supporting the translation of this new agent to treat patients with recurrent malignant gliomas (NCT03714334). In the work presented here, we have tested the therapeutic effect of Delta-24-RGDOX in murine syngeneic models of breast (4T1), gastric (M12) and lung cancer (LLC and CMT 167). We found that Delta-24-RGDOX infected all cancer cell lines efficiently. In addition, infection of cells was followed by the expression of the ectopic ligand <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo<\/i>. Because the elicitation of an anti-tumor immunity is part of the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of oncolytic viruses, we examined whether infection of tumors led to the reshaping of the tumor microenvironment. We observed that Delta-24-RGDOX infection was followed by increased frequencies of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and NK cells. In addition, the CD8<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>ratio was increased in Delta-24-RGDOX-treated tumor versus PBS-treated tumors. Interestingly, abscopal modifications were observed in breast cancer brain metastases with increased frequency of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells at the distal, untreated site. Delta-24-RGDOX treatment induced an anti-cancer effect in orthotopically implanted breast cancer and subcutaneously implanted lung and gastric tumors, as well as in metastatic niches. In summary, our data showed that treatment of solid tumors with Delta-24-RGDOX induces robust remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and produces anti-tumor effects leading to decrease in tumor volume, along with a delay in the development and in the reduction of the number of metastases. These data suggest that Delta-24-RGDOX should be tested in the clinical setting in patients with metastatic breast, gastric and lung cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/095c883e-4c39-4ad4-b38f-4542e57c92ff\/@B03B8ZGs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Lung cancer,Gastric cancer,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16991"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arie C.

Immunotherapy has recently emerged as a promising treatment for the MSI-H\/dMMR metastatic CRC. However, MSS patients still cannot benefit from this therapy. STC therapeutic vaccine (Brenus Pharma) is composed of selected tumor cell lines, stimulated to overexpress TAA\/TSA and neoantigens including resistant factors that are further haptenized to form immunogenic hapten-protein complex. This educates the immune system to recognize and target the patient&#8217;s tumor cells expressing the same resistance factors. We report results of the transcriptomic changes induced by the different treatment and culture conditions on each cell line; highlighting the potential of this three cell lines vaccine to sensitize immunotherapy-resistant tumors to anti-PD1 therapy.<br \/><b>STUDY DESIGN and METHODS: <\/b>In this study, three cell lines have been cultured: HCT116, HT29, and LoVo. Each of these cell lines has been subjected to four growth conditions: RCB) the parental cell line cultured in standard medium 10% SVF or MCB) 2% SVF; DSA) MCB condition plus low-dose irradiation and heat shock or DSB) cultured with chemotherapy exposure. STC-1010 vaccine (DP) is the mix of the haptenized DSA and DSB culture conditions of these three cell lines. Total RNA of all those samples have been extracted and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500. Sequences have been aligned against the GRCh38 reference genome using Kallisto v0.46.1 software. Differential abundance and enrichment analyses have been performed with DESeq2 v1.34.0 and clusterProfiler v4.2.0 R packages, respectively.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>A first overview of the whole-transcriptome shows that each cell line has its very own profile and that the DP condition reflects a balanced mixture of the three transcriptomes. HT29-DSA condition displays 1048 differentially expressed genes (DEG) compared to MCB condition and altered 59 pathways, whereas the HT29-DSB condition shows 1288 DEG and altered 46 pathways. Both conditions show an overexpression of DNA repair pathways. LoVo-DSA condition displays 1044 DEG compared to MCB condition and altered 59 pathways, especially DNA repair pathways. HT29-DSB condition shows 1791 DEG and altered 130 pathways, mostly impacting the tumor immunity. HCT116-DSA condition displays 407 DEG compared to MCB condition and altered 72 pathways, especially DNA repair pathways. HCT116-DSB condition shows 1824 DEG and altered 51 pathways. Both conditions show an overexpression of pathways involved in tumor immunity.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> Brenus STC vaccine based on physical and chemical stimulations and haptenization reveals a promising potential to sensitize MSS CRC immunotherapy resistant tumors to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy.

Still, a majority of cancer patients including those with poorly immune infiltrated &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors are resistant to currently available ICB therapies. Oncolytic viruses are natural immunomodulators able to turn &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors &#8220;hot&#8221; and, for some of them, to deliver therapeutic payloads intratumorally. Payloads of choice are those with tolerability and\/or pharmacokinetic\/biodistribution issues, such as @CTLA4 antibodies and GM-CSF respectively. Here, Transgene and BioInvent present a preclinical characterization of a highly efficacious and potentially safe strategy to target CTLA-4 and GM-CSF using vectorization in an oncolytic vaccinia virus.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>A novel human IgG1 CTLA-4 antibody (4-E03) was identified using function-first screening for mAbs and targets associated with checkpoint blocking and superior Treg depleting activity. A tumor-selective oncolytic Vaccinia vector was then engineered to encode this novel &#945;CTLA-4 as full-length antibody (i.e. distinct transgenes for light and heavy chains) and GM-CSF (VV<sub>GM<\/sub>-&#945;hCTLA4, BT-001). Viruses encoding matching mouse surrogate payloads were additionally generated, enabling proof-of-concept studies in syngeneic immune competent mouse tumor models.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Our studies demonstrate that two chains cloning approach allowed to express @CTLA4 at a high level in numerous infected human tumor cell lines without affecting replication, oncolytic activity or genetic stability of the virus. Intratumoral (i.t.) administration of VV<sub>GM<\/sub>-&#945;CTLA4 achieved tumor-restricted CTLA-4 receptor saturation at least for 10 days, Treg-depletion antigen cross-presentation, stronger systemic expansion of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and antitumor immunity compared with systemic &#945;CTLA-4 antibody or unarmed virus therapies. Remarkably, in a clinically relevant mouse model resistant to systemic immune checkpoint blockade, i.t. VV<sub>GM<\/sub>-&#945;CTLA4 synergized with &#945;PD-1 to reject &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Our findings demonstrate in vivo proof-of-concept for tumor delivery by Vaccinia virus of GM-CSF and strongly Treg-depleting, immune checkpoint blocking, vectorized &#945;CTLA-4. This vector-based delivery is a highly effective and safe strategy to target CTLA-4 which overcomes current limitations of approved &#945;CTLA-4 regimens. A clinical trial evaluating i.t.

DC-based immunotherapy against cancer has been promising for a long time, but has not yet met expectations. Cancer cell heterogeneity and numerous immune evasion mechanisms represent challenges. According to textbook renderings, DCs may induce either tolerance or immune activation depending upon the nature of the encountered antigen and the status of the microenvironment. Recently, we have discovered a more complicated scenario according to which monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) exhibit dual pro- and anti-inflammatory features, suggesting that selected conditions that enhance pro-inflammatory features and counteract tolerogenic features could generate more robust and potent DCs for cancer therapy.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Healthy blood donor buffy coats were used for the isolation of monocytes and conventional CD141+ and CD1c+ natural circulating DCs. IL-4 and GM-CSF were used to differentiate monocytes into immature moDCs. Toll-like receptor agonists were used to induce DC maturation, and specific agonists and inhibitors were tested in different DC variants. Flow cytometry, ELISA determination of cytokine secretion, HPLC-based quantitation of kynurenine secretion, genome-wide gene expression analyses and functional assays, such as antigen uptake, migration and the mixed leukocyte reaction were used for evaluation of treated DCs.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Conventional DCs were more susceptible to apoptosis, and dependent upon culture conditions, than moDCs. Inhibition of &#946;-catenin signaling stimulated several pro-inflammatory features, <i>e.g.<\/i> increased IL-12 and decreased IL-10 secretion, with reciprocal effects caused by &#946;-catenin stimulation. Maturation of moDCs was accompanied by very strong induction of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) transcription and paralleled by increased kynurenine secretion, but this was partially counteracted by &#946;-catenin stimulation.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Preparation of more potent DCs for cancer therapy needs to take into account DC longevity and conflicting activation patterns of pro- and anti-inflammatory abilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c4c15c27-5e33-4ca4-8558-84fa7b99854d\/@B03B8ZGs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,&#946;-catenin,IDO1,Cancer vaccine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16994"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Waqas Azeem<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seyed Mohammad Lellahi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaping Hua<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Margrete Øyan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Gabriel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karl-Henning Kalland<\/i><\/presenter>.

But its effect in solid tumors is suboptimal. Intratumoral injections of oncolytic viruses, including Delta-24-RGDOX (DNX-2440) from our group, directly lyse cancer cells and activate tumor microenvironment, leading to adaptive antitumor immunity. To take advantage of instant antitumor activity of T cells and virus-mediated <i>in situ<\/i> autovaccination against heterogeneous cancer cells, we hypothesize that intratumorally injections of tumor-targeting T cells followed by Delta-24-RGDOX overcome antigen escape of CAR T therapy, leading to more sustainable systemic anti-cancer immunity. Thus, we used subcutaneous (s.c.)\/s.c. B16 melanoma mouse models to assess the effect of localized treatment in disseminated tumors. OVA (or gp100)-specific CD8+ T cells or CD19 CAR T cells were injected into the first tumor, followed by three injections of Delta-24-RGDOX into the same tumor. T cells and tumor cells from the mice were profiled for surface markers with flow cytometry and immune staining. <b> <\/b>Activity of splenocytes against tumor cells and specific tumor-associated-antigens (TAAs) was measured with ELISA. Tumor growth was monitored through measuring tumor size. The animal survival curves were plotted according to the Kaplan-Meier method<i>.<\/i> We found TAA-specific T cells injected into the first s.c. tumor showed tropism for disseminated s.c. and intracranial tumors, tumor draining lymph nodes, but not for spleen, peripheral blood and normal brain. Unlike untreated and Delta-24-RGDOX-treated tumor, T cell-treated tumor showed decreased expression of the target TAA which was depleted in the recurrent tumor. Moreover, Delta-24-RGDOX increased total T cell presence within the tumors, and the activity of the splenocytes against the tumor cells and other antigens than the one targeted by injected T cells. Consequentially, the combination of OVA-specific T cells and Delta-24-RGDOX was more potent to inhibit the injected and untreated disseminated tumor growth and caused improved survival rate than either of the agent alone (p &#60; 0.05). Importantly, we observed relapse of the regressed tumors in the group treated by T cells alone, but not in the combination group. The survivors from the combination therapy were protected from rechallenging with B16-OVA cells but not lung carcinoma cells, suggesting the development of immune memory. In summary, our study indicates the virus induces antigen spread, resulting in expansion of antitumor T cell repertoire to prevent cancer relapse in adoptive T cell therapy (ACT). Our data demonstrate that Delta-24-RGDOX collaborates with ACT to induce more potent systemic immunity against the tumors, leading to sustainable tumor regression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6d782267-d37c-4701-b5a2-56a02f866035\/@C03B8ZGt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Adoptive cell therapy,CAR T cells,Cancer vaccine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16996"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hong Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong Ho Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanhua Yi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuejun Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joy Gumin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta M.

Ideally, a personalized cancer treatment approach needs to target specific cancer antigen. Efforts to induce specific immune responses against tumor associated antigens (TAAs) include the expression of TAAs through viral vectors capable of expressing multiple antigens. We have previously shown that the HSV-1(VC2) vaccine vector can induce potent antitumor immune responses utilizing the B16F10-derived syngeneic melanoma mouse model. To investigate whether heterologous antigens expressed by this vaccine vector could elicit potent immune responses, we generated the recombinant virus VC2-OVA that expresses the ovalbumin antigen (OVA) fused in-frame at the amino terminus of the viral VP26 protein. Western blot analysis of infected cells in cell culture showed efficient expression of the OVA-VP26 protein. The anti-tumor efficacy of the VC2-OVA virus was tested in the B16cOVA and E.G7-OVA mouse models that constitutively express the OVA antigen to test whether this vaccine can either prevent the formation of new tumors (prophylactic modality) or reduce tumor metastasis (therapeutic modality). In addition, we evaluated the differences between intradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular routes of vaccination with VC2-OVA. Treatment with VC2-OVA resulted in significant reduction of tumor formation and metastasis in both the prophylactic and therapeutic modalities. Importantly, the anti-tumor efficacy was dependent on the specific mouse tumor model. Further, we found that subcutaneous and intradermal was superior to intramuscular vaccination. The VC2 virus is available as a bacterial artificial chromosome allowing for the rapid isolation of recombinant VC2-derived virus expressing multiple tumor antigens. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the VC2 vaccine virus can be used to produce personalized cancer vaccines targeting specific TAAs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9032ca0a-5443-4fb2-919f-71f169d06ab1\/@C03B8ZGt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,HSV,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16997"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ifeanyi K.

One of the important findings to emerge in NSCLC is that specific genetic mutations that lead to cancer development occur early in the disease process. Unfortunately, identifying NSCLC at its earliest stages when it is curable has been a challenge even in high risk individuals. These gene mutations, especially those involving the Kras protein, can &#8220;drive&#8221; the development of NSCLC cancer as they alter the regulation of cell growth or block programmed cell death. Mutations in Kras have been reported in 30% of lung cancer cases and are associated with worse outcomes. This neo-antigen cannot generate effective anti-tumor immunity, suggesting lack of a cellular, cytotoxic immune response to cancer cells on mucosal\/epithelial surfaces. No effective therapies specifically targeting mutant Kras have been developed. To overcome poor immunogenicity of neo-antigen, newer adjuvants (NA), biocompatible nanoparticles, were used to enhance immune response. It has been reported NA can produce cytotoxic and mucosal immunity safely in humans. Producing this type of immune response to mutated Kras through immunization could produce a significant anti-tumor effect. In the current study, we first tested NA combined with mutated and wild type (MHC II) Kras peptides vaccine for immunogenicity on the same genetic background as the animals in the inducible tumor model. Our data<b> <\/b>have demonstrated that NA in combination with multiple Kras peptides can increase CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in the draining lymph node cells and enhance antigen specific TH1 and TH17 responses by luminex and ELISpot to increase the ability of the vaccine to kill tumor cells and elicit long-lasting immune memory. Furthermore, we evaluated anti-tumor efficacy of this vaccine in tetracycline-inducible mouse model with Kras mutation.<b> <\/b>In this challenge model, vaccinated mice showed higher IFN&#612; and IL-17 levels and decreased the tumor incidence significantly compared to PBS or peptides alone group. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the antigen-specific cellular immune responses and mononuclear cell infiltrates correlate with tumor prevention. Our data suggest that this novel vaccine could prevent the development of NSCLC after validation in an appropriate animal model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09640870-a9c0-4cfa-b939-62b347bb7630\/@C03B8ZGt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adjuvant,Nanoparticle,Immune response,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16998"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Suhe Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengyi Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janczak Katarzyna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Baker Jr.<\/i><\/presenter>.

Immune suppression is achieved by multiple mechanisms including interfering with antigen presentation and inhibition of effector T-cell tissue infiltration. Altering specific TME properties can reduce immune-suppression and improve anti-tumor immunity with abscopal effects. Oncolytic Virotherapy (OV) is a promising approach for cancer treatment. We evaluated the efficacy of the HSV-1 (VC2) vaccine strain for the treatment of breast cancer using the murine stage-4 (4T1) syngeneic and immunocompetent breast cancer mouse model. Following Intratumoral (IT) injection of VC2 in mice bearing implanted 4T1 tumors, treatment efficacy was evaluated by monitoring tumor weight, immune infiltration, and metastasis in the lung. Animals treated with VC2 via the IT route exhibited significantly reduced metastasis and improved intra-tumoral T-cell infiltration. Improved T-cell infiltration was not due to viral replication since improved parameters were observed during late times post VC2 treatment when no viral replication was detectable. The total area of metastasis in the lung was significantly reduced compared to control groups. VC2 treated animals via the IT route had significantly higher cytotoxic splenocytes, evident by the in-vitro killing of 4T1 cells, compared to the control group. This improved cytotoxic activity, intratumoral T-cell infiltration, and reduced metastasis in the lung suggest that IT administration of VC2 altered TME in a way that induced better antigen recognition, processing, and presentation resulting in improved anti-tumor immune responses with an abscopal effect in the lung. Further understanding of the mechanisms involved in the observed improved anti-tumor immune responses will help improve treatment efficacy and provide new approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/96fb925e-e4d9-4946-bf93-4f8b5b39b13e\/@C03B8ZGt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Vaccines,HSV,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16999"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rafiq Nabi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Farhana Musarrat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vladimir Chouljenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Konstantin Kousoulas<\/i><\/presenter>.

Several clinical studies have targeted EBV antigens as immune therapeutic targets with limited efficacy of EBV<sup>+<\/sup> malignancies, suggesting additional targets might be important. BamHI-A rightward frame 1 (BARF1) is an EBV antigen that is highly expressed in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) and EBV<sup>+ <\/sup>nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and has not been evaluated as an antigen in the context of therapeutic immunization. Here, we developed a synthetic DNA-based expression cassette as immunotherapy targeting BARF1 (pBARF1). Immunization with pBARF1 induced potent antigen-specific humoral and polyfunctional effector T cell responses <i>in vivo<\/i>. We observed significant antigen-specific increases of IFN-&#947;<sup>+<\/sup>, IFN-&#947;<sup>+<\/sup> TNF-&#945;<sup>+<\/sup>, and IFN-&#947;<sup>+<\/sup> TNF-&#945;<sup>+<\/sup> IL-2<sup>+<\/sup> populations in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from the pBARF1 immunized animals in both C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c mice. Novel BARF1 expressing carcinoma lines that grow in immune-competent animals were developed as surrogates for human EBV<sup>+<\/sup> tumors. We confirmed that BARF1 expression in these new cancer cell lines, MC38-BARF1 and CT26-BARF1, was within the range of human EBV<sup>+<\/sup> cancer cell lines, SNU719 and C666-1. Immunization with pBARF1 plasmid demonstrated impact of tumor progression through induction of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell in these BARF1<sup>+<\/sup> carcinoma models. We also observed long-term antitumor immunity, at least up to 446 days, against BARF1 in a CT26-BARF1 rechallenge study. Using IVIS <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging, we observed that pBARF1 immunized animals rapidly controlled and cleared cancer cells. These studies demonstrate the potential for pBARF1 immunity to induce antigen-specific immune responses impacting tumor progression. Further study of this immune target and these EBV<sup>+<\/sup> tumor models is likely important as part of therapeutic approaches for EBV<sup>+<\/sup> malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6dd0ec98-0057-447c-910d-72c103c1b032\/@C03B8ZGt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),Cytotoxic T cell,Immunotherapy,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17000"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xizhou Zhu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfredo Perales-Puchalt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krzysztof Wojtak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziyang Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kun Yun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pratik S.

Despite the therapeutic success of novel small molecules (e.g. ibrutinib, idealisib and venetoclax), patients frequently experience disease relapse due to the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD). Targeting the residual CLL cells by immunotherapy could further improve the depth and persistence of CLL remission. Here, we report on the preclinical development and clinical implementation of a phase I trial evaluating safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in terms of MRD response of a personalized multi-peptide vaccine adjuvanted with the novel toll-like receptor (TLR) 1\/2 agonist XS15 emulsified in Montanide<sup>TM<\/sup> ISA51 VG (Rammensee <i>et al. <\/i>JIC 2019) in CLL patient receiving Bruton-Tyrosin-Kinase (BTK)-inhibitor based regimes (NCT04688385). So far, broad application of peptide vaccines in cancer patients is hampered by time- and cost-intensive design and the lack of neoepitopes from tumor-specific mutations, especially in low-mutational burden malignancies. To improve on these drawbacks, we developed an immunopeptidome-guided workflow for the design of tumor-associated off-the-shelf peptide warehouses for broadly applicable personalized therapeutics (Nelde et al., Front Immunol, 2021). For the trial reported here, comparative mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome analyses of 61 CLL patient samples and a dataset of benign tissues samples (n = 351) enabled the identification of high-frequent non-mutated CLL-associated antigens for the most common HLA allotypes (HLA-A*02, -A*24, and -B*07). These antigens were proven to be recognized as T cell epitopes by pre-existing and <i>de novo <\/i>induced T cells in CLL patients and healthy volunteers, thereby enabling the selection of a 12-peptides panel comprising 9 HLA-class I (3 for each HLA allotype) and 3 HLA class II restricted high frequent CLL-exclusive T cell epitopes as warehouse for the personalized composition of study vaccine cocktails. Our meanwhile ongoing phase I trial recruits CLL patients eligible for treatment with BTK inhibitors. For those with matching HLA allotypes, a personalized peptide-cocktail is formulated comprising 6 CLL-associated peptides (3 HLA class I and 3 HLA class II peptides), selected from our warehouse based on individual immunopeptidome analysis, and 2 highly immunogenic HLA class II control peptides, one viral (human adenovirus C) and one tumor associated (Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5). Three doses of the vaccine are administered in a 4-weekly interval, after reduction of CLL-load by BTK inhibitors. So far, 10 CLL patients were included in the trial. The first vaccinations will be applied in November and December 2021 with first immunogenicity data expected in March 2022 and to be reported at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e291959-2097-42a6-bd23-a96be7fe6bf7\/@C03B8ZGt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Immunotherapy,Peptides,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17001"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maddalena Marconato<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annika Nelde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yacine Maringer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcel Wacker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marion Richter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monika Denk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helmut Salih<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Heitmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliane Sarah Walz<\/i><\/presenter>.
