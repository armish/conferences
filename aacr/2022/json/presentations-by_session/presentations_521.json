[{"Abstract":"<b>Objectives:<\/b> Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel, CARVYKTI, previously JNJ-68284528) is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Due to the restricted expression of BCMA in normal tissue and expression primarily on late-stage B-cells, plasma cells and malignant B-lineage cells, BCMA is an attractive target for cell therapy for multiple myeloma. The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) consists of two BCMA-targeting single domain antibodies designed to confer avidity, a CD3&#950; signaling domain and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. The aims of this work were to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for CAR transgene after single intravenous infusion administration of cilta-cel and to evaluate the effects of subjects&#8217; demographic characteristics and other covariates on CAR transgene PK.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Subjects CAR transgene level in blood, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were available from 97 subjects in a Phase 1b\/2 CARTITUDE-1 study (NCT03548207). A targeted cilta-cel dose of 0.75x10<sup>6 <\/sup>(range 0.5-1.0x10<sup>6<\/sup>) CAR-positive viable T-cells\/kg body weight was given 5-7 days after lymphodepletion (300 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> cyclophosphamide, 30 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> fludarabine daily for 3 d). The data were analyzed by a non-linear mixed effects modeling approach implemented in NONMEM V7.4.3. The population PK model development was based on existing information on CAR T-cell (CAR-T) PK with some modifications. Model qualification was guided by the objective function value, diagnostic plots, standard error of parameters, evaluation of condition number, shrinkage, and visual predictive checks.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The PK of cilta-cel following IV infusion was adequately described by a 2-compartment model (with a fast and a slow apparent decline rate from each compartment, respectively) and a chain of 4 transit compartments with a lag time empirically representing the process from infused CAR-T cell to measurable CAR transgene. The model diagram is shown in Figure 1, consisting of 5 parameters and their respective inter-individual variability (lognormal distribution). The dose was defined as the number of CAR-positive viable T cells infused, and the fitted CAR transgene level (units of copies\/&#956;g genomic DNA) observation was the sum of the 2 CAR-T cell compartments.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: A population PK model has been developed to characterize CAR transgene level of cilta-cel in blood following IV infusion of 0.75x10<sup>6<\/sup> (range 0.5-1.0x10<sup>6<\/sup>) CAR-positive viable T-cells\/kg body weight. The developed model is robust and adequate for investigating the covariate effects on CAR transgene level of cilta-cel and enabling subsequent exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ae03521-12b9-4898-a2ce-e5f5afe7c68b\/@r03B8ZQm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Pharmacokinetics,Multiple myeloma,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17503"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liviawati S.

Although initial responses to 1st line treatment is high, over 75% of patients eventually relapse and acquire chemotherapy resistance, which is the primary cause of ovarian cancer treatment failure. New therapies to improve patient outcome are therefore urgently required. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is an adoptive immunotherapy that is currently being used to treat some blood cancers. CAR-T cell therapies have so far been less effective against solid cancers, due in part to the absence of suitable tumor-associated antigen (TAA).This study has investigated whether Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5, LGR5) is a suitable target for CAR-T cell therapy for ovarian cancer. We found that LGR5 is highly expressed in HGSOC cancer lines (COV318, COV362 and OAW28) and increased in HGSOC tissues following relapse with chemotherapy resistant disease. We assessed the cytotoxic effects of LGR5-CAR-T cells on a range of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary serous ovarian cancer cells derived from patient ascites <i>in vitro <\/i>by MTT and 3D spheroid assays. We demonstrated that LGR5-CAR-T cells were cytotoxic and significantly inhibited survival of ovarian cancer cell lines (COV318, COV362) that express high levels of LGR5 but not SKOV3 or OV90 that express lower LGR5 levels in monolayer culture. In addition, LGR5-CAR-T cells were cytotoxic and significantly inhibited survival of primary serous ovarian cancer cells compared to un-transduced CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. LGR5 CAR-T cells also exhibited anti-tumor activity against ovarian cancer cell lines (COV318, COV362 &#38; OAW28) and primary serous ovarian cancer cells<i> in vitro <\/i>using 3D-spheroid culture assays. This study demonstrates that LGR5-CAR-T cells have great potential to be developed as a novel immunotherapy for ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/608229bd-1fd7-4558-a7f3-fd416a389a5a\/@r03B8ZQm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,CAR T cells,Spheroids,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17504"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wanqi Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronika Bandara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noor A.

A key determinant in CAR-T selection for clinical trials is the potency and persistence of the selected CAR-T to kill cancerous cells. This is often difficult to determine across different donors and batches. Additionally, these characteristics can be difficult to determine <i>in vitro<\/i> in a rapid, high-throughput manner. In this study we have utilized real-time impedance cytotoxicity assays to screen LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells. LGR5 is a well described cancer stem cell antigen implicated in tumor initiation and metastasis, and prognosis of colon, ovarian and neuroblastoma cancers. Impedance measurements are taken continuously, providing comprehensive real-time information about CAR-T cell efficiency over time, which is not achievable with single timepoint cytotoxicity assays. Through this validation process we have been able to concurrently test different Effector to Target (E:T) ratios and different CAR constructs to accurately and directly compare CAR-T killing efficiency. This readout is a key indicator of CAR-T potency. Similar to inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) or lethal dose 50 (LD50) data, CAR-T potency can be expressed in a measure as kill time 50 (KT50), and represents the time required for the CAR-T to stimulate cytolysis in 50% of the target cancer cells. KT50 data was key to the selection of our lead clinical candidate; CNA3103. In addition to selection of our lead candidate, real-time impedance technology has allowed us to screen a broad range of LGR5-expressing cancer types. Our data indicates that CNA3103 can effectively target colon, neuroblastoma, and ovarian cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Real-time impedance assay has allowed us to analyze cancer cells with different levels of LGR5 expression to confirm the specificity of our CAR-T cells and to develop an understanding of how LGR5 expression levels might impact cancer cell killing. The data also indicates that our LGR5 targeting CAR-T cells have the potential to repeatedly kill, i.e. the same CAR-T cell is able to move on from one cancer cell to another and remain cytotoxic. Taken together, real-time cytotoxicity assays provide valuable pre-clinical data, enabling the selection of CNA3103 as our LRG5-CAR-T clinical candidate. This technology may also assist in patient and dose selection within a clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/486afc59-5357-41fb-8af3-ea252ae804d9\/@r03B8ZQm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Preclinical testing,Cytotoxicity,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17505"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emma J.

Also, gene-engineering NK cells to express an exogenous CAR receptor allows the innate anti-tumor ability of NK cells to be directed against target tumor antigen. However, these autologous applications are limited by toxicities, restricted trafficking and infiltration into tumor, suboptimal persistence, and exhausted status of immune cells that may cause manufacturing failure. One approach to overcome those limitations is the development of &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; iPS-cell sources. The iCAR-ILC-N101 is an allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-homozygous induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived anti-glypican-3 (GPC3) CAR-expressing innate lymphoid cells\/natural killer cell (ILC\/NK), which has both antigen-specific and NK activating receptor-mediated cytotoxicity. The iCAR-ILC-N101 is produced from the established iPSC strain QHJI01s04, and there is theoretically no risk of developing graft-versus host disease because the product dose not have T cell receptor. The product has a relevant living period in the body, thereby has little concern about residual toxicity and reduces systemic side effects by topical treatment. GPC3 is a cancer-specific membranous protein that is expressed in hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) but is not expressed in normal tissue. OCCC is a relatively rare malignancy and is associated with poor prognosis. Intraperitoneal administration of iCAR-ILC-N101 is expected to show antitumor activity for OCCC patients with peritoneal dissemination that express GPC3 and reduce systemic side effects, thereby ensuring safety and improving therapeutic efficacy. Preclinical study showed that intraperitoneal injection of iCAR-ILC-N101 for GPC3-positive ovarian tumor-bearing immunodeficient mouse model showed suppressed tumor growth.<br \/>Method: This is a first-in human phase 1 study to evaluate safety, toxicity and efficacy of the iCAR-ILC-N101 in patients with GPC3-positive advanced or recurrent OCCC harboring peritoneal dissemination. Major inclusion criteria include histologically diagnosed GPC3-positive advanced or recurrent OCCC with peritoneal dissemination who are resistant to standard therapy and have matched HLA-A24 or B52. The study includes 3 cohorts (cohort -1, 0.5x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/kg; cohort 1, 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/kg; cohort 2, 3x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/kg) and starts with cohort 1. The iCAR-ILC-N101 is administered intraperitoneally once a week for 4 weeks; for the first patient in each cohort, patient is observed for 14 days for safety evaluation after the first administration and then receive iCAR-ILC-N101 on day15 and 22. Enrollment initiated in July 2021 and one patient was enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed.

We sequentially characterized peripheral blood T cell functionality by immunophenotyping and correlated with efficacy endpoints.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Immunophenotypic characterization of both non-CAR-T and CAR-T cells was performed by flow cytometry in 378 blood samples from 111 pts collected at enrollment and within the first month post Tisa-cel infusion. Proportions of T cell subsets were identified by maturation (CCR7\/CD45RA\/CD45RO) and exhaustion (PD1\/LAG3\/TIM3) markers and then correlated with durable clinical response (Complete Response (CR) &#8805; 6 mo vs. Non-response (NR)\/Relapse), PFS and OS.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>At enrollment, low T cell levels (&#60;14.5% of PBMCs or &#60;170 cells\/uL) observed in 30% (31\/105) pts were associated with NR\/relapse (27\/31) and with significantly shorter PFS and OS, compared to those with higher levels (median (m)PFS: 2.1 vs. 9 mo, p=0.0006; mOS: 6 vs. 28.5 mo, p=0.003). NR\/relapse pts had higher levels of exhausted T cell subsets in both CD4 (LAG3<sup>+<\/sup>, LAG3<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup>) and CD8 (PD1<sup>+<\/sup>, LAG3<sup>+<\/sup>, LAG3<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup>) cells at enrollment. High levels (&#62;median) of these subsets also had significantly shorter PFS and OS, with LAG<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> ranked on top (mPFS: 2 vs. 34 mo; mOS: 4.6 mo vs. not reached, both p&#60;0.0001) and remained significant in multivariate Cox models including LDH and Myc status (PFS: HR=3.1 [1.9 - 5.3]; OS: HR=2.8 [1.6 - 4.8]; both p&#60;0.001). Hierarchical clustering showed concordant increase of all non-CAR-T exhausted subsets in NR\/relapse pts, separating them from ongoing CRs. The trend continued at day 28 (D28), with almost all exhausted CD4 and CD8 subsets in both non-CAR-T and CAR-T cells being consistently higher in NR\/Relapse compared to ongoing CRs. In addition, high levels of exhausted subsets in non-CAR-T cells at D28 were associated with shorter PFS and OS, with the strongest trend in PD1<sup>+<\/sup>, LAG3<sup>+<\/sup>, LAG3<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> of CD8 and CD4 cells. Survival analyses for CAR-T exhausted subsets were less informative due to small sample size. Of note, several LAG3<sup>+<\/sup> and LAG3<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> subsets of CAR-T and non-CAR-T cells were also higher in NR\/relapse at CAR-T peak expansion. In contrast, no obvious differences were observed for T cell memory subsets from both CAR-T and non-CAR-T cells across multiple timepoints.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Decreased circulating T cells at enrollment, and increased circulating exhausted T cells in non-CAR-T (at enrollment and D28) and CAR-T (at D28) compartments, were associated with poor response and survival, suggesting these flow measurements may serve as surrogate for overall T cell function, which is critical for optimal Tisa-cel efficacy and early prognostication in LBCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4768f85f-eaa4-4859-8400-7c4ba31f259a\/@r03B8ZQm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Exhaustive T-Cells,JULIET,Tisagenlecleucel,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17507"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"bc218249-9ebd-452a-964a-c755e00ca028","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc218249-9ebd-452a-964a-c755e00ca028\/@r03B8ZQm\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ulrich Jäger<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xia Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Davide Germano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Quinn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dalia Gaddis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aisha Masood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanya Mulvey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Mataraza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael R.

NKX101 is a NK cell therapy product engineered to overexpress a chimeric receptor consisting of NKG2D ectodomain, costimulatory signaling motifs, and a membrane-bound form of IL-15. NKX101 is currently under clinical evaluation for treatment of relapsed\/refractory AML and MDS. To better understand patterns of response to NKX101, we describe the development of (i) a single-cell (sc) RNAseq approach to assess gene expression pattern changes in NKX101 and patient cells, (ii) a multiplex IHC panel to monitor NKG2D-ligand expression by cancer cells, and (iii) an ELISA method to detect NKG2D-ligand shedding in serum.<br \/>To verify that our scRNAseq approach can distinguish the NKX101 product cells from patient cells, healthy human PBMCs were pre-mixed with NKX101 cells at set ratios. 10x Genomics hybrid capture baits were prepared to enrich for exogene reads, first via single-cell 5&#8217; gene expression assays and then further processed for target enrichment using a human immunology gene set panel. Multiplex IHC was carried out using the Vectra Polaris Phenoptics platform. FFPE biopsy samples were stained with an 8-marker multiplex panel. Digital image analysis was conducted using the inForm analysis software. For the detection of shed NKG2D-ligands, a sandwich ELISA was employed using recombinant human NKG2D to capture the ligands, followed by detection using ligand-specific antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.<br \/>We can successfully separate NKX101 product cells from the host PBMC background using our scRNAseq data. NKX101 cell proportions in the transcriptome datasets correlated with the expected titration ratios against host PBMC, with samples titrated at 25% NKX101<sup>+<\/sup> cells yielding approximately 25% NKX101 exogene expressing cells by scRNAseq. Our internally developed multiplex IHC methods can quantify NKG2D-ligand expression levels in AML and solid tumors. We show examples of NKG2D-ligand expression on blast cells from AML solid bone marrow biopsies. In solid tumors, we demonstrate that NKG2D-ligands are upregulated on PanCK<sup>+<\/sup> cancer cells compared to PanCK<sup>-<\/sup> cells or healthy normal tissues. Finally, we found certain commercial kits for the detection of soluble NKG2D ligands to potentially under-report the NKG2D-ligand concentrations due to their propensity for aggregation. Using recombinant NKG2D as a capture reagent, we have developed sandwich ELISA method to detect NKG2D-ligands shed into the culture supernatant or serum. In summary, we describe here the development of IHC and ELISA methods to determine NKG2D-ligand expression and shedding as well as a scRNAseq assay to identify NKX101<sup>+<\/sup> product cells and evaluate the anti-tumor immune response during CAR-NK treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a170cf4e-41eb-4867-ace1-06174f66121d\/@s03B8ZQn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Acute myeloid leukemia,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17508"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyle Hansen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sombeet Sahu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bao Duong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cynthia Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Trager<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanne Tan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus the miHA are ideal targets for adoptive T cell immunotherapy for the recipient of alloSCT. We developed a novel single-cell based high-throughput technology (TCXpress) for cloning T cell receptors (TCRs) and successfully cloned multiple TCRs reactive against the miHA, HA-1 from a parous woman who was naturally immunized to HA-1 through pregnancy. We identified an HLA-A*02:01 woman homozygous for the non-immunogenic HA-1 alleles (R\/R) who had pregnancies from an HA-1(H\/R) father. TCRs were cloned from single-cell-sorted HA-1 dextramer+ (dex<sup>HA-1+<\/sup>) T cells from unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subsequently from CD8<sup> <\/sup>cells cultured with HA-1 peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APCs). TCRs were re-expressed in reporter cells and analyzed for dextramer binding and CD69 upregulation after culture with peptide-pulsed APCs. TCR sequencing was performed to define CDR3 diversity. 48 dexHA-1+CD8+ T cells were single-cell sorted from 3.9 x10e7 PBMCs of a parous woman. Using TCXpress technology, we cloned 38 TCRs from 48 single-cell dexHA-1+CD8+ T cells. Of these 38, 16 unique TCRs, when expressed in Jurkat cells, were functionally reactive against HA-1(H) peptide by ELISpot. These TCRs had a broad range of EC50s as measured by CD69 upregulation when cultured with HA-1(H) peptide-pulsed T2 cells. CD8+ T cells from the same donor were expanded with autologous HA-1(H)-peptide pulsed APCs for one week. 704 additional TCRs were cloned from dexHA-1+ cells from these cultures. 440 clones were confirmed to bind HA-1 dextramer when expressed in CD8-expressing 293 cells. TCR sequencing of these 440 TCRs identified six additional unique anti-HA-1 TCRs. Several TCRs, when re-expressed in primary CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, killed HA-1<sup>+<\/sup> target cells. TCR sequencing revealed that almost all dexHA-1+ CD8+ T cells used TRBV7-9, consistent with other anti-HA-1 TCR clones in previous reports. In summary, TCXpress technology has yielded 22 unique anti-HA-1 TCRs with a broad functional affinity from a single donor in only two experiments. Our data also highlight the wide range of TCR affinities that can arise from a natural immune response against a single allopeptide\/HLA complex. We aim to apply this technology to clone and characterize TCRs against other miHAs, particularly those with expression relatively restricted to hematopoietic cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09221cb1-99b2-400b-9b62-36ef8b5f66cd\/@s03B8ZQn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Adoptive cell therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17510"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sawa Ito<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Constantinos G.

Modifying tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) strategies have attracted attention for ameliorating tumor immunosuppression and improving anti-tumor immunity. Here, by applying human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reconstruction NSG mice and murine C57BL\/6 syngeneic tumor xenografts, we demonstrated that APG-2575 combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor activity, which was associated with the increased recruitment of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Additionally, we found that APG-2575-mediated antitumor T cell immunity is macrophage dependent, and it could function as an anticancer immune regulator that repolarizes TAMs from M2 to pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. Mechanistically, APG-2575 enhanced M1 polarization through increasing the activated NF-&#954;B binding to the NLRP3 promoter. In parallel, the enhanced expression of NLRP3 mediated the activation of pro-inflammatory caspases and the subsequently elevation of CCL5 and CXCL10 chemokines production by M1 macrophages. As a result, APG-2575-mediated macrophages transition could improve tumor immunosuppression, thus skewing the cytokines profiles into immunostimulatory one in the TME and further enhancing antitumor T cell immunity. These results provided a novel promising strategy for NSCLC treatment and warranted future clinical evaluation of combination therapy of APG-2575 and ICIs.<b>Key words: <\/b>BCL-2, APG-2575, ICIs, macrophages, non-small cell lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c5511df9-1b1f-4fa1-8132-fd39e92eeef5\/@s03B8ZQn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,NSCLC,APG-2575,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17512"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fan Luo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei-teng Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miao-zhen Qiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen-tao Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong-yun Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Da-jun Yang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Grade 3 adverse events were 26.3%, and there were no grade 4 or above adverse events. The tumor tissues of 16 patients have done high-throughput sequencing, and genetic test results show that 6 patients were evaluated as HRD-High and 10 patients as HRD-Low.

As a negative regulator of T cell activation, VISTA inhibits T cell proliferation and attenuates the production of cytokines. Studies have shown that VISTA expression is increased in infiltrating immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment and that blocking pathways that lead to VISTA activation can enhance antitumor immune responses in mice. Based on this, antibodies targeting VISTA are promising leads for cancer therapy. Preclinical efficacy evaluation of antibodies again human VISTA requires the expression of human VISTA in animal models, since difference in extracellular domains may affect antibody recognition while the overall homology between the two proteins is only 77%.<br \/>To meet this need, we established a humanized mouse model in which the extracellular domain of mVISTA is replaced with that of hVISTA while the trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domains remain intact. In order to confirm the activity of the chimeric protein in our mice, we evaluated the anti-tumor effect of proven VISTA antibodies in homozygous hVISTA mice engrafted with CT26 tumor subcutaneously. Consistent with previous studies, the growth of CT26 tumor was inhibited after VISTA antibody treatment, indicating the humanized VISTA mice are suitable for efficacy evaluation of human VISTA antibodies.<br \/>Moreover, we evaluated the anti-tumor effect of a combination of PD-L1 antibody and VISTA antibody in these mice. Interestingly, the combined use of PD-L1 antibody and VISTA antibody led to significantly enhanced tumor regression than either antibody. Taken together, BALB\/c-hVISTA mouse is a novel non-human animal model appropriate for preclinical efficacy study of human VISTA antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b4db44b9-f050-46f4-9539-45a073ebf837\/@s03B8ZQn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Immune checkpoint,VISTA,PD1H,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17515"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"b2a2c7f4-9e9b-4486-a725-dcc33c899ee0","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b2a2c7f4-9e9b-4486-a725-dcc33c899ee0\/@s03B8ZQn\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Weiwei Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Honghong Bao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hao Qi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Gao<\/i><\/presenter>.

While research focused on improving adaptive immune functions in CTCL, we investigated the role of 1) the &#8220;do not eat me signal&#8221; (CD47), and PD-L1, as a dual (innate and adaptive IC)-targeting strategy in CTCL. RNA sequencing and flow cytometric analysis showed that CTCL tumor cells and CTCL cell lines (MyLa, Hut78, HH, and H9 cells) overexpressed CD47 and PD-L1 compared with healthy control, and CD47 positively correlated with PD-L1 in CTCL patients. Overexpression of CD47 and PD-L1 was induced by high <i>MYC<\/i> expression in CTCL tumor cells lines. In addition, the signal-regulatory protein (SIRP)&#945; receptor for CD47 and PD-L1 were significantly more abundant on macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells in CTCL patients than healthy control by flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, the RNA sequencing data indicated that the M2 macrophages, immature dendritic cells, and inhibitory receptors expressed natural killer cells in CTCL patients were higher than in healthy control. Notably, TTI-621 (SIRP&#945;Fc) treatment decreased M2 macrophage, immature dendritic cells, and inhibitory receptors expressed natural killer cells in CTCL patients at the end of the treatment, compared to baseline. <i>In vitro<\/i>, TTI-621 treatment increased the macrophage phagocytic activity compared to untreated control. Moreover, TTI-621 synergized with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (durvalumab) to reprogram M2-like TAMs, induced by MyLa supernatant, to M1-like phenotypes. The simultaneous blockade of both CD47 and PD-L1 inhibited growth of CTCL cell lines more potently than each single antibody alone or blank control <i>in vitro.<\/i> Enhanced CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell mediated killing was detected using a chromium-release assay following dual blockade of in CTCL cell lines, suggesting anti-CD47 and anti-PD-L1 may synergistically facilitate elimination of CTCL tumor cells through specific pathways. RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that these effects were mediated by cell death related pathways such as apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that CD47 and PD-L1 are critical regulators of innate and adaptive immune surveillance in CTCL and that dual targeting of CD47 and PD-L1 will provide insight into tumor immunotherapy to improve tumor control in CTCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7ad4cdde-2887-4638-b38a-fc389181a705\/@s03B8ZQn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Durvalumab,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17517"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhen Han<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingye Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiwei Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chingyu Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yate-Ching Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanjun Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James F.

These processes rely on a transcription-translation feedback loop controlled by a family of circadian-relevant genes, including the transcription factors (CLOCK\/BMAL1) and key circadian genes (<i>Cryptochromes<\/i> (CRY1 and CRY2) and <i>Period<\/i> (PER1, PER2, and PER3)). Previous studies showed that the circadian clock could affect the DNA damage response pathway. Therefore, we hypothesized that alterations of the circadian clock genes might associate with tumor mutation burden (TMB). Here, we explored the associations of mutations in the circadian clock genes with TMB and response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: The ICIs treatment NSCLC cohort from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) was used for exploring the associations of mutations in the clock genes (CLOCK, BMAL1, CRY1, CRY2, PER1, PER2, and PER3) with TMB, tumor neoantigen burden (TNB), and ICIs efficacy. The relationships between the clock genes mutations and TMB, PD-L1 expression, levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and prognostic value were investigated in the TCGA-NSCLC cohort.<br \/>Results: In the TCGA-NSCLC cohort, the most frequently mutated gene was PER3 (1.4%), followed by PER1 (1.3%), CRY1 (1.1%), and CRY2 (0.7%). The median TMB was significantly higher in the clock genes<i> <\/i>mutations (MT) group compared to the wild type (WT) group (10.1 vs 5.9 muts\/Mb, P &#60; 0.0001). However, the data revealed that PD-L1 expression and the levels of TILs did not have any associations with mutations of the clock genes. Furthermore, there was no difference in overall survival (OS) for patients with MT or WT tumors. In the MSKCC ICIs cohort, mutations in the clock genes were also associated with higher TMB (16.7 vs 4.3 muts\/Mb, P &#60; 0.0001) and higher median predicted neoantigen burden (1338 vs 293, P &#60; 0.0001). Compared to the WT group, patients in the MT group had a significantly longer median progression-free survival (PFS) (23.0 vs 5.2 months, HR: 0.45 [95%CI: 0.25-0.81], P = 0.0216) with PD-1 plus CTLA-4 blockade.

Preclinical data showed that IFx-Hu2.0 primes both innate and adaptive immune responses through the expression of Emm55, a bacterial protein. Recognition by antigen presenting cells (APC) is followed by interantigenic epitope spreading to tumor antigens expressed in transfected tumor cells. The current study was designed to determine the extent of epitope spreading through quantitating the IgM and IgG responses to known melanoma antigens. Plasma samples (pre-and post-intralesional injection of IFx-Hu2.0) from seven patients with unresectable stage III-IV cutaneous melanoma enrolled in a first-in-human, phase 1 open-label trial (NCT03655756) were analyzed and compared using PEPperCHIP&#174; Melanoma Antigen Microarrays with 21 melanoma-associated antigens converted into linear 15 amino acid peptides with a peptide-peptide overlap of 13 amino acids. The resulting array contained 4,125 different peptides printed in duplicate along with multiple control peptides. The arrays were incubated with plasma samples [collected immediately prior to and four weeks (N=6) or two weeks (N=1) post treatment and three weeks post injection #2 (N=1)] at three dilutions, followed by staining with secondary and control antibodies. Readout with a LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System was followed by quantification of spot intensities and peptide annotation with PepSlide&#174; Analyzer. For generation of IgM\/IgG intensity ratios, a minimal baseline intensity of 200 fluorescence units was set. Changes in both IgM and IgG epitope recognition to melanoma-associated antigens was detected in all patients. Baseline and IFx-Hu2.0-induced antibody response profiles for all individuals were heterogeneous, with no dominant common antibody response, pointing to the unpredictability of specific epitope recognition and a relative independence from MHC haplotype requirements due to epitope spreading. Notwithstanding the signals from adjacent peptides, high numbers of newly recognized melanoma epitopes were observed for all patients and all plasma samples. These data suggest enhanced crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune cells, epitope presentation by APC to T and B cells and epitope spreading to multiple previously unrecognized tumor epitopes. IgM and IgG levels were maintained at four weeks post IFx-Hu2.0 administration suggesting continued primary recognition and maturation of effector immune response. B cells represent an important proportion of infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma and are associated with good prognosis in most cancer types. Studies are underway to determine the relative contribution of B cell activity to anti-tumor effects seen with IFx-Hu2.0.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2593dac1-4959-4f07-93dc-292ceb83a4fa\/@t03B8ZQo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Immunotherapy,Antibody,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17520"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patricia Lawman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Shamblott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashraf Dehlawi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Bianco<\/i><\/presenter>.

These observations revealed that propolis can be an anti-cancer drugs, however the immunological effects upon tumor microenvironments of these naturally occurring components has not been elucidated.

AMG 794 redirects T cells to kill CLDN6-expressing tumor cells and is being developed for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). CLDN6 is a compelling tumor antigen that is expressed during embryonic and fetal development, transcriptionally silenced in adult tissues, and re-expressed on the surface of NSCLC and EOC cells. By immunohistochemistry, CLDN6 staining of the cell membrane was observed in 27% of non-squamous NSCLC (n = 63) and 69% of EOC (n = 92) samples, the majority of which were of the high-grade serous ovarian cancer subtype. Expression of CLDN6 protein was not detected in most normal adult tissues, with rare CLDN6 immunostaining limited to individual cells in the pituitary, pancreas, small intestine, kidney, and female reproductive organs. AMG 794 is a fully human BiTE<sup>&#174;<\/sup> molecule that binds both human and cynomolgus monkey CLDN6 and CD3. AMG 794 binds human CLDN6 and CD3 with equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D<\/sub>) of 13 nM and 36 nM, respectively. <i>In vitro,<\/i> AMG 794 redirects human T cells to kill CLDN6-expressing cancer cells with a half-maximal lysis concentration (EC<sub>50<\/sub>) of 2.6 &#177; 1.1 pM to 127.4 &#177; 53.4 pM. Consistent with the mechanism of action of BiTE<sup>&#174;<\/sup> immune therapy, AMG 794 induces T cell activation and transient production of cytokines in co-cultures of T cells and CLDN6-expressing tumor cells. Remarkably, AMG 794 binding and cytotoxic activity is selective for CLDN6 over other claudin family proteins, despite high homology in the extracellular loops with CLDN9. Weekly dosing of AMG 794 significantly inhibited the growth of established lung and ovarian xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice injected with human T cells. Anti-tumor activity was associated with an increase in tumor-infiltrating T cells. AMG 794 was well tolerated in a one-month repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey, with evidence for target engagement. The potent, selective activity of AMG 794 for CLDN6-expressing NSCLC and EOC cells, together with an acceptable nonclinical safety profile, supported the advancement of AMG 794 into clinical development. A first-in-human study to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of AMG 794 in patients with CLDN6-positive advanced \/ metastatic non-squamous NSCLC or EOC will be enrolling patients in March 2022.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d0a3e4c-c7e6-4502-90bb-3a40060a037a\/@t03B8ZQo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,T cell engager,Claudin 6,BiTE antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17523"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"730ac993-856a-4e66-9131-e98bdd1d1ee9","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/730ac993-856a-4e66-9131-e98bdd1d1ee9\/@t03B8ZQo\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth Pham<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anja Henn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beate Sable<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joachim Wahl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kip Conner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Matthes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shivani Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodolfo Yabut<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Famke Aeffner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Lewis Wilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Anlahr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Dahlhoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vijay Kale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Friedrich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Raum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Kufer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Coxon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Stienen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie M.

TIGIT and PVRIG, are exciting novel targets for immune-oncology which function as immune inhibitory receptors expressed on both T and NK cells and have been reported to inhibit anti-tumor activity. SLD2435, a novel humanized IgG1 bispecific antibody simultaneously targeting human TIGIT and PVRIG that synergistically enhances both NK and T cell functions, demonstrates significant preclinical anti-tumor efficacy. Here, we reported the discovery, development and characterization of SLD2435 for potential use in cancer patients. Anti-human TIGIT mAb was generated from mouse hybridoma whereas anti-human PVRIG Ab was discovered from Alpaca as single-domain antibody (sdAb). Both Abs were identified based on the ability to block the interaction of TIGIT or PVRIG with their cognate ligands (PVR or PVRL2 respectively) and for the ability to enhance primary human NK cytotoxicity over tumor cell lines as well as to promote the function of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Lead anti-human PVRIG sdAb was then selected and fused to the N-terminal of lead anti-human TIGIT mAb with a peptide linker for SLD2435 construction followed by subsequent testing in multiple abovementioned assays. SLD2435 simultaneously bound to human TIGIT and PVRIG with sub-nanomolar affinity and showed cross-reactivity to respective cynomolgus targets together with strong avidity mediated receptor-ligand interaction blocking at both protein and cellular levels. <i>In vitro<\/i> functional studies revealed that SLD2435 induced potent primary human NK cell mediated cytotoxicity over WiDr tumor cells better than the combination of anti-PVRIG and anti-TIGIT mAbs. It could also trigger preferential depletion of TIGIT+\/TIGIT+PVRIG+ Treg via ADCC. In addition, SLD2435 enhanced IFN-&#947; production of CMV antigen-specific CD8+ T cells culturing with PVR+PVRL2+HLA matched Colo205 tumor cells and had synergistic effect on T cell activation when further combined with an anti-PD-L1 mAb. In consistent with <i>in vitro<\/i> results, SLD2435 displayed significant anti-tumor efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i> in a HuPBMC A375 xenograft model. At last, SLD2435 demonstrated great developability profile under various stress tests. Taken together, these data support the further development of SLD2435 as a potential novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/552d369a-7359-48e5-b653-a727fd327a34\/@t03B8ZQo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,PVRIG,Bispecific antibody,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17524"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaofeng Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yayuan Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoqing Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fengli Shan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenna Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengyu Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huiming Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hai Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenqing Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuoxiao Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renhong Tang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Blocking of CD47 binding to its receptor, SIRP&#945;, on macrophages leads to inhibition of macrophage activation and phagocytosis. Several monoclonal anti-CD47 antibodies are currently in various stages of clinical development. However, since CD47 is also expressed on normal cells such as red blood cells and platelets, anti-CD47 antibodies also caused on-target side effects during clinical evaluations, such as anemia and red blood cell hemagglutination. To minimize the on-target side effects of anti-CD47 antibodies, we have generated anti-CD47 prodrugs. By screening a phage peptide library, we identified peptides that can specifically block the anti-CD47 antibody binding activity. These peptides were fused to the humanized anti-CD47 antibody via a linker containing protease substrate sequences to derive the anti-CD47 antibody prodrug. We demonstrated that these anti-CD47 antibody prodrugs had significantly diminished CD47 binding activity and were unable to block CD47:SIRP&#945; interaction. Upon cleavage of the anti-CD47 antibody prodrug with proteases, the antibody regained full activities in both binding to CD47 and blocking CD47:SIRP&#945; interaction. Importantly, we showed that the anti-CD47 antibody prodrug had minimal hemagglutination and RBC binding activities. Since different tumors may have different types of protease activities, anti-CD47 prodrugs with different types of protease substrates have been generated to demonstrate that the anti-CD47 prodrug can be used for treating various tumor types. These data suggest that novel anti-CD47 antibody prodrugs are promising candidates for the next generation anti-CD47 therapeutics with improved safety profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b7319e7-81a7-4660-a92f-e6133e6ff23a\/@t03B8ZQo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Prodrugs,Antibody,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17525"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Richard Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Haishan Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The TTDR design is based on transcriptional control of the essential HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP27 using a tumor specific CEA promoter, coupled with translational control of the key neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 accomplished by introducing multiple tandem copies of miRNA binding sites for miR-124 and miR-143 which are downregulated in tumors but abundantly expressed in normal brain tissues. The anti-tumor and immune stimulatory properties of VG2025 are also enhanced by expressing a pair of cytokines (IL-12 and IL-15\/IL-15R&#945; complex) that are linked by 2A cleavage peptides and controlled by the tumor specific promoter CXCR4. The dual regulation strategy was verified <i>in vitro<\/i> and shown to be highly selective. Growth of VG2025 virus correlated with CEA expression in a panel of cell lines including normal cells and a selection of tumor cells with varying CEA levels. miRNA-mediated regulation of ICP34.5 expression was validated by transfecting HEK293t cells with miR-124 and miR-143 precursors, followed by infection with VG2025. RT-qPCR testing revealed a significant decrease in the levels of viral ICP34.5 mRNA when the miRNA was present. VG2025 virus replication was evaluated in a variety of human tumor cell lines, and two cell lines representing NSCLC and pancreatic cancer (A549 and BxPC3, respectively) were selected for testing in a humanized mouse model, where VG2025 displayed strong <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy. The immune stimulatory characteristics of VG2025, and the bioactivity of expressed cytokines, were demonstrated in a syngeneic mouse colorectal tumor model (CT26) and lymphoma model (A20) using VG2026, which is an identical mouse specific variant of VG2025 that expresses murine IL-12 in place of human IL-12. In addition to a significant reduction in the growth of injected tumors, we observed a clear abscopal effect on contralateral tumors, indicating a robust anti-tumor immune response with an immune memory effect. Due to the tendency of HSV-1 to establish latency which may lead to neurotoxicity and potential safety concerns, we performed a safety pharmacology study by subcutaneously inoculating immunocompetent DBA mice with VG2025. Absence of neurotoxicity was further verified by more aggressive routes of administration, including via the nose and by corneal scarification. The risk of VG2025 reactivation from a latent state was evaluated in a two-step study: latent infection in the CNS was first established and confirmed, then the trigeminal ganglia were removed and co-cultured with Vero cells to detect reactivation-related cytopathic effects. All studies showed that VG2025 was safe with no reactivation events detected.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f29e924d-ac95-4730-a2c6-54af2b5acd22\/@t03B8ZQo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Regulation,MicroRNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17526"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanal Murad<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guoyu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>I-Fang Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zahid Delwar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitry Chouljenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Will Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luke Bu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronghua Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Jia<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the mechanisms of response to ICIs are still poorly understood in patients with mTNBC. Here we investigate immune correlates of response in patients with mTNBC treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor-targeting pembrolizumab and doxorubicin (n=9).<br \/>Methods: Patients received pembrolizumab and doxorubicin every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles followed by pembrolizumab maintenance until disease progression. Objective response rates (ORR per RECIST 1.1) were: N=1 complete response (CR), N=4 partial responses (PR), N=3 stable disease (SD), and N=1 progression of disease (PD). Baseline tumor biopsies were collected for PD-L1 (22C3 antibody) and TILs analysis, and peripheral blood was collected for immune correlatives. Circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were assessed by high parameter flow cytometry with samples collected at timepoints cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1), cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1), and cycle 3 day 1 (C3D1)<br \/>Results: No association between response and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scoring or PD-L1 expression were observed. Circulating exhausted CD8+ T cells (PD-1 high CD39+) were identified at baseline in all patients, with the patient with PD having a low frequency of exhausted CD8+ T cells (0.08% in PD vs. 0.3% mean in CR\/PR\/SD) at baseline. In the patient with PD, the following results were observed relative to other patients: high levels of antibody-secreting B cells (ASC, 15.2% in PD vs. 1.5% mean in CR\/PR\/SD), CD4+ follicular helper T cells (Tfh, 8.47% PD vs. 2.6% mean in CR\/PR\/SD), and terminally differentiated NK cells (11.0% PD vs. 6.3% mean CR\/PR\/SD) at baseline. From baseline to C2D1, the patient who achieved CR demonstrated robust expansion of exhausted CD8+ T cells (4.4-fold change in CR vs. 1.4-fold change in PR\/SD\/PD).<br \/>Conclusion: Our data suggests that both baseline immune profile &#8216;setpoints&#8217; and dynamic remodeling of immune features, including expansion of exhausted CD8+ T cells, are associated with response to ICIs in patients with mTNBC. Lack of response to ICIs is defined not only by a lack of CD8+ T cell expansion, but also by high levels of circulating ASCs, Tfh, and terminal NK cells at baseline. Additional studies to further explore and validate features of this T cell: B cell: NK cell axis and response to ICIs in patients with mTNBC are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a4aba1c9-7660-4657-83d6-bc2dde8636a0\/@u03B8ZQp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pembrolizumab,Doxorubicin,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18470"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Colt A.

However, ICIs may trigger accelerated tumor progression, regarded as hyperprogressive disease (HPD), in certain patients, and it is still challenging to define HPD. We aimed to investigate the landscape of HPD and the prognostic value of its different definitions in advanced solid cancer patients treated with ICIs.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study for solid cancer patients receiving ICIs. Among them, only unresectable or metastatic cancer patients were included in this analysis. Tumor response was evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. In patients who showed progressive disease (PD) by RECIST 1.1 at the first tumor evaluation, HPD was defined according to the following three criteria: A) tumor growth kinetics (TGK) ratio (TGK<sub>post-ICI<\/sub>\/TGK<sub>pre-ICI<\/sub> &#62;=2, B) &#62;=10mm increase in sum of target lesion (SUM<sub>target<\/sub>)and at least one of the following two criteria - 1) &#62;=40% increase in SUM<sub>target<\/sub> or 2) &#62;=20% increase in SUM<sub>target<\/sub> and the appearance of new lesions in at least two different organs, C) TGK ratio &#62;=2 and &#62;50% increase in SUM<sub>target<\/sub>. The discriminatory ability of three definitions in terms of overall survival (OS) were evaluated by the chi-square, C-statistics, and prediction error with integrated Brier score.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 427 patients were included; head and neck (n=22, 5.2%), lung (n=173, 40.5%), breast (n=8, 1.9%), gastrointestinal tract (n=99, 23.2%), hepatobiliary pancreas (n=57, 13.3%), genitourinary (n=56, 13.1%), melanoma (n=5, 1.2%), and others (n=7, 1.6%). Incidences of HPD were 4.9%, 14.8%, and 11.5% in definition A, B, C, respectively. The incidence of HPD was relatively low (2.7%-9.5%) in non-small cell lung cancer compared to other cancer types (10.1%-21.5% in esophagogastric cancer, 3.9%-21.6% in hepatobiliary pancreas cancer, and 5.5%-22.5% in genitourinary cancer). Median OS was the worst for patients with HPD, which ranged from 4.8 months to 4.9 months according to definition A-C. After multivariate analysis adjusting for cancer types, ICIs types, and the number of prior anti-cancer therapy, each definition remained a significant factor for OS (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001, respectively). Both chi-square and C-statistics of definition B were higher than those of definition A and C, although prediction error with integrated brier scores was similar between three definitions.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Incidences of HPD appear to be various according to its definitions and cancer types. Given that the RECIST-based definition B not requiring pre-ICI imaging, showed similar discriminatory ability to predict dismal OS compared to TGK-based ones, it may be the most feasible and convenient measure to capture HPD in daily clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a7941937-208d-4528-9d83-c68a659f854e\/@u03B8ZQp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Advanced solid tumors,Survival,Hyperprogression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18471"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jwa Hoon Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soohyeon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hee Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jee Hyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun Joo Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae-Yong Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeon Hee Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Youn Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Il-Hwan Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang-We Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dae Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Lyun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Cheol Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chang-Min Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Changhoon Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shinkyo Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae Ho Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seyoung Seo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin-Hee Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sook Ryun Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

Increasing treatment options for recurrent\/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R\/M HNSCC) mandates prediction of the therapeutic response of anti-PD-1 antibody alone as well as optimization of the treatment sequence. In view of improving biomarkers predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy for R\/M HNSCC, we hypothesized that biomarkers can be personalized depending on clinicopathological backgrounds and treatment sequence.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this study, we retrospectively included formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, peripheral blood cell counts at treatment, clinicopathological information, and outcome data for patients with R\/M HNSCC receiving nivolumab across 22 institutions in Japan (N = 100). FFPE samples were subjected to 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) and image cytometry analysis (Tsujikawa T et al. Cell Reports, 2017) to quantitatively evaluate CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, CD66b<sup>+<\/sup> granulocytes, mast cells, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 expression in a single slide. Intratumoral and circulating immune cell frequencies were comparatively analyzed between responders (CR, n = 14; PR, n = 39) and non-responders (SD, n = 2; PD, n = 45).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of 100 patients included, responders had significantly lower smoking and alcohol index, higher incidence of immune related adverse events, and higher PD-L1 expression in immune cells as well as PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) than non-responders. Next, focusing on the history of prior therapy, stratified analysis revealed that the frequency of NK cells was associated with nivolumab response in patients with prior cetuximab use, but not in cetuximab-na&#239;ve status. Furthermore, stratified analysis by patient age revealed that nivolumab response was significantly associated with high CPS and lymphoid-inflamed profiles based on cell densities of nine immune cell lineages in the group aged 65 years or older, but not in the group under 65 years of age. On the contrary, the neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratios (NLR) in peripheral blood counts at nivolumab treatment were significantly lower in responders (mean 4.96) than those in non-responders (mean 10.46) in the group under 65 years of age, but not in those over 65 years of age (7.41 versus 8.47).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Using peripheral blood data and tumor tissue profiling stratified by patient age and prior treatment might provide better predictive biomarkers in nivolumab response to HNSCC. Further preclinical and clinical studies elucidating immune mechanisms in different patient backgrounds will be warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2834de0c-3b34-4e44-9cf1-043c9faa4348\/@u03B8ZQp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18472"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Takahiro Tsujikawa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuchika Ohno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sumiyo Saburi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junichi Mitsuda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kanako Yoshimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alisa Kimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroki Morimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaku Ohmura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akihito Arai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Ogi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saya Shibata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosuke Ariizumi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akihisa Tasaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryosuke Takahashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yumiko Tateishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroaki Kawabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadakatsu Ikeda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kei-ichi Morita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatsuhiko Tsunoda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takumi Akashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morito Kurata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Issei Imoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasushi Shimizu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akihito Watanabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yukinori Asada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryuichi Hayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Saito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroyuki Ozawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiyoaki Tsukahara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuhiko Oridate<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arata Horii<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Maruo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuhiro Hanai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hidenori Inohara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Iwai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Fujii<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken-ichi Nibu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shigemichi Iwae<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tsutomu Ueda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryuji Yasumatsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirohito Umeno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Muneyuki Masuda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyoko Itoh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shigeru Hirano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahiro Asakage<\/i><\/presenter>.

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and second-generation antiandrogens have become the new standard of care for men with prostate cancer. However, resistance to these therapies remains a problem. <i>TP53<\/i> mutations and <i>PTEN<\/i> loss have been associated with patients who fail to respond to anti-androgen therapies and complex interactions between AR signaling and the immune system means that these therapies have the potential to affect antitumor immune responses. Here, we characterize treatment responses of ADT alone and in combination with antiandrogen therapy using apalutamide (Apa) in a mouse model of <i>Pten\/Trp53<\/i>-deficeint castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Twenty-eight-week-old conditional <i>Pten\/Trp53<\/i>-double knockout mice were randomized as untreated control or treated with ADT via orchidectomy for four weeks followed by vehicle or Apa therapy for an additional four weeks. While both treatments reduced tumor burden, there was no difference between treatments. Treatment responses in were further evaluated and were judged as favorable or non-favorable, relative to median tumor burden. Analysis of individual treatment responses indicated that 31.3% (5\/16) of mice treated with ADT+Apa had tumor burden reductions &#62;20% (relative to the median) compared to 6.3% (1\/16) in ADT, and in both instances, 37.5% (6\/16) of mice treated with ADT or ADT+Apa had tumor burden increases &#62;20%. IHC showed lower nuclear\/cytoplasm expression of AR in ADT+Apa treated mice and the reduction was more pronounced in favorable responders. ADT+Apa treated mice had lower gene expression levels of <i>Ar <\/i>than ADT alone and AR target genes (<i>Fkbp5<\/i>, <i>Tmprss2<\/i>, <i>Timp4<\/i> and <i>Nkx3.1<\/i>) were decreased in ADT+Apa favorable responders whereas these target genes as well as AR-regulating genes (<i>Myc<\/i> and <i>Igf1r<\/i>, <i>Igf1<\/i>) were higher in ADT+Apa non-favorable responders. Cancer cell proliferation did not differ between treatments, but cancer glands in ADT+Apa treated mice had significantly greater IHC expression levels of cleaved caspase 3, a marker for apoptosis, and were greatest in ADT+Apa favorable responders. Levels of p-S6 ribosomal protein, a downstream target of Akt, were higher in the cancer glands of ADT+Apa but were reduced in stromal and infiltrating immune cells. Immune profiling by gene expression and flow cytometry showed enhanced macrophage involvement and reduced MDSC\/granulocyte activity in ADT+Apa treated mice.

Acting only on T lymphocytes may, however, not be sufficient, e.g. in immunologically-cold tumors or due to de novo or acquired resistance. Moreover, immune-related AEs remain hurdles of T cell therapies. To overcome these limitations and to awaken the immune system in an agnostic way against the tumor, we have developed a genetically modified cell-based autologous hematopoietic stem cell platform (Temferon) delivering immunotherapeutic payloads into the TME through Tie-2 expressing monocytes (TEMs), a subset of tumor infiltrating macrophages. TEM-GBM is an ongoing open-label, Phase 1\/2a dose-escalating study evaluating the safety &#38; efficacy of Temferon in up to 21 newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma &#38; unmethylated MGMT promoter assigned to 7 different cohorts (3 pts each) differing by Temferon dose (0.5-4.0x10<sup>6<\/sup>\/kg) and conditioning regimen (BCNU+ or Busulfan+Thiotepa). By Oct 15<sup>th<\/sup>, 2021, 15 pts (cohort 1-5) had received escalating doses of Temferon with a median follow up of 267 days (range: 60-749). Rapid engraftment and hematological recovery from nonmyeloablative conditioning occurred in all pts. Temferon-derived differentiated cells, as determined by the presence of vector genomes in the DNA, were found at increasing proportions in PB and BM, reaching up to 30% at 1 month for the highest cohorts tested (2.0x10<sup>6<\/sup>\/kg) and persisting up to 18 months, albeit at lower levels. Despite the significant proportion of engineered cells, only very low median concentrations of IFN&#945; were detected in the plasma (D+30, 5.9; D+90, 8.8pg\/mL) and in the cerebrospinal fluid (D+30, 1.5; D+90, 2.4pg\/mL), indicating tight regulation of vector expression. SAEs were mostly attributed to conditioning chemotherapy (e.g. infections) or disease progression (e.g. seizures). 1 SUSAR (persistent GGT elevation) has occurred. Median OS is 14 mth from surgery (11 mth post Temferon). Four pts from the low dose cohorts underwent 2<sup>nd<\/sup> surgery. These recurrent tumors contained gene-marked cells and expressed IFN-responsive genes, indicative of local IFN&#945; release by TEMs. In 1 pt, a stable lesion (as defined by MRI) had a higher proportion of T cells &#38; TEMs, an increased IFN-response signature and myeloid re-programming revealed by scRNAseq, as compared to a synchronous, progressing tumor. TCR sequencing of blood and tumor samples showed a post-treatment increase in the cumulative frequency of tumor-associated T cell clones identified in 1<sup>st <\/sup>and 2nd<sup> <\/sup>surgery specimens (up to 4 out of 9 subjects). These results provide initial evidence for on-target activity of Temferon in GBM, to be consolidated with longer follow up in the higher dose cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0ef770d-3bd8-41f0-9519-c1f49a705b4c\/@u03B8ZQp\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cell & Gene Therapy,Macrophages,Tumor Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18475"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bernhard Gentner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaetano Finocchiaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Farina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marica Eoli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessia Capotondo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Anghileri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Barcella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Grazia Bruzzone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Giovanni Carrabba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valeria Cuccarini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgio D'Alessandris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Di Meco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valeria Ferla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Ferroli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filippo Gagliardi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federico Legnani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pietro Mortini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Maria Naldini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Olivi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Pallini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Patanè<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosina Paterra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bianca Pollo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Saini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Snider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Brambilla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefania Mazzoleni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Zambanini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlo Russo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi Naldini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabio Ciceri<\/i><\/presenter>.

We previously reported a link between intratumoral copper levels and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and therefore sought to elucidate the wider impact of copper chelation on immune evasion strategies (Voli et al 2020). Here we profile key elements of the neuroblastoma tumor microenvironment which work in concert to promote immunosuppression and tumor progression. Using the murine TH-<i>MYCN<\/i> model, animals were treated daily with the copper chelation agent tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) for seven days before tumor resection and processing. Transcriptome analyses using single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed copper chelation positively skewed the functional status of tumor, immune and stromal compartments to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. This was supported by a tissue microarray screen using NanoString Digital Spatial Profiling which identified increased immune cell infiltration and regions of active tumor killing. High-resolution mass-spectrometry detected upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins and exclusive antigenic signatures in peptide repertoires. A multiplex cytokine array indicated an improved anti-tumorigenic response underscored by T cell and Natural Killer cell activation. Importantly, combination of copper chelation and anti-GD2 antibody therapy led to tumor regression and significantly improved survival <i>in vivo<\/i>. Collectively, this study demonstrates the ability of copper chelation to successfully mitigate tumoral immune evasion strategies while providing remarkable insight into neuroblastoma biology. Findings provide crucial evidence in support of combining clinically approved copper chelators with immunotherapy to improve outcomes for neuroblastoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/737dcb82-2793-4a5a-8dd6-53987ac21900\/@u03B8ZQp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Neuroblastoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18476"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jourdin R.

Kadmon has established a cytokine fusion antibody platform to synergize the antibody and cytokine anti-tumor activity, extend cytokine serum half-life and reduce systemic toxicity. One of novel asset in this platform is KD050, an anti-PD-1\/IL-15 bi-functional antibody with strong PD-1 antagonist function, but lower lymphocyte stimulation enabled by a novel mutation on the IL-15. KD050 was designed to deliver PD-1-mediated, avidity-driven lymphocyte stimulation to PD-1+ tumor-in&#64257;ltrating lymphocytes (TIL) while minimally affecting circulating peripheral natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. We have reported previously (SITC2020, Abstract ID: 573) that KD050 (also called mut-1N-IL-15\/38B2) showed robust anti-tumor efficacy and low systemic toxicity to treat hPD-L1-CT26 tumor inoculated in hPD-1\/hPD-L1 transgenic BALB\/c mice. Here, we conducted the MOA study in the same animal model by treating the mice with vehicle, KD050, PD-1 antibody (38B2), non-target counterpart of KD050 (ntKD050) and combination of 38B2 and ntKD050. The peripheral blood, draining lymph nodes and tumors were isolated at day 7 after the treatment. Immune cell types were analyzed by FACS for all isolated samples, and Nanostring RNA sequence and IHC was performed for the isolated tumors. Compared to the other treatments, we observed significant higher effector memory CD8 T cells (EM CD8 T), expanded Granzyme B+ and CD8+ T cells, and high CD8\/CD4 ratio in tumor when treated with KD050. Tumor Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis revealed that many lymphocyte markers were specific to KD050. Functional Enrichment by Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) in tumor showed that many cell types especially CD8 T cells, cytotoxic cells and Th1 cells were statistically (p. adjust &#60; 0.05) significant higher relative to other treatments. We further found that binding of KD050 to PD-1 mediated delivery of IL15 to PD-1+ T cells and the simultaneous binding of KD050 to PD-1 and IL-2 receptor &#946;&#947; (IL-2R&#946;&#947;) resulted in enhanced potency of IL-2R&#946;&#947; activation and anti-tumor activity. In conclusion, we demonstrated that KD050 treatment activated different gene pathways which were unique from PD-1 monospecific antibody 38B2, ntKD050 alone or combined with 38B2. These findings indicated that KD050 may have potential to benefit patients that were not responsive to the PD-1\/PD-L1 treatment or cytokine treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4111b77c-9b1d-42be-b746-16cc6bde941e\/@u03B8ZQp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,PD-1 cytokine fusion bi-functional antibody,Tumor immunity,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18477"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zhanna Polonskaya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tzu-Pei Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stella Martomo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xenia Luna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhikai Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stanley Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Mora<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeegar P.

Comprehensive mechanism of action studies show that GrB-Fc-IT4 effectively induces cell death <i>in vitro <\/i>against a broad selection of tumor types with high specificity. The intracellular pathway includes irreversible activation of the caspase cascade and independent mitochondrial depolarization leading to an intense apoptotic cellular damage. This activation occurs quickly and efficiently. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice showed that GrB-Fc-IT4 was cleared bi-exponentially from plasma with a rapid initial clearance (t <sub>&#189;alpha<\/sub> = 0.36 hours) followed by a prolonged terminal-phase plasma half-life (t <sub>1\/2beta<\/sub> = 35 hours) similar to that of IgGs. Based on our pharmacokinetic study, we employed a QODX5 therapy schedule and demonstrated impressive antitumor activity against several tumor models including PDX-lung, A459 (NSCLC) and MDA-MB231(TNBC) tumor models. In the present study we compared the <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor efficacy of GrB-Fc-IT4 against A549 (NSCLC) tumor cell line, using two different dosing schedules (QODx5 vs QWx5). There was a clear dose and schedule dependence and that treating mice bearing A549 tumors with 32mg\/kg\/dose using a QOWx5 schedule induced a complete tumor growth inhibition (7\/10 tumors regressed) with 3\/10 tumors showing no growth up to 50 days after the last dose. Preliminary results suggest that GrB-Fc-IT4 may reduce the formation of spontaneous A549 metastasis into lungs. Further studies are planned to examine the potential of the fusion construct to prevent spontaneous metastatic spread in lung tumor models. Although the fusion construct cross-reacts with the murine Fn14 antigen, maximum tolerated dose studies have confirmed that GrB-Fc-IT4 is a safe product, showing no evidence of toxicity (weight loss) in mice treated with up to 500mg\/kg. This suggests that the therapeutic index (TI) for this class of agents is &#62;4. Our data suggest that GrB-Fc-IT4 is a novel class of antitumor agents with a unique mechanism of action. This agent seems to be an exceptionally safe and effective drug and appears to be an ideal candidate for advancing to clinical trials.

While T cell infiltration of tumors is frequently cited as a measure of OV immunogenicity, this measure is non-specific as OVs elicit a strong virus-directed T cell response, and it remains unknown what proportion of T cells expanded by OV therapy are virus-specific vs. tumor-specific or how these T cells distribute across virus-treated and distant tumors. We employed oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in a bilateral flank melanoma mouse model to identify and phenotypically characterize anti-viral and anti-tumor T cells using single cell (sc) RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. Intratumoral NDV therapy to a single flank tumor resulted in increased infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the injected (enestic) and distant (non-enestic) tumors and increased the breadth of the TCR repertoire at both sites with preferential expansion of several dominant clonotypes. There was substantial expansion of the proportion of T cell clonotypes shared between enestic and nonenestic tumors as well as the spleen, indicative of inter-tumor TCR repertoire normalization. In both treated and distant tumors, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of convergent TCR clonotypes, i.e. TCRs encoded by different nucleotide sequences that converge on the same amino acid sequence, implying that the presence of these TCRs in tumors is non-random. Using scRNA and paired TCR sequencing, we demonstrate that NDV therapy leads to expansion of unique clusters of terminally differentiated and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells associated with distinct TCR-based clonotypes. Notably, the predominant phenotypic clusters were distinct between the enestic and non-enestic tumors. Enestic tumors were dominated by CD8+ T cells exhibiting a signature associated with terminal dysfunction (<i>PDCD1, LAG3, TOX<\/i>), while the predominant expanded CD8+ T cells in non-enestic tumors exhibited an activation signature associated with high expression of cytolytic markers. While phenotypic states were conserved for the dominant TCR clones shared across the enestic and non-enestic tumors, TCRs unique to the non-enestic tumor were predominantly associated with an activated T cell state. Taken together, these studies highlight that T cells expanded by OV therapy exhibit unique functional states and TCRs in treated and distant tumors and imply that virus- and tumor-specific T cells may be identified by distinct TCR repertoires and phenotypes. Understanding the balance between virus- and tumor-directed T cells elicited by OV therapy will be key to engineering OVs and designing combination strategies that drive stronger tumor-directed T cell response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bcfaa52f-bb90-491a-ab45-90ac55ef2992\/@v03B8ZQq\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,T lymphocytes,Single cell,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18479"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bharat Burman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Ceglia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Hirschhorn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadna Budhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Levi Mangarin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anton Oseledchyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yonina Bykov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew McPherson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sohrab Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jedd Wolchok<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taha Merghoub<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitriy Zamarin<\/i><\/presenter>.

SVV, serendipitously identified in 2001, is an extremely tumor selective and potent oncolytic virus for a variety of solid human cancers, primarily due to the expression of the receptor of SVV, TEM8, being selectively expressed on the surface of malignant cancer cells and cancer stem cells within a variety of solid tumors.<br \/>SVV has been tested in three clinical trials of patients having neuroendocrine neoplasms as a single intravenous dose monotherapy. Despite this, the results were encouraging with patients having evidence of clinical benefit and only one DLT was reported in the 76 patients treated. Recent data have demonstrated that some oncolytic viruses can enhance efficacy in preclinical models and in clinical trials when the oncolytic virus was injected intratumorally in combination with systemic administration of a CPI(s). The mechanism is primarily believed to be due to the oncolytic virus enhancing T cell infiltration and fostering an anti-tumor immune response.<br \/>SVV was injected intra-tumorally in Pan02 tumors along with aPD1and\/or aCTLA4. SVV reversed any resistance to CPIs and enhanced efficacy over CPI(s) alone resulting in complete cures in &#62;83% of mice with primary and abscopal tumors. SVV plus aPD1+aCTLA4 resulted in 5 of 6 mice cured of their primary tumor. The animals were challenged on their contralateral flank with Pan02 to evaluate systemic and abscopal immune effects. All mice (5\/5) that cleared the primary Pan02 tumor also eradicated the abscopal secondary tumors. Control treated Pan02 tumor-bearing mice were all sacrificed due to tumor burden by day 70 (median survival &#60;50 days). Control animals treated with aPD1+aCTLA4 showed transient tumor regressions but these animals all grew large tumors, requiring sacrifice. In contrast, the SVV+aPD1+aCTLA4 primary tumors were eliminated within 44 days and these animals remain tumor-free out to &#62;110+ days. Contralateral tumors were eradicated in all 5 animals that rejected the primary tumor, demonstrating potent systemic immunity. In the control aPD1+aCTLA4 group, only one animal with contralateral tumor showed prolonged tumor regression.<br \/>SVV treatment caused increases in T-cell infiltration; the combination of SVV+aPD1+aCTLA4 showing the highest infiltration. Phenotypic and gene expression analyses of infiltrating cells will be presented. These studies serve as a foundation for translating SVV oncolytic virotherapy combined with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms with a clinical trial anticipated to begin in H1, 2021.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72bc73bd-5f91-4272-939d-685110d83962\/@v03B8ZQq\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic,Immune checkpoint blockade,Lung cancer: small cell,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19187"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul L.

The tumor suppressor TP53 has been reported to cooperate with DNA methylation and IFN signaling to maintain transcriptional silencing of various repeat sequences, including ERVs. We now report that DNMTis, used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients unfit for chemotherapy, robustly induce expression of ERVs and STING-dependent IFN\/inflammasome signaling in AML with mutations in <i>TP53<\/i>(approximately 10%), a subset with poor prognosis.<br \/><b>First,<\/b> our studies of ERV transcripts (N=13) levels in <i>TP53<\/i> mutant (KASUMI, KG1-1A, U937) and wild-type (WT; MOLM-14, OCI\/AML2, and OCI\/AML3) AML cell lines and primary cells (N=6 mutant, N=6 WT) show that, while <i>TP53<\/i> mutant cells have low baseline ERV expression, DNMTi treatment significantly increases ERV expression, compared with WT TP53 cells (p&#60;0.05). Moreover, inhibiting TP53 in WT <i>TP53<\/i> AML cell lines with the specific TP53 inhibitor pifithrin significantly upregulates ERVs, validating the role of TP53 in suppressing ERVs in AML cells.<br \/><b>Second,<\/b> while TCGA data analysis showed that baseline STING transcript are low in <i>TP53<\/i> mutant vs WT AML, phospho-STING (activated) is actually increased in <i>TP53 <\/i>mutant AML cells and DNMTi treatment further activates STING. Increased expression of downstream IFN\/inflammasome genes in <i>TP53<\/i> mutant AML treated with DNMTi, compared with results in WT cells, validates these results. Moreover, DNMTi combination with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis), which we previously reported to activate STING in breast and ovarian cancer though increasing cytosolic dsDNA and dsRNA, further augments STING activation and IFN\/inflammasome signaling (p&#60;0.05).<br \/><b>Third<\/b>, the IFN\/inflammasome signaling response to DNMTI\/PARPI signaling is directly linked with decreased expression of DNA ds break repair (DSBR) genes and activity, leading to homologous recombination defects (HRD).<br \/><b>Fourth,<\/b> the mechanism for both IFN\/inflammasome signaling and HRD induction is dependent on STING, since both CRISPR\/CAS KO of STING or treatment with the STING inhibitor H-151 can rescue these effects in <i>TP53<\/i> mutant and WT AML cells. Our findings increase understanding of the therapy potential for combining DNMTi+PARPi treatment in AML and suggest use of this paradigm to treat mutant <i>TP53 <\/i>AML. These results also suggest that activating STING may be a key strategy for increasing IFN\/inflammasome signaling in treatment of <i>TP53<\/i> mutant AML and that immune responses may be further augmented with immune therapy in AML and other cancers. <b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dfdcd338-97c0-413c-a514-78ae7a00717f\/@v03B8ZQq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,p53 mutations,inflammasome,STING,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21151"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aksinija A.

However, many patients do not respond to ICI therapy due to development of primary and secondary resistance, and this population represents a large unmet medical need. The critical role of C&#8209;X&#8209;C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) signaling in eliciting an effective response to anti-PD-1 therapy has been recently demonstrated. The CXCR3 chemokine system is instrumental in effector cell recruitment to the tumor and augments intratumoral CD8+ T cell proliferation and function, which are key mechanisms driving anti-tumor immunity and responses to ICI therapy.<br \/>We used our proprietary peptide discovery platform to identify a unique microbiome-derived peptide, SG-3-00802, from bacterial strains associated with response to anti-PD1 inhibitors in patients with melanoma. We subsequently determined that CXCR3 is the target receptor for SG-3-00802 and demonstrated that SG-3-00802 enhanced the activity of CXCR3 in the presence of its endogenous ligands CXCL9\/CXCL10\/CXCL11. Optimization of SG-3-00802 pharmacological properties led to the selection of a novel drug development candidate SG-3-00802DC with improved potency and PK properties. Mechanistically, it increases CXCR3 activation by CXCL11 by greater than 10-fold from a nM to a pM range. As a positive allosteric modulator, SG-3-00802DC can potentially alter the conformation of the primary orthosteric binding site of CXCR3 and enhance the binding affinity of CXCL11, causing increased CXCR3 signaling activity, which is known to drive TIL infiltration that improves overall survival in mouse tumor models and cancer patients. Supporting this concept, we demonstrated that SG-3-00802DC showed anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical mouse tumor models, alone and in combination with anti-PD-1, improved overall survival and increased recruitment of CXCR3+ effector cells into the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Numerous strategies are currently undergoing clinical evaluation to improve long-lasting disease control in broader patient populations by combining ICIs with approved and novel therapeutic agents and procedures. SG-3-00802DC, with its well validated and unique mechanism of action to safely target the CXCR3-driven anti-tumor immune response offers a novel orthogonal approach complementary not only to immunotherapies, but also as a combination strategy with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b2356abd-2c90-46af-94cb-6c5b914323ae\/@v03B8ZQq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Combination therapy,Immune response,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21438"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Dhwani Haria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jina Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justy Guagua<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Archana Nagaraja<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Roskamp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bum-Yeol Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Divya Ravichandar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michi Willcoxon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todd DeSantis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karim Dabbagh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Helena Kiefel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Binding of MSLN with CA125\/MUC16 promotes cell proliferation, local infiltration and metastasis. CD137 is mainly expressed on the surface of activated T cells, NK cells and some other immune cells, mediating the costimulatory signal to enhance the function of T cells and improve the anti-tumor ability of immune cells. Here, we report the development of a bispecific antibody, HK013, targeting both MSLN and CD137 for the treatment of solid tumors. The bispecific antibody HK013 was generated by introducing an anti-MSLN nanobody to the C-terminus of the heavy chain of an anti-CD137 antibody. Two stages were involved: first, we compared the MSLN nanobodies with different binding epitopes to select the optimal candidate. Two nanobodies, R2G12 and R3C7, with the binding affinity of 10<sup>-9<\/sup>M to human MSLN were selected. R3C7 blocks the binding of MORAb-009 to MSLN, while R2G12 does not. However, the bi-specific antibody containing R2G12 exhibited stronger anti-tumor activity than that containing R3C7 in both N87 and H226 mouse xenograft models. We then determined the best isotype and format of the bispecific antibody. While IgG1 or IgG4 (FALA) were selected as the candidate isotypes, the anti-MSLN VHH were linked to the N-terminal or C-terminal of the heavy chain of anti-CD137 antibody. Results showed that in the presence of H226 cells, IFN-&#947; secretion of CD8+T cells was slightly higher as triggered by IgG1 isotype than that by IgG4. However, IgG1-based molecules were not as potent as those in IgG4 in N87 and H226 xenograft models. Moreover, IgG1-based molecules showed cytotoxicity on CD4+T and CD8+T cells while those in IgG4 did not. In addition, HK013 exhibited the minimal ability of non-specific activation of CD137 signaling pathway by Fc receptor in a NF&#954;B-luciferase reporter assay.These data indicate that our bispecific antibodies containing MSLN nanobodies with different epitopes exhibit varied antitumor activity, and antibodies with similar epitopes to MORAb-009 show poor antitumor activity. Molecules in IgG1 may potentially reduce the antitumor activity due to the cytotoxicity to the effector T cells. The bispecific formats are related to the Fc receptor-mediated non-specific activation of CD137 signal, which may potentially cause safety issue. The strong antitumor activity and the lowest non-specific activation of CD137 signal of HK013 makes it the candidate worthwhile of further evaluation of its safety and efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/76140059-cbe0-4a08-9224-2d731544f62e\/@v03B8ZQq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Mesothelin,CD137,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19964"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xing Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dayan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenting Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guodong Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liansheng Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Agonistic antibodies against CD137 have shown promising therapeutic activity in mouse tumor models. However, molecules in the clinical development have shown limitations due to either dose-dependent severe liver toxicity (e.g. Urelumab), or modest antitumor activity (e.g. Utomilumab). We developed ZG033, a fully human IgG4 agonist of CD137 that engages with a exclusive epitope, to achieve a better efficacy and safety profile for immunotherapy. The biophysical properties and anti-tumor activities were determined using in vitro assays and in vivo mice xenograft models, respectively. ZG033 is a safe and potent antibody targeting a ligand competitive epitope, that conserved in human, cynomolgus monkey, and is associated with a differentiated pharmacology and toxicology profile. The complex structure of ZG033\/CD137 was determined by X-ray crystallography. The binding affinity to human 4-1BB of ZG033 determined by Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was moderate (KD=10 nM). ZG033 increased the production of IFN-&#947; by human CD8+T,CD4+T, NK cells in a Fc&#947; receptor-dependent manner, displaying an intermediate activation level between that of Urelumab and Utomilumab. In addition, it led to a dose-dependent increase in the CD137-driven NF&#954;B reporter gene activation. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, ZG033 showed robust single agent anti-tumor activity starting from 0.3 mg\/kg and induced durable antigen-specific immunological memory that prevents the growth of the same tumor cells in the mice re-challenged as compared to Utomilumab. Furthermore, ZG033 combined with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (Atezolizumab) significantly inhibited the growth of colorectal tumor in a human PBMC-engrafted humanized mouse model. Data from toxicology test in humanized CD137 transgenic mice showed that ZG033 was well-tolerated with normal ALT and AST levels. Even high dose of ZG033 (MTD&#8805;180mg\/kg) was achieved in cynomolgus monkeys with no abnormality in hematological indexes, important organs. These data demonstrate that ZG033 is a novel CD137 agonist that displays an favorable safety profile and has a potential in either mono- or combinational immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/50654cc9-cebc-4775-956a-357096f09ccd\/@w03B8ZQr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,CD137,agonist,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20001"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liangwei Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenting Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guodong Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dayan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoli Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liansheng Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite significant clinical efficacy in aNHL (Hutchings et al. JCO 2021), some patients only achieve a partial response or progress upon treatment. To investigate the cellular and molecular factors that correlate with clinical activity of glofitamab, we applied CyTOF, single cell RNA and TCR sequencing to study PBMCs collected at baseline and at cycle 2 of treatment from patients with aNHL. Our cohort included 9 patients with complete response (CR) and 9 patients with progressive disease (PD) status (response assessed at cycle 3) recruited during dose escalation of glofitamab in a Ph1 clinical trial (NP30179).<br \/>We identified a higher proportion of CD4 T cells and a lower proportion of monocytes in CR versus PD patients. Complementary to changes in cell proportions, we explored the covariation of genes across single cells to isolate co-regulated processes and identified several gene expression programs associated with the response status, of which some were shared between two or more cell types while others were cell type-specific. Focusing on the T cell compartment, we further identified subtypes of CD8 and CD4 T cells enriched in either CR or PD patients, and used topic modeling, a computational approach that excels in settings of continuous phenotypes, to contrast the transcriptional state of T cells in CR patients compared to PD patients at baseline and on treatment. Interestingly, we found CR patients to exhibit a less exhausted CD8 T cell population at baseline, confirming our previous observations using tumor bulk RNA sequencing data. Moreover, we observed that hyper-expanded clonotypes were generally enriched in the CD8 T cell compartment, and that the clonal cells had a stronger cytotoxic phenotype compared to non-clonal T cells. This observation was further corroborated when looking at TCR diversity. Indeed, we observed that distinct T cell populations exhibited differences in TCR diversity, with exhausted CD8 T cells showing decreased clonal diversity. Finally, to better understand the changes in CD8 T cells, we performed trajectory inference and observed that the position of individual cells along the pseudotime varied largely according to timepoint and response status. This analysis further allowed us to identify the expression dynamic of numerous markers of T cell exhaustion, as well as transcription factors associated with progenitor and self-renewing state.<br \/>Notwithstanding the limited sample size and patient heterogeneity, our analysis provides a deep characterization of the cellular and molecular features associated with response to glofitamab using peripheral biomarkers. As glofitamab is being evaluated in a number of clinical trials either as a single agent or in combination, our dataset and findings can help broaden the understanding of its mode of action, and might be relevant for patient enrichment and monitoring response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/adcdd1a9-8512-4320-a994-58ceccb5b1cb\/@w03B8ZQr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Biomarkers,Single cell,T cell engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21078"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sina Nassiri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucas Habegger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petra Gerber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vinko Tosevski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamara Hüsser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilio Yanguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvia Herter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Weisser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koorosh Korfi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo Umana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Piccione<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ann-Marie Bröske<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Marina Bacac<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Tumor cells, which express high level of CD47, exploit this mechanism to evade from immune surveillance. CD47 is considered a prominent target for cancer treatment. However, the wide expression of CD47 on normal cells could cause antigen sink and lead to safety issues, such as anemia and thrombocytopenia. ICAM-1 is constitutively present at low levels on endothelial cells, but its overexpression has been observed on various types of tumors, such as primary myeloma, lymphoma and kidney cancer. Here we describe a novel CD47 x ICAM-1 bispecific antibody, which specifically targets CD47<sup>+<\/sup>\/ICAM-1<sup>+<\/sup> tumors in preclinical studies.A novel anti-CD47 antibody and an anti-ICAM-1 antibody were used for the generation of a CD47 x ICAM-1 bispecific antibody. In vitro assays including FACS binding, FACS-based SIRPa blocking, ADCP, RBC binding and hemagglutination were performed to characterize the bispecific CD47 x ICAM-1 antibody. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacies of CD47 x ICAM-1 bispecific antibody were evaluated in xenograft tumor models with high ICAM-1 expression.The CD47 x ICAM-1 bispecific antibody selectively exhibited potent SIRPa blocking and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activity on CD47<sup>+<\/sup>\/ ICAM-1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells, but not on cells lacking ICAM-1 expression. Minimal RBC binding and RBC phagocytosis were observed upon treatment with CD47 x ICAM-1 bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody did not cause any appreciable hemagglutination with up to 1&#181;M antibody treatment. Most importantly, the CD47 x ICAM-1 bispecific antibody demonstrated potent anti-tumor activities in <i>in vivo<\/i> CDX and PDX models that overexpress both CD47 and ICAM-1. Our findings suggest that the novel CD47 x ICAM-1 bispecific antibody selectively binds to CD47 and blocks CD47\/SIRPa binding on ICAM1<sup> <\/sup>overexpressing tumor cells. The bispecific antibody has minimal RBC binding compared to the bivalent CD47 monoclonal antibodies and benchmark anti-CD47 antibodies.
