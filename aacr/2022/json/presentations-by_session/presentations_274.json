Recent successes in the development of therapies targeting oncogenes has dramatically improved cancer care for subsets of patients and generated a wave of interest in precision cancer medicines. However, efforts to broadly discover effective targeted therapies have been stymied by a limited understanding of how response to drugs is modulated by tumor genotype.<br \/>Here, we describe an <i>in vivo<\/i> functional cancer pharmacogenomics (PGx) platform optimized for the discovery of genetic drivers of response to therapies. By &#8203;&#8203;coupling somatic genome editing, DNA barcoding, next generation sequencing, and robust statistical methods with genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer, the effects of different candidate therapies can be precisely quantified across thousands of tumors of diverse tumor suppressor genotypes. These tumors are initiated <i>de novo<\/i> in the native microenvironmental context in mice with an intact adaptive immune system.<br \/>To illustrate the translational value of our platform, we tested a standard-of-care chemotherapy combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed (carbo\/pem) in mice with oncogenic Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>-driven lung tumors with inactivation of 22 putative tumor suppressors. Treatment after 12 weeks of tumor growth for 3 weeks led to greater than 75% reduction in tumor sizes relative to vehicle controls. Surprisingly, although chemotherapy affects cell proliferation pathways rather than a defined genetic component, we identified a diverse spectrum of genotype-specific sensitivity and resistance to carbo\/pem treatment in our model.<br \/>We next determined the extent to which our empirical PGx data could predict human clinical outcomes by analyzing clinicogenomic data from &#62;200 patients with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant lung cancer who received combination chemotherapy treatment. Training a multivariate Cox proportional hazards (PH) model on overall survival from treatment initiation using our 22 cancer-associated genes as binary features in combination with baseline clinical data revealed a remarkable agreement between the Cox-PH coefficients and our empirical PGx data. Further analysis of the human survival data using multiple machine learning (ML) methods identified Random Survival Forests (RSF) as the top performing model. Importantly, using mouse empirical PGx data to rank genes for feature selection significantly improved the predictive power of the ML model. Together, these results demonstrate how leveraging our PGx platform together with human data within a machine learning framework may improve the prediction of patient clinical outcomes, and thus profoundly impact our ability to realize the promise of precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Cancer genetics,Predictive biomarkers,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Rosen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Amar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Winters<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hira Rizvi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wensheng Nie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Wall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitri Petrov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monte Winslow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Rudin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Juan<\/i><\/presenter>.

From genome-wide essentiality measurements in over 900 cancer cell lines, we find VRK1 dependency in VRK2-methylated adult and pediatric gliomas and neuroblastomas. VRK2 methylation was mainly seen in IDH-mutant gliomas and H3.3-G34R-mutant DIPG. Knockout of VRK2 was able to sensitize cells to VRK1 knockout. Overexpression of kinase-active but not kinase inactive VRK2 rescued VRK1 knockout. Global phosphoproteomics in VRK1 and VRK2 knockout cells demonstrate increased phosphorylation of targets involved with DNA damage and decreased phosphorylation of nuclear membrane targets. VRK1 and VRK2 were found to phosphorylate BANF1, which is involved in nuclear membrane re-formation during mitosis. Taken together, we show that VRK1 is a viable target in VRK2-methylated adult and pediatric gliomas, and neuroblastomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Kinases,Glioblastoma,Neuroblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonathan So<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathaniel Mabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernhard Englinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Shim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariella Filbin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Stegmaier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Hahn<\/i><\/presenter>.

Comprehensive genomic analysis identified the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) subgroup which is predominantly enriched in patients harboring germline BRCA1\/2 mutations (glBRCA) and presents ~7% and up to 15% in selected high-risk populations. Tumors with HRD are susceptible to DNA-damaging agents and PARP inhibition. However, not all patients demonstrate a similar response, and a spectrum is observed. We analyzed the clinical outcome of ninety-one glBRCA PDAC patients treated at Sheba Medical Center. We identify three main subgroups of response spanning from ~25% patients refractory to first line platinum agents and ~9% patients with durable long-term response with no evidence of disease for over three years. The majority of the patients display a prolonged response to platinum and PARPi maintenance (&#62;24 months) followed by acquired resistance. We generated patient derived xenograft (PDX) models and an ex-vivo culture system (EVOC) from na&#239;ve to treatment tissue and at clinical resistance. In vivo efficacy to platinum agents and PARPi demonstrates that these models recapitulate the specific clinical spectrum of response. We demonstrate the utility of both pre-clinical models in their ability to predict response to platinum-based agents and PARPi, with EVOC having a potential to assist in medical decisions while treating the patient. Whole genome sequencing of the tumors revealed that BRCA monoallelic tumors are associated with innate resistance while biallelic tumors reflect sensitivity to platinum agents and PARPi. In the acquired resistance models, the main identified mechanism of resistance was due to reversion mutations in 4\/6 of samples. Whole genome analysis demonstrates high mutational and neo-antigen load in majority of the glBRCA tumors. In a preliminary study, we show the efficacy of anti PD1 in a novel humanized glBRCA PDAC PDX model. This extensive preclinical and clinical collection of BRCA associated PDAC, enables further understanding and investigation of this unique subtype in aim to develop alternative treatments to overcome resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Pancreatic cancer,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Talia Golan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chani Stossel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Raitses-Gurevitch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dikla Atias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamar Beller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Gallinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raanan Berger<\/i><\/presenter>.

The Adaptive Multi-Drug Treatment of Evolving Cancers (AMTEC) trial (NCT03801369) is evaluating the PARPi + ICB combination of olaparib (ola) + durvalumab (durva) in mTNBC patients (pts). Deep profiling of paired pre- and on-ola monotherapy TNBC biopsies (Bx) is key to identifying: i) predictive biomarkers to select pts who will benefit from PARPi + ICB, and ii) resistance mechanisms that inform on other rational PARPi combinations. We report on biomarker characterization of paired Bxs from 18 AMTEC pts.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> AMTEC pts undergo a pre-ola Bx (Bx1), start one (28-day) cycle of ola monotherapy (300 mg BID), with a repeat on-ola Bx (Bx2) before adding durva (1500 mg Q4W) to ola. Profiling of DNA, RNA and protein signals in Bx1 and Bx2 using WES, RNAseq, RPPA, and spatially resolved single cell proteomics using cycIF and mIHC was correlated with clinical outcomes to identify predictors of ola + durva sensitivity, and adaptive resistance to PARPi therapy.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> <i>WES\/RNAseq - <\/i>TNBC subtype (Bx1) was a strong predictor of response, with basal immune activated (BLIA), luminal androgen receptor (LAR), and basal immune suppressed (BLIS) subtypes associated with mPFS of 8.7, 2.5, and 1.7 months, respectively (p&#60;0.05). MutSig3 signature in Bx1 (Yes = 7.4 mo vs. No = 2.5 mo; p&#60;0.05), or increases in IFN signaling in Bx2 (Yes = 6.6 mo vs. No = 2.2 mo; p&#60;0.05) were positive predictors of mPFS.<br \/><i>RPPA - <\/i>Change in PD-L1 expression on Bx2 (from Bx1) was a positive predictor (p&#60;0.05). RAS-MAPK pathway activation in Bx1 was predictive of a poor response (p&#60;0.05).<br \/><i>mIHC - <\/i>Two dominant immune cell groups were identified: <i>1)<\/i> T cell enriched, and <i>2)<\/i> hypoinflammed. On Bx1, most pts in the T cell enriched group achieved a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), whereas pts in the hypoinflammed group all had progressive disease (PD, p=0.04). On Bx2, all pts in the T cell enriched group were PR or SD, whereas PD pts comprised the hypoinflammed group (p=0.06).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Findings highlight the value of paired Bxs to identify predictive biomarkers of PARPi + ICB sensitivity. Emerging resistance mechanisms justify amending AMTEC to a PARPi biomarker-driven trial evaluating ola in combination with durva, selumetinib (MEKi), or capivasertib (AKTi).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Adaptive Resistance,PARP inhibitors,Predictive Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zahi I.

While sotorasib and other KRAS G12C inhibitors have demonstrated rapid and durable responses in the clinic, some patients do not achieve responses. The identification of specific vulnerabilities conferred by recurrent co-occurring mutations may enable the development of biomarker-driven combination therapies with enhanced activity in distinct subsets of patients. We screened a panel of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines as well as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models and observed that loss of the tumor suppressor STK11\/LKB1 is associated with increased sensitivity to combined MAPK (either the KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib or MEK inhibitor trametinib) and MCL-1 inhibition (AMG 176). Restoration of LKB1 expression in LKB1-deficient cell lines and PDX tumors blunted the apoptotic response to MAPK + MCL-1 inhibition; conversely, deletion of LKB1 in LKB1 wild-type models increased sensitivity. Mitochondrial apoptotic cell death is regulated by interactions between pro- (e.g., BIM) and anti-apoptotic (e.g., MCL-1, BCL-XL) BCL-2 family members. MAPK inhibition increases BIM, while MCL-1 inhibition prevents BIM sequestration by MCL-1, resulting in apoptosis. LKB1 deficient cells exhibit increased association of BIM and MCL-1 upon MAPK inhibition, effectively priming cells for death upon inhibition of MCL-1. Mechanistically, LKB1 deficiency and associated loss of NUAK phosphorylation leads to hyperactivation of the JNK phospho-kinase network. JNK phosphorylates MCL-1 at S64 and T163, which enhances BIM: MCL-1 protein-protein interaction. Conversely, JNK phosphorylates BCL-XL at S62 and prevents sequestration of BIM. This series of phosphorylation events increases MCL-1 dependence and creates a specific vulnerability of KRAS-LKB1 tumors to MAPK + MCL-1 inhibition. Consistent with this mechanism, ex vivo treatment of tumor tissue from a KRAS-LKB1 mutant NSCLC patient with sotorasib or trametinib increased MCL-1 dependent priming. These results reveal a novel link between LKB1 and the regulation of BCL-2 family proteins and provide preclinical rationale for evaluation of combined KRAS G12C + MCL-1 inhibitors for KRAS-LKB1 mutant NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,LKB1,Mcl-1,G12C,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chendi Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammed Usman Syed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audris Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cameron Fraser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johannes Kreuzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Nabel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaitlyn Webster<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Morris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Caenepeel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Y.

However, better biomarkers of response are still needed for further improving precision medicine. Therefore, a robust LUAD subtyping can substantially aid in determining the most effective therapies that target subtype-specific vulnerabilities. In this study, we integrated multiple datasets: (i) the full 509 LUAD patient cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, (ii) cancer vulnerability data in LUAD cell lines from the Broad Institute&#8217;s DependencyMap, and (iii) proteomic data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) LUAD patients. Using these datasets, we identified 5 expression subtypes (S1-S5) with unique proteogenomic and dependency profiles that increased the resolution of previously defined subtypes (Proximal Inflammatory [PI]; Proximal Proliferative [PP]; and Terminal Respiratory Unit [TRU]). S4-associated cell lines exhibited specific vulnerability to CDK6 and CDK6-cyclin D3 complex gene, CCND3. S3 was characterized by dependency on CDK4, immune-related expression patterns, and altered MET signaling. Experimental validation showed that S3-associated cell lines responded to MET inhibitors, which also led to increased PD-L1 expression. Finally, we identified a small set of biomarkers for S3 and S4 that could be used in the clinic to classify patients into our therapeutically relevant subtypes. Overall, our lung adenocarcinoma expression subtypes, especially S3 that represents 20% of LUAD patients and S4 that represents 25% of LUAD patients, and their biomarkers could help identify patients likely to respond to CDK4\/6, MET, or PD-L1 inhibitors, potentially improving patient outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Multiomics,Molecular subtypes,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Whijae Roh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yifat Geffen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mendy Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shankara Anand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaegil Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Heiman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Meyerson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Laird<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Cherniack<\/i><\/presenter>, NCI CCG Tumor Molecular Pathology (TMP) Analysis Working Group, <presenter><i>Gad Getz<\/i><\/presenter>.

No precision therapies have been approved for the treatment of LSCC and the genetic drivers of LSCC are unknown in approximately 60% of the cases. As a result, treatment of LSCC is still limited to chemotherapy and\/or radiotherapy.<b> <\/b>Analysis of LSCC samples from the TCGA reveals that nearly 50% of LSCC patients harbor distal amplification of the 3q chromosome that includes the resident protein kinase gene <i>TNIK<\/i>. Recent studies have pinpointed TNIK as a potential oncogenic driver in cancer cells with distal 3q amplification (Cancer Discov. 2013; 3:1044). However, the therapeutic potential of TNIK in LSCC remains unexplored.<br \/>To determine if amplified <i>TNIK<\/i> is a genetic driver in LSCC, we analyzed TNIK expression in a panel of LSCC cell lines. We show that TNIK is overexpressed in LSCC cell lines in comparison with primary lung cells from healthy donors, consistent with observations in patient tumors based on analysis of TCGA data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TNIK genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition significantly reduces survival of LSCC cells with 3q amplification <i>in vitro <\/i>and in <i>in vivo<\/i> LSCC cell-line derived mouse xenografts. Importantly, we have generated LSCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models to test TNIK inhibitors and have observed that inhibition of TNIK catalytic activity suppresses tumor growth in LSCC PDX mouse models.<br \/>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning TNIK-driven LSCC cell viability we have used a combination of reverse-phase protein arrays, motif-driven screens for proteins with TNIK consensus phosphorylation sites, co-expression experiments, peptide mapping and mass spectrometry. Through these approaches, we have identified the tumor suppressor MERLIN as a novel TNIK substrate and determined that TNIK phosphorylates MERLIN at Ser13, Thr272 and Thr576. We also demonstrate that TNIK is required for stabilization of the YAP transcription factor, and activation of the focal adhesion kinase, FAK, two oncogenic pathways that are inhibited by MERLIN.<br \/>In conclusion, we have pinpointed the protein kinase TNIK as a promising therapeutic target in LSCC that maintains survival of LSCC cells through modulation of novel a TNIK-MERLIN-YAP\/FAK signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Targeted therapy,Squamous cell carcinoma,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pedro Torres-Ayuso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elvira An<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine M.
