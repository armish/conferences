[{"Abstract":"<b>Purpose: <\/b>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive cancer with early primary resistance and modest clinical benefit to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Mutation or transcriptional repression of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) is a key mechanism driving resistance to T cell-based therapies. Lysine Demethylase 1 (LSD1) regulates gene expression through modulating mono- and di- methylated lysine 4 and 9 of histone H3. LSD1 is a therapeutic target of interests in SCLC due to its oncogenic requirement for tumor growth, and there has been growing evidence pointing to LSD1 as a repressor of tumor-intrinsic immunogenicity. Here investigated the role of LSD1 as a transcriptional regulator of antigen presentation in SCLC.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>To perturb LSD1 function, we employed the pharmacological inhibitor ORY-1001 and shRNA-mediated knockdown. We then assessed changes in MHC-I expression on SCLC cell lines by flow cytometry and western blot. To analyze transcriptional changes following LSD1 inhibition, we performed RNA-seq on SCLC cells pre- and post-treatment with ORY-1001. To observe for antigen-specific T cell killing, we engineered SCLC cells to express endogenous antigens and co-cultured these cells with primary cognate CD8+ T cells. Finally, we treated genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM)-derived tumors on immunocompetent syngeneic mice with ORY-1001 with or without anti-PD-L1 blockade to assess for anti-tumor effects.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We discovered a significant and strong negative correlation between expression of LSD1 and genes encoding the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway. Inhibition of LSD1 induces expression of MHC-I genes and restores expression of genes encoding the antigen presentation machinery. Perturbation of LSD1 further activates interferon signaling and interferon-inducible expression of NLRC5, a well-characterized transcriptional activator of MHC-I genes. We further showed that targeting LSD1 sensitizes SCLC cells to MHC-I-restricted T cell-dependent cytolysis and enhances ICB efficacy in refractory SCLC tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data define a role for LSD1 as a potent negative regulator of MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation and provide rationale for the use of LSD1 inhibitors to augment response to immunotherapy in SCLC.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/58a5e274-05d9-44b0-988f-ec7f1cede19e\/@w03B8ZH9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LSD1,Antigen presentation,Lung cancer: small cell,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13895"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Minh N.

In line with this, immune checkpoint blockade shows tremendous anti-tumor efficacy by enhancing cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). However, cancer cells develop different mechanisms of immune evasion, among which suppression of immune recognition of somatic mutations via tumor antigen is prevalent. In fact, 65% to 90% of the cancers show reduced MHC-I antigen presentation. There is, nonetheless, little achievement toward the therapeutic approaches to restore antigen presentation on tumor cells. Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second deadliest cancer in U.S., shows increasing incidence and mortality rates over the past years. Standard conventional CRC treatments, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, often lead to many side effects due to their non-specificity and cytotoxicity. While immunotherapy is very promising, only a small population of CRC patients respond to the current immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, our objective was to harness a novel immunological approach to target CRC tumors. We developed a bioinformatics tool to create a pool of genes whose expression negatively correlates with cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CTLs in the tumor microenvironment of CRC patients. Given the central role of antigen presentation in activating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CTLs, we further screened these genes based on the scope of their effects on antigen presentation. To this end, we developed stable clones of OVA expressing MC38 cells (MC38<sup>OVA<\/sup>) where OVA-derived peptide, SIINFEKL, will be bound to MHC-I complex for cell surface presentation. 4 genes with highest capacity to alter MHC-I cell surface levels were identified. Our consequent in vivo experiments and in vitro cytotoxicity assays identified that &#8220;Rho-GEF&#8221; gene was the top actionable target with striking suppressive effects on tumor growth. TCGA database analysis showed Rho-GEF is upregulated in 22% of CRC patients accompanied by a poor prognosis. Rho-GEF knockdown (KD) significantly inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent mice whereas it only showed minor effects on immunocompromised mice, suggesting that the Rho-GEF may modulate tumor growth by regulating the interaction of tumor cells with non-tumor cells such as immune cells. Consistent with the major contribution of antigen presentation in promoting CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CTLs activity, TNF&#945;, IFN&#947;, and GZMB levels in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells isolated from Rho-GEF KD MC38-derived tumors showed a significant increase compared to the wild type tumors. Taken together, we introduced Rho-GEF as a potential clinical target involved in CRC immune evasion by modulating antigen presentation and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CTLs anti-tumor responses.<br \/>1","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/28a71bdf-9b98-4116-9d05-8679bc06b754\/@x03B8ZHa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Cancer immunotherapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13898"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haniyeh Eyvani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinna Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a burgeoning etiology of liver cancer. Emerging data shows that NAFLD alters adaptive T cell immunity and has a profound influence on both liver cancer development and efficacy of immunotherapy. Tumor antigen-specific T cells recognize tumor and are crucial for controlling malignancy. However, their populations are often low, and detection requires special tools. This study utilized a novel mouse model of HCC to investigate how the tumor antigen-specific T cell response is affected in NAFLD.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We generated a doxycycline-inducible MHC-I OVA<sub>257-264<\/sub> and MHC-II OVA<sub>323-339<\/sub> antigen-expressing HCC cell line which allowed us to investigate tumor antigen-specific T cell responses. The cell line was seeded orthotopically into the livers of diet-induced (methionine choline-deficient [MCD]) and genetic (Ob\/Ob [Ob]) NAFLD mouse models. OVA<sub>257-264<\/sub><sub> <\/sub>specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were detected by flow cytometry using H-2Kb\/OVA<sub>257-264<\/sub> tetramer. Pharmacological depletion experiments were used to identify additional effector cells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The creation of an inducible MHC-I and -II OVA antigen-expressing HCC cell line was validated in both <i>in-vitro<\/i> and <i>in-vivo<\/i> settings. Tumor expression of highly immunogenic OVA antigens caused a strong tumor suppression which was mostly mediated by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in mice fed with normal diet. The inverse correlation between percentage of OVA<sub>257-264<\/sub> specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with tumor size further supported their critical role in tumor control. In contrast, in NAFLD mice fed MCD diet as well as Ob\/Ob mice, tumor OVA antigens induction failed to reduce liver tumor growth. The presence of OVA<sub>257-264<\/sub> specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in NAFLD mice suggested that NAFLD did not inhibit the generation of tumor antigen-specific T cells. This was supported by the finding that OVA<sub>257-264<\/sub><sub> <\/sub>specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from NAFLD mice had similar cytotoxic potential, activation, degranulation, PD-1 expression, and effector memory phenotype compared to controls, suggesting an indirect mechanism for the impaired anti-tumor immunity. Immunoprofiling revealed a drastic increase of macrophages in tumor-bearing NAFLD livers. Depletion of macrophages with clodronate reversed the NAFLD caused resistance to tumor-antigen dependent tumor suppression. It was observed that there were minimal changes to the amount of TAS CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in doxycycline-treated mice irrespective of clodronate depletion. There was, however, higher markers of activation such as CD69 and TNF&#945; in clodronate-depleted mice compared to controls.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> NAFLD impairs antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell immunity against liver tumor. The effect was not due to reduced generation or intrinsic functional changes of tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells but caused by accumulated macrophages in the liver environment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09bea872-af60-425e-b8d5-31d9911401a7\/@x03B8ZHa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Neoantigens,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13914"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John C.

Identifying HLA-bound peptides is therefore crucial to understand the specificity of T cell responses in cancer. Due to sample limitations, it is often difficult or impossible to confirm epitope presentation in clinical biopsy material. To develop truly personal medicine, target epitopes need to be directly identified or validated in patient tumors at the peptide antigen level.<br \/><b>Methodology:<\/b> We have developed a microscale HLA immunoprecipitation protocol which when combined with a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based barcoding approach was able to identify HLA-bound peptides. HLA-complexes were affinity purified from either cultured cells, patient-derived xenograft or melanoma biopsies and the peptide cargo was tagged using TMT barcodes and analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Like primers in PCR, the carrier peptides and multiplexing of samples amplifies the signal enabling sensitive detection.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> By using this strategy, we identified HLA-bound peptides from as few as ~1000 cultured cells. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach by confirming the presentation of around 1000 peptides from a challenging melanoma biopsy (~1-20mg in total), including 11 well-known T-cell response-inducing epitopes and other potential epitopes derived from Melanoma-associated antigens and neoantigens.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This strategy will be useful for studying peptidome subsets in other clinical samples where the amount of tissue available via sampling is limiting, including biopsies taken for autoimmune diseases and infections, or to sample rare cell types in tissue\/cell samples, such as different antigen-presenting cell subsets.

The identification and quantification of the immunopeptidome bear the potential to enable personalized treatments, especially in cancers, vaccines, infectious, and autoimmune diseases. Mass spectrometry is currently the only technology that can reliably measure and identify immunopeptide profiles of biological samples on a large scale. However, the usually high sample input amount and poor scalability are limiting. Here, we introduce a semi-automated workflow to robustly identify immunopeptides from low amounts of cultured cells and tissue samples by systematically optimizing each step of the sample preparation and acquisition. We optimized the native lysis and immunoprecipitation workflow while ensuring scalability and reproducibility. Leveraging the magnetic properties of the beads, 1,000 samples can be processed within a week by a single operator. The established sample preparation offers high reproducibility and identifications of good quality. For class-I immunopeptides, &#38;gt60% of the peptides identified are 9-mers, &#38;gt80% predicted strong binders, and the expected amino acids are enriched at the anchor positions. For class-II, &#38;gt50% of the peptides identified are 14-to-16-mers, and &#38;gt50% are predicted strong binders. Furthermore, the pipeline is highly sensitive as we could still identify over 2,800 class-I immunopeptides when processing as little as 2.5 mg fresh frozen tissue and &#38;gt9,000 class-I and &#38;gt12,000 class-II immunopeptides when preparing 10 million JY cells. Overall, the pipeline is scalable, highly reproducible, and results in high-quality identifications while supporting very limited sample input. Finally, we measured a cohort of 12 cancerous and matched healthy lung tissues from as little as 15 mg tissue, whereby we could identify &#38;gt11,000 class-I immunopeptides and &#38;gt9,000 class-II on average. For class-I, matched samples clustered together, while &#38;gt3,000 immunopeptides were upregulated in the cancer tissues, with a significant enrichment for proteins related to lung cancer. Overall, we established a scalable, efficient pipeline for cell line and tissues immunopeptidomics for class-I and II that generates high-quality identifications and that only requires small amounts of input material and is ready to shed light into immunopeptidomics heterogeneity through large-scale profiling of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ee3b8c9-27a8-45cc-b36a-9faaa6cade8e\/@x03B8ZHa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Cancer vaccine,MHC II,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13916"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ilja E.

Current treatment options comprise maximal surgical resection followed by radiation and\/or chemotherapy with temozolomide. However, these procedures are unable to eliminate all tumor cells, which in turn lead to disease recurrence accounting for the poor prognosis. Glioblastoma is a highly infiltrative tumor in which recurrence originates from the unresectable peritumoral infiltration zone. Thus, novel treatment options specifically targeting the tumor cells in the infiltration zone are needed to prevent relapse and enable long-lasting remission. In this work, we performed multi-omics spatial analysis of the necrotic center (NEC), the gadolinium contrast-enhanced region (T1), and the infiltration zone (INF) to assess immunological relevant aspects of tumor heterogeneity. By integrating mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome analysis with next generation sequencing methods (whole exome and RNA sequencing, DNA methylation), we aimed to identify the intra-tumoral regional heterogeneity of T cell antigens with a special focus on the peritumoral infiltration zone. For multi-omics analysis, HLA peptides and genetic material from 15 glioblastoma patients were extracted and analyzed from the three zones NEC, T1, INF and for four patients additionally from adjacent benign (BEN) brain tissue. A total of 24,699 unique HLA class I and 17,394 HLA class II peptides were identified. Comparative profiling of peptides from our study and a benign tissue database (in-house (n=429) combined with HLA ligand atlas (https:\/\/hla-ligand-atlas.org)) revealed that 6% (970\/15,579), 5% (829\/16,442) and 5% (725\/13,891) of HLA class I peptides were exclusively presented in the INF, T1 and NEC zone, respectively. 6% (394\/7,150), 7% (589\/8,736) and 13% (1,725\/12,908) of HLA class II peptides showed exclusive representation in the INF, T1 and NEC zone, respectively. Importantly, due to the spatial analysis of the immunopeptidome, we revealed 970 HLA class I and 394 HLA class II peptides exclusively presented in the INF zone. Interestingly, one INF-associated HLA class I peptide, which showed frequent presentation in 36% of glioblastoma immunopeptidomes, is derived from the brain and acute leukemia cytoplasmic protein (BAALC), a highly expressed cell cycle inducer (via MEK kinase-1) in several cancers, including glioblastoma. Integrated RNA\/DNA sequencing enabled a greater understanding of spatial tumor antigen presentation and lead to the identification of INF-specific neoepitopes derived from tumor-specific mutations. In summary, we identified the intra-tumoral regional heterogeneity of tumor antigens, which could be used in the future for specific immunotherapy approaches targeting the infiltration zone of glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2d0f923-f06f-4819-86c7-9942fa32b365\/@x03B8ZHa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Mass spectrometry,Molecular profiling,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13925"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marcel Wacker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gioele Medici<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Marissa Dubbelaar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jens Bauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annika Nelde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Regli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Weller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helmut R.

Most studies examining T cell-cancer interactions have been directed toward late-stage tumors, but much less is known about how T cells respond to premalignant lesions. Using a clinically relevant liver cancer mouse model (<u>A<\/u>lbumin-<u>S<\/u>top-Large <u>T<\/u> Antigen; AST) in which the SV40 Large T Antigen (TAG) serves as oncogene and tumor neoantigen, we previously demonstrated that TAG-specific CD8 T cells (TCR-TAG) rapidly become dysfunctional (unable to produce cytokines and cytolytic molecules) after entering premalignant liver lesions, although they persist long-term. We hypothesized that peripheral tolerance mechanisms, which prevent autoimmunity against self-antigens, drive T cell dysfunction in premalignant lesions. To test this, we compared CD8 T cell (TCR-GAG) responses to a liver self-antigen (GAG) to TCR-TAG responses to the TAG neoantigen in premalignant hepatocytes. We found that liver-reactive TCR-GAG were unable to produce cytokines, similar to neoantigen-specific TCR-TAG; however, in contrast, they failed to persist. To test whether oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes promoted T cell persistence, we crossed Alb-GAG and AST mice to generate a model in which GAG and TAG was expressed in premalignant hepatocytes (ASTxAlb-GAG). We found that both TCR-GAG<sub> <\/sub>and TCR-TAG transferred into ASTxAlb-GAG mice bearing premalignant lesions driven by the TAG oncogene rapidly lost the ability to produce cytokines; however, only TCR-TAG persisted while TCR-GAG quickly disappeared. To understand why the TCR-GAG failed to persist, we assessed proliferation and cell cycling after T cells encountered their cognate antigen. While both TCR-GAG and TCR-TAG were rapidly activated and began proliferating, TCR-GAG exited cell cycle and began decreasing in number after four cell divisions, while TCR-TAG continued to divide and increase in number. Antigen amount and localization may regulate T cell proliferation and persistence. We found much higher levels of TAG-encoding versus GAG-encoding mRNA in the liver, suggesting that higher antigen expression may be required for T cell persistence. T cell responses can be directed against both shared tumor self-antigens and neoantigens. By dissecting the determinants of CD8 T cell function and persistence in response to self and non-self-antigens, these studies could inform strategies to boost anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c08dfb85-2b39-4a97-ad2d-f8a2d6fade4d\/@x03B8ZHa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxic T cell,Tumor antigen,T cell persistence,Peripheral tolerance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13927"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jessica J.

By using a high-density whole mouse proteome peptide array, we were able to assess potential protein-targets for antibodies present in mice cured of their melanoma by a combination immunotherapy regimen of 12Gy local radiation and intratumoral administration of a tumor-specific immunocytokine (anti-GD2 antibody linked to IL-2). This regimen can induce an &#8220;in situ vaccine&#8221; effect (ISV) enabling mice to be cured of their tumors with long-term immune memory.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Immunocompetent C57\/BL6 mice bearing large B78 (GD2-expressing) melanoma tumors were treated with ISV. Sera were collected at different timepoints (before tumor implantation, after implantation before treatment, after completion of treatment, after the mouse was rendered tumor-free and after a rejected rechallenge). Tumor cell surface binding of these serum samples was assessed via flow cytometry and showed a strong increase in binding of sample obtained following immunotherapy, and after rejection of a tumor rechallenge. Binding was assessed against the original tumor line, B78, as well as B16 (parental to B78 without GD2 expression).We used the na&#239;ve and immune sera on a Nimble Therapeutics whole mouse proteome peptide array to determine specific antibody-binding sites. Whole proteome data was analyzed using a newly developed algorithm which scans adjacent peptides to detect differential binding between na&#239;ve and immune samples.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Multiple proteins were selectively identified by immune sera which were not well detected by sera from na&#239;ve mice. Hundreds of proteins were targeted by 3 or more of 6 mice and exhibited strong antibody binding only by immune sera. Some proteins were recognized via the same binding epitopes, others via different epitopes in separate mice. Some of the whole protein peptide array results were validated via JPT multi-well peptide array and some via independent peptide ELISA. Results from Nimble peptide array and ELISA validated well.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: We were able to detect antibody in immune sera binding selectively to specific linear epitopes and identify proteins of interest for further investigation as potential targets for antibody-based or cellular therapies. Results from our whole proteome peptide array were validated in separate assays via peptide ELISA. We are also exploring if some of the identified tumor-specific endogenous antibodies could be used as biomarkers to predict response to our ISV regimen and potentially other immunotherapy treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/25191c17-cb7c-45f6-8184-8ca8a47e2453\/@x03B8ZHa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immunotherapy,Antibody,Peptides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13934"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Hoefges<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean J.

Recent studies, however, have demonstrated mixed roles of MHC Class 1 and the critical component beta-2-microglobulin (&#946;2m) expression in cancer progression and ICB response, with some studies showing inactivation of antigen presentation to be associated with resistance to ICB and others showing low &#946;2m expression to be associated with favorable prognosis. Glioblastoma (GBM) in particular expresses little or no MHC Class 1 and patients remain unresponsive to ICB. We thus sought to evaluate the role of MHC Class 1 in ICB, given that we have previously demonstrated that combination ICB with anti-PD-1 and co-stimulation with 4-1BB agonism has marked efficacy against intracranial murine glioma tumors in a CD8 T cell dependent manner. Surprisingly, in a CT2A murine glioma tumor line expressing the antigen TRP2 and lacking cell surface MHC I (CT2A-TRP2-&#946;2mKO), the efficacy of combination 4-1BB and PD-1 therapy (ICB) was re-demonstrated in a CD8 dependent manner, independent of NK cells, CD4 T cells, and B cells. Furthermore, the efficacy of immunotherapy against intracranial CT2A-TRP2-&#946;2mKO was demonstrated to be antigen dependent, with an adoptive lymphocyte transfer (ALT) of TRP2 TCR transduced T cells (TRP2 T cells) into a CD8KO mouse sufficient to eliminate CT2A-TRP2-&#946;2mKO in the setting of ICB. Additionally, an ALT of TRP2 T cells did not kill CT2A-&#946;2mKO tumors in the setting of ICB, while OT-1 mice whose CD8+ T cells primarily recognize OVA peptide with CT2A-TRP2-&#946;2mKO tumors did not respond to ICB. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies revealed that TRP2 T cells demonstrated anti-tumor cytotoxicity against MHC Class I negative CT2A-TRP2-&#946;2mKO tumor cells in the presence of TRP2 loaded bone marrow derived macrophages (TRP2 M&#966;), but neither cell type was individually sufficient to induce tumor cell death, while the combination of TRP2 T cells and TRP2 M&#966; demonstrated no cytotoxicity against CT2A-&#946;2mKO tumors. Transwell experiments in which TRP2 M&#966; and CT2A-TRP2-&#946;2mKO tumor cells were separated by a 0.5&#181;m membrane permeable to T cells but not M&#966; or tumor cells revealed that contact between TRP2 M&#966; and tumor cells was not necessary to induce T cell dependent killing. Indeed, tumor-bearing &#946;2mKO bone marrow chimeras lacking MHC class 1 on hematopoeitically derived cells did not respond to ICB, highlighting the importance of antigen presentation from myeloid cells. The mechanism of killing was found to be dependent on interferon gamma (IFN&#947;), as IFN&#947;KO mice did not respond to ICB. These findings demonstrate that tumors with low MHC Class 1 expression may still be targeted by T cell dependent immunotherapies such as ICB when antigen presentation can occur from myeloid cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b7c5eecf-43a9-4186-91c9-d3b5ca8ee1b0\/@x03B8ZHa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Glioblastoma,Antigen presentation,HLA class I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13943"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emily Lerner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent D'Anniballe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Tomaszewski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Perera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiuyu Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Waibl-Polania<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Wilkinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael D.

A subset are driven by frameshift mutations in the calreticulin gene (<i>CALR<\/i>). The CALR protein is a lectin chaperone and primarily assists in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is also part of the peptide loading complex, a set of proteins involved in antigen processing and peptide presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. All MPN-associated frameshift mutations in CALR lead to a similar change in its C-terminal, altering its protein-protein interactions. Examples include impaired chaperone activity of mutant CALR that impacts protein homeostasis and compromised activity of the MHC-I peptide loading complex. We hypothesized that these impaired functions will alter the repertoire of peptides presented by MHC-I in mutant CALR expressing cells, which we characterized in a patient-derived, mutant-CALR-driven myeloid tumor cell line, Marimo.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> We carried out an immunopeptidome analysis on Marimo cell line derivates expressing either wildtype or mutant CALR to identify potential MPN-associated peptides presented by MHC-I, and validated their immunogenicity in human samples. MHC-I-peptide complexes were immunoprecipitated from these Marimo cell line derivates, followed by peptide elution and analysis by mass spectrometry. A subset of peptides that were found in the mass spectrometry analysis of mutant CALR cells but not wildtype CALR cells were tested for their immunogenicity by assaying the in vitro T cell responses they evoked. Na&#239;ve T cells from healthy donors, carrying at least one MHC-I allele that matched the Marimo cells, were primed and expanded with the selected peptides and peptide-specific T cell responses were measured by intracellular staining detecting effector cytokines IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945;.<br \/><i>Results:<\/i><br \/>1. The expression of mutant CALR disrupts the function of the peptide loading complex, leading to reduced recruitment of MHC-I and reducing its cell surface expression by almost 40% compared to cells expressing wildtype CALR.<br \/>2. Peptide repertoire of MHC-I is significantly altered by the expression of mutant CALR. Immunopeptidomics revealed a qualitative and quantitative difference in peptides presented by cells expressing wildtype CALR vs mutant CALR<br \/>3. The immunogenicity of a curated list of 24 peptides was tested in healthy donors, and at least 6 peptides activated T cell responses. Similar testing in MPN patients is planned.<br \/><i>Conclusions:<\/i> This is the first study to investigate the impact of mutant CALR on the repertoire of peptides presented by MHC-I in myeloid cells. We discovered tumor-associated, immunogenic peptides that may serve as potential targets of immunotherapy allowing the specific elimination of mutant CALR-expressing cells, which has been a challenge in the treatment of MPNs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c0384cb-0f02-477e-bc89-2e2176d6cab4\/@y03B8ZHb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Calreticulin,MHC-I,myeloproliferative neoplasms,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14014"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Najla Arshad<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathalie Vigneron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cansu Cimen Bozkus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Stroobant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Naulaerts*<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nina Bhardwaj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benoît Van den Eynde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Cresswell<\/i><\/presenter>.

Several epigenetic modulators have been identified as potential targets for augmenting anti-tumor immunity, however the full breadth of their role is not well-understood.<br \/>To identify modulators of anti-tumor immunity in melanoma, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR screen using the YUMMER-G model and identified members of the HUSH complex and its associated methyltransferase, <i>Setdb1<\/i>, as drop-out hits. To validate these findings, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout <i>Setdb1 <\/i>individually and observed that <i>Setdb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> tumors are cleared by their host mice in a CD8+ T-cell dependent manner.<br \/>To determine the source of immunogenicity in <i>Setdb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells, we performed RNA-sequencing, cytokine profiling, and evaluated antigen presentation by flow cytometry. These assays revealed increased MHC-I levels, elevated secretion of Ifn-, and induction of an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression program, consistent with the observed immunogenicity. We further determined that treating <i>Setdb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells with IFNAR-blocking antibodies restores MHC-I levels to wild-type levels, suggestive of a tumor-intrinsic interferon loop.<br \/>We hypothesized that type-I interferon signaling is generated through sensing of expressed endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs), and consistently observe upregulation of ERVs in <i>Setdb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells. Previous studies have described the potential for ERV-derived antigens to act as substrates for anti-tumor activity by CD8+ T cells. We identified T cells in the tumor microenvironment of <i>Setdb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> tumors that bind tetramer carrying the P15E peptide derived from ERV envelope.<br \/>Together, these findings suggest that tumors lacking expression of <i>Setdb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> upregulate ERV transcripts, driving expression of type-I interferons which generate an inflamed tumor microenvironment and potentiate efficient tumor clearance of <i>Setdb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> tumors. Overall, this study emphasizes a critical role for regulators of ERV expression and type-I interferon expression, and suggests their potential as therapeutic targets for augmenting anti-cancer immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd819102-7f7f-4240-ab67-b60ba8a580f1\/@y03B8ZHb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Interferons,Antigen presentation,CRISPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14016"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meaghan K.

However, high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are found in a subset of pMMR tumors and low TIL are seen in a subset of dMMR colon cancer. In this study, we compared T-cell repertoires in 20 pMMR and 27 dMMR colon tumors with high and low TIL counts.<br \/>CDR3 regions of the TCR beta chain were sequenced by ImmunoSEQ Assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). The fraction T cells was calculated by normalizing TCR beta template counts to the total DNA. Sample richness was calculated as the number of unique productive rearrangements in a sample after computationally down-sampling to a common number of T cells to control for variation in sample depth. Simpson clonality was computed as a measure of how evenly productive rearrangements are distributed amongst the total number of T cells. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).<br \/>The mean TIL counts per high power field (HPF) for TIL-high and TIL-low dMMR tumors were 17.4 (range, 5-37) and 1.8 (range, 0-4). In pMMR tumors, they were 12.8 (range, 6-37) for TIL-high and 0.3 (range, 0-1) for TIL-low groups. The number of T cells measured by TCR sequencing correlated positively with the TIL count (Spearman rho = 0.391; P = 0.007). When comparing by MMR status, we found that dMMR tumors exhibited a trend towards higher Simpson clonality index (P = 0.09), with significantly lower repertoire richness compared to pMMR tumors (P = 0.030). Within dMMR tumors, TIL-high dMMR tumors had higher density (P = 0.017), higher clonality (P = 0.003), and a less rich repertoire (P = 0.003) compared to TIL-low dMMR tumors. Within pMMR tumors, while the T cell density was higher in the TIL-high tumors, we did not observe differences in T cell clonality or repertoire richness between TIL-high vs TIL-low pMMR tumors.<br \/>Our study found that T cells in dMMR tumors are more clonal and their repertoire is less rich compared with T cells in pMMR tumors. In the dMMR group, T cells in TIL-high tumors were more clonal and their repertoire was less rich compared with T cells in TIL-low tumors, but in the pMMR group, T-cell diversity in TIL-high tumors was comparable to T-cell diversity in TIL-low tumors. These findings suggest that T cells clonally expand in dMMR tumors, possibly in response to MMR deficiency-induced tumor neoantigens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/416e51cf-18ce-439d-b046-f4a7131a729c\/@y03B8ZHb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Colon cancer,Mismatch repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14041"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jin K.

Novel therapies for FLC are urgently needed to improve patient outcomes. The key genetic event in FLC tumorigenesis is a highly conserved gene fusion between the first exon of <i>DNAJB1<\/i> and the last nine exons of <i>PRKACA<\/i>. This fusion gene is present in all FLC tumors, and more than 90% of patients express fusion proteins with identical amino acid sequences. Genetic mutations like this gene fusion can serve as important therapeutic vulnerabilities, in part because they may be processed and presented on the surface of tumor cells as neoantigens that can activate an anti-tumor T cell response. The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that <i>DNAJB1-PRKACA<\/i> fusion neoantigens could elicit T cell responses against FLC and serve as targets for novel immunotherapies. Spatial transcriptomic analyses of human FLC tumor samples indicated that CD8+ T cells could infiltrate these tumors, but often expressed markers of dysfunction and exhaustion, such as TOX. Nevertheless, we successfully expanded tumor-infiltrating T cells from FLC <i>ex vivo<\/i> and used intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) to identify a subset of FLC patient T cells that produced IFN&#947; and TNF&#945; in response to stimulation with a fusion neoantigen. We used both peptide-MHC tetramer staining and functional response after stimulation to identify T cells in FLC patients and healthy donors that recognize fusion neoantigens. We then determined the paired T cell receptor (TCR) sequences using single-cell sequencing and expressed the TCRs in primary human T cells to test their potential utility in TCR-engineered immunotherapies. We validated the specificity and functionality of these TCRs using peptide-MHC tetramer staining, ICS, and <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity assays on the xCelligence and Berkeley Lights Lightning platforms. Primary T cells expressing fusion-specific TCRs bound to their cognate peptide-MHC tetramer, produced multiple cytokines in response to stimulation with their cognate fusion peptide, and specifically killed fusion-presenting target cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Ongoing experiments will test whether T cells expressing these fusion-specific TCRs can control growth of fusion-presenting tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>. Collectively, these studies have defined the first reported fusion-specific T cell response in FLC, as well as fusion-specific TCRs that hold promise for use in adoptive T cell therapies. Our spatial transcriptomic analyses have also begun to illuminate the immune microenvironment in FLC and will inform future efforts to develop immunotherapies for this disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30ac8e80-a662-4fcd-85da-b82fd78a1504\/@y03B8ZHb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Fusion genes,T cell,Fibrolamellar carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14042"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Allison M.

These cell-surface proteins are heterodimers consisting of a variable alpha chain associated with &#946;2 microglobulin and are expressed on nucleated cells at varying levels. The antigen specificity of the interaction between MHC, peptide and T cell receptor can be exploited in development of personalized cancer vaccines and other immunotherapies against cancer. MHC sequences are species-specific and there are many different haplotypes of MHC class I. For this reason, the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation of MHC complexes are a critical component of the workflow for identification of antigens presented by MHC. Subclasses of mouse MHC class I are divided into classical (H-2D, H-2K and H-2L) and non-classical (H-2Q, H-2M and H-2T), and haplotypes of each are known for homozygous inbred laboratory strains of mice. One common strain is C57BL\/6, which expresses H2-D<sup>b<\/sup> and H2-K<sup>b<\/sup> classical MHC molecules. Antibody clone M1\/42, which reacts with H-2 expressed on nucleated cells from mice of a, b, d, j, k, s and u haplotypes, is commonly referred to as a pan-MHC class I antibody. Antibody clones Y-3 and HB-27 recognize H2-K<sup>b<\/sup> and H2-D<sup>b<\/sup> haplotypes, respectively. In this study we aimed to compare different antibodies to mouse MHC class I complexes for their efficiency of recovery of associated peptides. Input was murine EL-4 cells which are T lymphoblast cells derived from a C57BL\/6 background. We performed immunoprecipitation with different antibodies either singly or sequentially to enrich MHC class I, followed by gentle elution of associated peptides and finally peptide analysis by mass spectrometry. Each immunoprecipitation workflow yielded a different (but overlapping) cohort of peptides, suggesting optimal methodologies for analyses of immunopeptidomes from common laboratory mouse strains.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0ba9c21-630e-4816-b397-f9a50d82258f\/@y03B8ZHb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Mouse models,Immunopeptidome,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14049"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seeta Nyayapathy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Ford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Pisano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie M.

Mice cured of their B78s with ISV demonstrate long-term immune memory, evidenced by rejection of engraftment of a tumor rechallenge &#62;180 days post initial cure of tumor. Traditionally, immaune memory is thought to be mediated via CD8+ T cells, which require antigen presentation via MHC Class I (MHCI). However, B78s express little to no MHCI but do express MHCII when stimulated with IFN&#947;. While not commonly expressed on solid tumors, MHCII is expressed on 50-60% of melanomas in humans. Here we explored implications of MHCI and MHCII expression in both the primary and long-term memory anti-tumor responses generated with ISV.<br \/>Methods: CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted in mice during the primary anti-tumor response (i.e. B78 tumor bearing mice receiving the ISV regimen) or during tumor rechallenge experiments (i.e. B78-cured mice rechallenged with B78s). Tumor growth was monitored. In separate studies, tumors and tumor draining lymphnodes (TDLNs) were harvested during the primary antitumor response and analyzed via flow cytometry to assess T cell activation and immune infiltrate. Finally, TDLNs were harvested from B78-cured mice, 7 days after tumor rechallenge, to define memory T cell subsets.<br \/>Results: Depletion studies revealed CD4+ T cells are required for both the antitumor response to ISV and the long-term memory response in B78-cured mice, but CD8+ T cells are not required for either of these responses. Increased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell infiltrates are observed in the tumor microenvironment during the primary anti-tumor response. In B78-cured mice, though not required for memory responses, CD8+ central memory T cells are significantly increased in the TDLNs compared to na&#239;ve or primary tumor bearing mice. The amount of CD4+ effector memory T cells are significantly increased in the TDLN of B78-cured mice compared to CD8+ effector memory T cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Often not expressed on solid tumors, MHCII is expressed on some melanoma tumors, and its expression has been correlated with a positive response to immunotherapies. CD4+ cytotoxic T cells can directly engage MHCII on tumors, suggesting this interaction has an important role in the response to immunotherapy for MHCII expressing tumors. Our data suggest that CD4+ T cells drive both the primary anti-tumor and long-term immune memory responses in the B78 model when treating with this effective ISV. We are continuing our efforts to understand the characteristics of the B78 cell line that may be relevant to its response to immunotherapy and its resistance to single agent checkpoint blockade. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ISV-induced immune recognition and destruction of B78s may guide future improvements of this clinically-relevant immunotherapy regimen.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dcd0dc74-314d-4583-9de5-3d3bff01beee\/@y03B8ZHb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,MHC II,MHCI,Immune Memory,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14051"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amy K.

Hallmarks of this aggressive disease include constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via mutant KRAS (mKRAS) and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Constituently-active KRAS has now been rendered targetable via clinical-stage mKRAS-specific small molecule inhibitors. While the impact of KRAS inhibition on tumor growth is well-studied, its ability to engender anti-tumor adaptive immune responses is not fully understood. Prior data generated by our group demonstrated mKRAS inhibition (mKRASi) increased expression of genes associated with antigen presentation in two models of PDAC <i>in vitro<\/i>. Additionally, proteomic analysis revealed increased expression of two tumor associated antigens (TAAs), MSLN and PSCA.<br \/>To better understand the alteration of antigen presentation in response to MAPK signaling perturbation, we measured surface expression of MHC-I and PD-L1 after mKRAS and\/or SHP2 inhibition via flow cytometry in a PDAC-KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> model <i>in vitro.<\/i> Results demonstrate an additive increase in MHC-I surface expression following inhibition of SHP2 and in combination with mKRASi that is more pronounced in the setting of type I interferon (IFN). Inhibition of MEK in a PDAC KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> model recapitulates these findings. Addition of a JAK inhibitor did not suppress the additional MHC-I expression suggesting a potential JAK\/STAT-independent mechanism for this observation.<br \/>To better understand the extent of alteration of presented epitopes in response to these perturbations we established an immunopeptidomics profiling workflow, using LC-MS\/MS to identify peptide ligands eluted from MHC-I complexes after inhibition of mKRAS and\/or SHP2. We additionally profiled epitope alterations after the addition of type I or II IFN. MAPK perturbation resulted in more unique epitopes identified, especially with dual inhibition of mKRAS and SHP2 and further potentiated by type I IFN. Furthermore, we were able to directly identify epitopes derived from MSLN and PSCA in our cell line models. This data demonstrates the potential for MAPK inhibition to render PDAC more sensitive to the adaptive immune system and synergize with immunotherapeutic treatment strategies. Additionally, direct identification of epitopes presented by cancer cells via mass spectrometry can aid in the rational design of targeted immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/912da438-2ac2-415e-a547-b6d2057519cc\/@y03B8ZHb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,KRAS,Proteomics,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14052"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda L.

Recent advances have facilitated identification of tumor mutant neoantigens and led to efforts to develop effective personalized neoantigen cancer vaccines. However, little is known about how expression of multiple neoantigens with variable peptide-MHC (pMHC) binding or TCR affinity\/avidity affects T cell responses to both discrete neoantigens and shared non-mutant antigens, and if the localization of T cells with distinctive pMHC specificity differs within the tumor. To address this, we genetically introduced multiple combinations of MHC-I and MHC-II neoantigens in the poorly immunogenic <i>Braf<sup>v600e<\/sup><\/i> <i>Pten<sup>-\/-<\/sup> Cdkn2a<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> YUMM1.7 (Y1.7) mouse melanoma line that contains a paucity of neoantigens. We expressed neoantigens previously found in a mouse sarcoma line of the same MHC haplotype as Y1.7. The MHC-I neoantigens used were formed by G1254V mutation in Laminin alpha subunit-4 (Lama4) and A506T mutation in the Asparagine-linked glycosylation 8 (Alg8) and the MHC-II neoantigen was formed by A710T mutation in Integrin beta-1 (Itgb1). We generated Y1.7 lines expressing minigenes for mLama4, mAlg8, or mLama4 + mAlg8 MHC-I neoantigens. All three lines also expressed the mItgb1 MHC-II neoantigen. Whereas ICT-treated mice bearing the parental Y1.7 melanoma line showed rapid tumor growth, modified Y1.7 lines expressing mLama4 and\/or mAlg8 plus mItgb1 were rendered sensitive to ICT. Tumors expressing mLama4 and\/or mAlg8 contained mLama4- and\/or mAlg8-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, respectively. Preliminary analysis revealed expression of either MHC-I neoantigen alters the frequency of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells specific for non-mutant endogenous antigens in Y1.7. Interestingly, therapeutic synthetic long-peptide (SLP) vaccines incorporating mLama4 and\/or mAlg8 neoantigens plus poly I:C induced tumor rejection comparable to ICT. Moreover, SLP vaccines amplified intratumoral mLama4- and mAlg8-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, as well as in tumor-draining lymph nodes, where these neoantigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were found to express IFN-&#947;. During either vaccination or ICT, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell response to mLama4 was higher than that to mAlg8 when both neoantigens were co-expressed. Altogether, these melanoma models will enable us to determine whether expression of one or more MHC-I neoantigens influences CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses to both distinct neoantigens and non-mutant antigens (e.g., gp100, Trp2) during ICT and SLP vaccination. Furthermore, high-dimensional analyses approaches including scRNA-seq. and CODEX imaging are ongoing and will facilitate development of improved immunotherapies and may help uncover novel biomarkers of response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7958873d-919b-4319-9661-c6f9b27b40ea\/@y03B8ZHb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Vaccines,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14055"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sunita Keshari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charmelle D.

This is mediated by the successful presentation of tumor-specific antigens on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules on the surface of tumor cells. Studies have focused on alterations in MHC I complex proteins (e.g. HLA, B2M) and gene regulatory elements (e.g. NLRC5). However, the impact on tumor response of individual defects in components regulating and composing the MHC I antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM) have not been extensively studied. Using a harmonized dataset of six clinical trials of patients with melanoma treated with ICB, whole-exome sequencing (WES, n= 244) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq, n= 426) data from untreated tumor samples were assessed to identify mutations in genes associated with MHC I APM and their regulation. Somatic alterations were correlated with clinical response to ICB and with gene expression profiles in tumor-matched RNAseq data. Mutations in MHC I and MHC I-related genes were found in 63% of patients (n= 154\/244). The most recurrently mutated genes were <i>NCAM1<\/i> (11%, n=28), <i>TRIM48 <\/i>(7%, n=17), and <i>CAMK2B <\/i>(6.6%, n=16), and the transcriptional regulators <i>NLRC5<\/i> (9.4%, n=23) and <i>CIITA <\/i>(9.4%, n=23). Mutations in <i>NLRC5<\/i> and <i>CIITA <\/i>trended toward being mutually exclusive from one another (Fisher&#8217;s exact test, p= 0.157) and mutations were overrepresented in tumors with stable or progressive disease following ICB therapy.

To develop novel cancer immunotherapies, <i>in vitro<\/i> primary immune cell bioassays offer an early assessment of their effects on the various players of the TME. Cytotoxic cells are key players in the anti-tumor immune response. CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, recognize and kill cells presenting antigens bound to MHC class I molecules, such as neoantigens present on the tumor cell surface. Activation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells requires at least two signals from antigen presenting cells: binding of their T cell receptor (TCR) to the appropriate peptide presented on MHC I and co-stimulation by B7 binding to CD28. However, the TME possesses several mechanisms to reduce immune cell activity, such as the expression of checkpoint inhibitors dampening the immune system. Natural killer (NK) cells represent another type of cytotoxic cells, with their innate immune activity dictating an important role in anti-tumor immunity. NK cells induce apoptosis via the release of perforin and granzymes from granules, eliminating cells lacking expression MHC I, including cancer cells that have lost expression of MHC I. However, also the activity of NK cells can be hampered in the TME, notably by the PD1\/PDL1 interaction.Increasing the activity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T and NK cells as a therapeutic anti-tumor strategy has become an important point of attention. Such strategies can have several shapes, with Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of IgG1 isotypes being one of the mechanisms that can be exploited by immunoglobulin-based therapeutics. Another way to increase the killing of tumor cells is to re-direct T cells to tumor cells by employing bi-specific antibodies targeting specific tumor associated antigens. Using this strategy, T cell activation can be concentrated in the TME, thereby also avoiding off-tumor activity. Real-time <i>in vitro <\/i>assessment of the potential enhanced killing capacity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T and NK cells elicited by test molecules could further provide pivotal information on the functional dynamics of test molecules. Using high quality primary human immune cells, <i>in vitro<\/i> bioassays were developed with improved robustness and reproducibility to screen for the potential to enhance tumor cell killing by novel therapeutics. The ability to evaluate the compounds capacity to increase or induce a cytotoxic activity profile and thereby facilitate the anti-tumor immune response is essential in the early drug development process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/07228379-ceeb-4128-8bdd-72cb3e409222\/@z03B8ZHc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ADCC,T cell engager,Natural killer cells,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14581"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Johan Arnold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Thibaut J.

The presence of TLS has been associated with improved patient outcome and response to immunotherapy, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Similarly, the contribution of B cells and TLS to anti-tumour immunity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains largely unexplored.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We evaluated TRACERx and TCGA NSCLC cohorts to compare B cell and TLS signatures as well as BCR sequences from human adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Using a novel immunogenic mouse model of LUAD, we applied lineage tracing, 3D IF, and single-cell sequencing to characterise the evolution of lung germinal centre and antibody responses over tumour progression and immunotherapy treatment. We validated immunotherapy observations in a cohort of melanoma patients with pre- and post-treatment samples.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that B cell and TLS gene set scores were significantly higher in LUAD compared to LUSC. We examined B cell signals in specific mutational backgrounds, and observed an increase in BCR CDR3 diversity and IgG class switch in the context of clonal <i>TP53<\/i> mutation. We therefore investigated the mechanistic basis of B cells in LUAD using an immunogenic mouse model on a <i>KRAS\/TP53<\/i> background. We found that TLS organisation was triggered by CXCL13 and that exogenous CXCL13 treatment increased B cell infiltration and overall survival. Using serum transfer experiments, we demonstrated that tumour-binding class-switched antibodies played an anti-tumour role and increased survival. We found that immunotherapy increased germinal centre B cell responses and antibody quantity and quality. Using single-cell BCR sequencing of immunotherapy-treated mice, we showed clonal expansion of B cells reactive to re-expressed endogenous retroviral antigens. Furthermore, we found that KRAS G12C but not MEK inhibition boosted B cell and antibody responses. Finally, combined treatment with CXCL13 and checkpoint blockade improved survival, suggesting that boosting local B cell responses can improve immunotherapy outcome. In checkpoint blockade-treated melanoma patients, we found that BCR diversity and the number of unique antigen specificities was elevated in responders post-therapy. Non-responders showed a loss of expanded clones, suggesting that both maintenance of expanded clones and recruitment of new clones associate with successful response.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our work describes a novel role for B cells in the lung tumour microenvironment and establish that TLS directly contribute to anti-tumour immunity by producing class-switched protective antibodies. We demonstrate that selective boosting of anti-tumour B cells shows therapeutic potential in combination with targeted and immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/884d109c-1fae-4f90-bc86-40d2428b4c32\/@z03B8ZHc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,B cells,Mouse models,KRAS inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14644"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katey Enfield<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Boumelha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Litchfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oriol Pich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TRACERx Consortium<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Swanton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Kassiotis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julian Downward<\/i><\/presenter>.

Humanized PBMC reconstitution in immune deficient mice is becoming a good model for evaluating therapeutic antibodies, especially the BsAb with one arm of anti-CD3 that mediates immune cells and another arm targeting a tumor antigen. However, limited window of dosing regimen triggered by graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) after 30-40 days of reconstitution, and insufficient tumor-infiltrated immune cells naturally from reconstituted circulatory system hindered the widely application of the model in immunotherapy in development of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors or immune agonists. To overcome this, LIDE has developed a unique human PBMC-cancer cells co-inoculated model instead. In our platform, cancer-priming PBMCs were mixed with the fresh cancer cells in MatriGel, co-inoculated into NCG mice to form a huPBMC well-infiltrated tumor tissue for immunotherapy. Our platform has been successfully helped evaluate biological function of PD1, Tigit, PVRIG, CD73, CD47, CD38, CD40, GITR Antibodies, Tgfb1\/PDL1 BsAb, DLL3\/CD3 BsAb in multiple cancers, such as melanoma, breast cancer and lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b30fcfd0-78b9-4981-859f-1eed5ae09848\/@z03B8ZHc\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,T cell,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14645"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Bin Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongkui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Danyi Wen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

While many markers can be used for a detailed immunophenotypic or functional analysis, design of a large multicolor flow cytometry panel is still hampered by the selection of optimal fluorochrome combinations. For example, expansion of existing flow cytometry panels with new markers of interest can result is suboptimal resolution and, in some cases, the need to design a new panel, impacting cost and increasing time to insight. To minimize these challenges and to provide increased flexibility, we have developed a human T cell backbone panel strategically designed to be complemented with 5-8 drop-in markers of choice, depending on instrument configuration. The backbone panel contains five T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CCR7) conventionally used to identify different maturational states of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (na&#239;ve, central memory, effector memory, effector memory RA). We will show how this backbone panel meets four fundamental requirements: i) clear resolution of major T cell subsets; ii) the fluorochromes used in the backbone panel have minimal resolution impact on the detectors allocated for drop-ins; iii) the fluorochromes assigned to drop-ins have minimal impact on the resolution of the backbone panel; iv) the fluorochromes assigned to drop-ins do not impact each other. We will provide examples of different drop-in combinations for the study of T cell and regulatory T cell biology. Performance of the backbone panel on different instruments will be shown to demonstrate assay consistency across platforms. The compatibility of the backbone panel with intracellular cytokine stain and transcription factor analysis will be further demonstrated. This pre-optimized backbone panel represents a unique tool for researchers who need to study different aspects of T cell biology and want to easily increase their assay capabilities, while minimizing panel design challenges and impact to population resolution.

The gold standard would be to analyze tumor and immune cells from the same sample, providing purified cells that are interacting within the tumor. Many tissue homogenization techniques have been developed to release cells for downstream analysis, however, an automated and gentle process of purifying multiple cell types from the same processed tissue has remained elusive. The industry-standard workflows, such as centrifugation, have presented long-standing performance issues in terms of low cell recovery and inefficient removal of molecular debris, which often leads to sequencing results that are difficult to interpret. To ensure the quality of sequencing data from tissues, upstream processes need to improve to get the most from the precious patient tissue. Applied Cells has developed an integrated system based on multiple physics principles to achieve cell wash, concentration, and target cell isolation, with high recovery at an unprecedented flow rate. This platform combines tunable, acoustic cell purification and in-flow, column-free immuno-magnetic separation technologies, enabling automation of the entire cell sample preparation workflow for genomics and transcriptomics analysis. By harnessing the power and precision of acoustic cell manipulation, the MARS System can process a variety of samples including dissociated solid tissue in enzymatic buffer with high cell recovery and superior molecular debris removal compared to standard methods. For instance, when purifying leukocytes from a lung cancer biopsy tissue samples, MARS can remove 99.50% debris and 91% of dead cells in one single step, which is supreme than the conventional centrifuge cell wash while having &#62;90% leukocyte recovery at 1mL\/min flow rate. The in-flow microfluidics design drastically reduces residual DNA and RNA fragments that are difficult to remove using centrifuge wash methods. Furthermore, the system enables parallel cell purification and concentration for high throughput sample processing. Tumor or TIL cells can be further enriched by means of positive magnetic selection for genomic or cell biology applications. This novel platform allows improved tumor and TIL recovery in a gentle, consistent manner while having minimal interference with downstream applications, all from a single source starting material.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1cae15ce-7c73-4b6e-b80a-867661c044ac\/@z03B8ZHc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Cancer cell,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14648"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liping Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

A key source of cytotoxic T cell response in cancer is neoantigens, cancer cell specific mutations that result in mutant peptides that elicit a T cell mediated immune response. However, a mutation can only engender a neoantigen if the associated mutant peptide is presented to T cells by HLA molecules, and, as such, transcriptional repression or loss of the HLA genes can have important implications for immune evasion.<br \/>Methods: We elucidate allele specific genomic and transcriptomic disruption to class I and II HLA genes. In whole exome sequencing (WES) data, our new tool (LOHHLA2.0) assesses loss of heterozygosity (LOH) status and somatic mutations. In RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data, LOHHLA2.0 quantifies allele specific expression and transcriptional repression referencing matched tumor adjacent normal samples. We applied LOHHLA2.0 to the TRACERx421 dataset, including 1554 WES tumor regions from 421 patients and 941 RNAseq regions from 357 tumor patients, 96 of which also had RNAseq from tumor adjacent normal samples.<br \/>Results: We find that our method is more accurate than existing tools (RSEM) at calling gene level expression, e.g. in HLA-DPB1, RSEM under-calls HLA expression by a factor of two. 36% of TRACERx421 primary tumors harbored HLA LOH of at least one class I HLA gene, validating our previous findings in the TRACERx100 cohort. Strikingly, we found that 74% (71\/96) of primary tumors with matched tumor adjacent normal tissue exhibited transcriptional repression of one or more class I HLA alleles, and 81% (78\/96) exhibited class II allele transcriptional repression. Class I HLA transcriptional repression was more likely to occur subclonally than LOH. In a subset of tumors, we observed convergence upon disruption of the same allele through alternative mechanisms; with genomic loss in one tumor region and transcriptional repression in another region of the same tumor. Across the tumor regions, we found a concordance between HLA expression and immune infiltrate levels, with immune hot tumors exhibiting higher HLA class I expression.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, we find significant disruption to class I and II HLA expression adding to the diversity of immune evasion processes evident in early stage treatment naive NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1cc6f04f-ea72-4726-b196-e9629795a1dd\/@z03B8ZHc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,Tumor immunity,Tumor antigen,HLA class I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14639"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Clare Puttick<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oriol Pich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Leung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Martinez-Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Bentham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Rosenthal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonya Hessey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James R.
