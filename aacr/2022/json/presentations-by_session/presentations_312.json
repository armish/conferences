[{"Abstract":"As novel cancer treatments become available, the need to quickly and accurately evaluate whether these treatments are effective remains unaddressed. Obtaining earlier feedback on the efficacy of a cancer therapy could prevent a poor treatment outcome by switching to a more effective therapy sooner. Levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have been found to be prognostic of tumor progression, suggesting that a non-invasive liquid biopsy assay could provide longitudinal ctDNA measurements that accurately track tumor progression. However, while there is interest in using existing minimal residual disease (MRD) detection and treatment selection liquid biopsy assays for treatment monitoring applications, they both suffer from limitations in their ability to precisely and sensitively quantify trends in tumor progression over the course of treatment. In addition, tumor-informed MRD detection assays are often infeasible for treatment monitoring due to unavailability of the initial tissue sample.<br \/>We have developed and validated a novel methylation-based liquid biopsy assay for pan-cancer treatment monitoring without the need to obtain a sample from the tumor itself. Methylation has long been shown to be a strong and consistent biomarker for cancer, and because tumor tissue has widespread differential methylation across the genome compared to normal tissue, we are able to overcome molecule sampling limitations. In analytical validation, our assay could detect as small changes as 0.05%, e.g., an elevation of tumor fraction from 0.5% to 0.55%, a level of precision that is an order-of-magnitude better than any available assays. Next, we tested our assay on clinical specimens by measuring ctDNA in serially collected blood samples from subjects with cancer. As would be expected from the high level of precision, we were able to successfully demonstrate the predictive power of ctDNA measurements for clinical outcomes. These results from our methylation-based liquid biopsy assay open the path to earlier and extremely precise treatment monitoring for oncologists and their patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c8fd083-9a30-460f-81a7-c80b50d5147b\/@C03B8ZBm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"cfDNA,Liquid biopsies,Methylation,Cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12618"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patrick Peiyong Ye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robb Viens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xavier Bower<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shan Riku<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Tsao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oguzhan Atay<\/i><\/presenter>.

The Genexus&#8482; Integrated Sequencer provides a viable pathway to deploy an automated platform for a sensitive pan-cancer liquid biopsy assay to meet the needs of quick turn-around and cost effectiveness for multi-site implementation. The Oncomine&#8482; Precision Assay GX (OPAGX) is an amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that enables detection of biomarkers across 50 genes from both solid tissue and liquid biopsy samples. OPAGX uses AmpliSeq&#8482; HD technology which includes unique molecular tags for sequencing error correction and increased sensitivity. The assay&#8217;s detection of hotspot mutations was evaluated for liquid biopsy samples.<br \/>Methods: Automated library preparation was completed on the Genexus&#8482; Integrated Sequencer using 20 ng of cfTNA derived from plasma or from well characterized control samples (Acrometrix, Agilent, Horizon, and SeraSeq). After reverse transcription was completed, gene targets of interest were amplified from DNA and cDNA. Amplicons were labeled with dual molecular barcodes during library preparation. Subsequently, libraries were bead normalized, pooled, and sequenced on a GX5&#8482; chip to a targeted depth of 12,000,000 reads per sample. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were examined by evaluating the correctness of calling true positive variants compared to false negative and false positive variant calls, respectively. Precision and limit of detection (LoD) were examined by evaluating the concordance of variants across replicate samples with the range of AF between 0.1% - 35% for SNVs and 0.2% - 15% for insertions and deletions. Specificity and accuracy were examined by evaluating the correctness of calling true negative variants compared to false positive and all other variant calls, respectively.<br \/>Results: Accuracy was 98% for SNVs and 100% for insertions and deletions above 0.25% allele frequency (AF). Sensitivity was 95% for SNVs and 81% for insertions and deletions above 0.5% AF. Specificity and PPV were 100% for SNVs and insertions and deletions above 0.1% AF. Intra-run precision was 95% for SNVs and 92% for insertions and deletions above 0.5% and 0.25% AF, respectively. Inter-run precision was 93% for SNVs and 76% for insertions and deletions above 0.5% and 0.25% AF, respectively. The estimated AF LoD was 0.6% for SNVs, which is slightly above the advertised 0.5% provided by the vendor. Additionally, CNV gain calls were 100% for ERBB2 above 0.25% AF, MET above 0.5% AF, and FGFR3 at all AFs.<br \/>Conclusions: The demonstrated performance of OPAGX presents a viable liquid biopsy platform which lays the foundation for global standardization of genomic profiling liquid biopsy samples with minimal nucleic acid input.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2463b219-0f77-499f-bfc2-37b1c3687708\/@C03B8ZBm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating cell-free DNA,Circulating tumor DNA,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12620"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lauren Frady<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Desiree Unselt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Pufky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fernando Torres<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Sims<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Mason<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, targeted NGS has poor accuracy for calling known variants with VAF below 0.5%. The goal of this study from the FDA-Sequencing and Quality Control Phase 2 (SEQC2) consortium was to develop and validate bioinformatic and biostatistical methods that enable incorporation of synthetic competitive internal standards (IS) in targeted NGS analysis of actionable tumor mutations.<br \/>Methods: A synthetic IS spike-in was designed for each actionable mutation target, suitable for use in NGS following targeted PCR or hybrid-capture enrichment and either with unique molecular index (UMI) or non-UMI library preparation. Contrived ctDNA reference samples developed by the SEQC2 consortium containing actionable mutations at known variant allele fraction were used. An aliquot of each sample was mixed with a mixture of IS. Following Illumina TST170 enrichment and library preparation, each library was sequenced, then native template (NT) sequences were separated from IS sequences bioinformatically. In SNAQ-SEQ&#8482; analysis, Poisson Exact Test (PET) analysis was used to calculate the statistical difference between each sample library NT variant VAF and respective IS variant VAF. Analysis was based on NT variant count and position coverage (i.e., copies recovered in library preparation) and IS count and position coverage. PET performed an exact test of a simple null hypothesis about the ratio between two rate parameters in Poisson distribution.<br \/>Results: Stochastic sampling effect on IS error detection was minimized by ensuring an IS\/NT ratio of 2.5 or greater. Under the specified conditions, in which a minimum of two NT variant observations were required for a call, the IS was able to estimate NGS background error for each sample when a minimum IS:NT ratio of 2.5:1 was used. Without use of IS information, the Illumina pipeline called 73% (41\/56) of known TP variants in the 0.1% - 0.3% VAF range. In contrast, SNAQ-SEQ&#8482; analysis (PET analysis of IS and NT information) increased TP detection sensitivity to 86% (48\/56), for a 13% increase in sensitivity, with no false positives.<br \/>Conclusion: Following mixture of contrived ctDNA reference samples with IS, PET analysis enabled calculation of technical error rate, limit of blank, and limit of detection for each variant at each nucleotide position, in each sample. Using this SNAQ-SEQ&#8482; analysis, true positive mutations with variant allele fraction too low for detection by current practice were detected with this method, thereby increasing sensitivity. SNAQ-SEQ&#8482; provides QC that is already standard operating procedure in clinical laboratories for analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/200ee37d-5d3b-4b5f-ab29-e4d2db47bbf6\/@C03B8ZBm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Targeted sequencing,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12621"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James C.

The prognosis for newly diagnosed cases is overall poor and strongly influenced by clinical stage at time of diagnosis, with dismal survival rates for cases diagnosed at a late stage. However, molecular profiling at diagnosis and advances in precision medicine has vastly improved the clinical management of lung cancer patients. An efficient evaluation of treatment response and early detection of recurrent disease can further improve survival rates. However, response evaluation during treatment is still limited to either radiological evaluation at fixed intervals or the risk-associated trans-thoracic biopsies that cannot be performed frequently. Therefore, there is an imperative need to identify minimally invasive, personalised biomarkers that can longitudinally monitor treatment response as well as early detect and map emerging resistance mechanisms leading to relapse. Employing liquid biopsy platforms to analyse tumor biomarkers in circulating nucleic acids, especially circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), is a promising approach for longitudinal disease monitoring as it is less invasive and quantitative. Here we present the Ume&#229; Molecular Adaptive Platform (UMAP) aimed for developing personalised tumor biomarkers for disease monitoring of individual lung cancer patients following curative treatment. The UMAP employs matched diagnostic tumor tissue and plasma samples from Swedish lung cancer patients (retrieved from Uppsala-Ume&#229; Comprehensive Cancer Consortium, Sweden) and entails mutational profiling of tumor tissue, specifically identifying disease-associated large structural variants (SVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) by long read sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) and Illumina TST170 target enrichment sequencing, respectively. Individualized SVs and SNVs biomarker assays are then developed for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) -based analysis and quantification in ctDNA isolated from corresponding plasma samples. This tailored, patient-specific panel can then be used to longitudinally monitor disease evolution and treatment response during the entire therapy regimen using blood-based sampling. The UMAP workflow has been optimised by mutational profiling of 3 lung cancer cell lines (H1299, H1975 and H2228) and fresh frozen tumor tissues from 12 lung cancer patients using ONT and Illumina TST170 panel followed by development of robust, highly sensitive ddPCR assays for targeting candidate SNVs and SVs with minimal hands-on time and with detection limit as low as 0.001%. Impact of this tailored approach on improving survival can be evaluated by implementing UMAP in a prospective clinical trial with patients with advanced lung cancer disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e8d9ca1-10cd-49dc-a5e4-fe805386781f\/@D03B8ZBn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,NSLC,,ctDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12622"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zahra Haider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda Köhn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Karlowatz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikael B.

Currently, there are no existing data on the genomic landscape of mCRPC in the context of this therapy, with the identification of biomarkers linked to outcomes with Lu-PSMA being a critical unmet need in order to select patients most likely to benefit from treatment and to dissect mechanisms of resistance. mCRPC patients with high PSMA expression on positron emission tomography scans and prior treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy and an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor were enrolled on a compassionate access prospective registry at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Patients received Lu-PSMA every 6 weeks for 4-6 cycles and entered into follow-up. Peripheral blood samples were collected for plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis at baseline and prior to cycle 2 of therapy. A highly-sensitive targeted next-generation sequencing assay was applied to patient plasma and matched leukocytes. Somatic mutations (single nucleotide variants\/indels) and copy number alterations from 43 genes were reported, along with the estimated ctDNA fraction. Current patient numbers preclude formal statistical analysis of genomic aberrations, however dynamic changes in ctDNA were assessed in relation to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and clinical and\/or radiographic progression. In total, 19 plasma samples were analysed from 13 mCRPC patients with a median age of 71. Patients had between one and four prior lines of therapy for mCRPC and had a median time on Lu-PSMA therapy of 3.7 months. ctDNA was detected in 17\/19 plasma samples with a median fraction of 26% (range 0-89%). Overall, a PSA response rate of 54% was observed. Interestingly, patients with higher baseline ctDNA fractions were more likely to experience a PSA response to Lu-PSMA therapy (median ctDNA fraction of responders 49% vs 10% in non-responders, <i>p<\/i>=0.1). Additionally, no PSA responses were seen in patients who did not attain a reduction in plasma ctDNA from baseline to cycle 2. This is the first targeted assessment of serial plasma samples from patients receiving Lu-PSMA therapy. Using a highly sensitive liquid biopsy assay, ctDNA was detectable in almost all samples. In this preliminary analysis, both baseline ctDNA fraction and early dynamic changes in ctDNA fraction appear to have clinical importance in Lu-PSMA therapy. Recruitment to this registry is proceeding rapidly, with further data available by April 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27218354-a623-4b92-bdc9-b9c2abd1b29e\/@D03B8ZBn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Theranostics,Cell-free DNA,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12624"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Heidi Fettke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Hauser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Bukczynska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Medhurst<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louise Kostos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Buteau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Steen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tu Nguyen-Dumont<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hofman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arun A.

While widely used to characterize tumors, tissue biopsy is limited in patient follow-up due to its invasive nature and the lack representation of the entire tumor bulk. To develop the method of circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) for obtaining clinically valuable sequence information, we isolated cfDNA from the plasma samples of 10 advanced metastatic lung cancer patients and performed next generation sequencing (NGS) using a unique molecular marker (UMI) integrated 275-gene-target-panel at the average depth of 4,000 X coverage. We were able to identify common mutants of lung cancer driver genes, e.g. EGFR, KRAS, DNMT3 and TP53 with high confidence. In one example, the TKI resistant EGFR mutant T790M was found coexisting with EGFR 746-750del and TP53 splice variant in a baseline sample of a patient progressed from a first-generation EGFR inhibitor. And the dynamic changes of the allele frequency of EGFR and TP53 mutants were consistent with total cfDNA levels of the patients. Interestingly, an osimertinib resistance EGFR mutant C797S emerged at Day 355 post-treatment and followed by disease progression in 4 months. In addition to EGFR gene mutations, we further found increasing EGFR copy number associated with drug resistance and cancer progression of this patient. Our study demonstrated that it is feasible using cfDNA for patient follow-up to understand cancer resistance or disease progression through characterization of cancer mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c48366ff-7669-46b2-ae17-c06c92572e15\/@D03B8ZBn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating cell-free DNA,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Mutation detection,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12625"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhigang Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Cao<\/i><\/presenter>.

As opposed to single-site solid tumor biopsy, liquid biopsies allow for better representation of the tumor mutational landscape. In the clinic, liquid biopsies are utilized for early detection of disease, to help inform treatment decisions, to monitor for disease recurrence, and to identify potential resistance mechanisms. Here we describe our approach to developing a liquid biopsy assay that will allow us to monitor, in real time, longitudinal changes in mutations&#8217; allelic frequency in patients with solid tumors. Our approach combines two powerful technologies: next-generation sequencing, that enables the identification of a broad array of mutations, and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) that provides speed and a cost-effective advantage to monitor mutations in cfDNA obtained from patient plasma samples.<br \/>In order to maximize the effectiveness of using liquid biopsy assays in our clinical trial, we prioritized developing an approach that enabled us to meet the following criteria: 1) generating a baseline and end-of-treatment mutational profile for each patient using either a tumor tissue sample or liquid biopsy to identify both driver and potential resistance mutation markers, 2) longitudinal sampling and real-time analysis over the course of treatment, 3) high assay sensitivity to detect low frequency alleles, 4) overall cost-effectiveness, and 5) ability to examine allelic frequency of multiple mutations of interest from limited input of cfDNA isolated from plasma.<br \/>Assay development included custom quantification of cfDNA and optimization of a pre-amplification step, which amplified the material allowing us to analyze multiple mutations of interest while ensuring that the quantitative nature of the assay was not impacted. For each individual mutation, gBlocks&#8482; and\/or cell-line&#8722;derived cfDNA were utilized to optimize annealing temperature and time, cycle number, and input amount to attain an assay with a target 0.1% limit of detection. These customized mutation assays can potentially serve as an accelerated cost-effective surrogate approach, compared to imaging, to monitor in real time the response to KB-0742 (CDK9i) in the ongoing phase 1\/2 clinical trial NCT04718675.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/062190b8-f224-457a-be10-c112671f59fc\/@D03B8ZBn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,Droplet digital PCR,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12627"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Suha Naffar-Abu Amara<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Noe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tressa Hood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Paganini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Crystal MacKenzie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melinda A.

However, only 15-20% of the patients benefit from ACT: 50% would be cured by surgery alone and are thus being overtreated, while 30-35% will experience a recurrence despite adjuvant treatment. Therefore, there is a need for prognostic biomarkers to better stratify this group of patients for ACT. Recent studies in non metastatic colorectal cancer have shown that detection of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood after surgery indicates presence of minimal residual disease, and is highly prognostic for relapse. Hence, ctDNA based liquid biopsies could be a promising approach to guide post-surgery treatment decisions in stage III colon cancer.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Aim: <\/b>Determine the prognostic value of post-surgery ctDNA in stage III colon cancer patients treated with ACT in order to reduce futile treatment.<br \/><b>Study design and Methods: <\/b>The Prospective Dutch Colorectal Cancer Cohort study PLCRC (www.PLCRC.nl) offers a nationwide infrastructure to accrue colorectal cancer patients in nearly all (&#62;60) hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients give informed consent for collection of clinical data, tissue and blood samples. &#8220;PROVENC3&#8221; (PROgnostic Value of Early Notification by Ctdna in Colon Cancer stage 3) is a prospective observational subcohort of PLCRC consisting of 267 stage III colon cancer patients treated with ACT,open for patient accrual in 25 hospitals. Blood samples are collected pre-surgery, post-surgery, post-ACT and longitudinally every six months up to 3 years. We will apply tumor-informed detection of ctDNA mutations by integrated analysis of targeted sequencing of a panel of 30 genes in cfDNA (PGDx elio plasma resolveassay) with a panel of 500 genes in DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (PGDx elio tissue complete assay). The clinical, pathological, and molecular data will be integrated in cBioPortal.<br \/><b>Results and future directions: <\/b>267 patients have been included. Approximately 950 blood samples have been collected to date. Once sequencing data is obtained, multivariate Cox regression analysis will be used to assess the association between post-surgery ctDNA detection and progression-free and overall survival. Ultimately, the results of this study will be used to design an ethically acceptable and cost-effective ctDNA-guided interventional trial in stage III colon cancer patients, in order to improve the risk stratification and reduce futile ACT and its associated side-effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d981608-a83d-4f0b-a59d-e3df5800b962\/@D03B8ZBn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Prognostic markers,Colorectal cancer,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12629"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"9e6d9722-bf58-4bf5-9bec-737e5657ff6d","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9e6d9722-bf58-4bf5-9bec-737e5657ff6d\/@D03B8ZBn\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carmen Rubio Alarcon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dave E.

TMB measurements can be determined using genomic DNA extracted from FFPE-preserved tissue biopsy samples. However, assessment of TMB from a liquid biopsy, or blood TMB (bTMB), is an attractive alternative clinical diagnostic tool that would allow clinicians and patients to avoid the invasive challenge of tissue biopsies. Accurately measuring bTMB with targeted gene panels has been problematic, thus we have developed the new Seraseq&#174; bTMB reference materials at various mutational burden levels from genomic DNA extracted from tumor-derived and SNP-matched normal cell lines. Somatic variants were identified in each cell line by whole exome sequencing (WES). TMB assessments were made by an in-house developed TMB bioinformatics pipeline based on recommendations by the Friends of Cancer Research (FoCR) TMB Harmonization Consortium. DNA from tumor and normal cell lines were blended at 0%, 0.5%, and 2% tumor fractions and fragmented to approximate the size of cell free DNA (cfDNA). The resulting bTMB mixes were enriched with the TruSight&#8482; Oncology 500 ctDNA Assay (2x151 bp), in triplicate, and sequenced on a NovaSeq&#8482; 6000. Blood TMB scores were determined using the DRAGEN&#8482; TruSight Oncology 500 ctDNA Analysis Software v1.1. The observed bTMB scores for the tumor-containing materials were slightly lower in the TF 0.5% mix versus the TF 2% mix due to variants moving below the limit of detection of the TSO500 ctDNA assay (Table 1). As is the case with patient samples and clonal hematopoiesis, there are background variants in 0 % tumor content material that may elevate apparent bTMB scores, thus adjusted bTMB scores are shown. The Seraseq Blood TMB Score reference materials provide a tumor-normal matched blood TMB control to aid development, validation and QC of cfDNA NGS assays for accurate determination of bTMB Scores.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{3E41B2ED-DAA8-4D88-BEB6-5848E780FA00}\"><caption>Table 1.

While HBOC patients often undergo regular surveillance including breast imaging, other cancers have no effective screening or biomarkers. One emerging technology is the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), fragments of DNA that are shed from the tumor into the bloodstream. In sporadic cancer, several studies have demonstrated the advantages and sensitivity of cell-free whole genome sequencing (cfWGS) compared to targeted panel sequencing. However, the use of cfWGS for cancer detection in HBOC has not been explored.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Matched tumor, germline, and plasma were collected from 5 HBOC patients (3 breast, 2 ovarian) as part of the Canada-wide CHARM consortium (https:\/\/charmconsortium.ca). Tumor (40x), germline (20x), and plasma (20x) underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS) and subsequent variant calling pipeline using an ensemble of 6 variant callers. Insertions, deletions, and structural variants were not included in downstream analyses. Plasma tumor fraction prediction and copy number alterations were performed using ichorCNA. Detection of tumor associated mutations in plasma was compared to MRDetect software.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Variant calling identified an average of 11,170 tumor (7,649-16,706) and 1,215 (544-3,205) plasma SNVs per patient. Somatic <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> mutations were detected in 0\/5; whereas deletion of the intact <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>allele was identified in 5\/5 patients. An average of 24.6% (8.3%-75.9%) of plasma mutations where shared with SNVs identified in matched tumor. Targeted panel deep-sequencing (20,000X) was only able to detect mutations in <i>TP53 <\/i>in 3\/5 cases (0.8% - 8.6%). Plasma derived copy number alterations correlated well with tumor derived copy number alterations in 3\/5 cases and ichorCNA predicted tumor fractions ranged from 0.038 to 0.196.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Traditionally, targeted panel sequencing has been used to identify tumor associated mutations in plasma. While this technique is sensitive, major disadvantages include the narrow breadth of the captured regions and the inability to detect deletion events such as those that occur in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>. Here we show that plasma WGS is effective for detecting tumor associated mutations in HBOC and is more sensitive than targeted panel sequencing. We are currently expanding our cohort to an additional 20 matched tumor pairs, including patients with pre-diagnosis plasma timepoints.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b805ef73-f771-4ffd-acc9-29ba85419cc8\/@D03B8ZBn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,BRCA,Ovarian cancer,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12631"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Derek Wong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adriana Aguilar-Mahecha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josiane Lafleur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clarissa Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirsten Farncombe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maia Norman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leslie Oldfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prabhjit Basra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Pederson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johanna Wellum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephenie Prokopec<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Basik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raymond H.

About 45% of patients with MIBC develop metastatic relapse within 2 years after CX. The response rate to chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is relatively low, and biomarker tests for monitoring response are needed. Furthermore, biomarkers for early detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after CX is needed to enable earlier treatment initiation. Tumor-informed detection of mutations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from peripheral blood has shown promising results in its ability to monitor MRD. However, the low tumor fraction after surgery and limited input material obtained from a typical plasma sample limits the probability of detecting low metastatic burden scenarios. Here we implemented and applied locally a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approach to circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) monitoring for improving ctDNA detection.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A total of 140 MIBC patients undergoing NAC and CX were enrolled, including a test cohort (n=19) and a validation cohort (n=120). cfDNA was extracted from ~1mL plasma (n=1100) and procured from longitudinal plasma sampling during NAC (response measure), pre-cystectomy (response measure), post-surgery (relapse monitoring) and during immunotherapy (ICI treatment). WGS was applied to tumor\/germline pairs (coverage &#62;30x\/20x) and plasma cfDNA (&#62;20x) facilitating detection of genome wide genomic alterations and quantification of ctDNA using the MRDetect method.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We developed a personalized tumor-informed WGS model by integrating genome-wide mutation and copy number variation data coupled with advanced signal processing and AI-based error suppression. Patient-specific somatic variant patterns were then used for detecting and measuring the ctDNA levels in low-input blood samples by WGS. The assay sensitivity allowed for detection of tumor fractions down to 8*10<sup>-5<\/sup>. Furthermore, in our test cohort of 19 patients, we detected ctDNA after CX in 7 of 8 patients with clinical relapse (88% sensitivity) and detected no ctDNA in 11 of 11 patients with no clinical relapse (100% specificity). We observed a positive lead-time for MRD-based recurrence detection compared to CT-based reccurence detection (9 months on average). The full dataset is currently being processed and will be presented at the AACR 2022 meeting.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> For precision oncology, we need to develop quantitative and non-invasive methodologies to help tailor the treatments to individual patients and monitor them for further clinical decision-making. The results indicate the clinical potential of personalized genome-wide mutation integration as an ultra-sensitive, non-invasive method for MRD detection and treatment response monitoring which could aid in clinical management of patients with bladder cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/124477e5-9718-4aaf-938f-dcc7b0e0bd8e\/@D03B8ZBn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Whole genome sequencing,Early detection,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12639"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Iver Nordentoft<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karin Birkenkamp-Demtröder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emil Christensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Deochand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dillon Maloney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danielle Afterman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomer Lauterman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noah Friedman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Imane Bourzgui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nidhi Ramaraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zohar Donenhirsh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronel Veksler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sia Viborg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mads Agerbæk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jørgen Bjerggaard Jensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Rosenfeld<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi Kandasamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iman Tavassoly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Oklander<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asaf Zviran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Dyrskjøt<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recent advances, however, have primarily focused on adult patients with solid tumors from whom access to sufficient volumes of blood, urine or other bodily fluids is not a barrier to testing. For pediatric cancer patients, noninvasive procedures are of paramount importance for early diagnosis as well as effective monitoring of disease, but clinical diagnostic tests need to be optimized for low volumes of blood. Furthermore, most childhood solid tumors have a limited number of driver mutations that can be interrogated by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panels. We evaluated analysis of liquid biopsy using Low-Pass Whole Genome Sequencing (LP-WGS) of plasma cfDNA as a potential approach for diagnosing and monitoring pediatric solid tumors. We profiled samples from 42 patients with a variety of solid tumors including sarcoma (n = 28), germ-cell (n = 4), and renal tumors ( n = 10). cfDNA was extracted with the MagMax cell-free total nucleic acid extraction kit from 4-6ml peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes at the time of diagnosis (if available), during and after chemotherapy, and when available, at relapse. Whole-genome sequencing libraries were constructed with the xGen Prism DNA Library Prep Kit using 5ng of cfDNA and paired-end sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 at an average of 1x depth of coverage. Data was analyzed using iChor software. The LP-WGS data from the cfDNA samples was compared with copy number alteration (CNA) profiles of the primary tumors generated from clinical chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) (CytoScanHD or OncoScan). The CNA profiles detected in plasma using LP-WGS were very similar to those of the primary tumors observed by CMA. Of 42 patients analyzed to date, 19 had non-informative profiles either at diagnosis or relapse. The loss of 9p and 17p, including <i>CDKN2A<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> respectively, were the most common pathogenic CNAs detected in the abnormal cases. One patient&#8217;s germ cell tumor profiled with our OncoKids NGS panel had a confirmed <i>KRAS <\/i>mutation and 12p amplification that were also detected by LP-WGS in the liquid biopsy. Marked genomic instability characteristic of osteosarcoma was readily detectable by LP-WGS and an indication of response to therapy was mirrored by the absence of CNAs in the liquid biopsy specimen after treatment. Combined, these data suggest that liquid biopsy with LP-WGS may be used to monitor pediatric patients with solid tumors, from diagnosis through treatment and recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1a8e884b-fc79-4bfb-86d0-0a6dca8aeda8\/@D03B8ZBn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating DNA,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12640"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eirini Christodoulou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dejerianne Ostrow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anya Zdanowicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Venkata Yellapantula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cameron O'Connell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moiz Bootwalla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pan Yachen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Cotter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Amatruda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leo Mascarenhas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fariba Navid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gai Xiaowu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaclyn Biegel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent form among various histological types accounting for 85% to 90% of primary liver cancers. As per Texas Cancer Registry, the Hispanic population had an incidence of 21.2 per 100,000 in Texas. The Rio Grande Valley, located in South Texas, is an underserved area composed highly of Hispanics. It faces multiple disparities that can attribute to increased risk factors of HCC and, thus, a higher liver cancer incidence and mortality. Due to this, there is a need to identify a new, inexpensive, and faster diagnostic biomarker in liver cancer. We have recently identified an extracellular secreted cancer antigen POTE-2, a member of the ankyrin domain-containing POTE gene family. Our preliminary data indicates high POTE-2 expression in HCC tumors. In this study, we will discuss the role of POTE-2 in HCC progression and its associated regulatory pathways.<br \/>Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database of HCC patients (n=371 tumor; n=50 normal) was analyzed. Liver cancer cell lines procured from ATCC were analyzed for POTE-2 mRNA and protein expression through RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Lentiviral-based plasmids were used for overexpression and knockdown studies for oncogenic assays. Localization of POTE-2, YAP1, and PDL1 was identified with immunofluorescence.<br \/>Results: Comprehensive analysis of the TCGA database showed increased POTE-2 expression in tumors and is upregulated in all stages of HCC. Lentiviral transduction led to a change in phenotype in oncogenic assays. Modulation of POTE-2 expression led to changes in kinase activity and regulatory pathways. Immunofluorescence showed nuclear localization of YAP1 and PDL1 in the liver cancer cell lines.<br \/>Conclusion: These studies will help discover novel mechanisms of POTE-2 protein function, signaling pathways, and its role in liver cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/96772ac3-5693-4c24-9712-3a47d40db64d\/@v03B8ZBo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Apoptosis,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12840"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samantha Lopez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adithya Anilkumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Doxtater<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sudhir Kotnala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neeraj Chauhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murali Yallapu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meena Jaggi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhash Chauhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish Tripathi<\/i><\/presenter>.
