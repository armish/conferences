They come in two flavors. <b>Embryonic stem cells<\/b> are brieflypresent in the early human or mouse embryo, a few days after fertilization.These stem cells can be grown indefinitely in the lab and have the potential tobuild each and every tissue in our body. ES cells hold great promise in thefield of regenerative medicine. <b>Adult stem cells<\/b>. Every organ inour body harbors its own dedicated stem cells. These adult stem cells replacetissue that is lost due to wear and tear, trauma and disease. Adult stem cellscan only produce the tissue in which they reside. The adult stem cells allow usto live 80-90 years, but this comes at a cost: they easily turn intocancer. Both types of stem cells can be used toestablish &#8216;organoids&#8217;, 3D structures established in a dish, that recapitulatemany aspects of the original organ -including its diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hans Clevers<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
