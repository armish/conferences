[{"Abstract":"Precision medicine promises to improve the treatment of cancer patients, but a lack of therapeutic targets and associated predictive biomarkers limit this reality. To identify novel strategies, we integrate genome-scale CRISPR viability screens across many cancer models with cellular and molecular features to systematically define The Cancer Dependency Map. Using this data, we have identified that XPR1, an inorganic phosphate exporter protein, is a highly selective dependency gene in ovarian and uterine cancers. These cancers are sensitive to loss of XPR1 due to over-expression of SLC34A2, a phosphate importer protein. These data suggest a synthetic lethal relationship in which intracellular phosphate homeostasis is dysregulated in cancer. As proof-of-concept of pharmacological inhibition of XPR1, we have developed protein ligands based on the receptor binding domain of viruses which use XPR1 for cellular entry. These ligands inhibit XPR1 and kill cancer cells in an on-mechanism manner, but may be limited in their clinical utility. As such, we are deepening our understanding of the mechanisms of XPR1-dependent phosphate efflux, and have identified a novel partner protein that is integral to phosphate efflux, possibly revealing functional domains that small molecule inhibitors might target. Overall, these data highlight a novel mechanism to treat cancers by leveraging cancer-specific phosphate dysregulation and further reinforce the Cancer Dependency Map as a powerful engine to uncover novel therapeutic vulnerabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7231ab7e-0143-4bd4-b851-393026347f91\/@H03B8ZFa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-01 Antireceptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Therapeutic target,Biomarkers,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13269"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Bondeson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brenton Paolella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adhana Asfaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Rothberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Skipper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriel Mesa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfredo Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren E.

Here, we define an androgen receptor (AR) signalling network that governs the maintenance and de novo formation of cancer stem cells in triple-negative breast cancer. In response to chemotherapy, AR activation switches cells into a cancer stem cell state, while AR antagonism suppresses cancer stem cell formation and function. In vivo, we validate that the AR antagonist, seviteronel, significantly improves chemotherapy-mediated inhibition of primary and metastatic tumour growth. Analysing three independent triple-negative breast cancer patient cohorts we identify that cytoplasmic AR expression prognosticates poor survival in treatment-na&#239;ve patients and predicts poor response to chemotherapy. Additionally, Phase II clinical trial data demonstrates that seviteronel treatment&#173; followed by chemotherapy improved survival outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer patients expressing high cytoplasmic AR levels. Seviteronel combined with &#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;chemotherapy represents a promising therapeutic strategy for triple-negative breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8371ea97-20a6-4419-b5f7-9ddb565f97f8\/@H03B8ZFa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-01 Antireceptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Androgen receptor,Combination therapy,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13270"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Beatriz P.

More than 85% of PCa and advanced aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) depend on the androgen receptor (AR) for growth. AR-targeted therapeutics are the mainstay treatment option for PCa. Majority of PCa and CRPC respond to AR-LBD-binding antagonists such as enzalutamide and become refractory after a brief period of response. One of the main resistance mechanisms is the expression of AR splice variants (AR-SVs). AR-SVs lack LBD and are constitutively active, causing aggressive phenotype.<br \/><b>Description:<\/b> Rationale-based drug design was employed to synthesize selective AR irreversible covalent antagonists (SARICA). SARICAs were evaluated in AR transactivation to determine the antagonistic activity. SARICAs were incubated with purified recombinant AR activation function-1 (AF-1) protein and mass spectrometry was performed to determine their covalent binding. SARICAs were evaluated in AR-SV transactivation assay and in a Schild&#8217;s plot to determine the nature of inhibition (reversible Vs irreversible). SARICAs were tested in PCa cell line gene expression and proliferation assays and in tumor xenograft experiments.<br \/><b>Summary:<\/b> SARICAs inhibited AR transactivation in submicromolar range. Mass spectrometry with purified AF-1 protein demonstrated covalent binding of SARICAs and identified C406 and C327 as SARICA-interacting nucleophiles. Both amino acids are important for AR-V7 function and stability, making them appropriate drug targets. SARICAs inhibited the activity of AR-V7 and irreversibly inhibited AR transactivation, indicating that these covalent binders are irreversible antagonists. SARICAs selectively inhibit the proliferation and growth of AR-positive prostate cancer cells and tumors, but not AR-negative cells and tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These first-in-class AR-selective covalent molecules thus serve as chemical probes to advance our understanding of the AR-AF-1 and they potentially offer an opportunity to treat refractory cancers.<br \/><b>Disclosure:<\/b> This work was supported by an NCI grant (CA229164 and CA229164S1), a DOD grant (W81XWH2110055), and by Muirhead endowment.

The median age of diagnosis is 68yo, and while many patients initially respond to frontline treatment, relapse is common. There is an unmet need to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MCL. Our group has identified protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as a key driver of MCL pathogenesis. PRMT5 symmetrically dimethylates arginine residues on a number of proteins (P53, E2F1, P65) and histones (H4R3, H3R8, H2AR3), which support tumorigenesis. Selectively inhibiting PRMT5 has shown significant anti-tumor activity in preclinical MCL models, and a Phase 1 clinical trial with PRT543 (Prelude), a novel PRMT5 inhibitor, is underway. While exploring pathways that converge with PRMT5 activity as potential avenues for combination treatment, we identified the intrinsic apoptotic pathway as an attractive target in MCL. BCL2 family proteins either promote or inhibit intrinsic apoptosis at the outer mitochondrial membrane through a dynamic set of binding interactions. Prior work has shown PRMT5 inhibition to drive the expression of multiple pro-death BCL2 family gene products (BAX, BAK, and BBC3\/PUMA) in MCL. We hypothesized that combining PRMT5 inhibition with BH3 mimetics, compounds that target pro-survival BCL2 proteins, would induce synergistic cell death in MCL. Selective PRMT5 inhibition with PRT382 inhibits the viability of MCL cell lines with an IC50 below 1uM in eight of nine lines (IC50 44.8nM - 1905.5nM). BH3 mimetics navitoclax (BCL2, BCLXL, and BCLw inhibitor), A852 (BCLXL inhibitor), and AMG176 (MCL1 inhibitor) were found to have IC50s below 1uM in five, two, and four of the nine cell lines respectively. We chose six cell lines to test combination treatment ranging in sensitivity to BH3 mimetics and expression of BCL2 family proteins (CCMCL1, Z-138, UPN1, Granta 519, Mino, and Maver1). Synergistic decreases in viability were tested via MTS assay and analyzed with the Loewe model of synergy. Mino, which showed sensitivity to all three mimetics, exhibited a synergistic reduction in viability with combination PRT382 treatment. Granta 519 and Z-138 exhibited a similar effect with the combination of PRT382 and navitoclax or A852. These observations were confirmed through BH3 profiling, supporting MCL cell line dependence on BCL2, BCLXL, BCLw and MCL1, and increased sensitivity to BCL2 family protein targeting with PRMT5 inhibition. Two patient derived xenograft models were tested <i>ex vivo<\/i> after treatment with 10mg\/kg of the PRMT5 inhibitor PRT382 or vehicle. iBH3 flow-based analysis revealed increased sensitivity of <i>ex vivo <\/i>PDX cells to pan BCL2, BCLXL, and MCL1 inhibition. These results provide rationale for combining BH3 mimetics and PRMT5 inhibition in clinical trials as a novel treatment strategy for MCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/56e55bec-3be3-4354-ba44-c54e35048ea7\/@H03B8ZFa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-02 Apoptosis: Therapeutic manipulation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mantle cell lymphoma,PRMT5,Bcl-2 protein family,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17214"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Claire Hinterschied<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Fiona Brown<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janani Ravikrishnan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JoBeth Helmig-Mason<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kris Vaddi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peggy Scherle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Woyach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Selina Chen-Kiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Elemento<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jihye Paik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Baiocchi<\/i><\/presenter>.

The aim of chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapies, or immunotherapies at this stage is to extend life and diminish suffering. Frequently the extension of life is for a few months, but amelioration of suffering is not always accomplished including side effects of medication. Mifepristone, a progesterone (P) receptor modulator\/antagonist has been given to patients orally (200-300 mg\/day) with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to patients with advanced metastatic lung cancer that had no more treatment options. Several of these cases have been presented at the AACR and showed significant extension of a good quality of life with well tolerated mifepristone therapy (Case 1 - rapidly progressing probable small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with marked hypoxia and marked hyponatremia, AACR 2016; Case 2 - Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis with no tumor markers for targeted therapy, AACR 2017; Case 3 - NSCLC positive for programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), AACR 2018). In case 1 her PO2 and serum sodium normalized within 3 weeks of single agent mifepristone and her lung nodules were no longer detectable. At time of presentation in 2016 she was 3 &#189; years on single agent mifepristone treatment. She died 5 years from treatment at age 85 from a myocardial infarction with no return of her lung cancer and normal serum sodium. Case 2 also received single agent mifepristone and had no new lung or brain lesions (predominantly stable disease), but he stated he felt perfectly normal. After 2 &#189; years his primary lung lesion started growing slowly. He died 5 years later not from extensive lung cancer but from pneumonia complicating his chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). Case 3 had progressed despite standard chemotherapy and nivolumab. With mifepristone her lung and brain metastases showed some regression, but she was enjoying a good quality of life. Her clinical status deteriorated after 1 year not from her cancer but worsening COPD and she died 1 &#189; years after initiating mifepristone therapy. Two female cases (age 56 and 46) that were never presented at AACR were treated with mifepristone when their advanced lung cancer with brain metastases progressed despite the third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib (they were positive for the EGFR mutation). These women had a good quality of life and are still alive after 4 years of treatment. Evidence suggests that mifepristone inhibits cancer by blocking membrane P receptors inhibiting the immunosuppressive protein called the progesterone induced blocking factor. The &#8220;parent&#8221; 90 kDa form helps the tumor to proliferate and invade normal tissue whereas smaller splice variants inhibit cellular immunity.

Extremely rare, but precedented, is the absence of hematologic abnormalities or lymphadenopathy. In some of the rare cases early diagnosis was achieved because hypercalcemia and bone pain were related to ectopic production of parathyroid-related peptide with consequent hypercalcemia and bone pain from hyperparathyroidism. However, there has been a case report in a 37-year-old male with B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia with osteolytic lesions, normal parathyroid hormone levels, and normal hematologic parameters despite &#62;80% of the bone marrow replaced with blast cells. We present another case of a 55-year-old woman presenting with B cell ALL, bone pain and perfectly normal hematologic parameters despite 95% of the marrow replaced with blast cells. Her pain began 2 &#189; months prior to the bone biopsy which was done because of the finding of osteolytic lesions on MRI. Her first bone marrow evaluation was performed 1 &#189; months later. Related to further delays in even getting an appointment with the proper oncologist she was started on mifepristone 200mg daily to hopefully help delay a hematologic ALL crisis in view of 95% blast cells on biopsy. After 1 month of mifepristone therapy her CBC was still perfectly normal before standard chemotherapy was started. Mifepristone was started because of its effectiveness in improving length and quality of life in patients with a variety of advanced cancers without any more treatment options coupled with its beneficial effect in controlled studies with spontaneous leukemia in mice. Furthermore, the target for mifepristone, the immunomodulatory protein known as the progesterone induced blocking factor (PIBF), was found to be highly expressed by multiple human leukemia cell lines and was suppressed by mifepristone. The most common clinical state found in patients with advanced cancers following treatment with mifepristone is to stabilize the disease and inhibit further spread. The possibility exists that the failure to progress to typical pancytopenia after 95% of the bone marrow was replaced by blast cells was related to the mifepristone treatment. However, the possibility also exists that some unknown factor inhibiting this progression was operative as in some other very rare reported cases. With the possibility of a beneficial effect of treatment, mifepristone, an extremely well tolerated oral agent, could be considered for treating ALL when no other reasonable treatment options are available, e.g., a patient not likely to survive standard therapy or failure to respond to traditional chemotherapy. Even in this patient, if it takes more than 1 month to induce remission, her 40% 5-year survival will even be lower so one could consider maintenance therapy with mifepristone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-01 Antireceptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Bone marrow,Progesterone receptor,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17216"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jerome H.

In a previous study (Liu et al, 2020 Br J Cancer), we showed that GLUT3, a major vitamin C transporter in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, was significantly decreased in AML blasts compared with normal hematopoietic cells, which impedes TET2 restoration and promotes leukemia progression. Although GLUT3 could be a potential biomarker to predict the vitamin C treatment efficiency, a remaining question was whether GLUT3 can be a druggable target in AML. In this study, we aim to investigate the therapeutic value of GLUT3 salvage in AML<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> GLUT3 salvage was conducted on GLUT3 deficient AML cell line OCI-AML3 using GLUT3 overexpression lentivirus transduction or AICAR (an AMPK activator, Phase 3) treatment.

Then, 5hmC DNA dot blotting results showed that GLUT3 overexpression further significantly raised the 5hmC level after 250 &#181;M vitamin C treatment. Consistent with augmentation of TET2 function, turning on GLUT3 with vitamin C treatment alleviated leukemic phenotypes compared with empty vector group. Pharmacological GLUT3 salvage using AICAR 0.5 mM 48 hours could achieve the same effect as lentivirus transduction, in terms of GLUT3 expression level, augmentation of TET2 function, and enhancement of vitamin C anti-leukemic effect.

TP53 is mutated in ~70% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Hotspot p53 mutants promote cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and metabolism through their gain-of-function (GOF). Among the p53 &#8220;hotspot&#8221; mutations, R273 is the most frequent mutation position (~12%) with R273H as the most commonly mutated codon (~8%) in PDACs. However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of mutant p53s&#8217; GOF in PDACs remain incompletely understood. In our attempt to address this question, we recently identified the ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP)\/p97 as a novel mutant p53-binding protein by performing immunoprecipitation (IP)-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) analysis. VCP bound to p53-R273H via the DNA-binding domain. VCP inhibition either by genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition by CB-5083 resulted in the increase of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53-R273H. VCP did so by binding to MDM2 and disturbing its interaction with mutant p53. As a result, VCP protected mutant p53 from degradation and enhanced its GOF in cancer development. Ablation of VCP retarded PDAC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our further studies also unveiled the negative regulation of wt p53 by VCP in cancer cells. Together, these results demonstrate that VCP can strengthen mutant p53&#8217;s oncogenic function by stabilizing it and negating wt p53 function, suggesting VCP as a resistant factor for chemotherapy against PDACs and thus a potential therapeutic target of the mutant p53-harboring pancreatic cancers as well as of the wt p53-containing cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7503214-dcf7-4da2-8bbb-d117223ccf7c\/@H03B8ZFa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,VCP,MDM2,gain of function,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17219"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jieqiong Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The protein kinase LKB1 is the 3rd most frequently mutated gene in lung adenocarcinoma, and serves as a master regulator of cell metabolism and growth. LKB1-inactivating mutations have a significant impact on NSCLC development. Although KRAS mutation is most frequently co-mutated with the tumor suppressor p53, the strongest cooperation was seen with homozygous inactivation of LKB1. Loss of LKB1 on a KRAS-mutant (KL) background leads to increased tumor burden, shortened survival time and increased metastasis compared to loss of TP53 (KP). Furthermore, inactivation or loss of LKB1 correlated with poor prognosis, where tumors are typically aggressive and chemoresistant. To discover therapeutic vulnerabilities for this aggressive genetic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma, we evaluated the contribution of multiple single- and double-genetic alterations (KRAS G12D (K), LKB1 knockdown (L), and p53 knockdown (P)) to 3D invasion phenotypes using immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC3-KT) and conducted RNA transcriptome profiling of the invading HBEC3-KT 3D spheroids. We found that bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) is upregulated in invasive KL spheroids only compared to K and KP, suggesting that the loss of both KL drives increased BMP6 expression. Consistent with this finding, the iron regulator hepcidin, which is regulated by BMP6 is also upregulated in KL spheroids. Both BMP-6 and hepcidin expression can be repressed by restoring exogenous LKB1 in KL spheroids suggesting that LKB1 loss is at least in part responsible for the overexpression of the BMP6\/hepcidin pathway. In addition, inhibition of BMP-6 signaling via BMP type I receptor ALK2 using small molecule inhibitor LDN214117 suppressed of cell invasion in 3D culture and decreased tumor growth in a KL syngeneic mouse model. Collectively, our findings show that upregulation of hepcidin via BMP6 signaling and followed by iron sequestration in tumor cells is part of the metastatic invasion strategy of LKB1 inactivated NSCLC. Therefore, current clinical strategies targeting BMP6 signaling could improve outcomes for LKB1-mutant lung cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e647a52-2dad-434c-94b4-d500eaf79ba7\/@H03B8ZFa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,Bone morphogenetic protein 6,Hepcidin,Iron metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17220"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Junghui Koo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chang-Soo Seong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhakti Dwivedi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carol Tucker-Burden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam I.

In fact, emerging evidence suggests RBPs are principal modulators of every hallmark of cancer progression. Functionally, RBPs are believed to modulate the stability, localization, and translation of transcripts encoding for virtually all known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Consequently, aberrant expression of RBPs may contribute to the malignant transformation of cancer cells through enhancing the expression of oncogenes or decreasing the expression of tumors suppressor genes, such as <i>TP53<\/i>. As a potent transcription factor, TP53 is a leading regulator of numerous signaling pathways involved in tumor suppression. While mutation or deletion of <i>TP53<\/i> contributes to tumorigenesis in more than half of all human cancers, suppression of wild-type <i>TP53<\/i> expression also drives tumorigenesis. Thus far, multiple RBPs have been implicated in the repression of wild-type TP53, such as RNA-binding motif protein 38 (RBM38). Specifically, RBM38 interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E) on the <i>TP53<\/i> transcript, preventing EIF4E from binding to <i>TP53<\/i> m<sup>7<\/sup>G cap, thus inhibiting <i>TP53 <\/i>translation. We previously demonstrated that Pep8, an 8 amino acid peptide derived from RBM38, disrupts the RBM38-EIF4E complex enhancing TP53 expression. Moreover, Pep8 alone or in combination with doxorubicin, significantly decreased tumor xenograft growth. As activation of wild-type TP53 by targeting non-genetic mechanisms that inhibit TP53 expression is a promising therapeutic tactic for malignancies that carry wild-type <i>TP53, <\/i>we are developing more efficacious Pep8 derivatives as a novel therapeutic approach for cancers that express wild-type TP53.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ca38fe3-ddb4-4a43-a230-77d7fcf6e163\/@H03B8ZFa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peptides,p53,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17221"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chris August Lucchesi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinbin Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, we have developed a novel combination therapy for PDAC by targeting mutated KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and Gal-1 to target both proliferation and metastasis in PDAC. This includes the delivery of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibiting siRNA (siKRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>) using a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) and a galectin inhibitor.<br \/>Methods: Our patented SPION nano-formulation was used to deliver siKRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and investigated in conjunction with Gal-1 inhibitor for its anticancer efficacy. Particles were investigated for size, physico-chemical characterization (Dynamic light scattering), hemocompatibility (hemolysis assay) and the complexation of siKRAS (gel retardation assay). Cellular internalization and uptake of the particles were investigated. Anti-cancer efficacy was determined using <i>in vitro<\/i> functional assays for cell viability (MTT), migration (Boyden chambers), invasion (Matrigel), clonogenicity, tumor spheroid formation, and in a mouse model.<br \/>Results: Our results demonstrate optimal particle size\/zeta potential of SP-siKRAS formulation. SP-siKRAS efficiently internalized in PDAC cells and suppressed KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> as well as its downstream targets, YAP and PDL-1. Combined targeting of siKRAS and Gal-1 inhibited cell proliferation. It inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion of PDAC cells. This resulted in activation of death related mechanisms, such as Bax, bcl-2, PARP cleavage in KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> cells. Interestingly, the formulation was highly effective in inhibiting KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and growth of tumor spheroid in 3D cell models, which recapitulate the heterogeneity and pathophysiology of PDAC. This further provides a clinical validation demonstrating potential of SP-siKRAS particles to efficiently silence KRAS expression. SP-siKRAS also exhibited hemocompatibility and stability suggesting its potential of silencing KRAS without being toxic to the body. The formulation efficiently exhibited KRas<sup>G12D<\/sup> silencing and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice.<br \/>Conclusion: This gene therapy targeting KRAS G12D mutation with a Gal-1 inhibition has a potential to modulate the oncogenic network and tumor microenvironment resulting in the repression of growth, metastasis, chemoresistance, and improvement in patient survival. This study will develop a novel sustainable therapeutic approach to target PDAC growth and improve patient survivability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Galectin-1,Nanoparticle,siRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17222"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ana I.

Despite the current standard of care, metastatic HER2-enriched breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer remain difficult to treat due to poor response to treatment, lack of actionable targets, or eventual acquired resistance. The high mortality rate of metastatic HER2-enriched breast cancers and triple-negative breast cancers highlights the need for novel actionable targets for improved response to therapeutic intervention. Through datamining of publicly available breast cancer patient datasets, we recently found that Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-STAT3 pathways are co-activated and co-enriched in HER2-enriched breast cancers and triple-negative breast cancers (Cancers 10:2340-2360, 2021). We also found that TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase, directly interacts with and phosphorylates STAT3 on Y705 residue, resulting in STAT3 activation, nuclear translocation, and increased transcription of STAT3 target genes <i>SOX2 <\/i>and <i>c-MYC, <\/i>which are associated with breast cancer stem cell formation as well as tumor recurrence and metastasis. In this study, we aimed to further characterize the effects of the TrkA-JAK2\/STAT3 pathway crosstalk on breast cancer stem cells. Our data showed that overexpression of TrkA enhances mammosphere formation and ALDH activity of breast cancer cells, which are further enhanced upon co-overexpression of STAT3. Our study further revealed that TrkA and JAK2 inhibitors synergize to reduce breast cancer stemness since co-inhibition of TrkA and JAK2 significantly reduces the CD44<sup>high<\/sup>\/CD24<sup>low<\/sup> cell subpopulation, mammosphere formation, and ALDH activity to a greater extent compared to vehicle or monotherapies. Western blot analysis of breast cancer cells treated with TrkA and\/or JAK2 inhibitors showed that co-inhibition of these two kinases significantly reduces levels of p-STAT3 (Y705), as well as stemness markers SOX2, MYC, and CD44. Taken together, these findings suggest that TrkA cooperates with the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway to promote breast cancer stem cells through increasing expression of SOX2, c-MYC, and CD44, and that co-inhibition of TrkA and JAK2 significantly suppressed breast cancer stemness, suggesting its future utility as a promising new treatment modality for patients with HER2-enriched breast cancers and triple-negative breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52586be9-67dc-487b-8c2d-554db4f59ab7\/@q03B8ZFb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,JAK2,TrkA,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17223"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Angelina T.

Given the heterogeneous nature of HNSCC, this carcinoma results in higher resistance to chemoradiotherapy. Recent evidence highlight the importance of the hypoxic microenvironment in contributing to cisplatin resistance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role played by hypoxia-induced protein carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) in supporting HNSCC cisplatin resistance. Furthermore, we purpose to investigate the ability of CA9 inhibitor, SLC-0111, a small molecule already used in Phase I clinical trial, to sensitize HNSSC cells to chemotherapy <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We analyzed the expression of CA9 in a public data set of 103 HNSCC samples and 22 oral cavity normal tissues and in two HNSSC cell lines (FaDu; SCC-011). HNSCC cells grown in 2D and 3D models under hypoxic conditions (1% O<sub>2<\/sub>) showed increased levels of CA9 and greater resistance to cisplatin than cells grown under normoxic conditions. The addition of CA9 inhibitor SLC-0111 to cisplatin sensitized cells to the chemotherapeutic agent and caused a reduction of colony number, spheroid formation, tumor cell, and spheroid migration and invasiveness. Furthermore, the combination therapy hampered activation of STAT3, AKT, ERK, and EMT program whereas it induced apoptosis. Notably, the combined treatment caused inhibition of tumor growth and induction of apoptosis in HNSCC subcutaneous xenografts, as assessed by high-frequency ultrasonography and fluorescent molecular tomography (FMT) with NIR-Annexin V, respectively, at a higher extent than single agents. In addition, FMT with NIR-Prosense revealed a stronger reduction of lymph nodes metastases when mice bearing orthotopic xenografts were treated with cisplatin plus SLC-0111 with respect to a single treatment. Our findings taken together demonstrate the crucial role played by CA9 in promoting cisplatin resistance in HNSCC and the efficacy of SLC-0111 to sensitize tumor cells and xenografts to chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/84d3a02b-72d1-48cf-8f8c-594ba3e2f3cf\/@q03B8ZFb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Hypoxia,Cisplatin resistance,Carbonic anhydrase IX,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17224"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Annachiara Sarnella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ylenia Ferrara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi Auletta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Albanese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincenzo Alterio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Yves Winum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudiu T Supuran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Cerchia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppina De Simone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Antonella Zannetti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

HBI&#8209;2376 is an orally bioavailable selective SHP2 inhibitor that is being developed for the treatment of solid tumors harboring KRAS or EGFR mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Additionally, HBI-2376 has the potential to suppress tumor growth via induction of the activity of immune infiltrating cells in the TME (tumor microenvironment). In a head-to-head comparison, in vitro studies showed greater potency of HBI&#8209;2376 to inhibit cell proliferation in a variety of cancer cell lines compared to other SHP2 inhibitors such as TNO-155 (Novartis AG) and RMC-4550 (Revolution Medicines). Consistently, HBI-2376 found to be more efficacious in tumor growth inhibition than TNO-155 and RMC-4550 in NCI-H1975<sup>L858R_T790M_C797S<\/sup> osimertinib-resistant cell line and other tumor models. In addition to xenograft models, we tested efficacy of HBI-2376 as single agent or in combination with anti-PD1 mAb in MC38 CRC syngeneic model. Consistent with xenograft data, HBI-2376 showed greater efficacy in tumor growth inhibition vs. TNO-155 and RMC-4550 both as single agent and in combination therapy. IHC data showed reduction in infiltration of M2 macrophages (F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>Arg1<sup>+<\/sup>) in the HBI-2376 treated tumors suggesting a MoA for its greater efficacy in MC38 model. Furthermore, Western blotting showed inhibition of p-ERK and DUSP6 in HBI-2376 treated cells indicative of a biomarker of response to the therapy. These findings, along with a positive safety profile led to HBI-2376 IND clearance by FDA and suggested promising responses in NSCLC or CRC patients in the forthcoming clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3dd975a6-664b-479c-a148-5a03053563b0\/@q03B8ZFb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,SHP-2,EGFR TKI resistance,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17225"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Farbod Shojaei<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Farbod Shojaei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jill M.

Aggressive pro-angiogenic signals induced by tumors lead to malformation of vessels characterized by reduced pericyte coverage and low perfusion. As a result of this vascular dysfunction, tumors have elevated hypoxia and high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), yielding an aggressive phenotype, and reducing efficacy and trafficking of intravenous therapies to the tumor core. Anti-angiogenic therapies aim to reduce angiogenic stimuli and normalize tumor vessels. The three type-1-repeat (3TSR) region of thrombospondin-1 contains the majority of its anti-angiogenic properties in a small bioactive peptide. These functions are mediated through the membrane protein, CD36. We have previously shown that administration of native 3TSR leads to improved tumor perfusion, and enhancing delivery of chemotherapy drugs and oncolytic viruses. We have developed a novel compound, Fc3TSR, that has two 3TSR peptides linked with a Fc to increase <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy. In an orthotopic, mouse model of ovarian cancer, we examined the effect of Fc3TSR treatment on tumor IFP using a 1.2Fr pressure catheter guided into the tumor core of anesthetized mice. Compared to untreated controls, mice treated with Fc3TSR had significantly lower IFP, even after considering differences in heart rate among animals. Immunofluorescence on fixed sentinel lymph nodes revealed enhanced presence of immune cells, a positive predictor of lymphatic patency. To determine impact on chemotherapy delivery, mice were injected with 40mCi paclitaxel and tumor uptake of the isotope was measured. At 12, 24 and 48h post injection, Fc3TSR treated tumors had significantly increased uptake of paclitaxel compared to untreated or 3TSR treated mice. <i>In vitro <\/i>cell viability assays and western blot analysis of cleaved-caspase-3 revealed that Fc3TSR enhances direct apoptosis in human ovarian cell lines (OVCAR-2 and 36M2) compared to untreated cells or those treated with native 3TSR at equimolar concentrations. In a human subcutaneous xenograft model using 36M2 cells in SCID mice, Fc3TSR significantly reduced tumor volume as a single agent compared to PBS controls.Fc3TSR causes direct ovarian tumor cell apoptosis <i>in vitro<\/i> and significant anti-tumor effects <i>in vivo<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i>, Fc3TSR causes potent vascular normalization, decreases tumor hypoxia and IFP in the tumor core. As such, Fc3TSR has the potential to remodel multiple aspects of the tumor microenvironment which would otherwise obstruct treatment delivery and efficacy in solid tumors. The multi-modal aspects of Fc3TSR makes this therapeutic approach attractive for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer and other malignancies that typically overcome single-agent therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/baadc8a8-bf71-4ab9-9587-432056c52d2e\/@q03B8ZFb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Vascular normalization,Tumor microenvironment,Interstitial fluid pressure,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17226"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kathy Matuszewska<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madison Pereira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leslie Ogilvie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Duncan Petrik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison Gartung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dipak Panigrahy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kin-Ming Lo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Lawler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Simpson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Petrik<\/i><\/presenter>.

The beneficial properties of CDPs, and miniproteins in general, have driven interest in therapeutic applications. However, CDP diversity is vast from every clade of life, and properly interrogating &#8220;CDP space&#8221; requires specialized screening and modeling tools.<br \/>With this in mind, we have created an optimized mammalian surface display platform to screen for CDPs of clinical interest using libraries of structurally-diverse native scaffolds optimized for stability. These native CDPs can be structurally modeled, which we did in determining the structures of over 4200 native CDPs. This modeling permits further selection <i>in silico<\/i> as well as targeted mutagenesis for favorable target-binding capabilities. Hits from these screens are routinely matured to sub-nM affinity. These CDPs can play numerous roles in a drug design pipeline, from an independent drug candidate to a delivery agent for tissue-targeting to a module in a polyspecific biologic. Recent novel CDP candidates have shown promise in immune-oncology space as part of a bispecific T-cell engager targeting PD-L1, where a single 2-week treatment was capable of eliminating subcutaneous PC3 prostate cancer xenograft tumors in 27\/30 mice.<br \/>Besides bispecifics, future directions for the platform include exploring targeted protein degradation. Additionally, we are expanding upon our previous work on CDPs to explore CNS or tumor delivery of therapeutic cargo. The versatility of CDPs and novel screening tools to rapidly identify and mature candidates of interest can facilitate rapid advancement of CDP therapeutics to address difficult targets in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a01511c-8b2c-4867-a2f4-1accc9c238b9\/@q03B8ZFb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,BiTE antibody,Peptides,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17227"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zachary R.
