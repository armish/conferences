[{"Abstract":"FGFR1 and PD-1 - mediated signals are involved in growth and survival of lung cancer and should be considered as targets for therapeutic approaches. Here, we report the potential efficacy of an anti-FGFR1 humanized antibody OM-RCA-01, either alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. To assess the activity of OM-RCA-01 on FGF-mediated signaling, A549 human adenocarcinoma cells expressing FGFR1 were incubated and dosed with OM-RCA-01. Control cells were left untreated. Six hours after dosing, FGF2 was added at a concentration of 100 ng\/ml. Cell growth was determined using Promega&#8217;s Cell Titer-Glo assay. Thirty-five NCr nu\/nu female mice (10-12 weeks of age) were used for A549 xenotransplantation. Twenty animals with measurable tumors were pair matched and selected on day 7 after tumor inoculation. Intravenous OM-RCA-01 (30 mg\/kg, N=10) or saline (Vehicle, N=10) were administered every 3 days starting on day 7 after tumor inoculation. To evaluate the efficacy of co-inhibition, patient explants (adenocarcinoma with PD-L1 expression &#62;50%, DAKO 22C3) were obtained from surgical lung specimens, and PDX models were generated by implantation of PDX into humanized NSG mice <i>(<\/i>Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, CA, USA) as previously described (Wang, FASEB J., 2018). Treatment with intravenous OM-RCA-01 (30 mg\/kg) with pembrolizumab (10 mg\/kg) or pembrolizumab alone (10 mg\/kg) or saline (vehicle) every 3 days was started when the tumors reached 70 mm3 in volume. Measurements of tumor volume were performed by digital calipers every 3 days during 31 days in xenograft and PDX studies. <i>In vitro<\/i> study showed that FGF2 significantly increased proliferation of the human lung cancer cells (P&#60;0.001). OM-RCA-01 exerted dose-dependent inhibitory effects on FGF-triggered lung cancer cell proliferation in comparison with control (P=0.01). IC50 was 9.69 mcg\/mL. <i>In the xenograft model<\/i>, treatment resulted in median tumor volume of 1,048.5 mm3 and 2,174 mm3 at day 31 in the OM-RCA-01 and vehicle groups, respectively (P&#60;0.0001). All tumors reached the volume endpoint of 2,000 mm3 to day 31 in vehicle group in comparison with study group where maximum size of tumor was 1,309 mm3. <i>In the PDX study<\/i>, the differences between groups were also statistically significant (all P&#60;0.001). Median tumor volume was 97.1 mm3 in the combination group (N=7), 417.1 mm3 in the pembrolizumab only group (N=7), and 863.5 mm3 in the vehicle group (N=7). No group mean body weight losses or clinical manifestations of toxicity were observed in both groups. In conclusion,<b> <\/b>OM-RCA-01 antibody has potent antitumor activity against lung cancer<i> in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our findings also support that the co-inhibition of FGFR1 and immune checkpoints can enhance antitumor activity compared to anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/685d5c35-1288-4926-b5e2-a184cc8560bd\/@u03B8ZFS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR-1),Immune checkpoint,Monoclonal antibodies,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16777"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ilya Tsimafeyeu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Yin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Fanelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitry Khochenkov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evgenia Stepanova<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our group previously demonstrated that 9-ING-41, a small-molecule inhibitor of GSK-3 in clinical development, stimulates both NK and T cell activity. This project characterizes the effects of 9-ING-41 in combination with ICB in vivo. In a syngeneic murine colon carcinoma BALB\/c model using MSS cell line CT-26, we compared isotype, 9-ING-41 (70 mg\/kg 2x\/wk), &#945;PD-1 (10 mg\/kg 2x\/wk), &#945;PD-L1 (10 mg\/kg 2x\/wk), 9-ING-41 + &#945;PD-1, and 9-ING-41 + &#945;PD-L1 treatment groups. The median overall survival was 19 days (d) with 9-ING-41 (hazard ratio for death (HR) 0.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03-0.54; p=0.008), 16 d for 9-ING-41 + isotype (HR 0.40; 95% CI, 0.08-1.9; p=0.14), 20.5 d for &#945;PD-1 (HR 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.67; p=0.0185), 18 d for &#945;PD-L1 (HR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.89; p=0.0559), 17 d for 9-ING-41 + &#945;PD-1 (HR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.09-0.1.5; p=0.29), and 45.5 d for 9-ING-41 + &#945;PD-L1 (HR 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.36; p=0.0019), compared to 16 d for the isotype control group. Tumor response rates observed were 33.3% in the 9-ING-41 + &#945;PD-L1 group, 16.6% in the &#945;PD-1 group, and a 0% for all other treatment groups. We hypothesize that the 9-ING-41-mediated upregulation of PD-L1 in CRC cells (HCT-116, HT-29) observed via both flow cytometry (FC) and western blot analysis may contribute to the increased efficacy of combination therapy with &#945;PD-L1, as compared to &#945;PD-1. Significant differences between responders and non-responders in intratumoral and splenic natural killer (NK) and T cell subsets 14-days post-treatment initiation were shown by multi-color FC. Compared to non-responders, regardless of treatment group, responders had lower percentages of splenic CD4+ (p=0.0145) and CD8+ T cells (p=0.0001), increased percentages of splenic CD69+ activated T cells (p=0.0070) and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (p=0.001), and increased percentages of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ (p=0.0006) and CD4+ T cells (p&#60;0.0001). Responders had lower splenic CD8+\/Treg (p=0.0007) and CD4+\/Treg (p=0.001) ratios and higher intra-tumoral CD8+\/Treg (p=0.0032) and CD4+\/Treg (p=0.0001) ratios. Murine serum cytokine profiling showed that responders had lower concentrations of tumorigenic cytokines (BAFF, CCL7, CCL12, VEGF, VEGFR2, CCL21) and higher concentrations of immunomodulatory cytokines (CCL4, TWEAK, GM-CSF, CCL22, IL-12p70) compared to non-responders. These results demonstrate that small-molecule inhibition of GSK-3 with 9-ING-41 may increase the anti-tumor effects of ICB and improve response in patients with MSS CRC via modulation of anti-tumor immunity and cytokine signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6fba7f41-e6ee-44b6-a6bf-51983eb112b3\/@u03B8ZFS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,T cell,PD-L1,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16778"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kelsey E.

However, primary and acquired resistance to these therapies limits their clinical benefit. Accumulating evidence indicates that chemotherapeutic agents such as Cyclophosphamide (CTX) that can induce anticancer immunity stand out as particularly promising partners for use in combination with ICBs. A combination approach to reorchestrate the anti-tumor immune response could magnify the clinical benefit of ICBs. CTX is an alkylating chemotherapeutic which is directly tumoricidal that can also modulate immune cells. CTX is known to preferentially deplete certain T cell subsets (such as T regulatory cells, T regs) and lead to homeostatic proliferation of antigen-specific T cells in addition to the modulation of myeloid cells. Here, we hypothesized that the addition of ICBs will augment the immunomodulatory changes induced by CTX including but not limited to the homeostatic proliferation of T cells which will reset the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire to favor tumor antigen-specific T cells. The murine melanoma tumor model, B16-F10, is known to be refractory to treatment with ICBs, particularly anti-PD-1, as these only modestly slow the growth of small tumors. Here, we show that a single dose of CTX one day prior to starting an ICB (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) regimen slows tumor progression of B16-F10 compared to CTX or ICB alone. Similarly, the triple combination (CTX+ anti- PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4) also significantly prolongs the survival of tumor bearing mice. Further, the combination of CTX with anti- PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 increased the number of activated and proliferating CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). This increase in cytotoxic T cells was accompanied by a decrease in Tregs, which further augments the tumor control. Additionally, we also observed a significant increase in a highly cytolytic population of CD4+ CD8+ double positive TILs. The depletion of CD8+ cells but not CD4+ cells abrogates the therapeutic effect of the triple combination suggesting that the anti-tumor effect is CD8+ T cell dependent. Overall, our results suggest that the combination of CTX with the ICBs, anti- PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, is a potent combinatorial approach that can prime an anti-tumor response and promote robust control of tumor growth. Thus, these findings form the basis for further investigations in understanding the mechanisms of combinatorial cancer therapies in tumor models that are refractory to ICB therapies and can inform the design of future therapeutic interventions that combine ICB with chemotherapy.<br \/>Note: M.M.G, A.B.W, and L.H contributed equally to this work","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b906d619-2e6b-46be-bbf1-7110ef0d8abb\/@u03B8ZFS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Chemotherapy,Antitumor activity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16779"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mariam M.

Understanding their mechanism of action in human tumors is key to developing STING-based therapies and combinations. Higher tumor STING expression correlates with better response to treatment and multiple cancers have been shown to silence STING and the downstream interferon response to avoid immune detection, demonstrating an important role for tumor cell STING in antitumor immunity. Recent mouse studies have explored the complex interplay of STING activation in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), identifying unexpected T-cell toxicity and novel effector mechanisms including NK cells. Yet how STING agonists impact the human TIME has not been carefully examined and could inform development of novel therapeutic combinations. Here we address this question using human tumors cultured <i>ex vivo<\/i> to maintain the TIME, dissecting STING agonist response in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an inflamed cancer with high STING expression.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed STING immunohistochemistry on 300 thoracic tumor specimens, followed by functional <i>ex vivo<\/i> studies of STING agonist response in human mesothelioma explants, measuring cell death and cytokine production. Dynamic single cell RNA sequencing was performed after treatment with a STING agonist. Primary human T-cells and NK cells were used to study STING agonist toxicity in the context of STING cycling and patient derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) were treated for six days with STING agonists +\/- NK and anti-mesothelin chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cell therapies.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Amongst thoracic cancers, MPM robustly expressed tumor cell STING and was responsive to STING agonist treatment <i>ex vivo<\/i>. We observed tumor cell death &#62;20%, p&#60;0.05 in 12\/35 MPM PDOTS after STING agonist treatment. Cell death was prevented by CD8 neutralizing antibody co-treatment. Dynamic single-cell RNA sequencing of MPM explants treated with a STING agonist unveiled CXCR3 chemokine activation primarily in tumor cells and cancer associated fibroblasts, coupled with an interferon stimulated gene program. However, STING agonism was also toxic to T-cells. In contrast, primary NK cells manifested rapid STING turnover and resisted STING agonist-induced toxicity. STING agonists enhanced NK and especially anti-mesothelin CAR-NK cell migration and killing, improving therapeutic activity in MPM PDOTS.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> MPM, an inflamed cancer type with marginal response to immune checkpoint blockade, demonstrated high tumor cell STING expression and response to STING agonists in combination with NK cell therapies <i>ex vivo<\/i>. These studies reveal the fundamental importance of using human tumor samples to assess innate and cellular immune therapies, identifying STING agonism as an effective strategy to prime NK cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/05044e4c-3b6a-4718-b70a-15f39e900ba0\/@u03B8ZFS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cancer immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16780"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Erik H.

More recent studies revealed that another half-life-extended form of IL-10 (IL10-Fc) can rejuvenate terminally-exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells to boost anti-tumor activity. We investigated whether combination of a PDL-1-blocking antibody with a C-terminal IL-10 fusion may enhance anti-tumor immunity, and possibly achieve synergistic effects.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Recombinant proteins were produced using an expiCHO system (Thermo Fisher). PDL-1 blocking activity was evaluated by ELISA, PD-1\/PDL-1 signaling (Eurofins) and mixed lymphocyte reaction assays. IL-10 activity was evaluated by MC\/9 cell proliferation and CD8 T cell activation and effector assays. Mouse CT26 colon cancer and EMT6 breast cancer studies employed the services of Oneness Biotech and Crown Bioscience, respectively.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> To develop a bifunctional anti-PDL-1 antibody\/IL-10 fusion protein, anti-human PDL-1 antibodies were first developed by screening an in-house human variable domain phage display library. Three different antibodies were then C-terminally-fused with human IL-10 polypeptide. All three showed high binding affinity to PDL-1 and blocked PD-1 signaling through PD-1\/PDL-1 interaction in a dose-dependent manner. In CD4 T cell\/dendritic cell co-cultures, the lead anti-PDL1\/IL10 protein enhanced IL-2 and IFN&#947; production, and it enhanced IFN&#947; and granzyme B production from activated CD8 T cells as well as proliferation of MC\/9 cells in an IL-10-dependent manner. Also, a mouse &#8216;surrogate&#8217; version (BF11, using avelumab anti-PDL-1) showed superior efficacy compared to either IL10-Fc or anti-PDL1\/TGFbR in a mouse CT26 colon tumor model, and correlated with increased serum levels of CXCL9 and IL-18. BF11 also allowed greater EMT6 tumor control than anti-PDL-1 alone or anti-PDL1\/TGFbR fusion protein. Such BF11-treated mice also showed long-lasting immunity against a secondary EMT6 tumor challenge. This ability of BF11 to enhance tumor control was in part dependent on increased activity of tumor-resident cells as co-treatment with FTY720, which inhibits lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs, did not appear to reduce anti-tumor activity of BF11 in some, albeit not all, EMT6-tumor-bearing mice.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Anti-PDL1\/IL10 fusion protein not only targets PDL-1 for checkpoint blockade but also activates the IL-10 pathway to boost T cell response, presumably including revitalization of exhausted T cells as recently reported. Effective anti-tumor activities of a mouse surrogate fusion protein, BF11, are demonstrated in CT26 and EMT6 tumor models. Taken together, our findings support this dual mechanism-strategy to potentiate anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/230c8ce6-1176-409a-91ee-0824b0db3a7f\/@u03B8ZFS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-10,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunotherapy,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16781"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Huey-Wen Hsiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Lun Hsiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Pandelakis Koni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hung-Kai Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, investigating neoantigens beyond those from somatic mutations can expand the repertoire of immunotherapy targets. Recent studies detected alternative-splicing (AS) events in various cancer types that could potentially translate into tumor-specific proteins. Our study investigates AS within glioma to identify novel MHC-I-presented neoantigen targets through an integrative transcriptomic and proteomic computational pipeline, complemented by an extensive spatiotemporal analysis of the AS candidates.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> Bulk RNA-seq of high tumor purity TCGA-GBM\/LGG (<i>n<\/i>=429) were analyzed through a novel systematic pipeline, and tumor-specific splicing junctions (neojunctions) were identified <i>in silico<\/i> by cross-referencing with bulk RNA-seq of GTEx normal tissue (<i>n<\/i>=9,166). Two HLA-binding prediction algorithms were subsequently incorporated to predict peptide sequences with high likelihood for HLA-presentation. Investigation of the tumor-wide clonality and temporal stability of the candidates was performed on extensive RNA-seq data from our spatially mapped intratumoral samples and longitudinally collected tumor tissue RNA-seq. Proteomic validation was conducted through mass-spec analysis of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)-GBM repository (<i>n<\/i>=99).<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Our analysis of TCGA-GBM\/LGG bulk RNA-seq identified 249 putative neojunctions that translate into 222 cancer-specific peptide sequences which confer 21,489 tumor-specific n-mers (8-11 amino acids in length). Both prediction algorithms concurrently identified 271 n-mers likely to bind and be presented by HLA*A0101, HLA*A0201, HLA*A0301, HLA*A1101, or HLA*A2402. We confirmed the expression of 15 out of 58 HLA*A0201-binding candidates in RNA-seq of two HLA*A0201<sup>+<\/sup> patient-derived glioma cell lines with a subset of candidates found tumor-wide. Analysis of CPTAC-GBM mass-spec data detected 23 tumor-specific peptides with 5 containing detected n-mers highly predicted to be HLA-presented.<b><br \/>CONCLUSION:<\/b> Tumor-specific neojunctions identified in our unique integrative pipeline present novel candidate immunotherapy targets for gliomas and offer a new avenue in neoantigen discovery across cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c35491e4-caf4-4502-85a3-4fe748c7b2a8\/@u03B8ZFS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Glioblastoma,Neoantigens,Alternative splicing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16782"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Darwin Kwok<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahide Nejo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aidan Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie Colton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Woo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Costello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideho Okada<\/i><\/presenter>.

Some cancers that naturally arise in pet dogs share critical features with human disease including tumor heterogeneity (immune infiltration, mutational burden, metastatic progression) and patient characteristics (outbred population, immunocompetence, age, microbiome). Investigating novel immunotherapies alongside radiation, chemotherapy, or surgical treatment of spontaneous canine cancers meaningfully informs their clinical translation.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We have developed interleukin -2 and -12 cytokine fusion proteins that bind and anchor to collagen after intratumoral administration and have shown their superior activity and tolerability in murine tumor models (Momin 2019). Here in pet dogs, we test these cytokines for safety and efficacy in two cancer types. Soft tissue sarcomas (n=10) were treated with intratumoral IL-2 and -12 using different dose schedules prior to surgical resection with subsequent tumor tissues assessed by histology for immune infiltrates and by Nanostring for whole tumor transcriptomics. Oral malignant melanomas (n=10) were treated with 9 Gy radiation at day 0, and on day 1 treated with intratumoral injection of the cytokines Q2W for 6 total doses, with dose escalation performed in cohorts of 3. Plasma was collected for PK\/PD analysis of drug and IFN-g post-injection, with serial CBC\/chemistry profiles and CT scans for assessment of safety and radiologic response, respectively.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Intratumoral dosing of collagen binding cytokines was well tolerated by 19\/20 dogs, with transient body temperature elevation observed 24-72 hours post-injection and 1 episode of grade 3 transaminase elevation. Magnitude of fever did not correlate with peak serum IFN-g or cytokine dose level. At the lowest dose level (17 ug\/kg IL-2, 40 ug\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IL-12), 1\/3 pet dogs with oral melanomas achieved CR by RECIST criteria, and 3\/3 pet dogs achieved near CR at the 2x dose level. Transcriptomic analysis of treated sarcomas revealed enrichment for antigen processing and T cell function two days after treatment. Moreover, IDO1 was upregulated in treated tumors, which suggests its systemic inhibitors combined with the locally-delivered cytokines may potentiate stronger responses.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This data supports the safety and efficacy of intratumorally delivered IL-2 and IL-12 collagen binding cytokines and the ability to combine with standard-of-care resection or radiation therapy. We are continuing to enroll dogs to evaluate safety and efficacy at higher dose levels, including response at metastatic sites. Canine cancers bridge the gap between murine and human disease, accelerating the build-test-learn design cycle for novel immunotherapies and treatment combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cee9f9dc-f98e-4818-a14f-8caa80811fb9\/@u03B8ZFS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Radiation therapy,Collagen,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16784"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jordan Stinson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison Sheen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Hampel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noor Momin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Bernstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Kamerer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy M.

Previous work has shown that in mice, NT-I7 dramatically increases tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells while reducing the frequency of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in the tumor. There is also significant expansion of Central Memory (CM)-phenotype CD8+ T cells (CD62L+CD44+) in the tumor and tumor draining lymph node. Here, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of NT-I7 in combination with two different T cell suppressor blockades; anti-TIGIT (YH29143) and anti-VEGF (Aflibercept) in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. NT-I7 was administered by intramuscular injection with the first dose of either YH29143 or Aflibercept. YH29143 or Aflibercept was administered every 3 days for 3 total doses, via intraperitoneal or intravenous route, respectively. The combination of NT-I7 with either T cell suppressor blockade enhanced the anti-tumor response. Surprisingly, NT-I7 combined with YH29143 increased the frequency of PD-1+TCF-1+TOX-CD39- stem-like CD8+ T cells in the draining lymph node. The combination also dramatically increased the frequency of CD62L-CD44+ effector memory CD8+ T cells in the tumor. Surprisingly, NT-I7 combined with YH29143 increased the frequency of PD-1+TCF-1+TOX-CD39- stem-like CD8+ T cells in the draining lymph node. In addition, Aflibercept reduced the expression of TOX in PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in the tumor.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-mediated anti-tumor response depends on T cell capability of recognizing and killing tumor cells. &#8216;Hot&#8217; tumors, which are characterized by the T cell infiltration, show a better response rate to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment. In contrast, &#8216;Cold&#8217; tumors have a particularly low objective response rate (ORR) to ICB. In consideration of the durable and impressive responses observed in &#8216;hot&#8217; tumors, it will be valuable to make an endeavor to turn immunologically cold tumors into hot tumors. The RNA-binding protein HuR is a member of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) family that is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and promotes tumorigenesis by interacting with a subset of oncogenic mRNAs. In this study, we show the direct binding of HuR protein to PD-L1 mRNA in multiple types of cells by Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RNP-IP) and further validated by RNA pulldown assay. We also show that PD-L1 mRNA decay is greatly expedited in HuR-knockout cells, which underlines the stabilization function of HuR on PD-L1 transcripts. Immunoblotting results demonstrate that PD-L1 protein expression level is decreased in HuR-knockout cells while up-regulated in HuR-proficient cells in comparison with control. These data together clarify HuR is engaged in PD-L1 post-transcription regulation. Based on this mechanism, we develop a combination strategy using HuR inhibitors and anti-PD1 antibodies to overcome the limitation by regulating the tumor immune microenvironment. KH-200 is a compound that disrupts the transportation of HuR from nuclear to cytoplasm. To test the combination strategy <i>in vivo<\/i>, we established the EMT6 syngeneic breast cancer model. After 4-week treatment, the combination group shows great effects in inhibiting<br \/>tumor growth and prolonging survival. A similar combination effect was further observed in Lewis lung syngeneic lung cancer model. In conclusion, we preliminarily explored the role of HuR in tumor immune evasion. The method using HuR inhibitors as a combination in immunotherapy shows effectiveness in immunologically cold tumor treatment and may have reference significance for clinical cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17546051-f415-4129-a697-7ecd628f62b4\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,RNA binding protein ,HuR,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16786"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qi Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Zhe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoqing Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lan Lan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lanjing Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Xu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Allogenic NK cells have also demonstrated a good safety profile in clinical trials. These promising features have led to increasing efforts to advance NK-based immunotherapies in recent years. However, efficacy of NK therapy remains limited. Strategies to augment NK efficacy are therefore much needed. To augment the efficacy of adoptive NK cells, most current studies revolve around two focal points: optimizing the source of NK cells and improving their functionality and persistence in vivo. In the current study, we took a different approach by studying how to make cancer cells more vulnerable to NK-mediated killing. It remains unclear to what extent mitochondrial apoptosis is required for NK-mediated killing. We found that primary human NK cells robustly induce mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, mitochondrial apoptosis is essential for efficient NK killing, especially at physiologically relevant low E:T ratios (Effector:Target ratios). It is traditionally believed that cytotoxic cell-cancer cell contacts are binary live\/death events. We found that NK engagement is often sub-lethal and push cancer cells towards apoptotic threshold (i.e. priming cancer cells for apoptosis), making them more susceptible for killing by subsequent NK contacts. Upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins has been widely implicated in cancer resistance to chemo- and targeted therapies. We found that overexpression of these proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 reduced mitochondrial priming for apoptosis and made cancer cells less susceptible to NK killing.<b> <\/b>We reasoned that additional agents that increase cancer cell mitochondrial priming for apoptosis (e.g., BH3 mimetics) might augment NK-induced killing, as long as NK cells can tolerate these agents.<b><\/b><b> <\/b>While primary resting NK cells are sensitive to BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 inhibitors, unexpectedly, pre-activation with IL-2 conferred resistance of NK cells to these inhibitors.<b> <\/b>NK cells and BH3 mimetics synergized in both priming and killing cancer cells in vitro. BH3 profiling could also predict the ideal BH3 mimetics to be combined with NK cells for different tumor models. Using liquid and solid tumor xenograft models, we demonstrated that BH3 mimetics synergized with NK cells in suppressing tumor growth and prolonging mouse survival.<b><\/b> In summary, we propose a rational strategy to sensitize cancer cells to NK cellular therapy. Moreover, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the apoptotic signaling that is the scientific basis for this strategy. Our results could potentially enable basic, pre-clinical, and clinical studies investigating the combined effects of BH3 mimetics with NK cells in cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fee3e975-f8ed-492e-a5ed-d29586bbb95b\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Mitochondria,Immunotherapy,Bcl-2 protein family,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16787"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rongqing Aaron Pan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Ryan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deng Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Wucherpfennig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Letai<\/i><\/presenter>.

CH5126766 (CKI27) binds the allosteric site of MEK to inhibit its kinase activity but is novel due to its interaction with MEK S218 and 228, which blocks their phosphorylation by RAF. CKI27 bound MEK binds to RAF and cannot be released by phosphorylation, thus becoming a dominant negative inhibitor of RAF activation. This prevents the induction of MEK phosphorylation observed with other MEKis. Although this results in more potent tumor control, CKI27 is also capable of inhibiting T cell function because the MAPK\/ERK pathway is activated downstream of T cell receptor signaling. We aim to balance the positive and negative immunomodulatory effects of MEKis for optimal combination with immunotherapy. We observed that CKI27 increased MHC expression on tumor cells and improved T cell mediated killing. Yet, CKI27 also decreased T cell proliferation, activation, and cytolytic activity. Intermittent administration of CKI27 allowed T cells to recover and partially relieved these inhibitory effects. Further combination with agonist antibodies anti-OX40 and GITR completely alleviated T cell inhibition and increased combination efficacy with immune checkpoint blockade antibody anti-CTLA-4. We also observed an increase in proliferation and T cell activation markers in LLC tumor bearing mice treated with the combination of CKI27, anti-GITR, and anti-CTLA-4. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of combining CKI27 with immunotherapy will elucidate the mechanism behind this increased efficacy. This will allow us to make more informed decisions in dosing regimens, overcoming resistance, and generating long-term immune responses in future clinical trials treating patients with <i>RAS<\/i> mutant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c46232b3-90f2-4aa4-b939-aa01988b69e8\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,MEK inhibitor,Combination therapy,Ras,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16788"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lauren Dong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyejin Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadna Budhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabell Schulze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svena Verma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nezar Mehanna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neal Rosen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taha Merghoub<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jedd Wolchok<\/i><\/presenter>.

Symptomatic BrM patients have a less than 20% 1-year survival rate. The poor clinical outcome is due to lack of effective treatment for BrM as even immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) only showed effects in 55% asymptomatic BrM in melanoma patients. Novel effective combination therapies are urgently needed to address metastasis in the unique brain immune microenvironment (BrIME). Interestingly, our RNA-seq data of patients treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of tumors of various mouse models showed that BrM express significantly lower major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) and higher histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 compares to extracranial tumors or metastasis. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been reported to upregulate MHC-I in extracranial tumors. In this study, we tested whether HDACi, Panobinostat, can upregulate MHC-I expression in BrM and whether Panobinostat combined with ICI (e.g., anti-PD1) treatment in mouse models can impede BrM development. Clearly, our data showed that HDACi Panobinostat significantly increased MHC-I expression in brain-seeking human breast cancer cells (MDA-231, MDA-435) and mouse mammary tumor cells (4T1, EO771) with or without IFN-&#947; treatment. We then tested Panobinostat penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for treating BrM in vivo. C57BL\/6 mice were treated with either 10 or 20mpk (i.p.) Panobinostat for three consecutive days. Mass spectrum analysis shows that Panobinostat can be detected in the brain at level of 10<sup>-8<\/sup>M after the treatment. We found that Panobinostat treatment increased both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell in the brain by FACS analysis. To test therapeutic efficacy of HDACi and ICI combination therapy in BrM, we induced BrM in C57BL\/6 mice by intracarotid artery (ICA) injection of E0771-Luc.GFP tumor cells, then mice were divided to four groups and were treated with i) vehicle, ii) Panobinostat, iii) anti-PD1 and iv) Panobinostat +anti-PD1. We found that combination of Panobinostat with anti-PD1 more effectively inhibited BrM tumor outgrowth compares to either monotherapy and the vehicle control. Furthermore, Immunohistochemistry staining revealed upregulated MHC-I in BrM tumor cells and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration by Panobinostat treatment. In summary, our data indicated that HDACi Panobinostat can increase ICI efficacy in BrM by upregulating MHC-I for enhanced antigen presentation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b61e6615-7b05-48aa-86e7-1e87c3daea8e\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Immune checkpoint blockade,Brain metastasis,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16789"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shao-Ping Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yimin Duan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangliang Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason T.

Combination ICI therapies could overcome immune resistance but are associated with higher rates of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). To elucidate the underlying irAE immunobiology, we profiled human intestinal tissue, enterocolitis (irEC), and tumor tissue from ICI-treated patients using NanoString PanCancer Immune Panel (NanoPCIP) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC); hypotheses generated from these translational results for potential irAE treatments were tested in parallel preclinical mouse model studies. In 23 patients identified with both normal intestinal and irEC tissue, we found genes encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6), Th17 differentiating cytokine, and neutrophil and monocyte chemotactic molecules were the highest significantly upregulated in irEC compared to patient-matched normal intestine. Using NanoPCIP cell scoring (23 patients) and mIHC (27 patients), Th17 cells were significantly higher in irEC than Th1 cells. T-cell subsets were similar between anti-CTLA-4 based regimen versus anti-PD-1monotherapy induced irEC, except Th17 memory cells were significantly higher CTLA-4i-induced irEC. We compared the degree of differential gene expression in irEC (normal intestine versus irEC) to the differential expression in tumors (baseline versus on-treatment tumors). The genes highest upregulated in irEC (including Th17 differentiating cytokines IL-6 and IL-1B) were not upregulated in responding tumors from patients receiving ICI. NanoPCIP Th17 cell score was significantly more upregulated than Th1 cells and neutrophils more upregulated than CD8 T cells in the irEC analysis, but not in the responding tumor analysis where IL-12 and CD8 cell score was significantly upregualted . Based on these discoveries, we used C57BL\/6 and Balb\/c mouse strains to address whether the antitumor effect of ICIs can be enhanced by IL-6 blockade while also improving irAEs. We found that IL-6 blockade + ICI was associated with improved tumor control and a higher density of CD4\/CD8 effector T-cells, with reduced Th17, macrophages, and MDSCs compared to ICI alone. Furthermore, in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model, the pathogenesis of which is well documented to be Th17 mediated (Robinson et al., 2014), we demonstrated that combined IL-6 blockade and ICI enhanced tumor rejection while simultaneously mitigating EAE symptoms versus ICI alone. Based on the totality of the basic science, translational, and clinical data we hypothesize that IL-6 blockade combined with ICIs could de-couple autoimmunity from antitumor immunity. We are currently conducting a prospective phase 2 trials of combination ipilimumab (3mg\/kg) + Nivolumab (1mg\/kg) + Tocilizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma, EGFR mutant NSCLC, and urothelial carcinoma ( NCT04940299).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8bbcbc81-75f3-4935-a4c9-642265a05542\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-6,Toxicity,Immune checkpoint blockade,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16790"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel H.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of PAK4 inhibition on anti-tumor immune response in preclinical prostate cancer models. C57BL\/6J mice (male, 5-8 weeks old) were injected with wild type (WT) or PAK4 knockdown (KD) syngeneic Rm1 tumor cells (2X10<sup>5<\/sup> cell\/mouse) and treated with or without &#945;PD1 blockade (200&#956;g, BioXCell). Tumor growth was monitored and analyzed using ANOVA of repeated measures (n=6). In a separate experiment, 1 cm RM1 tumors were collected for RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RNASeq data were normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation (VST) function as implemented within the DESeq2 package. IHC images were captured with Keyence BZ-X800 and positive staining was calculated using ImageJ. CD8<sup>+<\/sup> lymphocytes depletion was achieved by CD8 antibody injection (200ug, BioXCell). PAK4 inhibitors PF-3758309 (PF) and KPT-9274 (KPT) were evaluated in murine models. PAK4 KD tumors treated with &#945;PD1 antibody (&#945;PD1) showed a significant reduction of tumor growth when compared to growth in WT (P&#60;.05), WT &#945;PD1 (P&#60;.01), and KD (p&#60;.05). Analysis of bulk tumor RNAseq showed that the combination of PAK4 KD with &#945;PD1 was associated with increased CD8a, IFN&#947;, and PD-L1 expression. IHC with &#945;CD8 verified that PAK4 KD increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cell infiltration in mouse tumors. Further, RNAseq showed that PAK4 KD increased the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and genes related to the IFN&#947; response. These results suggest that PAK4 KD primes the tumor for immune infiltration and improves &#945;PD1 treatment response. The anti-tumor effect of PAK4 KD with &#945;PD1 in mice was CD8-dependent and could be eliminated by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cell depletion (p&#60;.05). We tested two different PAK4 inhibitors in mice with WT Rm1 tumors. PF is a kinase inhibitor that blocks the function of PAK4. A combination of PF and &#945;PD1 significantly reduced tumor growth when compared to WT (P&#60;.05), WT &#945;PD1 (P&#60;.01), and PF (p&#60;.05). KPT is a dual inhibitor of PAK4 and NAMPT, which reduces the cytosolic protein concentration of PAK4. A combination of KPT and &#945;PD1 significantly reduced tumor growth when compared to WT (P&#60;.01) and WT &#945;PD1 (P&#60;.01). In conclusion, PAK4 inhibition increased immune infiltration and improved &#945;PD1 treatment response in preclinical mouse prostate cancer models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7de4d56b-61fc-45d9-b05d-dbbd719fff9c\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,PD-1,Inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16791"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shengchen Su<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sungyong You<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanping Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Tamukong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine S.

However, the majority of patients ultimately experience disease relapse or progression indicating resistance to rituximab therapy. IGM-2323 is an engineered high-affinity, high-avidity anti-CD20 pentameric IgM antibody with an anti-CD3 scFv fused to the joining chain. IGM-2323 offers a novel treatment strategy in NHL through two mechanisms: 1) the recruitment of T cells to kill CD20-expressing tumor cells through T cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) and, 2) complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). We evaluated the activity of IGM-2323 in the presence of rituximab since rituximab can persist in patients after treatment discontinuation, and it can bind to an overlapping epitope on CD20 as IGM-2323. We hypothesized that the high valency of IGM-2323 could displace rituximab, thus enabling potent B cell killing by IGM-2323 even in the presence of high concentrations of rituximab. The affinity of IGM-2323 and its corresponding bivalent anti-CD20 IgG antibody to recombinant human CD20 protein were measured by surface plasmon resonance. IGM-2323 bound to human CD20 with an apparent 300-fold higher binding affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub>) and ~100-fold slower off-rate (k<sub>dis<\/sub>) than the bivalent anti-CD20 IgG. Human B cell lines with a range of CD20 expression levels, including a CD20-low rituximab-resistant Ramos cell variant, were pre-treated with escalating concentrations of rituximab, and subsequently evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> for cell binding, TDCC, and CDC by IGM-2323. At high concentrations of rituximab, which correspond to reported peak serum concentrations (C<sub>max<\/sub>) found in rituximab-treated patients, IGM-2323 displaced the binding of rituximab on human B cell lines. In contrast, binding of a bispecific CD20xCD3 IgG was severely inhibited by the C<sub>max<\/sub> of rituximab. In TDCC assays with healthy donor effector T cells, pre-treatment with high concentrations of rituximab only modestly inhibited IGM-2323 activity. Furthermore, only a minor impact to the maximum killing activity (E<sub>max) <\/sub>of IGM-2323 was observed at the C<sub>max <\/sub>of rituximab. In contrast, rituximab pre-treatment resulted in a distinctly lower E<sub>max<\/sub> of a bispecific CD20xCD3 IgG. Live cell imaging of CDC kinetics was utilized to quantify the extent of CDC by IGM-2323 with or without rituximab. Pre-treatment with rituximab enhanced CDC of IGM-2323 compared to single agent activity. Our preclinical data indicate that IGM-2323 maintains activity in the presence of rituximab. IGM-2323 is currently being studied in a phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed\/refractory NHL, where it has been generally well tolerated, with both complete and partial responses observed (NCT04082936). Clinical studies will continue to evaluate these findings, including the treatment of patients with circulating serum levels of rituximab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a545d3a-a20c-4dc4-9a86-81554fba749a\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,CD20,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16792"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kevin C.

Inhibition of CDK4\/6 pathway - altered in &#62;50% of brain metastatic patients - can reportedly increase tumor inflammation and sensitize extracranial tumors to ICI. To determine whether intracranial tumors can be similarly sensitized, we studied efficacy of combination CDK4\/6 inhibitor Abemaciclib and ICI in immunocompetent mouse models of brain metastasis bearing concurrent intracranial and extracranial murine tumors that are ICI-resistant. 8-week-old female C57BL\/6 mice received subcutaneous injections of 2x10<sup>5<\/sup> YUMM1.7 or B16-F10 melanoma cells 3 days prior to intracranial injections of 1x10<sup>4<\/sup> YUMM1.7-FmC (firefly luciferase-tagged) cells or 5x10<sup>3<\/sup> B16-F10 cells respectively. 8-week-old female BALB\/C mice similarly received 2x10<sup>5<\/sup> 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells in mammary fat pad 3 days prior to intracranial injections with 2x10<sup>4<\/sup> 4T1-FmC cells. Mice were randomized into 4 treatment groups (n=5-7\/group): Abemaciclib monotherapy (administered daily), anti-PD-1 monotherapy (every 3 days), Abemaciclib and anti-PD-1 (combination therapy), and treatment with vehicle and isotype-matched antibody as control. In all 3 tumor models, extracranial tumor growth was significantly reduced compared to control mice following combination therapy (P&#60;0.05 for all), while Abemaciclib monotherapy only reduced growth of subcutaneous YUMM1.7 tumors (P&#60;0.05). Intracranial tumor growth, calculated using bioluminescence imaging early-in-treatment and post-treatment, was significantly reduced compared to control-treated tumors following combination therapy in both YUMM1.7-FmC and 4T1-FmC models (P&#60;0.05 for both). In mice bearing B16-F10 tumors, where overall survival was used as an indirect measure of intracranial tumor growth, combination therapy improved survival (p&#60;0.05) compared to both control and Abemaciclib monotherapy arms. These results indicate CDK4\/6 inhibition with Abemaciclib can improve both extracranial and intracranial responses to ICI and sensitize brain metastases to immunotherapy. Our pre-clinical findings warrant further investigation to determine whether this combination approach can improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e328d6a-c66d-4b67-b72c-01d2cfdded1d\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Immune checkpoint blockade,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16794"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Naema Nayyar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohini Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Magali De Sauvage<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nazanin Ijad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashish Dahal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jane Chuprin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Brehm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priscilla Brastianos<\/i><\/presenter>.

Clinical studies indicate combining i.t. immunotherapy with systemic immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances durable complete response rates (CRR) in treated and distal untreated tumors (abscopal effect), although the number of i.t. therapies tested in this setting remains is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and characterize the immunotherapeutic activity of VAX014, a novel clinical-stage bacterial minicell-based oncolytic agent, following i.t. delivery in two syngeneic murine solid tumor models. The nonimmunogenic B16F10 melanoma and immunogenic MB49 urothelial carcinoma models were used to establish single agent activity of VAX014 in mice bearing a single intradermal (i.d.) tumor, followed by an evaluation of synergy between VAX014 and ICB combinations (CTLA-4 &#177; PD-1) in mice bearing dual bilateral i.d. B16F10 tumors where only one tumor is treated with VAX014.Weekly i.t. treatment with VAX014 led to significant CD8+ T cell mediated antitumor activity in single i.d. tumor models. A significant reduction in tumor growth rate was observed in all mice (<i>p<\/i>&#60; 0.0001, 38\/38 for B16F10; <i>p<\/i>&#60; 0.0001, 12\/12 for MB49) which ultimately resulted in a durable CRR in 58.0% and 100% in the B16F10 and MB49 models, respectively. B16F10 tumors actively responding to i.t. treatment with VAX014 had a significant increase in CD8+ T cells (<i>p<\/i>= 0.0004) with a concomitant decrease in CD11b+ myeloid cells (<i>p<\/i>= 0.039) even after a single i.t. dose of VAX014. VAX014-mediated antitumor activity was specific to the treated tumor type as determined by cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay against the treated tumor cell line versus haplotype matched control target cells (<i>p<\/i>= 0.0015). Using a bilateral variation of each model, VAX014 exhibited a significant abscopal effect in the immunogenic MB49 model (22.0% CRR and &#8595; tumor growth rate in untreated tumors, <i>p<\/i>= 0.009), an effect that was less pronounced in the nonimmunogenic B16F10 model. Addition of systemic CTLA-4 ICB significantly enhanced abscopal activity in the bilateral B16F10 model whereas PD-1 ICB did not. Remarkably, tripartite combination of VAX014 with CTLA-4\/PD-1 ICB resulted in a significant reduction in treated (<i>p<\/i>&#60; 0.0001) and distal untreated B16F10 tumors (<i>p<\/i>&#60; 0.0012) as well as an enhanced survival advantage versus CTLA-4\/PD-1 ICB combination (<i>p<\/i>= 0.03). Survival was associated with an improved CRR of both tumors (50.0% vs. 20.0%).In conclusion, these preclinical data provide scientific rationale and set the foundation for i.t. treatment with VAX014 in patients with injectable tumors refractory to standard treatment options and may be particularly effective when combined with systemic ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/18295e27-f9bf-465c-8b55-15d95477488e\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic,Immunotherapy,Combination therapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16795"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shingo Tsuji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine A.

Using a combination of in vitro metabolic profiling with the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer and in vivo tumor immunotherapy in the immunocompetent TRAMP-C2 prostate adenocarcinoma model, we determined the differential impact of multiple OxPhos inhibitors on both tumor immune metabolic fitness and functional capacity. Impact on the tumor immune microenvironment of TRAMP-C2 tumors was assessed through high parameter flow cytometry on a BD X-30. While OxPhos inhibition compromised initial T cell activation, we found that two of the inhibitors increased the glucose uptake, proliferation, and activation status of effector T cells. In contrast, the same two inhibitors decreased the mitochondrial fitness, proliferation and OxPhos metabolic capacity of TRAMP-C2 tumor cells themselves. To determine whether this selective inhibition of tumor versus T cell metabolic function could improve immunotherapy responses in vivo, we implanted TRAMP-C2 tumors and treated them with these OxPhos inhibitors with or without concomitant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The combination of ICB and OxPhos inhibition achieved highly significant and durable rates of tumor control and regression suggesting that these approaches are potentially synergistic. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment has identified the cellular mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects which may provide useful biomarkers as this novel combination is translated to the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0cc09b3-9f8c-40c9-a1ba-5d4b2d8a733d\/@v03B8ZFT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Oxidative stress,T cell,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16798"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Krithikaa Rajkumar Bhanu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priyamvada Jayaprakash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meghan Rice<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brittany Morrow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph R.

In clinical trials, glioma treatment with oncolytic viruses induced durable clinical responses in a small fraction of patients. To improve the percentage of responders, it is necessary to reshape the tumor microenvironment that shields the tumor from the immune system of the patient. Thus, we engineered Delta-24-RGDOX (DNX-2440), an oncolytic adenovirus that carries the cDNA of the T-cell activator, OX40L. In this work, we observed that Delta-24-RGDOX triggered a dramatic reshaping of the tumor microenvironment dominated by strong changes in immune processes as indicated by RNA-sequencing via ingenuity pathway analyses in a murine glioblastoma model. Paradoxically, network analyses revealed that Delta-24-RGDOX also induced robust activation of the cytokine-driven immunosuppressive IDO-Kynurenine-AhR circuitry, indicating a potential mechanism of resistance of the cancer cells to oncolytic virotherapy. To reverse this immunosuppression, we combined Delta-24-RGDOX with clinically relevant IDO inhibitors to treat glioma bearing mice. Importantly, addition of the IDO inhibitor to Delta-24-RGDOX decreased the activation of the IDO network. IDO inhibition did not affect virus infection or replication in human or murine glioma cells. Flow cytometry assays revealed that the combination therapy increased the frequency of activated CD8+ T cells and decreased the presence of the immunosuppressive cell populations, MDSCs and Tregs. Gene set enrichment analyses confirmed the decrease of MDSCs and Tregs in the combination treated glioma-bearing mice compared to the virus alone. Functional co-culture studies showed that the combined therapy activated splenocytes against tumor antigens, and that this activation was reversed by kynurenine. Importantly, the combination treatment eradicated the tumors in a CD4-dependent manner and significantly prolonged the survival of glioma-bearing mice. Altogether, these studies indicate that the combination treatment promotes an adaptive immune response while decreasing immunosuppression caused by virus-induced IDO activation. Furthermore, our data identified the striking role of immunosuppressive pathways in the resistance of gliomas to oncolytic virotherapy. Specifically, the activity of the tumor microenvironment IDO circuitry was responsible, at least partially, for the remodeling of local immunosuppression after tumor infection. Combining molecular and immune-related therapies may improve outcomes in human gliomas treated with virotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fadd218d-4af5-40da-b725-507437f0d721\/@w03B8ZFU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Oncolytic virus,IDO1,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16799"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Teresa T.

NEO-201 is a novel monoclonal antibody that binds a glycosylated variant of these CEACAMs that is upregulated in cancer compared to normal uterine or ovarian epithelia. Previous work has shown that NEO-201 induced cancer cell death predominantly by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) that can be enhanced by the addition of IL-15.<br \/>Methods: NEO-201 target expression was assessed on uterine and ovarian cancer cell lines, as well as a tissue microarray of primary uterine cancer samples.

We have previously demonstrated that reciprocally activated RAS\/RAF\/MEK\/ERK and JAK\/STAT3 pathways mediate therapeutic resistance, while combined MEK and STAT3 inhibition (MEKi+STAT3i) overcomes this resistance in preclinical PDAC models. Given the dramatic decrease in tumor burden observed following MEKi+STAT3i, we investigated its effect on the stromal and immune microenvironment.<br \/>Methods: <i>Ptf1a<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup>Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>Tgfbr2<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> (PKT) mice were<i> <\/i>treated with vehicle, trametinib (MEKi, 3.3 mg\/Kg, oral gavage three times weekly), ruxolitinib (STAT3i, 20 mg\/Kg, oral gavage three times weekly), &#945;PD-1 antibody (200 &#181;g\/mouse, i.p. injection twice weekly), combined MEKi+STAT3i or MEKi+STAT3i with &#945;PD-1 beginning at 4-4.5 weeks of age. Mice were sacrificed after four weeks of treatment and tumors were harvested for single cell RNA sequencing, and high-dimensional immune-profiling by mass cytometry and flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that combined MEKi+STAT3i not only altered stromal architecture but also reprogramed tumor-resident CAFs from <i>Il6\/Cxcl1<\/i>-expressing inflammatory phenotype towards <i>Ly6a\/Cd34<\/i>-expressing fibroblast phenotype with both mesenchymal and hematopoietic progenitor-like properties. This stromal plasticity was associated with a striking attenuation and reprogramming of F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages, M2-like macrophages (F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>CD206<sup>+<\/sup>), and MDSCs (CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>F4\/80<sup>-<\/sup>Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>\/Ly6C<sup>+<\/sup>), as well as enhanced trafficking of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells which exhibited a distinct effector and anti-apoptotic transcriptional program. The addition of MEKi+STAT3i to PD-1 blockade overcomes immune checkpoint resistance by significantly augmenting anti-tumor responses and dramatically improving survival in PKT mice, compared with vehicle treatment (median 181 vs. 44 days, p&#60;0.0001) or anti-PD-1 monotherapy (median 181 vs. 57 days, p=0.0005). The addition of MEKi+STAT3i to PD-1 blockade not only augmented the recruitment of activated and memory T-cell populations, but also improved their degranulating capacity and functional cytotoxicity compared to PD-1 blockade alone. Importantly, treatment of a patient with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic PDAC with MEKi (Trametinib), STAT3i (Ruxolitinib), and PD-1 inhibitor (Nivolumab) was well-tolerated and yielded significant clinical benefit.<br \/>Conclusion: These data uncover a novel paradigm in which combined MEKi+STAT3i reprograms stromal inflammation and immune tolerance to overcome immunotherapy resistance in PDAC. The clinical efficacy of combined MEKi+STAT3i and anti-PD1 treatment provides encouraging signals for its translatability and is currently being pursued in a clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae02a38c-9930-4e13-845b-e6e28099f16d\/@w03B8ZFU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16803"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vanessa Tonin Garrido<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jashodeep Datta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xizi Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Bianchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iago De Castro Silva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Purushottam Lamichhane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siddharth Mehra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samara P.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) induces tumor rejection primarily via cytolytic CD8+ T cells, but many patients have primary or acquired resistance to CD8+ T cell immunity. Reduced major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) expression is a contributing factor to resistance, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is historically treatment-refractory due to, among other features, low MHC expression and a dearth of T cells in the tumor. Interrogating interventions in the context of the PDAC tumor microenvironment will reveal novel mechanisms regulating sensitivity to immune-mediated destruction. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC, we previously reported that combination immunotherapy (agonistic anti-CD40 and dual ICB, anti-PD-1\/CTLA-4) induced both a CD8+ and a CD4+ T cell response sufficient to mediate tumor rejection and long-lived protection. Here, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the dominant MHC I (H-2K<sup>b<\/sup> allele) expression in PDAC cell lines, precluding direct antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells via this molecule. Subcutaneous injection of MHC I-deficient tumor clones into wild-type mice revealed normal tumor growth at baseline, and significantly delayed tumor growth kinetics in response to combination immunotherapy (CD40\/ICB) in a CD4+ T cell-dependent manner (p &#60; 0.0001 vs. vehicle-treated mice). These findings were observed in parental PDAC clones lacking H-2K<sup>b<\/sup> expression, as well as in an ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing PDAC clone. CD4+ T cells mediated tumor rejection including in OVA-tolerized mice, excluding the role of tumor-neoantigens as a major determinant of response. There was no direct contribution of tumor rejection by CD8+ T cells, despite the generation of an activated, tumor-specific CD8+ T cell response in the tumor site (24.5% vs. 1.98% in vehicle-treated mice, p &#60; 0.003). CD4+ T cells upregulated IFN-&#947; production (52.3% vs. 11.9% in vehicle-treated mice, p &#60; 0.0001), and host IFN-&#947; and IFN-&#947; receptor expression were required for response. No changes were observed in the expression of cytotoxic molecules (Granzyme A or B) by CD4+ T cells after CD40\/ICB, and perforin was not required for tumor rejection. Furthermore, depletion of macrophage and myeloid cells or genetic knockout of inducible nitric oxide synthase did not dampen CD4+ T cell immunity against established PDAC tumors. Thus, CD4+ T cells mediated PDAC tumor rejection via non-canonical mechanisms, excluding cytotoxic molecules and re-direction of anti-tumor macrophage effector functions after treatment with anti-CD40\/ICB. This study provides critical insight into novel mechanisms of tumor clearance beyond direct CD8+ T cell:tumor cell interactions, and opportunities to exploit CD4 T+ cells as regulators of tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/baf8c76a-f5dc-44bb-a740-e03332b8cb8a\/@w03B8ZFU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CD40,Pancreatic cancer,CD4 T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16804"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Samuel I.

However, widespread use of cytokine therapy in the clinic is limited by its short half-life in circulation and the associated toxicities that emerge as a result of high systemic exposure. To overcome these limitations, we developed a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform, called cytokine factories, composed of genetically engineered epithelial cells encapsulated in biocompatible polymers. These cells are able to produce a wide range of natural cytokines (IL2, IL7, IL10, or IL12) and allow for controlled and predictable dosing <i>in vivo<\/i>. In vivo administration of cytokine factories created a high local cytokine concentration (IP space) without substantial leakage into the systemic circulation. Local, or tumor adjacent, administration of pro-inflammatory (IL-2-based) cytokine factories caused reduction of tumor burden by 70% after only 1 week of treatment when delivered as a monotherapy to mice with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Importantly, when administered in combination with local anti-PD1 injections, these cytokine factories lead to eradication of these highly aggressive tumors in 7\/7 treated mice. To validate the translatability of this platform, we evaluated the safety profile in non-human primates. Significantly, this platform produced local and systemic T cell biomarker profiles that predict efficacy without renal, liver, or general toxicity in non-human primates. Our findings demonstrate the safety and efficacy of cytokine factories in preclinical animal models and provide rationale for future clinical testing for the treatment of metastatic peritoneal cancers in humans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19f600cd-5882-43c1-9b24-5c7421825c46\/@w03B8ZFU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelioma,Cytokines,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16805"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda Nash<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samira Aghlara-Fotovat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Hernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bertha Castillo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aarthi Pugazenthi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Rios<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofia Ghani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ira Joshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Douglas Isa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunyu Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Sheth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiyi Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Oberholzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Jazaeri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hee-Jin Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Burt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun-Sung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi Ghanta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omid Veiseh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Simultaneous targeting of multiple tumor antigens with a single therapeutic modality offers the potential to treat heterogeneous tumor populations, prevent antigen escape, and induce durable clinical remission. Here, we demonstrate the application of a unique dual-CAR approach simultaneously targeting two tumor associated antigens (TAA) for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) using an off-the-shelf induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived NK cell platform. The iPSC background has been functionally enhanced and can be combined with therapeutic antibodies. A CAR targeting B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a well-defined TAA in MM, was designed utilizing a previously published high-affinity binding sequence shown to exhibit high selectivity to BCMA with enhanced recognition of low-BCMA expressing myeloma cells (Bluhm <i>et al.<\/i>, Molec Ther 2018). This CAR was combined with a companion CAR targeting the pan-TAAs, MICA and MICB. The CAR binding sequence targets the conserved &#945;3 domain of MICA\/MICB, which we have previously shown to inhibit MICA\/B shedding by blocking the putative cleavage site (Andrade <i>et al.<\/i>, Science 2018). The designed anti-MICA\/B-&#945;3 CAR exhibits selective targeting potential against a broad range of tumor types. To determine the suitability of co-targeting BCMA and MICA\/B in MM, we surveyed surface expression of BCMA and MICA\/B on a variety of MM cancer cell lines and observed a complimentary pattern of co-expression compatible with a dual-CAR to broaden the targeting approach of malignant plasma cells. In a reductionist approach, dual CAR-iNK cells exhibited antigen-specific activation, degranulation and cytotoxicity against a Nalm6 target line constitutively expressing the BCMA and MICA\/B. Similar trends were observed in a series of long-term cytotoxicity assays against several MM lines, consistent with antibody staining on target cells, illustrating that co-targeting of MICA\/B and BCMA expands the breadth of coverage against MM. Known modulators of antigen expression were tested for their ability to provide further depth of response, and therapeutic antibodies such as anti-CD38 were tested in combination to exploit the non-cleavable CD16 and CD38KO edits in the iPSC backbone. These combinations were further tested <i>in vivo<\/i> against a disseminated model of multiple myeloma where BCMA\/MICA dual CAR-iNK cells demonstrated superior tumor control relative to single-CAR controls, and TGI was augmented with the addition of Daratumamab. These data highlight the applicability of a multi-targeted approach in MM patients, whereby MM dual-CAR NK and\/or T cells maintain responsiveness to malignant cells that shed or downregulate tumor antigens to evade treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a9c7461b-cf1d-4519-b5b9-e2e54eabf78d\/@w03B8ZFU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Natural killer cells,Stem cells,CAR T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16806"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ketan Mathavan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>John Reiser<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sajid Mahmood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yijia Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Hancock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Blum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen-I Yeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Houk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Wei Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bobby Goulding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jode Goodridge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Bjordahl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bahram Valamehr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uta Hoepken<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Armin Rehm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Wucherpfennig<\/i><\/presenter>.
