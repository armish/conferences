Statistical approaches are employed to estimate how a collection of significant risk loci can collectively affect the risk for a specific type of cancer. Recently, there has been particular emphasis on capitalizing on the immense value of accruing greater diversity of participants in GWAS studies. PRS hold the promise of translational utility but only after adequate validation, the latter is a critical second step towards clinical testing of the instrument. There are major challenges to determining the optimal use of PRS to reduce the burden of a cancer, particularly by identifying individuals in which a measurable reduction in risk could be achieved by changes in modifiable risk factors. PRS also hold promise for use in risk stratification, especially when an effective screening modality could be employed more intensively in the very high-risk group.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen J.
