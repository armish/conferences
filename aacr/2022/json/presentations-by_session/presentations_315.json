[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Bexmarilimab is a novel macrophage re-programming agent targeting CLEVER-1 on tumor associated macrophages. CLEVER-1 is a highly immunosuppressive macrophage scavenger receptor. Inhibition of CLEVER-1 has been shown remove T cell exhaustion, induce clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD8 cells, and improve their infiltration into the tumor. Recently in a first-in-human Phase I\/II study named MATINS (NCT03733990) bexmarilimab was reported to have a survival benefit in 30% of patients with advanced gastric cancer, cutaneous melanoma and cholangiocarcinoma as a single agent (ESMO 2021).<br \/>Methods &#38; Aims: As a part of the mode of action of bexmarilimab, it is known to induce TNFa and IFNg responses, especially when IFNg levels are low. Using ROC analysis we aimed to test the performance of baseline cytokine serum IFNg and TNFa levels to identify patients that experienced a survival benefit from bexmarilimab compared to patients that did not benefit from bexmarilimab.<br \/>Results: 30 patients, 10 per each tumor type, were treated with bexmarilimab at 1mg\/kg Q3W. Mean age 59 years (SD, 9 years), 73% male, with an average of 3 previous lines of therapy, median survival not yet reached. At baseline, patients that saw a clinical benefit (CBR) from bexmarilimab had average serum IFNg levels of 5.11 pg\/ml (SD, +\/- 4.99 pg\/ml) compared to 13.07 pg\/ml (SD, +\/- 13.26) in patients that did not respond to the treatment. Similarly serum TNFa levels 0.96 pg\/ml (SD, +\/- 0.74 pg\/ml) in patients that benefited from bexmarilimab compared to 2.37 pg\/ml (SD, +\/- 1.43 pg\/ml) in patients that did not respond to the treatment. Log transformed values were used for ROC analyses. Used together IFNg and TNFa performed well to identify patients that are responsive to bexmarilimab (AUC 0.83, P &#60; 0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: Bexmarilimab works well in patients with low IFNg and TNFa levels, which is opposite to what is usually seen with checkpoint inhibitors and other T cell activating agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a888960f-a298-4150-9bd6-6e1e92ef153e\/@w03B8ZBy\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,TNF-&#945;,Cancer immunotherapy,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12692"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jussi Koivunen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juho Jalkanen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mari Björkman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jami Mandelin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petri Bono<\/i><\/presenter>.

New biomarker candidates have emerged as an important prognostic and predictive factor and genetic profile approach has been used in the choice of targeted therapies and in the prediction of drug response. The aim of this study was performed a comprehensive genomic profile and intestinal microbiota characterization in peruvian CRC patients to define biomarkers for decision making.<br \/>Methods: Patients with CRC diagnosed in 2019 and treated at INEN were included. Tumor samples were collected to assessed the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Bar virus (EBV) by qPCR, microsatellite instability (MSI) by IHC and somatic genomic alterations by next generation sequencing (NGS) using Ampliseq FOCUS panel (Illumina). Fecal samples were self-collected to performed V3-V4 region 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomics sequencing (Illumina).<br \/>Results: The study included 40 CRC patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 56 (28-90) years, 59.2% were men. Clinical stages were distributed, in I-II (16.5%), III (37.5%), IV (27.5%). The remaining 12.5% had an unknown tumor stage at diagnosis. The 62.5% of patients underwent tumor surgical treatment. Most tumors (85%) were adenocarcinoma NOS and moderately differentiated (65%). Tumor location was rectum (RC; 27.5%), right side colon (RCC; 42.5%) and left side colon (LCC; 30%). Chemotherapy was administered in 30%. The median follow-up period was 11.1 months (2-28). MSI was high (20%), low (10%) and stable (70%). HPV and EBV DNA was detected in 42.5% and 82.5% of CRC patients respectively. The prevalence of genomic alterations was 77.5%. <i>KRAS <\/i>alterations were found in 47.5% patients. <i>BRAF<\/i> (5%), <i>NRAS<\/i> (2.5%), <i>PIK3CA <\/i>(12.5%), <i>APC <\/i>(2.5%), and <i>AKT1 <\/i>(2.5%). All <i>PIK3CA and BRAF <\/i>variants were found in RCC. No variants were found in the<i> NTRK<\/i> or <i>HER2<\/i> amplifications. Patients with <i>BRAF <\/i>variant had a median survival rate only 5 months (3-7). MSI-high\/low was present only in colon, showing dominance on the RCC (66.7%). <i>Verrucomicrobia, Staphylococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium <\/i>were present in both RCC and LCC. <i>Clostridium and Peptostreptococcus <\/i>were highly enriched in the LCC. <i>Campylobacter <\/i>and <i>Spirochaeta <\/i>were found only in the LCC.

Immunotherapy with various check point inhibitors has been shown to have antitumor activity in HCC. The combination of Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab resulted in better overall survival and progression-free survival outcome than sorafenib and is now approved for first line for the treatment of HCC. Other PD-1 inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been shown to have antitumor activity with an overall response rate 20-30% as second line agents. The important question is whether one can find biomarkers which could predict response.<br \/>Methods: Plasma biomarkers were measured by ELISA before and during treatment with pembrolizumab for advanced unresectable HCC patients. MiR RNA was carried out by Ocean Ridge Biosciences. Circulating MDSC (CD14+ CD33+ HLA-DR (low) Treg CD4+ CD25+NK cells and exhausted CD8 re-invigoration (Ki 67 in PD-1 + CD8+) were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: Serum IL-1&#946;, Il-6, IL-12, IL18, IFN-&#947;, IL-10, CXCL9, CCL4, CCl5, and circulating PD-L1 were not predictive of response. However, baseline serum TGF-&#946; is one of the predictors for lack of response. Using a cutoff point of 200 pg \/ml, TGF-&#946; is also a predictor for progression free survival (P=0.008) and overall survival (p=0.005). In addition, several candidate miRNA were detected higher in responders compared to non-responders. Among them, three miRNAs:1) HsamiR-145b-3p which functions to suppress CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th2\/Th17, a tumor suppressor targeting oncogene (i.e. DNMT3 b), 2 ) Has-miR93-5p which targets IL-8 , VEGF, diminishing CXCL12 and PD-L1 expression and 3) Has-miR-23b-3b which regulates inflammatory factors (including IL-6, TNF alpha VCAM-1) are consistently higher in the responders compared to non-responders. Among immune cells analyzed, only MDSC (CD14+ CD33+ HLA-DR low) was a good predictor for responders. The responders had a lower MDSC (4.2) and non-responders had high (56.2, p=0.047). Using a cutoff point of 25, MDSC was also a predictor for overall survival (p= 0.026). Both circulating Treg and exhausted CD8 re -invigoration exhibited no differences between responders and non-responders. (12.8 vs 6.2 for Treg and 18.7 vs 25.7 for PD1+ CD8+.T cell re-invigoration, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: Serum TGF-&#946;, MDSC, and miR -145b-3p, miR94-5p, miR -23b-3p are possible circulating biomarkers which one can use to design future clinical trials. In addition, combination therapy with TGF-&#946; inhibitor and checkpoint inhibitor is possible to improve response and survival in these HCC patients, and should be evaluated in a prospective clinical trial.

A novel bio-physics based multi (pan)-cancer test technology named Cancer Differentiation Analysis Technology (CDA) has been developed and investigated for evaluating and monitoring lung cancer therapeutic responses.<br \/>Methods: A total of 686 patients diagnosed with different sub-types of lung cancer were included in this study. CDA levels were concurrently measured in peripheral blood obtained from 686 patients during the treatment. According to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 standard, the efficacy of 686 patients after treatment was evaluated, and the diagnostic efficacy of CDA technology was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Clinical pathological parameters of the patients are listed in Table 1. The higher the CDA value, the worse the curative effect. CDA value of lung cancer in CR (complete response) group was significantly lower than that in other 3 groups (p&#60;0.05). CDA value of adenocarcinoma lung cancer in CR group were significantly lower than that in SD (stable disease) group (p&#60;0.05). For non - metastatic lung cancer, CDA value in CR group was significantly lower than that in SD group (p&#60;0.05) The receiver ROC analysis showed that the area under curve (AUC) of lung cancer group, NSCLC group, adenocarcinoma lung cancer group, were 0.756, 0.772, and 0.792, respectively. The AUC of early lung cancer group, and non - metastatic lung cancer group were 0.794, and 0.851.<br \/>Conclusions: CDA appears to have the ability to predict and monitor therapeutic responses to lung cancer surgery and chemotherapy treatments. In most cases, the CDA of CR patients is low, and there is a good correlation between CDA and curative effect in early lung cancer. CDA could be a potential candidate for evaluating lung cancer, especially for early stage lung cancer therapeutic response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12696"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Junjie Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zixiu Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuedong Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xing Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lan Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Initial treatment guidelines were developed from probability-based assessments of the likelihood of groups of patients to respond to a compound. Biomarkers such as HER2 further added to the strength of therapy direction. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) facilitated the use of gene mutations to direct patients to targeted chemotherapies. The one thing in common for each of these methods is a lack of functional assessment of each patient&#8217;s own tumor cells when in direct contact with the therapy being considered. Advanced live cell preservation methods combined with innovative cell culture techniques have facilitated a new paradigm for guiding therapy decisions. 3D Predict&#8482; uses 3D cell culture to place each patient&#8217;s own tumor cells into direct contact with a panel of potential therapies. Individual response dynamics to each therapy are assessed thereby producing a patient-specific therapeutic response prediction. 95% of samples are successfully assayed with both response and non-response predictions being useful in therapy guidance, and data is returned within 7 business days of a patient&#8217;s surgical resection providing results within an actionable window. This platform has been analytically validated for use in high-grade gliomas (HGG) and ovarian cancer, it has been clinically validated in both HGG and ovarian cancer, and it is commercially available for use in HGG. 3D Predict&#8482; Glioma, when judged against clinical outcomes, is 85% accurate in the prediction of response to temozolomide for newly diagnosed patients and has been shown to more than double the progression-free survival of relapsed patients in the clinical study 3D-PREDICT (NCT03561207). When the ovarian assay is judged against clinical outcomes, it is 89% accurate in the prediction of response to carboplatin\/paclitaxel for newly diagnosed patients. Here we present the continued growth of the 3D Predict&#8482; pipeline, including validation in rare cancers, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer and the adaptation of the platform for the use of single core biopsies. Utilization of the 3D Predict&#8482; platform can help patients with tumor types that have little to no guidance metrics for treatment decisions, improve the accuracy of biomarker-based direction, and increase the precision of NGS-based response predictions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3f7806cb-19a0-4dd0-af90-fd3299000698\/@x03B8ZBz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Precision medicine,3D cell culture,Ex vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12698"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Melissa Rayner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Miles<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Burgess<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor Brooks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley K.

Unlike in hormone positive breast cancers, coding transcriptomic signatures like Lehmann&#8217;s failed to predict which TNBC patients will benefit from perioperative chemotherapy. Here, we analyzed the total transcriptome of a unique cohort of 44 TNBC tumors before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), including both patients that were chemosensitive (N=26) and chemoresistant (N=18) to following treatment. Differential gene expression analysis (DE-seq) was first performed on annotated genes and de novo Scallop RNA-profiled transcripts. Nearly half of detected differential transcripts were from non-coding genes that were mostly long non-coding (lnc)RNAs (90%). More than half differential lncRNAs were not annotated in gencode. Next, De-kupl, a new reference-free analysis of differential fragments of transcripts, was applied. This approach is based on 31-nucleotide long k-mers that are later merged into contigs without annotation bias. These differential contigs were able to separate correctly, in an unsupervised manner, all TNBC patients regarding their response to chemotherapy, outperforming our previous DE-seq analysis of gencode and scallop transcripts. Strikingly, 80% of the DE-kupl differential contigs were not derived from DE-seq differential genes. Furthermore, as BRCA 1\/2 mutated TNBCs are now well known for their chemosensitivity, we excluded them from subsequent analysis and repeated the differential expression analysis. Our results showed that DE-kupl differential contigs once more perfectly classified all patients and outperformed the whole length transcripts from DE-seq. Finally, we applied the LASSO regression analysis machine learning method, on both all misregulated genes and all misregulated contigs in parallel, to generate minimal signatures characterizing pre-chemotherapy TNBC tumors that are going to be chemoresistant. We obtained an 8-contig-signature that overpassed the 11-gene-signature in the accuracy to discriminate chemosensitive and chemoresistant TNBC patients before chemotherapy. These results suggest that a contig based unreferenced differential analysis of TNBCs regarding their response status to NAC provides promising predictive biomarkers of early TNBC chemoresistance and thus need further confirmation in a larger and independent validation cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/846621cb-1804-430e-a26e-a064795fe40b\/@x03B8ZBz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Predictive biomarkers,Unreferenced,Total transcriptome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12699"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nouritza Torossian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominika Foretek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Gabriel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda Larbi Cherif<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlotte Lecerf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maud Kamal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Le Tourneau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Gautheret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergio Roman-Roman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonin Morillon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Though we know mutations in the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) gene are commonly observed with dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway in patients with DT, the molecular mechanisms driving DT growth remain poorly understood. There is currently no standard systemic treatment for DT. The multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, has been identified as a potential front-line agent for DT after a recent clinical trial demonstrated an objective response in one third of patients. The mechanism for how sorafenib inhibits DT progression is still unclear, so it is unknown which characteristics predict response to the drug. Our work has identified the early growth response-1 (EGR1) gene as a downstream target of sorafenib.<br \/>Methods: Nine DT cell lines have previously been brought into culture with stable passage. These cell lines were treated with sorafenib at 10 &#956;M. RNA was collected from parental and treated cells and subsequent RNA sequencing was performed. Differential gene expression was performed using R. Appropriate comparisons for multiplicity were performed. Western blots were performed to confirm changes in expression of key genes at the protein level. EGR1 overexpression vector was introduced to the 2 DT cell lines and further treated with sorafenib. Additional banked patient desmoid tumor samples were sequenced to assess EGR1 levels and correlation with the CTNNB1.<br \/>Results: We first evaluated the effect of sorafenib on CTNNB1 in the DT models. Western blot demonstrated no changes in protein levels of CTNNB1 in the 4 cell lines tested at 72 hours post-treatment. This was further confirmed on RNA-sequencing. To identify additional gene targets of sorafenib, additional differential gene expression analysis was performed resulting in 13 altered genes at an adjusted p &#60; 0.01. The most significantly altered gene, both by p-value and by fold change, was the EGR1 mRNA transcript. EGR1 transcript levels were significantly attenuated by sorafenib treatment (logFC = 2.720, adjusted p-value &#60;&#60; 0.0001). Western blot analysis confirmed this decrease. EGR1-high DT cell line models exhibited faster growth rates and also higher sensitivity to sorafenib. Fifteen additional patient desmoid tumor samples confirmed the steady state of CTNNB1 and high variability of the EGR1 transcript. There was no correlation between the EGR1 and CTNNB1 transcript.<br \/>Conclusion: This study found that sorafenib does not directly modulate CTNNB1, but does decrease EGR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein level. This suggests that EGR1 expression may be associated with aggressive DT and may also predict responsiveness to treatment with sorafenib. Confirmatory EGR1 modulation experiments are underway and will be provided at time of presentation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/328d0157-122b-4b60-8e5e-c8287eec726e\/@x03B8ZBz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Sorafenib,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12705"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Max Devine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joy Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colin Stets<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Hays<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>James L.

The NGS-based clonality\/SHM testing demonstrated superior performance over the conventional capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods in characterization of B-cell neoplasms. However, its broad utilization in clinical diagnostics requires extensive validation of assays as well as standardization of data interpretation. We present here an NGS assay designed and validated specifically for IG clonality\/SHM characterization of B-cell malignancies. The assay was designed to simultaneously target the Leader, FR1, FR2, and FR3 regions of the IGH gene to identify clonal IGH V<sub>H<\/sub>-J<sub>H<\/sub> rearrangement as well as the IGK gene to identify clonal IGK V<sub>K<\/sub>-J<sub>K<\/sub>, V<sub>K<\/sub>-K<sub>de<\/sub>, and INTR-K<sub>de<\/sub> rearrangement. The validation was performed to assess assay accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, and reproducibility, with both pre-characterized reference controls and prospectively collected clinic peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate specimen included. Triplicates were included and testing was performed at different times and by different operators to assess the assay precision. Over 60 clinic peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate specimens were collected, including patients with B-cell malignancies such as CLL, B-ALL, and DLBCL as well as heathy donors, processed within 7 days for DNA extraction, and assessed by the NGS assay for IGH clonality and SHM assessment. Assay sensitivity as low as 2.5% for baseline clonality and as low as 0.001% for tracking MRD were observed. Near-perfect assay specificity and precision were observed at these sensitivity levels. The validated NGS assay was further qualified by ERIC (the European Research Initiative on CLL) with a certificate granted to standardize the data interpretation of this assay for testing in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In conclusion, a NGS IG clonality\/SHM assay was analytically and clinically validated under medical oversight, with a demonstrated rigor of the test by its high sensitivity\/specificity and robust reproducibility. The clinical diagnostic testing results with this assay is interpreted in accordance with ERIC standards for reliable clinical reporting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/81d19e21-a20d-4ab6-b17f-ce3b3abf4458\/@y03B8ZBA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,B cells,Cancer marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12706"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xin-Xing Tan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tricia Peters<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meredith Berry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristyn Jeter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brigitte Lovell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Venegas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanglong Mou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brad Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Funari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josette William<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, too few patients respond, and there are no diagnostic tools that predict IO response with high accuracy. Moreover, as more IO drugs and combinations are approved, selecting the best IO-based regimen for each patient will become more complex. To facilitate this selection, we are developing an ex vivo live tumor fragment (LTF) screening platform that retains representation of a patient&#8217;s tumor microenvironment (TME) including immune cells, enabling development of deep neural networks to predict IO response and thereby individualize therapy. Here we present preliminary data from our proof-of-concept platform that performs tissue fragmentation\/sorting, liquid handling, drug treatment, high-resolution dynamic imaging, and multiplex immuno-assays. Human tumor excisions were obtained from the Univ. of Wisconsin (IRB approved), and CT26 tumors were grown in mice subcutaneously. Live tumors were cut into 300 x 300 &#181;m fragments of 100 - 300 &#181;m thickness, sorted into multi-well plates, and cultured for 48 or 72 h in the presence or absence of anti-PD1 (nivolumab or mouse equivalent), anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab or mouse equivalent), or concanavalin A (ConA) as a positive control. Cell viability was measured by ATP luminescence assay or flow cytometry. Motility of CD8+ cells was tracked in human LTF using camelid VHH anti-hCD8a-AF594 and 3D multiphoton microscopy for 30 min. Supernatant cytokines were measured using bead immunoassay and T cell markers by flow cytometry. T cells were retained within LTFs, and the proportion of lymphocytes in LTFs was independent of fragment thickness (1.6%\/2.1% for 300 &#181;m, 1.4%\/2.3% for 200 &#181;m and 1.4%\/2.8% for 100 &#181;m thickness, for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively). Total cell viability and T cell viability exceeded 80% at 48h, and 3D LTF structure remained intact for at least 48 h. We treated LTFs with anti-PD1, anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4, or ConA and confirmed the presence of IFN-&#947; and 10 (mouse) or 16 (human) other cytokines associated with immune activation in both the ConA and anti-PD1 treated samples, but not the control. In human LTFs, cytokine panel upregulation was observed for anti-PD1 vs. control (p=1.1e-5) and anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4 vs. anti-PD1 (p=3.7e-9). Using multiphoton microscopy and CD8-binding nanobodies, we observed vigorous CD8+ T cell motility in human LTFs, with a speed of 10 &#181;m\/min, which is comparable to that reported in vivo. Our LTF platform has an immuno-competent TME in which we can detect cellular and secreted immune response markers, compare alternative treatments, and track the surveillance activity of infiltrating T cells. Future work will further advance the platform, enabling clinical trials for training and validating deep neural networks to predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other IO drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/446c70d5-9fac-42f5-a3ca-837d90f38dc7\/@y03B8ZBA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Predictive biomarkers,Precision medicine,Cancer diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12707"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tomasz Zal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leung Kau Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Hrycyniak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anura Shrestha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dinesh Joshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pichet Adstamongkonkul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelsey Tweed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wesley A.

Indeed, downregulation of MHC-I expression and\/ or defects in the pathways of antigen presentation machinery are commonly reported in human cancers. Despite many reports published, available tools lack the robustness, specificity and sensitivity needed for systematic integration and analysis in clinical trials. In order to explore loss of antigen presentation as one of the major resistance mechanisms to checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy treatment and to enable identification of patients with tumors harboring antigen presentation defects, we have developed immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based robust prototype assays to quantify HLA-A and B2M proteins in patient tissue samples. We have determined the prevalence of loss of HLA-A and B2M in banked primary tumor blocks as well as in 329 tumor metastatic biopsies collected during Roche-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trials investigating novel immunotherapies as single agents or in combination with CPI. Below are the key findings and preliminary interpretations:We confirm a significant prevalence of HLA-A and B2M loss (up to 65%) depending on indication, revealing heterogeneous expression patterns across patients and indications.We describe an increase of HLA-A and B2M loss from primary to metastatic lesions, which may reflect a selection of MHC-I-low\/ negative clones in spreading cancer cells (and maybe lines of therapies).We show that high on-treatment B2M expression is positively associated with clinical outcome (RECIST), while high baseline B2M expression only shows a trend (but no statistical significance) towards positive association with response. If the former (on-treatment expression) could be seen as a consequence of the drug effect (induction of inflammation, IFN-signaling and subsequent induction of MHC-I expression), the latter (baseline expression) would have been the foundation for enriching patient populations based on MHC-I expression. Based on these data, the absence of strong correlation between baseline expression and response does not support a cross-CIT enrichment approach at this stage.We see a treatment-induced increase of MHC-I expression in most of the patients. Preliminary conclusions could be that 1\/ MHC-I loss can be rescued in most of the cases we analyzed (few hard losses), 2\/ Since we only see few responders, MHC-I loss is not the dominant resistance mechanism or the drug(s) did not induce a strong-enough MHC-I expression to rescue it.This investigation reveals a highly dynamic expression of HLA-A and B2M in tumors affected by key variables such as indication, metastatic status, immunophenotype and immunotherapy treatment. We plan to explore MHC-I expression in larger cohorts of CPI-treated patients in order to confirm and broaden our preliminary findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c99d8990-ae92-4a4e-80d6-7a8cfa5b75fe\/@y03B8ZBA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,HLA class I,Resistance,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12708"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bernhard Reis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastian Dziadek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Attig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nico Graefe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Astrid Heller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natascha Rieder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruno Gomes<\/i><\/presenter>.

To understand the impact of co-occurring genetic alterations on the therapeutic response to mobocertinib, tumors from a subset of 72 platinum-pretreated pts with <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 20 insertions from the phase 1\/2 study (NCT02716116) were collected before treatment and analyzed by next-generation sequencing. More than 200 co-occurring hotspot genetic alterations were detected in 43 pts, with some alterations detected with greater than 20% frequency, such as <i>PTCH1<\/i> (67%), <i>HNF1A<\/i> (58%), <i>TP53<\/i> (58%), and <i>GNAQ<\/i> (35%). In addition to <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 20 insertion mutations, co-occurring <i>EGFR<\/i> substitutions were also observed in the exon 20 loop following the C-helix (amino acid positions 770, 771, 772) in 4 pts and L858Q in 1 pt. The pt with the L858Q mutation had a confirmed partial response as assessed by an independent review committee, while the 4 pts with exon 20 substitutions were non-responders (2 had stable disease and 2 had progressive disease as best response). An abnormally high level of mutational burden was seen in 4 pts with <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 20 insertions, along with alterations in the mismatch repair gene <i>MSH6<\/i> and\/or the elongation factor <i>MLLT3<\/i>. Association analysis of mutations reported increased odds of association between the presence of <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, <i>TP53,<\/i> and <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations and a lack of mobocertinib response. Gene amplifications were observed in 12 pts (16%) affecting <i>EGFR<\/i> (6 pts), <i>MYC<\/i> (4 pts), <i>CDK4<\/i> (3 pts), and <i>CCND1<\/i> (2 pts). When assessed for association with lack of response (<i>P<\/i> values from the Fisher exact test), odds ratios were 2.47 (<i>P<\/i>=0.66) and 6.34 (<i>P<\/i>=0.085) for <i>EGFR<\/i> amplification and any-gene amplification, respectively. When combined, the presence of either <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations or any-gene amplification was associated with a lack of response to mobocertinib treatment with an odds ratio of 12.93. Following adjustment for selected clinical covariates in a multivariate model, the presence of either <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation or gene amplification was an independent predictor of lack of response to mobocertinib (<i>P<\/i> value of 0.047). Given the retrospective nature of these analyses and the insufficient control of statistical multiplicity, this finding should be considered exploratory. These data suggest that intrinsic genetic alterations, present at baseline in patients with NSCLC harboring an <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 20 insertion mutation, might impact the response to mobocertinib treatment. The presence of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations, <i>EGFR<\/i> gene amplification, or cell cycle regulator <i>MYC-CDK4-CCND1<\/i> amplification is associated with lack of response to mobocertinib, which might guide rational combinations for future clinical investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e06d37c9-e3b3-4c8a-a40d-6229537387fb\/@y03B8ZBA\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Lung cancer,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,EGFR exon 20 insertions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12709"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sylvie Vincent<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenqiang Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adarsh Joshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kalyani Penta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pingkuan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>.

We recently reported IGV-001-treated newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients had a median progression free survival of 38.4 months compared with 8.3 months in historical standard-of-care-treated patients (P=0.0008). We have now identified key cytokines and other clinical measures that are predictive of patient outcome via serum profiling and machine learning classification.<br \/>Methodology: Cytokines in sera were assayed from the day of treatment (0d), 14, 28, 42, and 150d post-treatment. Cytokines quantified included IL-1&#946;, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN&#947;, and TNF&#945;. An overall survival cut point of 21.9 months was used to dichotomize &#8216;good&#8217; vs. &#8216;poor&#8217; outcomes. MATLAB&#174; Classification Learner was used to train an &#8220;optimized tree&#8221; predictive model with a sub-population of samples. The trained model was subsequently used to predict survival classification for all patients based on cytokine and clinical data inputs<br \/>Results: IL-8 showed predictive potential discerning good vs. poor outcomes. Median IL-8 sera concentrations from good (n=10) vs. poor (n=15) responders showed significant differences on 28d (good=7.42 pg\/ml, poor=14.73 pg\/ml, p=0.027) and 42d (good=4.56 pg\/ml, poor=19.87 pg\/ml, p=0.0025) compared to 0d (good=8.17 pg\/ml, poor=7.42 pg\/ml, p=0.8). Training the classification model, a maximum of 4 splits (&#8220;Gini&#8217;s diversity index&#8221; criterion) were possible while achieving 100% correct classification of the training dataset (n=8, good=4, poor=4). Applying the trained model on the full dataset (n=25, good=10, poor=15), resulted in 100% correct classification of patient&#8217;s actual clinical outcomes. Analysis of data distributions used by the trained model indicated key cytokine were IL-8, IL-6, and IL-17A.<br \/>Conclusions: A classification model has been developed to predict long-term &#8220;good&#8221; vs. short-term &#8220;poor&#8221; outcomes of IGV-001-treated patients. In particular, we identified IL-8, IL-6 and IL-17A as key immune correlates of patient outcome as early as d14 post-treatment and sustained beyond standard of care treatment. These cytokines are known to correlate with tumor burden, validating the utility of our model. Further inclusion of data from new patients from an upcoming Phase IIb (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04485949) will be utilized to strengthen the model&#8217;s predictive capabilities and the potential identification of patient populations most likely to benefit from IGV-001 immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ef8a748-31fc-4518-b07f-e0600e008973\/@y03B8ZBA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Cancer immunotherapy,Cytokines,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12710"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christopher Uhl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jenny Zilberberg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles B.

Although these strategies have reduced the incidence of CRC, they are invasive, costly, and have low rates of compliance. Chemoprevention aims to prevent or delay the onset of CRC through eradication or prevention of precursor colonic adenomas, ideally with affordable and nontoxic drugs. The imipridone ONC201, which induces apoptosis, in part, through upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), is currently undergoing preclinical evaluation as a potential chemopreventive agent. In preclinical models, we found that treatment with ONC201 is capable of increasing TRAIL expression in normal cells and can improve tumor suppression through immune surveillance by the innate immune system. To further assess potential biomarkers of response to ONC201, we evaluated expression of TRAIL and death receptor 5 (DR5), as well as markers related to cellular stemness such as LGR5 in colonic mucosa obtained from mice treated with ONC201 and vehicle controls. In this study, <\/b>16-week-old female C57BL\/6 mice were administered vehicle or ONC201 50mg\/kg (n=11) body weight by oral gavage twice a week for a total of five doses. Both immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to evaluate differential expression of various potential biomarkers in both fresh frozen and FFPE colonic tissue. Using western blotting we found a significant increase in TRAIL expression in normal colonic mucosa obtained from mice treated with ONC201 as compared to vehicle controls. This finding was further validated using immunohistochemistry. Other markers, such as DR5 appeared unaffected with treatment. As efforts are currently underway to develop a CRC chemoprevention trial using ONC201, TRAIL may represent a biomarker of interest. Further analysis of stemness markers, as well as serum analyses are currently in process and may reveal other potential biomarkers for use in chemoprevention trial development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/37e71bc3-e3e6-428b-81cd-efdf998d1eed\/@y03B8ZBA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Colon cancer,TRAIL,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12712"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander G.

Defining whether a patient has multiple primary cancers (MPC) or metastatic disease is an urgent clinical need due to differences in treatment strategies, with curative intend for MPCs. Discerning the clonal and non-clonal relationship of two lesions for metastases and MPCs, respectively, has been done since the 1970s by analyzing histological characteristics, which nowadays are complemented with genomic features. However, one or few mutation features are insufficient to unequivocally diagnose tumor clonality, due to intratumoral heterogeneity and common mutations. We and others have demonstrated convincing clonality classification by genome-wide copy number aberrations (CNAs) analysis, which is the recommendation from the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), independent of histological differences or similarities. Notwithstanding, a gold standard clonality assessment is currently lacking such that quality evaluation and calibration of the diagnostic tests are not possible. Gold-standard data: Genetic data from non-clonal cancer samples has become virtually endless by means of Whole Exome and Whole Genome sequencing (WES and WGS) since the mutational discrepancies by WES between two MPCs from a single lung cancer patient is the same as those of two primary cancers from different patients. Therefore, publicly available WES or WGS data from tumors of different lung cancer patients can serve as a gold standard reference for non-clonality. A gold standard reference for clonal samples can be derived from WES data from multiple biopsies of one patient, i.e. from the TRACERx initiative. These datasets now allow for the first time to calibrate CNA clonality testing against a gold standard and calculate the sensitivity and specificity of multiple lung tumors in one patient. Diagnostic test: Shallow Whole Genome Sequencing (sWGS) based genome-wide CNA analysis on Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) specimens has been used as the diagnostic routine at the Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC over the past 5 years. The pipeline was calibrated against gold standard clonal and non-clonal WES data. We present sensitivity and specificity for an adequate, fast, and more economic clonality test based on genome-wide CNAs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a5da66b-fca1-43a9-9ff7-f0f0f292976b\/@y03B8ZBA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,Lung cancer,Metastasis,Diagnostic marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12713"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bárbara Andrade Barbosa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teodora Radonic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongsoo Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bauke Ylstra<\/i><\/presenter>.
