[{"Abstract":"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that play a key role in tumor immune surveillance. NK cells have self-tolerance to healthy cells and can kill allogeneic tumor cells- both hematological and solid malignancies. Recent advances to derive immune cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) allow the production of NK cells that can be used for immunotherapy. Recent clinical trials suggest that high doses of NK cells (approx. 0.5-1 x 10<sup>9<\/sup> cells per dose) and multiple doses are both safe and likely necessary for clinical efficacy. Manufacturing large number of NK cells from a clonal master iPSC line provides a promising strategy to enable off-the-shelf, next generation allogenic cell therapies. To do this, we have developed a novel method to produce clinical scale iPSC-NK cells and improved the process to expand NK cells efficiently and consistently. Briefly, hematopoietic progenitor cells were induced using an improved spin embryoid body (EB) method and the hematopoietic progenitor cells were subsequently differentiated into mature NK cells without cell sorting step as well as stroma cells support. Using this novel protocol, differentiated NK cells expanded more than 3,000-fold to enable us to potentially produce 1 x 10<sup>12<\/sup> iPSC-NK cells starting from 1 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> undifferentiated iPSC. This cell production scale can supply &#62;200 doses of 10<sup>9<\/sup> cells per dose. Importantly, iPSC-NK cells produced using this method display the typical phenotype of NK cell activating receptor including NKG2D, NKp44, NKp46, and DNAM-1. These iPSC-NK cells demonstrate better anti-tumor activity (against AML) and higher levels of IFN&#947; and TNF&#945; compared to primary peripheral blood-derived NK cells isolated from healthy donors. Additionally, our iPSC-NK cells demonstrated prolonged &#8220;serial killing&#8221; of AML cells up to six days. Moreover, this protocol has been tested in large scale using not only unmodified iPSC-NK cells, but also genetically engineered iPSC-NK cells including those with deletion of <i>CISH<\/i> in iPSC-derived NK cells us that demonstrate improved in vivo anti-tumor activity, in vivo persistence, metabolic fitness, polyfunctionality and resistance to cell exhaustion to create next-generation CAR-NK cell-based immunotherapies. Overall, this novel cell production strategy paves the way for clinical trials using higher doses of more potent iPSC-derived NK cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c81492b8-9704-4c6a-a210-fb91ffc74cd5\/@s03B8ZMJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-05 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,iPSC-derived NK cells,Cancer immunotherapy,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14665"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Davide Bernareggi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caryn Gonsalves<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Max Schabla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandra Garate-Carrilo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleanor O’Gorman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Solchaga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammad El-Kalay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Sandborn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan S.

Head and neck radiation results in hyposalivation and altered sialochemistry which patients experience as xerostomia. We performed a preclinical and a pilot clinical study to determine if IFN-&#611; stimulated marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC(M)) from HNC patients could function as a source of autologous cells for the treatment of RIX and as a tool in preclinical murine studies of RIX.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Materials\/Methods:<\/b> Bone marrow aspirates from HNC patients previously treated with chemoradiation were obtained (IRB #2019-0497, NCT 04007081). MSC(M)s were isolated from bone marrow. MSC(M) were expanded in culture, surface marker expression was confirmed via flow cytometry, stimulated with IFN-&#611;, and cryopreserved. Thawed MSC(M)s were profiled to evaluate their functionality after cryorecovery. Cells were tested for their ability to stimulate salivary production in a murine model of RIX by injecting 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells into the submandibular gland (SMG) one week after a single 15 Gy fraction of radiation. Efficacy was evaluated by saliva production and histology.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> MSC(M)s from six patients were expanded to &#62;20x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells (median 15.5, range of 8-20 days). Post-thaw cultures demonstrated robust growth, with a median doubling time of 3.1 days. Cultured cells showed an MSC(M) phenotype, positive for CD73, CD90, and CD105 and negative for CD14, CD20, CD34, or CD45. IFN-&#611; stimulated MSC(M)s had immunomodulatory potential based on increased expression of IDO, ICAM-1, PD-L1, MHC I and MHC II expression compared with non-stimulated MSC(M)s (391%, 263%, 114%, 70% and 196% percent increase respectively). In a murine model of RIX, radiation resulted in structural changes to the gland as evidenced by increased fibrosis, decreased acinar size, and immune cell infiltration. Injection of MSC(M)s to the SMG following radiation resulted in improved saliva production, a reduction in fibrosis, and an increase in the size and density of acini within the tissue compared to control.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>These data strongly support the feasibility of a first-in-human clinical trial of autologous IFN-&#611; stimulated MSC(M)s to treat RIX and the potential of using human-derived MSC(M)s in future murine studies of RIX.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/77f906bc-5f8a-4383-9aca-8c65ffa835ef\/@s03B8ZMJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-05 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation,Saliva,Mesenchymal stem cell,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14666"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cristina Paz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Blitzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annemarie Glassey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kwangok P.

The NASA Twins study suggests that genomic, epigenomic, epitranscriptomic, and proteomic changes may detrimentally impact hematopoietic stem and immune cell fitness and induce stem cell exhaustion (Garrett-Bakelman et al., <i>Science<\/i>, 2019). Moreover, changes indicative of pre-cancer stem cell generation such as increased chromosome translocations and inversions occurred and persisted post-flight. Additionally, a recent publication entitled <i>Multisystem Toxicity in Cancer: Lessons from NASA&#8217;s Countermeasure<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> Program <\/i>found significant similarities between the multisystem physiological toxicities in cancer patients and during spaceflight (Scott et al, <i>Cell<\/i> 2019). These reports highlight the benefits of studying injury response, changes in mutational profiles and cancer evolution in microgravity at the stem cell level.<br \/>For this study, we designed a novel bioreactor system to support the culture of donor-derived human HSCs in low Earth orbit (LEO). A sponge matrix and stromal cells model the microenvironment HSCs reside in within the bone marrow niche. Testing on Earth confirmed our system&#8217;s ability to maintain stem cell fitness over several weeks. To assess stem cell physiology in LEO over time, we lentivirally transduce a reporter into the HSCs pre-flight (Pineda et al., <i>Scientific Reports<\/i> 2016), which allows for cell cycle tracking via fluorescence imaging. This will provide data for assessment of stem cell health, maintenance and functionality. Furthermore, we will be analyzing mutational status post-flight, with a focus on signatures we have previously connected to (pre-)malignant transformation via RNA sequencing analysis (Jiang, <i>Cancer Cell<\/i> 2019). Our bioreactors are scheduled to launch as part of the SpaceX CRS-24 mission on Dec 21, 2021. This investigation may provide valuable insights into the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell health and functionality, response to injury through accumulation of mutations and, eventually, the mechanisms fueling long-term (pre-)malignant transformation into leukemia stem cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69b9b5b4-3f93-495f-9219-6c52e4196b48\/@t03B8ZMK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-05 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone marrow,Stem cells,Tumor evolution,Tumorigenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14668"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luisa Ladel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Pham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Oliver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Larisa Balaian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catriona HM Jamieson<\/i><\/presenter>.

Natural Killer (NK) cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) hold great potential to become the next-generation cell therapy products because of their established safety profile and their unique biological activities, especially their potential effectiveness for targeting solid tumor. In contrast to T cells, NK cells exert anti-tumor activity without requiring antigen recognition through MHC complex; they are instead activated by calculated signaling through ligation of multiple activating and inhibitory receptors. As various solid tumors highly express activation ligands for NK cells, we reason that enhanced expression of activation receptors on NK cells could improve their killing activity towards solid tumors. Here, we report that &#8220;super NK cells&#8221; with more than 10 folds higher expression of NK cell receptors such as NKG2D and NCRs derived from engineered hiPSC show improved cytotoxicity against solid tumors compared with non-engineered ones. The &#8220;super NK cells&#8221; can achieve more than ten rounds of serial killing against both K562 and THP-1 cell lines in vitro. More importantly, the &#8220;super NK cells&#8221; show improved cytotoxicity to multiple solid tumors in both in vitro system and in vivo xenograft mouse models. In summary, we have engineered hiPSCs which can be differentiated into \"super NK cells\" as a potential cell therapy product for improved efficacy against solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d71aa478-ed14-4fa9-8fd0-ca6896123978\/@t03B8ZMK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-05 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Solid tumors,Stem cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14669"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yiyun Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangjun He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linqin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mi Shao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanan Yue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangbin Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Church<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>He Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Luhan Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

As mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) belong to the tumor microenvironment and exhibit - depending on the tumor type and microenvironment - either pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic abilities, we aimed to study the effects of TTFields on human MSCs.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Human MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of three different healthy donors and were exposed to TTFields for 72 hours. MSCs&#8217; clonogenic survival, proliferation and viability was analyzed after different TTFields frequencies. Boyden chamber assays were carried out to investigate the influence of TTFields on the migratory potential of MSCs. Flow cytometry analyses of caspase-3 and annexin V were conducted to determine MSCs&#8217; apoptosis rates after TTFields treatment. TTFields-induced senescence was quantified using beta-galactosidase stainings. MSCs&#8217; characteristic surface marker expression (CD73, CD90 and CD105) was studied after TTFields treatment.<br \/><b>Result<\/b> TTFields led to significantly reduced clonogenic survival (70-90% reduction compared to controls) and cellular proliferation (approximately 50% reduction) in all analyzed MSC specimens. However, MSCs&#8217; metabolic viability was largely unaffected after TTFields exposure. Within a range between 100 and 500 kHz, there was no frequency dependence of TTFields&#8217; anti-proliferative effect on human MSCs. As determined by Bodyen Chamber assays, TTFields resulted in a considerable reduction of MSCs&#8217; migratory potential. TTFields increased both cellular apoptosis and senescence in all MSC samples, whereas there was no alteration of MSCs&#8217; characteristic surface marker pattern.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> As TTFields considerably reduce MSCs&#8217; survival and migratory potential, TTFields could attenuate the pro-tumorigenic effects of tumor-associated MSCs that were recently described in glioblastoma patients.

We previously reported such a phenomenon in skin, where squamous cell carcinomas adopt a plastic phenotype so called &#8220;stem cell lineage infidelity&#8221;, entailing a wide-spread co-expression of otherwise lineage restricted genes, exemplified by hair follicle factor SOX9 and interfollicular epidermal factor KLF5. Occurring transiently in wounds and persists in cancer, stem cell lineage infidelity is essential to drive wound repair and tumorigenesis. However, it remains unclear what were the functional mediators of lineage infidelity factors. We thus set out to investigate one of its defining factors, KLF5. Employing genome-wide transcriptome and epigenome profiling, we found KLF5 specifies the epidermal lineage in the skin and is essential for skin maturation <i>in vivo<\/i>. Strikingly, KLF5 binds to the genomic vicinity of, and transcriptionally controls, multiple key enzymes catalyzing rate-limiting steps of epidermal sphingolipid secretion, whose disruption led to loss of lipid ultrastructural integrity, compromised secretory machinery and selective decline of high complexity sphingolipids in the skin. Remarkably, lipid-rich dietary intervention was able to reverse skin defects caused by KLF5 ablation and KLF5 is prevalently disrupted in skin barrier and inflammatory diseases. Our findings suggest KLF5 serves as a master secretory lineage factor and a transcriptional governor of sphingolipid metabolism in the developing and diseased skin, warranting future investigation of its functional underpinning in wound repair and cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17703c6a-f691-4edf-a489-4db3c82b3664\/@t03B8ZMK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Adult stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin,KLF4,Lipid metabolism,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14671"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yejing Ge<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We discovered two populations of basal cells in individuals with a smoking history: those with high mutational burden, driver gene mutations and tobacco-associated mutational signatures, and those with low mutational burden, similar to basal cells from never smokers and with an absence of mutational signatures associated with tobacco exposure. These cells expand preferentially in ex-smokers, accounting for 20-40% of basal cells compared with 2-5% in current smokers. We hypothesise that these cells are cancer-protective and their expansion reduces the risk of lung cancer development after smoking cessation.<br \/>Understanding the functional differences between high- and low-mutant airway basal cells and the mechanisms by which some cells resist the accumulation of smoking-induced mutations will be crucial to understanding the earliest stages of lung carcinogenesis.<br \/>To address this, we performed RNAseq on a subset of whole-genome sequenced airway basal cells. Preliminary data show that expression of markers of stemness is significantly different between high- and low-mutant basal cells. In addition, initial analysis shows that pathways such as carcinogen metabolism and MHC class I antigen presentation are higher in high-mutant basal cells. Further analysis in more patients is ongoing. To complement these data, we expanded whole-genome sequenced basal cell clones in culture and performed a range of assays to assess their progenitor and differentiation capacity. We assessed proliferation, colony-forming efficiency, longevity and differentiation and found no apparent differences between low- and high-mutant basal cells.<br \/>Initial analysis suggests that carcinogen metabolism and MHC class I antigen presentation may be key pathways in establishing heterogeneity in mutational burden and clonal dynamics in the normal airway epithelium. Additional assays and analysis are ongoing and will be the focus of future research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f7cef883-0d63-4c6f-853e-f556de53be78\/@t03B8ZMK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Adult stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tobacco smoke,Stem cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14672"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kate H.

Understanding this process is essential to decipher both normal tissue development and aberrant differentiation associated with malignant transformation. CUX1 is a non-clustered HOX-family transcription factor that is recurrently mutated in hematopoietic and solid tumours and regulates cell fate in multiple developmental systems. We reported that CUX1 is required for normal hematopoietic homeostasis of both murine and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). To date, the transcriptional role of CUX1 in HSPCs has been unclear, partly because of the complexity of the <i>Cux1 <\/i>locus. Namely, <i>Cux1 <\/i>shares exons with a distinct gene, <i>Casp, <\/i>which encodes a highly expressed golgi-associated protein. As most transcriptomic studies combine <i>Casp <\/i>and <i>Cux1<\/i> transcripts, the nuances of <i>Cux1 <\/i>expression are concealed. To identify the transcriptional mechanism by which CUX1 regulates HSPC functions, we compared scRNA-seq data of Kit+lin- HSPCs from transgenic mice expressing inducible shRNAs targeting <i>Cux1<\/i>, Cux1<sup>mid<\/sup> and Cux1<sup>low<\/sup>, to control counterparts expressing an shRNA targeting renilla luciferase. We demonstrate that separating <i>Cux1 <\/i>from <i>Casp <\/i>transcripts provides more power to detect the influence of <i>Cux1 <\/i>in scRNA-seq data analysis.<i> <\/i> While cell numbers within most HSPC sub-populations are largely unchanged after five days of <i>Cux1 <\/i>knockdown, the transcriptomes within multiple clusters are disrupted. The effect size is greatest in Cux1<sup>low<\/sup> cells, compared to Cux1<sup>mid<\/sup>, consistent with dosage dependent roles of CUX1 in HSPCs. Across sub-populations, <i>Cux1 <\/i>levels correlated with gene signatures of &#8220;stemness,&#8221; and <i>Cux1 <\/i>knockdown disrupted this gene signature in the core hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. Concomitantly, low levels of <i>Cux1<\/i> led to upregulation of cellular metabolism and G2\/M cell cycle transition pathways in core HSCs, indicating that CUX1 regulates stem cell quiescence at the hematopoietic apex. We are currently integrating this data with epigenetic datasets to determine the mechanism by which CUX1 regulates critical hematopoietic transcriptional programs. Overall, understanding the regulatory function of CUX1 will provide insight into how HSCs commit to different fates and may ultimately lead to novel cancer therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce56ec4c-7a51-4f9e-8b13-c7fc8a30e0b2\/@t03B8ZMK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Adult stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone marrow,Stemness,Transcription factor,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14673"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Weihan Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Konecki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanner Martinez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan McNerney<\/i><\/presenter>.

In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the number of characterized cell lines remains small. We have recently established a novel blastoid MCL cell line, isolated from a malignant pleural effusion of a patient with MCL.<br \/>A sample of the malignant pleural effusion was obtained with informed consent, and mononuclear cells were isolated. Following a few days of <i>in-vitro<\/i> culture, cells started to grow rapidly resulting in an estimated doubling time of 48h. The cells survived multiple freeze\/thaw cycles and have been maintained in culture for the last 8 months. Hence the establishment of a novel blastoid MCL cell line, named Arbo.<br \/>Both Arbo and the primary MCL cells obtained from the pleural effusion were negative for EBV DNA by qPCR.<br \/>Flow cytometry showed kappa-restricted cells that were positive for CD5, 19, 20, 22, and 23, and negative for CD2, 3, 7, 10, and 71. FMC7 was positive in Arbo and negative in primary cells, as opposed to CD38 that was negative in Arbo and positive in the primary cells. Arbo&#8217;s karyotype was complex contrasting with the normal 46XY karyotype found in the primary MCL cells. The presence of t(11;14)(q13;q32) was confirmed by FISH, additionally overexpression of cyclin-D1 was confirmed by western blot.<br \/>Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on DNA collected from Arbo revealing a total of 148,059 SNPs. Mutations were detected in the <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>NOTCH2<\/i>(C19W and R2400*) genes. Mutations in <i>NOTCH2<\/i> have not been described in other MCL cell lines, while they were identified in 5.2% of MCL patients. Immunoblotting for NOTCH2 confirms the expression of the protein by the cell line. Additionally, expression of CD23, which has been shown to be induced through NOTCH2 signaling, was confirmed by flow cytometry. To further characterize the effect of NOTCH2 on the survival of Arbo cells and CD23 expression, we cultured the cell line with increasing concentrations of the NOTCH2 transactivation inhibitor gliotoxin. We observed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth with an IC<sub>50 <\/sub>of 100 nM. Additionally, a dose dependent decrease in the expression of CD23 was observed by flow cytometry following treatment with gliotoxin.<br \/>To determine the dependence of Arbo on B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling for survival, we cultured the cells with increasing concentrations of the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib for 48h. Inhibition of cell growth was observed in a dose-dependent manner resulting in an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.4 &#181;M.<br \/>In conclusion, Arbo is a novel blastoid MCL cell line with a <i>NOTCH2<\/i> mutation that is fully characterized and will be made available to the research community.<br \/>Supported by a grant from the <i>Ladies Leukemia League, Inc., of the Gulf South Region<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea710a3c-b0f1-4eeb-827d-a6d64f9c4ae5\/@t03B8ZMK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-03 Developmental pathways in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mantle cell lymphoma,Cell lines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14677"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ishwarya Satyavarapu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Firas M.

During these critical windows, tissue resident macrophages function to maintain the homeostatic balance within the stromal microenvironment and the ductal epithelium, and alterations in these interactions disrupt tissue homeostasis and impact breast cancer risk. However, the signaling and mechanisms by which macrophages regulate mammary gland homeostasis are poorly understood. Our recent studies (and others) have identified transcriptional profiles of distinct tissue resident macrophage subpopulations in the mammary gland. We found that<i> <\/i><i>Cebpb<\/i>, a transcription factor important for myeloid cell differentiation and mammary gland development, is highly expressed in<i> <\/i><i>Cx3cr1<\/i><i><sup>+<\/sup><\/i> ductal macrophages and localizes to macrophages in close contact with the epithelial ducts. Genetic ablation of C\/EBP&#946; in CSF1R-expressing macrophages results in deficient alveolar budding during diestrus, while branching morphogenesis was normal. Interestingly, this phenotype is also seen in macrophage null models and suggests that C\/EBP&#946; in macrophages plays a crucial role in signaling to the mammary epithelium. Analysis of serum hormone levels show that circulating estrogen and progesterone levels are not changed in<i> <\/i><i>Cebpb<\/i><i><sup>&#916;M&#966;<\/sup><\/i> mice, however, the number of progesterone receptor (PR)-expressing cells are significantly increased in the ductal epithelium, suggesting altered local progesterone signaling. Further examination of the mammary epithelium shows alterations in a number of Wnt family members, including<i> Wnt1<\/i>,<i> <\/i><i>Wnt2b<\/i>,<i> <\/i><i>Wnt3a<\/i> and<i> <\/i><i>Axin2<\/i>, indicative of decreased canonical Wnt signaling. Importantly, canonical Wnt signaling has been shown to be critical for regulating mammary stem cell expansion during diestrous budding. Analysis of the C\/EBP&#946;-null macrophages show decreased expression of TGF&#946;, which is known to signal to basal epithelial stem cells to induce Wnt expression. Finally, other signals, such as Notch 2, which have important roles in the mammary gland development are altered. Ongoing studies are aimed at delineating how macrophage-derived C\/EBP&#946; facilitates mammary stem cell function during the estrous cycle in a progesterone-independent manner. The results of these studies will have critical implications for understanding how the signaling between macrophages and the ductal epithelium regulate tissue homeostasis and the inherent dysregulations that lead to tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5d2c3c96-6b8e-42c6-8009-b319dfc86a30\/@t03B8ZMK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-03 Developmental pathways in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Mammary gland,C\/EBP,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14680"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michelle D.

This process is characterized by high tumor plasticity that confers to cancer cells the ability to shift from a differentiated state, with limited tumorigenic potential, to an undifferentiated state which is responsible for drug resistance and tumor relapse. In ER+ breast tumors, this plasticity is manifest by the enrichment of breast tumor initiating cells (BTICs) with stemness features, such as self-renewal capacity, CD44 expression and high ALDH activity, and ER down-regulation. Development of clinically relevant ER+ breast tumor models to test novel therapeutic strategies that inhibit the enhanced tumor cell plasticity and restore or extend endocrine sensitivity are urgently needed.<br \/>Experimental Design: Unique endocrine resistant and metastatic breast cancer models were utilized to define <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> the pivotal role of Aurora-A mitotic kinase (AURKA) in the induction of stemness plasticity, endocrine therapy resistance and tumor progression. Unbiased phospho-proteomic analysis was performed in the absence or presence of alisertib, a clinically relevant AURKA inhibitor, that was used to identify novel down-stream targets of AURKA signaling pathway.<br \/>Results: Phospho-proteomic analysis showed that AURKA targeting reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3 transcription factor at the <i>serine-727<\/i> site. Significantly, herein we define a novel mechanism by which AURKA-induced self-renewal capacity is mediated through the activation of a phosphorylated <i>serine727<\/i>-STAT3\/<i>serine294<\/i>-progesterone receptor (PR) transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of KLF4 stemness reprogramming gene. Remarkable, pharmacologic and genetic targeting of AURKA\/STAT3\/PR oncogenic axis impairs self-renewal capacity of endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study<b> <\/b>we demonstrate the pivotal role of a novel AURKA\/STAT3\/PR oncogenic axis in promoting stemness plasticity and endocrine therapy resistance.

Despite available treatments, relapsed disease is a common occurrence with patients receiving survival predictions of less than one year. Relapsed MM is often refractory to multiple lines of therapy and occurs due to the uncontrolled regeneration of a population of malignant cells displaying progenitor-cell-like phenotypes. Selectively targeting this cancer stem cell (CSC) population provides an effective way to limit incidence of relapsed disease, improving the prognosis for high-risk patients. In MM, the defining characteristics of CSCs remain poorly understood, though signaling pathways promoting &#8216;stemness&#8217; that are often deregulated in CSCs, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, as well as canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling are also aberrantly activated in MM. In this context, the central objective of this project was to explore the functionality of two proteins which have been shown to be downstream targets of IL-6\/JAK2\/STAT3 signaling and potentiate Wnt signaling, the embryonic G-protein coupled receptor LGR4 and the fetal-oncogene tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor-1 (ROR1), as CSC biomarker candidates, and explore the feasibility of CSC targeting therapeutics for MM. Receptor expression was assessed by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry in primary plasma cell dyscrasia patient samples across the spectrum of disease, as well as in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs). Whole transcriptome sequencing analyses were carried out in HMCLs induced to overexpress LGR4, which enriched genes associated with ion transport and embryonic development. Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix genes were downregulated, along with genes associated with metabolic and mitochondrial pathways. Results of ROR1 gene expression and flow cytometry studies suggest that a subset of MM patient samples harbor a low-frequency ROR1-positive cell population, and expression is enriched in an <i>in vitro <\/i>model of acquired drug resistance. Overexpression of interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4) - a myeloma cell-enriched transcription factor that we recently showed promotes myeloma regeneration - also contributed to increased human ROR1 protein levels. HMCLs with high endogenous ROR1 expression were sensitive to <i>in vitro<\/i> killing by anti-ROR1 CAR T-cell treatment, which employs an scFv generated from the fully humanized ROR1-specific monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab, at effector:target cell ratios (ET) as low as 0.33:1. Together, these results suggest a central role for Wnt signaling in MM stem cell phenotypes and activation of embryonic transcriptional pathways, while also paving the way towards development of clinical therapies that target a CSC population in MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a8811f01-eb95-4569-ae73-3ed074d46ae3\/@u03B8ZML\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Biomarkers,GPCR-G-protein coupled receptor,ROR1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14698"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lara C.

Unequivocal SLTIC isolation, using surface markers, has proven highly elusive, thus impeding characterization and targeting of their mechanistic dependencies. To address this challenge, we applied a systems biology approach to effectively characterize SLTIC biology and to prioritize drugs that can reprogram them to a more differentiated state that is sensitive to chemotherapy.<br \/>To isolate breast cancer cells enriched for SLTICs, we performed flow cytometry-based sorting of tumor cells from 7 metastatic breast cancer patients, based on the expression of Epcam and CD49F, which are established epithelial and SLTIC-enriched cell markers, respectively. Activity-based clustering of single cell RNASeq profiles using the VIPER (Alvarez et al. Nat Genet 2017) algorithm identified two cell states, comprising cells presenting high activity of either SLTIC (<i>i.e.<\/i>, BMI1, NOTCH1, <i>etc.<\/i>) or differentiated, proliferative epithelial cell markers (<i>i.e.<\/i>, PCNA, CCNB1, <i>etc.<\/i>). Analysis of RNASeq profiles of BT20 cells treated with ~400 FDA approved and late-stage experimental drugs identified albendazole as the drug inducing the most significant activity inversion of SLTIC Master Regulator proteins (Alvarez et al. Nat Genet 2018) (<i>p=4.21x10<\/i><i><sup>-5<\/sup><\/i>). This was experimentally confirmed <i>in vivo<\/i> by single cell analysis of metastatic TNBC PDX models at 14 days after treatment with albendazole, paclitaxel (a drug known to kill differentiated but not SLTIC cells), and vehicle control. As expected, paclitaxel induced dramatic decrease of the differentiated vs. SLTIC cell ratio, while albendazole had the opposite effect, inducing equally dramatic increase in that ratio, as assessed by a combination of CytoTRACE and established SLTIC marker analysis. Sequential therapy, based on a 30-day treatment with albendazole with 3 rounds of paclitaxel at day 15, 22, and 30, repeated after a 15-day drug holiday produced highly synergistic tumor volume reduction, compared to individual monotherapies (<i>p=0.00869<\/i> by Bliss independence analysis). Indeed, while albendazole had little effect compared to vehicle control, as monotherapy, it induced &#62;50% additional tumor viability reduction when combined with paclitaxel. The approach is highly generalizable and can be used to identify potential combination therapy approaches for any tumor in which molecular distinct subpopulations co-exist with different drug sensitivities, thus offering a practical solution to addressing tumor heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f333403-ea77-40d3-89a8-7c4b6b2796aa\/@u03B8ZML\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cancer stem cells,Systems biology,Drug synergy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14699"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jeremy Worley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongxu Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Heeju Noh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evan Paull<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron T.

Accordingly, the scaffolding proteins that form the <i>Scribble<\/i> polarity complex (<i>SCRIB<\/i>, <i>LLGL1<\/i>, and <i>DLG<\/i> members) are usually downregulated in cancer, in particular in highly aggressive or invasive tumors. Because gliomas arise from non-epithelial precursors that are likely motile before transformation, the expression and functions of these scaffolding proteins in malignant brain tumors has remained almost entirely unexplored. Surprisingly, we have found that one member of the DLG family, DLG5, is highly upregulated in malignant gliomas compared to other solid tumors. Indeed, DLG5 was the predominant DLG member found in all molecular subtypes of glioblastoma (GBM). Knockdown of DLG5 reduced the viability, invasiveness, and self-renewal of GBM stem cells belonging to the proneural and mesenchymal molecular subtypes. As a result, intracranial tumors defficient in DLG5 were smaller and less proliferative than controls, resulting in extended animal survival. At the molecular level, DLG5 knockdown decreased the expression of stemness-related genes (<i>SOX2<\/i>, <i>NANOG<\/i>, <i>POU5F1<\/i>) but increased the expression of LLGL1, a component of the Scribble complex that is associated with neural precursor differentiation. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) signaling, both in vitro and in vivo, which drives GBM cell stemness and proliferation. Moreover, DLG5-deficient GBM stem cells became insensitive to exogenous SHh and were unable to upregulate Gli1 or increase cell invasion in presence of added SHh, compared to control cells. We further confirmed that DLG5 downregulation increased the ubiquitination of Gli1-containing complexes as well as Gli1 proteasomal degradation, providing a suitable mechanism for the loss of SHh signaling and tumor stemness. These results describe for the first time the expression of a DLG family member in malignant gliomas and reveal a novel, polarity-independent, pro-tumoral function of DLG5, which differs from its proposed tumor-suppressor role in other solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f2402ea2-db8a-44ba-a923-cef47651c2e1\/@u03B8ZML\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sonic hedgehog,Gli1,Cancer stem cells,Cell polarity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14701"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Somanath Kundu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohan S.

T cell-based immunotherapy has been suggested as a novel therapeutic option to eliminate minimal residual disease and achieve long-lasting remissions. One main prerequisite for immunotherapy development is the selection of immunogenic targets that show natural, high-frequent, and tumor-exclusive presentation on the cell surface of malignant cells. In a previous study we characterized the antigenic landscape of AML by mass spectrometry to identify AML-specific T cell epitopes (Berlin <i>et al.<\/i> Leukemia 2015). Here, we aimed to analyze the immunopeptidome of primary AML progenitor cells (n = 10, purity &#62;80% CD34<sup>+<\/sup>CD38<sup>-<\/sup>) to identify LPC-associated antigens that enable the specific targeting of AML LPCs. Additionally, we analyzed an extended set of AML patient samples (n = 47) to screen for naturally presented neoepitopes and to identify broadly applicable AML-associated target antigens that are presented on both AML blasts and LPCs.<br \/>We identified more than 16,000 HLA class I- and 17,000 HLA class II-presented peptides on LPCs and 72,000 HLA class I and 61,000 HLA class II peptides in the total AML cohort. Comparative profiling of LPCs, AML blasts, and a benign tissue database (n = 332) revealed HLA class I- and HLA class II-presented LPC-exclusive as well as frequently presented AML-associated antigens on both AML blasts and LPCs.

A subpopulation of tumor cells known to have intrinsic resistance to standard therapies and contribute to metastasis function as &#8220;cancer stem&#8221;, or tumor-initiating, cells (TICs). Enriched populations of TICs are typically identified by markers such as aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, the cell surface marker combination of CD44<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD24<sup>-<\/sup>, or fluorescent reporters for signaling pathways that regulate TIC function such as STAT3. Despite their utility, TIC markers and reporters have limitations. Marker expression can be unstable and there is no established method to lineage trace long-lived TICs or to follow them as they undergo cell state changes.<br \/>Methods: To augment existing TIC reporters, we developed a two component TAM-inducible, Cre recombinase-dependent, STAT3 signaling-specific lentiviral LT system. The first component is a vector that labels cells with active STAT3 signaling (EGFP<sup>+<\/sup>), followed by a self-cleaving peptide and TAM-inducible Cre-recombinase (4M67-EGFP-P2A-CreER<sup>T2<\/sup>). The second component is a constitutively expressed dual-color switching Cre-dependent reporter vector (EFS-<sub>loxP<\/sub>dsRed<sub>loxP<\/sub>-mNeptune2). Addition of TAM drives color switching from dsRed to mNeptune2 via CreER<sup>T2<\/sup> recombination in STAT3 signaling cells. Both lentiviral vectors were constructed using Gateway&#174; Cloning. Sum159 cells were transduced with the LT system and reporter activity was validated both in vitro and in vivo using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Four LT cell populations (EGFP<sup>+<\/sup>\/mNeptune2<sup>+<\/sup>, EGFP<sup>+<\/sup>\/dsRed<sup>+<\/sup>, EGFP<sup>-<\/sup>\/mNeptune2<sup>+<\/sup>, and EGFP<sup>-<\/sup>\/dsRed<sup>+<\/sup>) were enriched using fluorescence activated cell sorting, then analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq).<br \/>Results: Our results confirm the STAT3 LT reporter identifies STAT3 signaling cells (EGFP<sup>+<\/sup>), which can be labelled (mNeptune2<sup>+<\/sup>) upon addition of TAM. We conducted a TAM dose response curve to identify the optimal TAM dose for complete and partial labeling of STAT3 signaling cells. scRNA seq uncovered gene expression patterns within the TIC compartment and revealed similarities and differences in gene expression between the TIC compartment and the remaining LT reporter populations.<br \/>Conclusions: These data demonstrate our LT system is a powerful tool that can be applied to uncover the role of TICs in metastasis and therapeutic resistance, as well as identify genetic vulnerabilities to specifically target TICs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd92e9d6-4b04-4cf4-a5b2-6c12d015712f\/@u03B8ZML\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Breast cancer,Tumor heterogeneity,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14703"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eric P.

Therefore a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the origin of GICs is critical to develop new therapies better targeting glioblastoma. Human endogenous retroviral sequences (HERVs), present in approximately 500,000 copies and comprising nearly 8% of the human genome, may serve as an abundant genetic material equipping GIC with phenotypic plasticity needed to develop stem-like phenotype. Recent epigenomic and transcriptomic data show HERV activation during early human development. Moreover, increased HERV transcription is observed in OCT4\/SOX2\/KLF4\/c-MYC induced pluripotent cells. Finally, activation of HERV loci transcription is also commonly observed in different tumor types. Using publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA-GBM) RNA-seq data collection, we have quantified transcripts for all 13,208 HERV loci annotated in the RepBase database. To improve the accuracy of quantifying the HERV transcriptomic landscape, we reassigned already mapped fragments to the most probable transcript using the Telescope software. Our comprehensive approach allowed us to identify the set of HERV loci uniquely dysregulated in the glioblastoma compared to normal brain tissue. In addition, we compared 540 low-grade glial tumors from TCGA-LGG project (classified as grade II and III gliomas) with 165 glioblastoma samples from TCGA-GBM (classified as grade IV gliomas) using the same bioinformatics pipeline. Comprehensive analysis of transcript levels allowed us to identify HERV assemblage differentially expressed between these two patient cohorts. The correlation between HERV and ORF transcript levels show strong coregulation of HERVs expression with genes involved in establishing\/maintaining embryonic\/neural\/glial stem cells phenotype. To confirm our observations we have up- or downregulated HERV loci combining guide RNA array targeting robustly approximately 90% of HERV LTR5Hs elements with a vector expressing CRISPR-based transcriptional activator or repressor. Downregulation of HERV transcription with this system was associated with the inhibition of clonogenic growth in cell culture. In summary, this study sets the stage for identifying HERV loci that could serve as potential GIC biomarkers, as well as the molecular targets for GIC elimination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e91d38f-2229-4cdd-b3d1-51543dcb5a84\/@u03B8ZML\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Retrovirus,Glioblastoma,Stemness,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14704"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Adam J.

Here we present the novel role of ARL2 in human cancer nucleus and cancer stem cells (CSC). The cancer tissue gene expression data in The Human Protein Atlas and The Cancer Genome Atlas showed possible pro-cancer and nuclear role of ARL2 in colon cancers. The single cell RNA seq analysis suggests its function in colon stem cells. The activation mutant of K-Ras harboring colon cancer cells expressed less ARL2 than the wild type cells but increased ARL2 expression in CSC spheres. The deprivation of ARL2 in colon cancer cell lines using RNAi preferentially eliminated the CSC spheres while it resulted in minimal impact on bulk cultured cell (BCC) numbers. Suppression of ARL2 halted the BCC at M phase as expected but did not change cell cycle in CSC spheres. However, it led to accumulation of a DNA double strand break marker and apoptosis only in CSC spheres which suggest that ARL2&#8217;s requirement for double strand DNA break repair in CSC. Out of 6 somatic RAD51 family genes which all mediate the critical early events of homologous recombination repair (HRR), 5 showed significant and positive association with ARL2 in gene expression in human colon cancer tissue suggesting functional link between ARL2 and HRR. Indeed, ARL2 was required for HRR when double strand DNA breaks were induced. These data collectively showed that ARL2 may contribute to the HRR in the nucleus and the ARL2 mediated HRR is more critical for colon CSC survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e35adf1-8d1c-4038-8761-79ad0ff3e6ad\/@u03B8ZML\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Homologous recombination,DNA repair,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14705"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seok Gyeong Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hani Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sojung Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sukjoon Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woo-Young Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.
