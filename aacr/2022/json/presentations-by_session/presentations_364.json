[{"Abstract":"Richter&#8217;s syndrome (RS) arising from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a striking example of an aggressive malignant histology that emerges from indolent cancer. RS is a major barrier to disease control in CLL and is associated with poor clinical outcomes and limited survival. The genetic basis of RS is poorly understood, and its relationship to the antecedent CLL remains incompletely characterized.<br \/>To study RS, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on samples collected from 52 patients with RS of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) histology. For this genomic characterization, samples from 42 patients were analyzed as &#8216;trios&#8217; (matched germline, CLL and RS tissue DNA) and those from 10 as &#8216;duos&#8217; (matched CLL and RS DNA). Beyond addressing contamination of CLL DNA in the germline sample, we developed methods for discriminating between the RS and CLL clones which often coexist in the same samples.<br \/>The discovery cohort revealed that RS and CLL were clonally-related in 45\/52 (87%) cases based on WES analysis, with a distinct RS clone emerging from a CLL subclone. The remaining 13% were determined to be clonally unrelated. RS clones presented ~3x higher rates of additional mutations than the ancestral CLL clones from which they developed. We identified novel RS somatic driver mutations (in IRF2BP2, SRSF1, B2M, DNMT3A and others), a high rate of copy number variations with recurrent deletions (e.g., del(17p) [TP53], del(13q14.3), del(7q36), and del(15q13.11) [MGA], del(9p21.3) [CDKN2A\/B], del(16q12.2)), focal amplifications (amp(7q21.2) [CDK6], amp(8q24.2) [RECQL4, MYC], amp(13q31.2) [ERCC5], and frequent whole genome duplication.<br \/>To further investigate RS and CLL clonal evolution, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on biopsies at the time of RS diagnosis in 5 individuals with clonally related transformation. Using our novel tool, CNVSingle, we inferred allele specific single-cell copy number alterations, yielding cluster-specific copy number profiles that matched the WES results of individual subclones of the RS and CLL populations. This enabled mapping genetic clones to specific expression patterns. Finally, we devised and tested a methodology that uses cfDNA for early detection of emerging Richter&#8217;s disease and have successfully identified Richter&#8216;s tumor DNA in the blood several months prior to the clinical diagnosis. Our study thus defines drivers, distinct molecular subtypes and evolutionary path to RS and suggests strategies for its improved detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d91feb33-6101-4b8a-b23b-ff6fc2cb993f\/@y03B8ZER\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor evolution,Leukemias: chronic lymphocytic,Leukemias,Lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12976"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Erin M.

Patients often present at an advanced stage and overall-5-year survival rates are less than 15%. In many patients, the response to neoadjuvant therapy is encouraging at first, but most will develop metastatic disease several years later. Recently, we observed plasticity along the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) axis in EAC tumor cells upon therapeutic pressure. The last decade has seen the discovery of static molecular subtypes in cancers and a poor-prognosis mesenchymal subtype has been reported in multiple gastrointestinal cancers, but not in EAC. Here, we set out to identify transcriptomic subtypes and the frequency of their occurrence during EAC progression, and exposure to therapy in a clinical setting.<br \/><i>Methods: <\/i>A cohort comprising of 174 esophageal cancer cases (n=100 pre-treatment biopsies, n=46 neoadjuvantly-treated resection specimens, and n=28 metastatic biopsies) with 12 esophageal cancer cell lines (8 primary and 4 ATCC cell lines) was RNA-sequenced. To circumvent non-tumor signals confounding the analysis, we leveraged non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a virtual microdissection tool. Patients were subtyped by consensus clustering the top 50 exemplar genes per tumor-cell intrinsic signature. Next, the subtypes were validated in two independent cohorts and clinical correlates were analyzed. In addition, we perturbed subtype-specific regulators to functionally assess the existence of the subtypes.<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>Here, we identified 7 biological signatures involved in primary and metastatic EAC. Two of these were unambiguously tumor-intrinsic signals. All seven signatures associated with tumor cellularity scores estimated by an experienced pathologist confirming the reliability of NMF as a virtual microdissection tool. Upon clustering two EAC subtypes emerged: Intestinal-like (IL) and Mesenchymal-like (ML). ML-subtyped patients were observed with increased frequency after neoadjuvant treatment, and following metastatic dissemination. This association was validated in an independent cohort. Lastly, we identified HMGA2 as a key transcription factor for the ML-subtype. Genetic perturbation of HMGA2 induced an IL-associated phenotype.<br \/><i>Conclusion: <\/i>Our study demonstrate for the first time from clinical transcriptomics data that EAC cells can exist in distinct cell states. In addition, the abundance of either cell states, that constitute to tumor subtype, alter when exposed to chemoradiation or following metastatic spread. These subtypes offer a valuable method to design more informed personalized treatment approaches for EAC patients; for existing and future subtype-directed treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/33707cd1-89d2-4230-8e01-19d373d72df2\/@y03B8ZER\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Gene expression profiling,Target discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12977"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mark P.G.

Current vaccines are likely to have limited impact in the prevention of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in several decades due to a high prevalence of this infection in older individuals. HPV-associated (HPV+) HNSCC is the most frequently diagnosed HPV related cancer and its incidence continues to rise. Despite this, little is known about the mechanism of HPV-driven carcinogenesis. Even though HPV+ HNSCC has a favorable prognosis, around 30% of patients show recurrence accompanied by severe side effects due to intensive radiotherapy. Hence, it is pertinent to develop de-intensification strategies to identify patients that are at low risk of recurrence. However, absence of molecular biomarkers greatly limits these studies. Data from two independent patient cohorts helped identify subtypes of HPV+ HNSCC based on presence or absence of NF-&#954;B activating mutations. The subtype with NF-&#954;B overactivity significantly correlated with better patient survival and the absence of an integrated HPV, suggesting that these tumors are driven by a distinct mechanism of oncogenesis, dependent on NF-&#954;B overactivity and maintenance of episomal HPV. Most of these tumors had deletions of <i>TRAF3<\/i> or <i>CYLD<\/i> genes, which are known NF-&#954;B inhibitors. Another finding from this study was the presence of NRF2 downregulation in the subset of NF-&#954;B overactive tumors. NRF2 is a major regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response. Its dysregulation has been known to help cancer cells survive and plays a role in radio resistance. We confirmed that baseline and inducible NRF2 transcriptional activity is downregulated in NF-&#954;B overactive HPV+ HNSCC cells with <i>TRAF3<\/i> or <i>CYLD<\/i> knockout<i>. <\/i>Interestingly, similar results were observed in these cells after overexpression of dominant negative CUL3 that stabilizes and activates NRF2, suggesting that stabilized NRF2 is inhibited in HPV+ HNSCC cells carrying constitutively active NF-&#954;B. Clonogenic survival assay revealed that NF-&#954;B active cells are more sensitive to radiation as compared to parental HPV+ HNSCC cells. In addition, we found lesser nuclear localization of NRF2 after treatment with small molecule NRF2 activator CDDO in <i>CYLD\/TRAF3<\/i> knockout cells. Confirmation of these findings post radiation may explain improved survival of patients with NF-&#954;B overactive HPV+ HNSCC. Overall, our data suggests an inverse correlation between NF-&#954;B and NRF2, with NF-&#954;B potentially altering the oxidative stress response and conferring radio sensitivity to HPV+ HNSCC with <i>TRAF3\/CYLD<\/i> mutations. Our aim is to uncover the unique mechanism of HPV carcinogenesis and finding novel therapeutic targets in HNSCC while improving quality of life in patients. Importantly, constitutively active NF-&#954;B distinguishing the 2 subtypes of HPV+ HNSCC may serve as prognostic biomarkers to help clinicians with therapeutic decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/38bc1e7d-044b-4b51-bb5a-7a6c8a6bbed9\/@y03B8ZER\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Molecular markers,Radiosensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12978"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aditi Kothari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Travis Parke Schrank<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalia Issaeva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendell Gray Yarbrough<\/i><\/presenter>.

Approximately 50% of TNBC patients respond to pre-operative neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), however those patients with residual disease (non-pathological complete response or non-pCR) have a very poor prognosis. Recently, the use of capecitabine in the adjuvant setting was shown to increase disease-free survival in non-pCR patients. However, there are no biomarkers to identify patients who may benefit from adjuvant capecitabine. Moreover, novel therapeutic targets are needed to treat patients with non-pCR.<br \/>Methods: RNA extracted from 32 Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) residual post-NAC tumor samples underwent NanoString nCounter gene expression analysis using the BC360 panel as well as RNAseq.<br \/>Results: Comparison of tumors from poor (RFS&#60;2 yrs) and good prognosis (RFS&#62;2 yrs) patients showed 65 genes differentially expressed (&#8805;1.5 fold change and p&#60;0.05) by nCounter. 40 of these genes had differential expression also validated by RNAseq (R2= 0.96) and were selected for further pathway analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed an enrichment for biological pathways involved in cell cycle, with all genes in this set upregulated in the poor prognosis group. GSEA analysis of 310 upregulated genes identified by RNAseq showed an enrichment for biological pathways associated with cell population proliferation and skin development. Interestingly, one of the upregulated genes identified was TYMS, encoding thymidylate synthase, the target of capecitabine, which showed 2-fold increased expression in the poor prognosis group (p&#8804;0.005).<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that residual tumors from TNBC patients who relapse within two years of surgery show transcriptomic evidence of increased proliferation and that expression levels of TYMS may be a potential biomarker to select patients for capecitabine in the adjuvant setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cb2d3c90-43e6-4c0e-b43e-2dd470ebdfac\/@y03B8ZER\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Prognosis,Thymidylate synthase,Cell cycle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12981"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adriana Aguilar-Mahecha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasamin Majedi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oluwadara Elebute<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josiane Lafleur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Papadakis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cathy Lan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuela Pelmus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Touhidur Rashid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Jenna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Basik<\/i><\/presenter>.

Using standard 2D culture models, our group has shown that targeting EGFR activity in ISP-associated SNC effectively inhibits cellular proliferation in vitro. Targeting EGFR in pre-clinical models that are more representative of in vivo patient responses is a critical next step.<br \/>Methods: High-throughput drug screening was conducted using a 3D in vitro culture model for two ISP-associated SNC cell lines (SCCNC4 and UM-SCC-112) using a library of &#62;800 curated small molecule inhibitors including inhibitors of EGFR, PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR (P\/A\/M), and Bcl-2. Viability was assessed and drug sensitivity scores were calculated. Dual combinations (inhibition of EGFR and P\/A\/M or Bcl-2) and triple combinations (inhibition of EGFR, P\/A\/M, and Bcl-2) for select drugs were tested for synergistic killing using the Chou-Talalay and Bliss methods. Treatment-associated transcriptomic changes were monitored using whole-transcriptome RNAseq. Finally, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from primary sinonasal papilloma or carcinoma tissue were utilized ex vivo for short-term drug screening with EGFR, P\/A\/M, and\/or Bcl-2 inhibitors at maximum human plasma concentration (Cmax) format.<br \/>Results: Drug screening demonstrated that ISP-associated SNC cell lines are highly resistant to a diversity of standard and targeted therapeutic agents. Indeed, these cell lines demonstrated poorer responses than other highly resistant tumor types previously analyzed by our group, including triple-negative breast cancer and bladder cancer. Our data demonstrated that EGFR inhibition alone does not effectively kill ISP-associated SNC cells in 3D culture; however, dual and triple combinations of EGFR and P\/A\/M and\/or Bcl-2 inhibitors showed synergistic killing. Finally, sinonasal papilloma and carcinoma PDOs showed partial responses to selected EGFR inhibitors in 3D ex vivo culture.<br \/>Conclusions: While EGFR inhibitors effectively inhibit cellular proliferation in ISP-associated SNC cell lines in 2D culture, drug screening in 3D culture and using PDO material - more representative models of in vivo patient responses - show that EGFR inhibition alone is insufficient to completely eliminate these tumor cells, suggesting that EGFR inhibitors alone are unlikely to generate significant clinical responses for patients with ISP or associated SNCs. However, combining targeting of the P\/A\/M and\/or Bcl-2 pathways revealed synergistic killing of ISP-associated SNC cell lines. Taken together, these data demonstrate that compensatory oncogenic and\/or anti-apoptotic pathways must be targeted to potentiate EGFR inhibition for successful treatment of ISP and associated SNCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b26a7844-e291-41f8-abbf-9190df55f23d\/@y03B8ZER\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular profiling,Combination therapy,Synergism,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12982"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Athena M.

Functional and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies unequivocally demonstrate the coexistence of functionally and spatially distinct fibroblast and mural cell states within the tumor microenvironment of various non-prostate tumors. Stromal cellular heterogeneity in PCa however remains poorly understood. This study therefore aimed to (1) comprehensively analyze stromal cell states within the PCa microenvironment and (2) to identify and characterize onco-supportive fibromuscular entities in respect to their potential clinical exploitation. Thus, we performed bulk tissue scRNA-seq on biopsy cores from benign and cancerous prostate tissue of 4 different patients. Analyses presented here focused on the fibroblast and mural cell clusters, which each delineated further into 2 subclusters. One fibroblast subcluster showed strong similarity to published signatures of inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAF). A closely related but distinct fibroblast subcluster exhibited hallmarks of benign interstitial fibroblasts with enrichment of GO terms such as antigen processing and presentation. Based on expression signatures and spatial localization via immunohistochemistry, the 2 mural cell subclusters (MCAM+) were identified as vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) and dedifferentiated prostate SMCs\/myofibroblasts. Notably, the gene signature of this latter subcluster correlated with increasing Gleason score and decreased disease-specific survival. On the basis of scRNA-seq data from this and independent datasets, panels of subcluster-specific markers were selected for validation studies via FACS, multiplex immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time PCR. Thus far, immunohistochemical studies validated not only the <i>in vivo<\/i> presence of the 4 distinct cellular states but also revealed their distinct spatial localization. We will present molecular and functional data from these ongoing analyses in (i) immortalized fibroblast and smooth muscle cell lines, (ii) heterogeneous <i>ex vivo<\/i> outgrowth cultures of primary PCa fibroblasts\/myofibroblasts and (iii) primary cells from single cell suspensions of PCa biopsies enzymatically digested using an in-house approach optimized for maximal recovery of fibromuscular cells. These studies aim to evaluate the specificity, robustness and suitability of the chosen markers to delineate distinct tumor-relevant stromal cell subtypes enabling their functional contribution to PCa pathophysiology and clinical relevance to be assessed in future experiments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/376f25f0-9080-42ce-8e26-0171d92a698f\/@z03B8ZES\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Single cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12983"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Elisabeth Damisch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Brunner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sieghart Sopper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabel Heidegger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Pircher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georgios Fotakis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zlatko Trajanoski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Theresa Deichsler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georg Schäfer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Natalie Sampson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

As these studies lacked experimental testing of potential targets in high-quality cell models accurately reflecting individual tumor subtypes, it remains unclear whether any of the proposed targets retained value for precision medicine. The absence of clinically useful classifiers further hampered translation of proteogenomic information to better diagnose and treat cancer patients. In the case of the brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM), such challenges are exacerbated by tumor heterogeneity and broad therapeutic resistance. Here, we analyzed a large dataset of human GBM to determine the multi-omics features that characterize four GBM subtypes we recently identified through single cell RNAseq analysis. Each subtype exhibits activation of unique hallmark functional traits including distinct sensitivity to inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration for the mitochondrial subtype. The inspection of proteomics, phosphoproteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and acetylomics data revealed that each GBM subtype has a coherent molecular structure that drives the dominant function and can be extracted by each analytical platform. Stratification of tumors in four functional classes is not a specific attribute of GBM as we were able to unbiasedly identify the same subtypes in breast and lung cancer. To identify actionable targets in GBM we developed an unbiased protein kinase signaling network approach for the selection of master kinases aberrantly activated in each GBM subtype. The experimental follow-up using a library of annotated GBM patient derived organoids (PDOs) established that inhibition of DNA-PK with the clinically tested compound nedisertib radiosensitizes proliferative\/progenitor PDOs by exacerbating replication stress-induced DNA damage in this GBM subtype. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacological tools qualified PKC&#948; as vulnerable target for the broadly resistant glycolytic\/plurimetabolic GBM subtype. Thus, together with the targeting of mitochondrial GBM with OXPHOS inhibitors, the functional classification delivers experimentally validated actionable targets for three GBM subtypes. To provide rapid translation of the classifier for precision medicine in GBM, we developed a probabilistic classification tool which determines the probability that a patient&#8217;s GBM belongs to one of the four subtypes based on transcriptomic features and exhibits optimal performance when using RNA extracted from either frozen and paraffin embedded tissues. The algorithm is publicly accessible. It can be used in retrospective studies to evaluate the association of therapeutic response with GBM subtypes and as tool for selection criteria in prospective clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/acbd532b-6202-44c5-aacb-ead7aae3d403\/@z03B8ZES\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Multiomics,Targeted therapy,Kinases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12985"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Simona Migliozzi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Taek Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luciano Garofano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hasanain Mohammad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fulvio D'Angelo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan D.

It is difficult to identify those who will likely relapse, however, ES has a very high recurrence rate. Given these realities, the objective of this study was to determine factors influencing the prognosis of ES patients.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Clinical and genomic data of 99 patients with ES, were obtained from the cBioPortal. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and patient survival information were also obtained from the cBioPortal.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> In the data examined, ES had multiple primary sites of disease, including 16 femur, 10 hipbone, 10 rib, 10 tibia, 6 ischium pubis, 5 scapula, 4 fibula, 3 dorsal vertebra, 3 intra-abdominal, 3 lumbar vertebra, and 3 skull. A comparison of survival relationships between different primary sites of ES indicated that overall survival (OS) was significantly different between femur and dorsal vertebra (p = 0.023) and intra-abdominal and hipbone (p = 0.049). However, no significant difference was determined for TMB between the different primary sites. The median value of TMB was 0.23. Data were divided into two groups: high TMB (TMB-H,&#8805; 0.23 muts\/Mb) and low TMB (TMB-L, &#60; 0.23muts\/Mb). Interestingly, the OS of patients with TMB-L was significantly higher than that of patients with TMB-H (p = 0.049; 59.45 versus 42.00 months). The presence of metastases at the time of diagnosis was associated with poor OS ( p = 0.023;) and was a clinical factor associated with outcomes having statistical significance.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Given the heterogeneity in outcomes for patients with ES, additional prognostic factors are needed to optimize clinical decision making. Prognosis was different depending on primary site of ES. Patients with ES in hipbone displayed a better prognosis compared to that in abdomen. Similarly, patients with ES in dorsal vertebra had a significantly higher OS than that in femur. As such, the primary site should perhaps be considered during ES treatment, although there was no significant difference between TMB and primary site. Our results indicate that high TMB is associated with inferior survival for ES and may provide insights for clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12986"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jun-Qing Mao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>.

The molecular landscape of ccRCC has been elucidated by a number of next generation sequencing studies and complemented by recent global proteome and phosphoproteome results. However, a limitation of such studies is the mixture of signals from distinct cell populations, presenting challenges to subsequent interpretation. As a remedy, single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) is able to dissect distinct cell populations and map their differential expression patterns. Using snRNA-seq from 30 ccRCC tumor samples, we identified distinct genetic pathways associated with survival in the TCGA patient cohort (525 patients) in multiple cell types, including immune and stromal components. Prognostic value of pathways was confirmed in an independent cohort with 130 patients. Multiple cancer cell-specific pathways were related to metabolism, suggesting that certain metabolites are less abundant in high-risk tumors. Using data from two independent large-scale metabolism ccRCC studies, we found metabolites&#8217; levels changing in accordance with our predictions, when comparing low-risk to high-risk ccRCC tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/096a659d-dab3-4afb-b05e-8b8ec2565057\/@z03B8ZES\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12989"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ilya Strunilin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yige Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruiyang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wagma Caravan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Ding<\/i><\/presenter>.

While few patients show long-term response to the treatment, most suffer from rapid disease progression. Several studies revealed that genomic alterations, gene expression changes and altered HER2 signaling activity contribute to impaired therapy response. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this research project is to analyze differences between patients with long and short progression-free survival by utilizing combined genetic, histologic, clinical and gene expression data. We collected a retrospective German patient cohort (n=20) including patients with HER2 positive advanced GGEJ who received Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy. Using archival samples that were obtained prior to Trastuzumab treatment, we created a dataset including clinical information, histologic assessment, immunostaining, target amplicon sequencing (TAS; 409 gene panel) and human transcriptome data using the Affymetrix platform. To analyze the TAS sequencing data, we generated an automated analysis pipeline, which detects single nucleotide variants (SNV) and copy number alterations (CNA). Information about genomic alteration will be correlated with pathway and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) from the Affymetrix data. Furthermore, the data will be supported by investigating the functional status of HER2 in patient samples via electron microscopy. The results of this study could give insights on how genetic and transcriptomic alterations are connected to long-term Trastuzumab therapy response in HER2 positive GGEJ patients. This could potentially support therapy decision in personalized medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/700416c0-33cf-4dbf-b25c-ffcc4c3691fd\/@z03B8ZES\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,HER2,Therapy response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12990"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isabel Porth<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Weidner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvie Lorenzen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wilko Weichert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thorsten Oliver Götze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sven Perner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim Luley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela Hirsch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ralf-Dieter Hofheinz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana B.

Objective response rates (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated under double or single agent chemotherapy (CT), immunotherapy (ICI), CT-ICI, multityrosine kinase inhibitors (MTKi) and RET inhibitors (RETi). Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the start of first line therapy and compared between pts treated or not by RETi, after stratification by number of treatment lines.<br \/><i>Results:<\/i><b> <\/b>A total of 71 pts was included from 11 centers. Median age was 60 [IQR 47-69], 58% were female, 93% had adenocarcinoma, 2 pts (3%) had squamous and 2 (3%) neuroendocrine carcinoma, 38 (53.5%) were tobacco consumers (median 18.5 PY [7.8-31.3]), 50 (70%) had stage IV disease at diagnosis. Fusion partners were KIF5B (35\/49, 71%), CCDC6 (9\/49, 18%), others (5\/49, 10%). Median TMB was 2.76 [2.0-8.5], median PD-L1 5% [0-29]. The most frequent co-mutation was <i>TP53 <\/i>(18\/58 cases, 31%). Median number of metastatic sites was 2 [1-3], most commonly lung (48%), bone (45%), pleura (41%) and nodes (35%). Brain metastases were found in 18% of cases at diagnosis and in 31% at last follow-up or death. Table reports outcomes by treatment. mOS was 50.6 months [95%CI 37.6 - NR]. Fifty-two pts received 1st generation RETi. The use of RETi improved OS in pts treated with &#8804;2 lines of therapy (NR vs 17.8 months, p=0.024) and in those receiving &#62;2 lines (50.6 vs 12.7 months, p=0.0037).

Diffuse gliomas are the most frequent and devastating primary CNS tumors in adults. Standard treatment has limited efficacy and without exception these gliomas recur. The evolutionary processes that drive progression in glioma of the IDH-mutant astrocytoma subgroup, remain unclear. The GLASS-NL consortium was initiated to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma evolution and to identify markers of progression in IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Such markers can ultimately assist clinical decision making. Here, we present the results of genome wide DNA-methylation profiling of samples included in the GLASS-NL study.<br \/>METHODS. 110 adult patients were identified with an IDH-mutant, 1p19q non-codeleted, astrocytoma at first diagnosis. All patients underwent surgical resection of the tumor at least twice, separated by &#62;6 months with a median of 41.9 months (IQR:26.5-65.9). After surgical resection of the initial tumor, 63% and 22% of the patients were treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy respectively. DNA-methylation profiling was performed on 235 samples from 103 patients, using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Copy number alterations (CNAs) were extracted from these data. Methylation subclasses were determined according to Capper <i>et al.<\/i> (Nature, 2018). Overall survival (OS) was measured from date of initial surgery.<br \/>RESULTS. Of all primary tumors, 85 (87%) of the tumor samples were assigned to the A_IDH (&#8216;low grade&#8217;) methylation subclass and 10 (10%) to the A_IDH_HG (&#8216;high grade&#8217;) subclass. The relative proportion of high grade tumors increased ~three-fold at tumor recurrence (32\/101, 32%) and even further in the second recurrence (15\/29, 52%). The high grade subclass of the recurrent, but not the initial tumor sample, was negatively associated with OS (p &#60; 0.0001). The overall DNA-methylation levels of recurrent samples were lower than that of initial samples. This difference is explained by the increased number of high grade samples at recurrence, since near identical DNA-methylation levels were observed in samples that remained low grade. Analysis of CNAs revealed several chromosomal arms and bands that were more frequently altered in samples of the high grade methylation subclass compared to low grade. In addition, gains and losses of specific genes, such as homozygous deletion (HD) of CDKN2A\/B, were more frequent in high grade samples. Overall DNA-methylation levels of recurrent samples with CDKN2A\/B HD were lower than that of samples without this deletion. However, CDKN2A\/B HD alone does not fully explain DNA-demethylation at malignant progression and other molecular aberrations are likely to contribute as well.<br \/>CONCLUSION. Longitudinal methylation profiling analysis of IDH-mutant astrocytoma reveals a shift towards a higher grade at tumor recurrence coinciding with reduced genome-wide DNA-methylation levels.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5985136f-f0c4-4f2b-8079-9edf15fd581c\/@z03B8ZES\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Astrocytoma,DNA methylation,Molecular profiling,Copy number alterations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21435"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wies Rijan Vallentgoed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anneke Niers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karin Van Garderen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Van den Bent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik Van Dijk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaspar Draaisma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Van Eijk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris De Heer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathilde Kouwenhoven<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johan Kros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendy De Leng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivonne Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre Robe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marion Smits<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mircea Tesileanu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hinke Van Thuijl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roel Verhaak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bart Westerman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Van de Wiel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bauke Ylstra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pieter Wesseling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pim French<\/i><\/presenter>.
