[{"Abstract":"Background: Abemaciclib (A) activity against breast cancer as monotherapy or combined with endocrine therapy warrants further investigations in other cancer types. However, its significant toxicity profile illustrates the challenge of defining more precisely the patients unlikely to benefit from it, sparing them from useless toxicities. FDG-PET\/CT can identify treatment-refractory disease with high negative predictive value, soon after the treatment onset and before morphological changes are observed. MiMe-A was built on the assumption that a therapy that does not induce tumoral metabolic changes 14 days after its onset is unlikely to achieve a significant clinical benefit.<br \/>Methods: A multicenter phase II basket trial assessed the efficacy of A in 5 cancers types (cholangiocarcinoma, endometrial, urothelial carcinomas, oesophagal adeno- and squamous cell carcinomas). The primary endpoint is the &#8216;treatment success&#8217;, defined as metabolic response according to PERCIST at FDG-PET\/CT performed during the first cycle (D14) and absence of disease progression per RECIST 1.1 after two cycles of A. A Simon&#8217;s 2-stage design was used in each cohort based on the null hypothesis that the treatment success rate will be &#8804;20%. An interim analysis for futility was performed on each cohort after accrual of 17 patients during the first stage.<br \/>Results: The baseline characteristics and the metabolic and morphologic evaluation of eligible patients are shown below.<br \/>*: stop treatment before the two months (due to progression or toxicities) IQR: interquartile range, PR: partial response, SD: stable disease, PD: progressive disease<br \/>The treatment success rate was 0% for each cancer type except for urothelial carcinoma (5,9% (1\/17 treatment success). Toxicities were mainly graded 1 or 2, including diarrhea, nausea, fatigue and haematological.<br \/>Conclusion: A did not show significant anti-tumour activity in any of the five cohorts. But early metabolic response was noted in 29% of the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma population, this finding did not translate in disease control at two months. This could be explained by an initial response rapidly followed by tumoral escape. A combination of A with other drugs should be explored in this cancer type.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\"

Exercise, optimized to benefit physiological responses, can be an effective strategy to reduce systemic inflammation. The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of a 16-week circuit, interval-based exercise training program on proinflammatory cytokines in cancer survivors who are obese and sedentary.<br \/>Methods: This study was a single center, pilot randomized controlled trial in 90 survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers who were sedentary (&#60;60 mins of exercise per week) and overweight\/obese (body mass index &#62; 25.0 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>). Participants were randomly assigned to either the exercise group (n=60) or the usual care group (n=30). The exercise intervention was moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic (65-85% of VO<sub>2max<\/sub>) and resistance (65-85% of 1-repetition maximum) exercise training in a supervised, circuit, interval-based format performed thrice-weekly for 16 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and post-intervention to measure serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), and high-sensitive c-reactive protein (hsCRP). Paired t-test and repeated measure ANOVA were used to determine the between-group differences.<br \/>Results: Participants were aged 63.2&#177;10.8 years and diagnosed with breast (35%), prostate (30%), and colorectal (35%) cancers. 55% were female and mean BMI was 34.7&#177;5.9. 75% completed chemotherapy and\/or radiation therapy. Retention and adherence rates to the exercise intervention was high (100% and 92%, respectively). Compared to usual care, circuit, interval-based exercise significantly reduced IL-6 (between group mean difference, -1.2 pg\/mL; p&#60;0.001), IL-8 (-2.4; p&#60;0.001), TNF-&#945; (-1.9 pg\/mg; p&#60;0.001), and hsCRP (-0.8 mg\/L; p=0.02).<br \/>Conclusions: A 16-week circuit, interval-based<b> <\/b>aerobic and resistance exercise training program induced a reduction in systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines among sedentary and obese breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors. Our findings suggest that combined aerobic and resistance exercise may be an effective strategy to offset elevated systemic inflammation associated with obesity and sedentary behavior in cancer survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/512c9c98-e3aa-4c5b-8b9f-2d0b5f73c89f\/@v03B8ZYu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exercise,Inflammation,Biomarkers,Obesity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20270"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dong-Woo Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cami N.

Cerala, a selective oral ATR inhibitor, has shown synergistic preclinical activity with a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) in <i>TP53<\/i>- and <i>ATM<\/i>-defective CLL cells (Kwok et al. <i>Blood<\/i>. 2016;127:582-95). Acala is a selective, irreversible BTKi approved for CLL. This phase 1\/2 proof-of-concept study investigated cerala alone and in combination with acala in high-risk R\/R CLL.<br \/>Methods: This multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study (NCT03328273) enrolled adults with high-risk R\/R CLL per iwCLL criteria and ECOG performance status &#8804;2. In Arm A, pts with <i>TP53<\/i> mutation, del(17p), or del(11q) having exhausted available treatment options received cerala monotherapy (cohort 1: 160 mg BID continuously; cohort 2 [after &#8805;2 DLTs in cohort 1]: 160 mg BID 2 wk on\/2 wk off). In Arm B, pts with del(11q) suitable for BTKi and cerala treatment per investigator judgment received acala 100 mg BID continuously alone for cycle 1 and acala 100 mg BID continuously + cerala 160 mg BID 1 wk on\/3 wk off from cycle 2 onward. Primary objectives: safety and pharmacokinetics (PK). Secondary objective: activity&#8212;overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Pharmacodynamic changes were explored using novel multiple reaction monitoring-targeted mass spectrometry.<br \/>Results: Eleven pts were treated (median age 64 y; median prior therapy lines 3). Pts in Arm A (n=8 [7 received prior BTKi]: cohort 1 n=5; cohort 2 n=3) received cerala for a median of 3.5 mo (range 0.5-7.7). Grade (G) &#8805;3 AEs in &#62;1 pt were anemia (75%),<br \/>thrombocytopenia (63%), and neutropenia (25%); 4 DLTs of G4 thrombocytopenia were reported (3 in 2 pts in cohort 1; 1 in 1 pt in cohort 2). No responses were observed in Arm A. At a median follow-up of 15.1 mo, median PFS was 3.8 mo (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-4.6); median OS was 16.9 mo (95% CI 6.6-not reached [NR]). All pts had baseline telomeres within a &#8220;fusogenic&#8221; range (negative prognostic indicator).In Arm B (n=3; all BTKi-naive), 2 pts received acala + cerala and 1 received acala only. Median (range) treatment duration was 7.2 mo (4.9-9.5) for cerala and 15.9 mo (9.7-18.4) for acala. No G&#8805;3 AEs or DLTs were reported. ORR was 100% (all partial responses); median DOR was NR. At a median follow-up of 15.9 mo, median PFS and OS were NR. PK of acala and cerala were consistent with historical data, with no drug-drug interactions when combined; cerala did not affect BTK occupancy.<br \/>Conclusions: Cerala monotherapy in BTKi-exposed, high-risk CLL pts showed limited clinical benefit. Acala + cerala was tolerable with preliminary clinical activity in pts with CLL and del(11q). The study terminated due to the evolving treatment landscape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/df262bc3-1493-423d-97ab-3f7c1c1aa943\/@v03B8ZYu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,BTK,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20271"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wojciech Jurczak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nagah Elmusharaf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher P.

The phase 2, multi-arm, signal-searching BALTIC study (NCT02937818) assessed novel treatment combinations in platinum-refractory\/resistant ES-SCLC; we report efficacy, safety, and exploratory ctDNA and PD-L1 analyses from pts who received D + T in Arm A.<br \/>Methods: Eligible pts had ES-SCLC, progressive disease (PD) during or within 90 days of completing 1L platinum-based CT, WHO PS 0-1, and life expectancy &#8805;8 weeks. In Arm A, pts received D 1500 mg + T 75 mg q4w for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance D 1500 mg q4w until PD. The primary endpoint was ORR (investigator assessment, RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints included DCR, PFS, OS, and safety and tolerability. Prespecified exploratory analyses included assessment of baseline\/on-treatment ctDNA levels measured by maximum variant allele frequency (MaxVAF), and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (TC) and immune cells (IC) (VENTANA PD-L1 [SP263] Assay).<br \/>Results: 41 pts received treatment with D + T (median age 63 years; 76% male; 76% PS 1). At the data cut-off (DCO; Jun 22, 2020), median treatment duration was 12 weeks, with 3 pts ongoing D treatment (these pts had received &#8805;38, &#8805;21, and &#8805;19 doses of D, respectively, at DCO). Confirmed ORR was 7.3% (95% CI 1.54&#8210;19.92; 3 partial responses [PR]). DCR at 12 weeks was 27%. 21 pts (51%) were PD-L1 evaluable. Of 12 pts with PD-L1 expression (TC or IC) &#8805;1%, 3 (25%) had a best response of PR or stable disease, compared with 1 (11%) of 9 pts with PD-L1 (TC or IC) &#60;1%. Median PFS was 1.84 mo (95% CI 1.77&#8210;1.91) and median OS was 5.36 mo (95% CI 2.89&#8210;7.23). Grade 3\/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 8 pts (20%); TRAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 5 pts (12%) and death in 1 pt (hemorrhagic enterocolitis). 26 pts (63%) were evaluable for ctDNA at baseline, and 10 pts (24%) had on-treatment ctDNA data. Pts with baseline MaxVAF in low (n=9), medium (n=8), and high (n=9) tertiles had a median OS of 12.8, 4.5, and 2.3 mo, respectively. Pts with a decrease in on-treatment ctDNA level (delta MaxVAF &#60;0) had a longer median OS (12.0 mo) vs those with an increase (5.6 mo).<br \/>Conclusions: Although limited antitumor activity was observed in refractory\/resistant ES-SCLC in BALTIC, association of lower baseline ctDNA levels (MaxVAF) with longer OS may reflect the prognostic effect of disease burden. Association of on-treatment reduction in ctDNA level with longer OS suggests potential use of ctDNA as a surrogate of treatment response in ES-SCLC. Further analyses in larger datasets and in a randomized setting are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f77571dc-a982-4d79-aefe-eb8671967c61\/@v03B8ZYu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Durvalumab,Tremelimumab,BALTIC,ES-SCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20272"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"bbc20a38-2b10-4c5b-9491-aa9aacb12512","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bbc20a38-2b10-4c5b-9491-aa9aacb12512\/@v03B8ZYu\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Niels Reinmuth<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oscar Juan-Vidal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zsolt Horváth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dariusz Kowalski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Kryzhanivska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eszter Csánky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriella Gálffy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maciej Bryl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Vicente<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ihor Vynnychenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zsolt Pápai-Székely<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon Armstrong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tapashi Dalvi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yashaswi Shrestha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingchao Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiyi Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Bondarenko<\/i><\/presenter>.

Very recently, CXCL9 was identified as the strongest contributor to the &#8220;inflammatory clock of aging&#8221;, linked to age-related chronic inflammation. Due to the critical role of magnesium (Mg) in regulating inflammatory responses, this study aims to investigate the effect of Mg treatment on DNA methylation changes in CXCL9.<br \/>Methods: The Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial conducted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center was a double-blind 2 &#215; 2 factorial randomized controlled trial of 240 participants who completed the study. Participants aged from 40 to 85 years, had a daily calcium intake 700-2000 mg and calcium:magnesium intake ratio &#8805;2.6 based on the average of the two baseline 24-hour dietary recalls.<br \/>Results: Among three CpG sites, a 12-week personalized dose of Mg supplementation marginally increased the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine methylation, a measure of active demethylation, at CpG site 04038163 (3'UTR of <i>CXCL9<\/i> gene) by 7.0% compared to the placebo group (p=0.07). Although the overall effect was not significant or of borderline significance, Mg treatment significantly reduced the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine by 3.7% at the CpG site 12793812 (body of CXCL9 gene) among those with aged 60 years or above (p=0.03).<br \/>Conclusions: These findings indicate that Mg treatment modified the demethylation process in the CXCL9 gene, a critical regulator of immune responses and inflammation.

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) often induce immune-related adverse events and despite high response rates many patients still progress. Nivolumab combined with a peptide vaccine designed to engage and activate IDO- and PD-L1 specific T cells is a promising approach for treating advanced melanoma without inducing the amount of toxicity observed in combination ICI treatment.<br \/>Methods: In an investigator-initiated phase I\/II study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03047928) anti-PD-1 naive stage IV melanoma patients received a maximum of 15 IDO\/PD-L1 peptide vaccine<sup> <\/sup>[1] doses SC (6x q2w followed by 9x q4w). Nivolumab (3 mg\/kg) was administered every second week (q2w) for a maximum of two years. Clinical efficacy, toxicity, and survival data were evaluated<sup> <\/sup>[2]. Responses were assessed according to RECIST 1.1.<br \/>Results: Here we present the updated efficacy data and subgroup analyses. As of data cut-off, December 1, 2021, all 30 patients were evaluated after completing the IDO\/PD-L1 vaccination schedule in combination with nivolumab. The overall response rate (ORR) was 80% (n=24) with 46.7% (n=14) of patients obtaining complete responses (CR). After a median follow-up of 2.7 years, the median progression free survival (mPFS) was 25.3 months and median overall survival (mOS) was not reached. The three-year survival probability is 73%. A subgroup analysis showed that in PD-L1+ patients, RR was 94.1% with mPFS: 30.9 months. In PD-L1- patients RR was 61.5%, with mPFS: 7.2 months. Furthermore, in poor prognosis patients with elevated baseline LDH-levels, the RR was 81.8%, with mPFS: 30.9 months. In patients with non-elevated baseline LDH-levels, the RR was 78.9%, with mPFS: 19.3 months. Finally, in patients classified as M1c at baseline RR was 88.2%, with mPFS: 25.6 months, and patients classified as M1a or M1b at baseline had RR: 69.2% with mPFS: 14.8 months. The immune-related adverse events were comparable to patients receiving Nivolumab monotherapy and no additional toxicity was observed in poor prognosis patients.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination of an PD-L1\/IDO peptide vaccine and nivolumab is an effective treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. The clinical efficacy- and survival data are very encouraging with ORR of 80% of which 46.7% were CR. After a median follow-up of 32 months, the mPFS was 25.3 months which is twice the expected for patients receiving standard treatment of care. Importantly, we report that patients with unfavorable prognostic baseline characteristics at inclusion obtain impressive response rates and durable responses without additional toxicity. <sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>1 <\/sup>IO Biotech (www.iobiotech.com) has licensed the patent of the vaccine IO102\/IO103 T-win&#174; <sup>2<\/sup>Results are reported in Nature Medicine, December, 2021","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/502c5258-b6e5-46fb-8623-8dba71181f99\/@w03B8ZYv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Peptides,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20274"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Julie W.

We report updated outcomes, with interim analyses from a confirmatory cohort.<br \/>Methods: In the Phase II VISION study, pts with advanced\/metastatic<i> MET<\/i>ex14 skipping NSCLC, identified by liquid (L+) and\/or tissue (T+) biopsy, received 500 mg (450 mg active moiety) tepotinib once daily. All pts were assessed for safety; pts with &#8805;3 months&#8217; follow-up were assessed for efficacy. Primary endpoint was objective response by independent review (RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints were disease control (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.<br \/>Results: As of Feb 1, 2021, 7,882 pts were pre-screened, and 275 pts were analyzed for efficacy. Patients analyzed for efficacy had a median age of 72.4 years (range, 41-94]), 50.9% were female, 46.5% had smoking history, and median tumor load [target lesions by IRC] was 57.4 mm [range, 10.2-227.8]). Tumor load in L+ pts was 68.0 mm (11.6-227.8) and 52.9 mm (10.2-227.8) in T+ pts.<br \/>In treatment-na&#239;ve pts (n=137), ORR was 54.0% (95% CI: 45.3, 62.6), DCR was 74.5% (66.3, 81.5), and &#62;90% of pts had tumor shrinkage. Median (m) DOR was 32.7 months (9.0, not estimable), mPFS was 10.4 months (8.4, 15.3), and mOS was 17.6 months (13.4, 29.7).<br \/>In previously treated pts (n=138), ORR was 44.2% (35.8, 52.9), DCR was 75.4% (67.3, 82.3), and &#62;90% of pts had tumor shrinkage. mDOR was 11.1 months (8.4, 18.5), mPFS was 11.0 months (8.2, 12.4), and mOS was 19.9 months (15.8, 22.3). Meaningful clinical activity was observed in L+ and T+ pts (Table).<br \/>Overall, 14.1% of pts discontinued due to TRAEs; tepotinib was well-tolerated across treatment lines (Table).<br \/>Conclusions: Tepotinib demonstrated robust and durable clinical activity across treatment lines in pts with <i>MET<\/i>ex14 skipping NSCLC, with particularly durable efficacy in first line. TRAEs were manageable with few discontinuations.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{5C298CFD-51FD-4059-8891-A53EABDD67FA}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td

Gilteritinib is the first FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor approved as monotherapy in FLT3-mutated relapsed\/refractory AML. The aim of the study was to compare relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with FLT3\/internal tandem duplication AML in first complete remission who received gilteritinib or placebo.<br \/>Method: In this phase 2, double-blind trial, patients were randomized 2:1 to gilteritinib (120 mg) or placebo once daily for up to 2 years, beginning after completion of induction\/consolidation (I\/C) therapy. RFS, defined as time from randomization date until the date of documented relapse or death from any cause was assessed via independent review committee adjudication (primary efficacy endpoint). Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization until date of death from any cause. Survival and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed 30 days after treatment discontinuation, and every 3 months thereafter. Due to a slow accrual rate, this trial (NCT02927262) was changed from a planned phase 3 to phase 2 based on the reduction in sample size.<br \/>Results: 124 patients were screened and 98 were randomized (gilteritinib 63, placebo 35) and are included in the full analysis set (FAS), of whom 32 (gilteritinib 20, placebo 12) completed 2 years of treatment. The safety analysis set (SAF) comprised 97 patients (gilteritinib 62, placebo 35) who had received &#8805;1 dose of study drug. In the FAS, relapse occurred in 31\/63 (49.2%) gilteritinib- and 20\/35 (57.1%) placebo-treated patients; 3\/63 (4.8%) gilteritinib-treated patients died without relapse. RFS was not significantly improved with gilteritinib vs placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.738, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.407-1.336; 1-sided stratified log-rank p-value 0.163). Median RFS was 24.02 months for gilteritinib and 15.84 months for placebo. OS in the FAS was not significantly different between treatments (gilteritinib 21\/63, [33.3%], placebo 11\/35 [31.4%]; HR 1.130, 95% CI 0.540-2.364; 1-sided stratified log-rank p-value 0.627). Median OS was not reached in either arm. TEAEs in the SAF occurred in 58\/62 (93.5%) gilteritinib- and 33\/35 (94.3%) placebo-treated patients including, respectively, 51\/62 (82.3%) and 20\/35 (57.1%) drug-related TEAEs and 10\/62 (16.1%) and 3\/35 (8.6%) serious drug-related TEAEs. The most common TEAEs were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (gilteritinib 18\/62 [29.0%], placebo 1\/35 [2.9%]) and thrombocytopenia (gilteritinib 12\/62 [19.4%], placebo 4\/35 [11.4%]).<br \/>Conclusion: Gilteritinib showed improved RFS versus placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. There were no new safety findings in the gilteritinib arm.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73652d13-a30c-4ed1-ae8a-fcceee76bee0\/@w03B8ZYv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,FLT3,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20276"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mark D.

Here we report final analyses from INSIGHT (data cut-off: September 3, 2021; median follow-up: 57.5 months).<br \/>Methods: Patients with <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant (T790M-negative) NSCLC and anti-EGFR resistance, with <i>MET<\/i> gene copy number (GCN) &#8805;5 and\/or <i>MET<\/i>:<i>CEP7 <\/i>&#8805;2 by FISH and\/or MET IHC 2+\/3+, were randomized to tepotinib 500 mg (450 mg active moiety) + gefitinib 250 mg QD or CTX. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per investigator. Preplanned analyses evaluated patients with <i>MET <\/i>amplification.<br \/>Results: In the 19\/55 randomized patients (34.5%) with <i>MET <\/i>amplification (GCN &#8805;5, n=18; <i>MET<\/i>:<i>CEP7<\/i> &#8805;2, n=13; MET IHC 3+, n=17), median age was 60.4 years, 68.4% were never-smokers, and prior EGFR inhibitors were gefitinib (57.9%), afatinib (21.1%), erlotinib (10.5%) and icotinib (10.5%). Median duration of tepotinib + gefitinib was 11.3 months (range: 1.1-56.5), with treatment duration &#62;1 year in 6 patients (31.6%) and &#62;4 years in 3 patients (15.8%). Two patients continued treatment outside the study.<br \/>Tepotinib + gefitinib improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04, 0.43), overall survival (HR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02, 0.36), objective response rate and duration of response vs CTX (Table). Treatment-related Grade &#8805;3 AEs occurred in 7 patients (58.3%) with tepotinib + gefitinib and 5 (71.4%) with CTX. Most common post-study therapies were kinase inhibitors (n=2 in the tepotinib + gefitinib arm; n=3 in the CTX arm).<br \/>In patients with MET IHC 3+ (n=34; including 17 patients with <i>MET <\/i>amplification), tepotinib + gefitinib also markedly improved PFS (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.17, 0.74) and OS (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.23, 0.84) vs CTX.<br \/>Conclusions: Tepotinib + gefitinib greatly improved PFS and OS vs CTX in patients with <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant NSCLC with <i>MET <\/i>amplification.

In the ongoing phase 2 INCB 50465-201 trial (NCT02718300), add on parsaclisib (potent, highly selective PI3K&#948; inhibitor) is showing preliminary efficacy in MF pts with suboptimal ruxolitinib response. JAK inhibitors (eg, ruxolitinib), are associated with thrombocytopenia; therefore, pts with low PC are commonly more difficult to treat. We present a subgroup analysis of efficacy and safety data from INCB 50465-201 by baseline PC.<br \/>Methods: Eligible adults had primary\/secondary MF with suboptimal response (palpable spleen &#62;10 cm below left subcostal margin [LSM]; or palpable spleen 5-10 cm below LSM and active symptoms) after &#8805;6 months of ruxolitinib monotherapy (5-25 mg BID; stable dose &#8805;8 wks). Pts remained on their last stable ruxolitinib dose and received add on parsaclisib (10 or 20 mg QD for 8 wks; same dose QW thereafter) or parsaclisib (5 or 20 mg QD for 8 wks; 5 mg QD thereafter). For this analysis, spleen volume (SV), total symptom score (TSS) assessed by Myelofibrosis-Symptoms Assessment Form (MFSAF) v3.0 daily diary, and safety, were evaluated by baseline PC (low PC, 50-&#60;100&#215;10<sup>9<\/sup>\/L; higher PC, &#8805;100&#215;10<sup>9<\/sup>\/L).<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (8\/27\/2020), 67 pts were enrolled (low PC, n=21; higher PC, n=46; median age 68 y). For low vs higher PC, median prior duration of ruxolitinib use was 34.7 vs 14.9 months; baseline symptoms were worse for low PC vs higher PC (median [range] MFSAF-TSS, 21.4 [0.6-47] vs 10 [0-43]). For low vs higher PC, 9\/18 (50.0%) vs 15\/38 (39.4%) pts had SV reduction (SVR) &#8805;10% at wk 12; percentages of pts with SVR &#8805;10% were similar at wk 24 (6\/17 [35.2%] vs 13\/35 [37.1%]); 0 vs 1 pt had SVR &#8805;35% at wk 12; 2 vs 1 pt had SVR &#8805;35% at wk 24. Of pts with &#8805;10% SVR at wk 24, 4\/6 with low PC and 9\/13 with higher PC were on all daily dosing regimens. For low vs higher PC, median (range) percentage change in MFSAF-TSS was &#8722;20.5 (&#8722;56.6 to +17.1) vs &#8722;22.2 (&#8722;100 to +500) at wk 12; &#8722;26.1 (&#8722;54.7 to +2.4) vs &#8722;23.1 (&#8722;91.3 to +222.5) at wk 24. In both subgroups, nonhematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly grade 1\/2. Most common (&#8805;20%) TEAEs were dyspnea (33%), falls (33%), peripheral edema (29%), and nasal congestion (24%) for low PC; diarrhea (28%), nausea (24%), abdominal pain (24%), cough (20%), and fatigue (20%) for higher PC. For low vs higher PC, 9\/21 (43%) vs 3\/46 (7%) pts had parsaclisib dose interruption due to thrombocytopenia; 1 pt with low PC had ruxolitinib interruption due to thrombocytopenia.<br \/>Conclusion: Add-on parsaclisib showed efficacy in pts from both low and higher baseline PC groups. Given the acceptable safety profile and efficacy of add-on parsaclasib, MF pts with both low and higher PC may be able to benefit from parsaclisib-ruxolitinib combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/11851478-9e97-403b-b427-64ef75c41066\/@w03B8ZYv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20280"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3e36e14e-94ca-4690-86de-75296baac1e4","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e36e14e-94ca-4690-86de-75296baac1e4\/@w03B8ZYv\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Abdulraheem Yacoub<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uma Borate<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raajit Rampal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haris Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunice Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Gerds<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriela Hobbs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Kremyanskaya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elliott Winton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Casey O’Connell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swati Goel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gary Schiller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albert Assad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sue Erickson-Viitanen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naval Daver<\/i><\/presenter>.

The reports of immunotherapy combined with HER2-targeted therapy are limited. KN046 is a novel bispecific antibody that blocks both PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 and CTLA4 interaction with CD80\/CD86. KN026 is a novel bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds to two distinct HER2 epitopes. Here the preliminary safety and efficacy results of KN046 in combination KN026 were reported in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic other solid tumors who received &#8805; 1 line prior systemic therapy.<br \/>Methods: HER2-positive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic other solid tumors with progression after &#8805; 1 line of prior systemic therapy were recruited, including 14 CRC patients, 4 NSCLC patients, 4 gallbladder cancer patients, 1 renal pelvis cancer patient and 1 pancreatic cancer patient. These patients were by KN046 (iv. 5 mg\/kg Q3W) plus KN026 (iv. 30 mg\/kg Q3W, loading on C1D1, D8) until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Efficacy was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 Q6W. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR).<br \/>Results: As of the August 10th, 2021, 24 non-breast or non-gastric cancer patients with the median age of 56 years (range: 37-66) were enrolled. 20 and 24 patients were evaluable for overall response and safety, respectively. The ORR was 55.0% (11 of 20, 95% CI: 31.5-76.9). And the disease control rate (DCR) was 85.0% (17 of 20, 95% CI 62.1-96.8). The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 84.1%. 11 CRC patients were evaluable for overall response. The ORR and DCR in CRC was 45.5% (5 of 11, 95% CI: 16.7-76.6) and 90.9% (10 of 11, 95% CI 58.7-99.8), respectively. Twenty of total 24(87.9%) patients suffered from treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade. Total 4 of 24 (16.7%) patients had experienced &#8805;grade 3 TRAEs, including 4 cases related to KN046 and 3 cases related to KN026. The most common (&#8805;10%) TRAEs were infusion related reaction (29.2%), diarrhea (19.4%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16.7%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (16.7%), vomiting(12.5%) and decreased appetite (12.5%). No treatment-related deaths were observed.<br \/>Conclusion: This chemotherapy-free regimen of KN046 in combination with KN026 has shown promising clinical efficacy and manageable toxicity in HER2-positive non-breast and non-gastric solid tumors with &#8805; 1 line prior systemic therapy.<br \/>The trial is currently ongoing.

The primary outcome was the major pathological response (MPR). Biopsies and plasma before and after neoadjuvant therapy were analyzed for whole-exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, PD-L1 expression and 92 proteins using proximity extension assay technology.<br \/>Results: After neoadjuvant therapy, 26 patients (48.15%) achieved MPR, 16 (29.63%) achieved pCR. 18.3% of the patients experienced grade &#8805;3 AEs. Compared to patients PD-L1-low, patients with PD-L1-high had a significant higher ratio of PR. During therapy, TMB and TNB were significantly decreased in PR patients, and the ratio of gained and increased clones were significantly lower in MPR patients than nonMPR patients, while the lost and decreased clones were significantly higher in MPR patients than nonMPR patients. Transcriptome analyses before and during therapy revealed CD8 and CD4 T cells were increased in all patients, however, the exhausted cells, nTreg and iTreg were significantly increased in nonMPR patients. Proteins analyses revealed the levels of TRAIL and MUC16 were significantly increased in MPR and PR patients, respectively, while the levels of IFN-&#947; and IL18 were significantly decreased in MPR and PR patients, respectively. And the expression of ADA, ARG1, CD83, TNFRSF4 and VEGFR2 in plasma were found to be related with serious adverse events.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, neoadjuvant therapy with toripalimab, nab-paclitaxel and S-1 was well tolerated and showed promising antitumor activity in patients with resectable ESCC, and the changes of genomic, transcriptome, PD-L1 expression and proteins in plasma were comprehensively analyzed and correlated with clinical outcomes, which provided insight into the mechanism of action of Toripalimab combined with nab-Paclitaxel and S-1 in ESCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a441a4d0-d631-4e19-b293-9eaedbc39774\/@x03B8ZYw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,Chemotherapy,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20283"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Guoqing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Chaohu Pan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qing Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoli Cui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minglu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhigang Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liangliang Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongfang Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haitao Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunchang Jiao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Gene fusions arise from inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements involving the 3&#8217; region of the <i>NTRK <\/i>gene and the 5&#8217; end of a fusion partner gene, leading to the expression of a constitutively active tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion protein. Larotrectinib is a highly selective and central nervous system (CNS)-active TRK inhibitor approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion cancer. Larotrectinib has previously demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 75% in 206 patients with non-primary CNS solid tumors (Hong et al, ASCO 2021). Here, we report on the TRK fusion exon junction organization in patients with TRK fusion cancer receiving larotrectinib.<br \/>Methods: Patients with non-primary CNS TRK fusion cancer treated with larotrectinib were identified from three clinical trials (NCT02122913, NCT02576431, and NCT02637687). <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusion data were determined by local molecular testing. The testing method, <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions, and exon structure were extracted from the molecular pathology reports from 212 patients. The data cut-off was July 20, 2020.<br \/>Results: TRK fusion exon junction data were available for 80 patients from 14 different tumor types. Median age was 47 years (range 0.5-84 years). The ORR for these patients was 82.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 72.4-90.1). Patients had gene fusions involving <i>NTRK1<\/i> (40%), <i>NTRK2<\/i> (4%), or <i>NTRK3<\/i> (56%), a pattern similar to that seen in the larger dataset.<i> <\/i>We detected 20 different <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions; the most common were <i>ETV6-NTRK3<\/i>,<i> TPM3-NTRK1<\/i>,<i> <\/i>and<i> LMNA-NTRK1<\/i> detected in 39 (49%), ten (13%), and seven (9%) patients, respectively. There were 12, three, and five different fusion partners associated with <i>NTRK1<\/i>, <i>NTRK2<\/i>, and <i>NTRK3<\/i>, respectively. The majority (12\/20; 60%) of fusions were intrachromosomal rearrangement events: 8\/12 (67%) related to <i>NTRK1<\/i>, 2\/3 (67%) related to <i>NTRK2<\/i>,<i> <\/i>and 2\/5 (40%) related to<i> NTRK3<\/i>. There were 35 different 5&#8217;\/3&#8217; gene breakpoint combinations: 3&#8217; fusion points were located at <i>NTRK1 <\/i>exon 8 (n = 2), <i>NTRK1<\/i> exon 9 (n = 5), <i>NTRK1<\/i> exon 10 (n = 15), <i>NTRK1<\/i> exon 11 (n = 6), <i>NTRK1<\/i> exon 12 (n = 3), <i>NTRK1<\/i> exon 13 (n = 1), <i>NTRK2<\/i> exon 15 (n = 2), <i>NTRK2<\/i> exon 16 (n = 1), <i>NTRK3<\/i> exon 14 (n = 21), and <i>NTRK3<\/i> exon 15 (n = 24). For <i>ETV6-NTRK3<\/i> fusions, the <i>NTRK3<\/i> fusion point was at exon 14 in ten of 11 thyroid carcinomas, but in only three of 13 salivary gland tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Among 80 patients with TRK fusion cancer, we detected 20 different <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions, of which 55% occurred in only one patient each. There were 36 different fusion variants. Despite the variability of the fusion structure, larotrectinib was equally efficacious. The large number of potential different fusion partners and involvement of various breakpoints highlight the need for validated and appropriate testing methodologies that are agnostic of 5&#8217; partners and breakpoints.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a3fc4f0e-02a3-4f76-80ee-62d51af222f8\/@x03B8ZYw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene fusion,Larotrectinib,TRK fusion cancer,NTRK gene fusion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20284"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"1b5a1686-9dd1-4476-960d-96ad07b3e84c","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b5a1686-9dd1-4476-960d-96ad07b3e84c\/@x03B8ZYw\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marc Ladanyi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sinchita Roy-Chowdhuri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Ritterhouse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Sahm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ricarda Norenberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kui Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Fellous<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicoletta Brega<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cornelis M.

Adding treatment with AV-GBM-1, a personal vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with autologous tumor antigens (ATA) may improve survival. AV-GBM-1 is produced by incubating ATA with autologous DC. ATA are from a lysate of irradiated autologous GBM cells that were self-renewing in serum-free medium with factors that favor survival and proliferation of tumor initiating cells, i.e., stem cells and early progenitor cells. After recovery from RT\/TMZ, GBM patients were injected subcutaneously with AV-GBM-1 admixed in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. This study examined changes in plasma proteomics before and after injections of AV-GBM-1. 57 patients were treated during November 2018 to October 2020. Median progression-free and overall survival were 10.3 and 16.0 months respectively. Plasma samples obtained at baseline (week-0), and just prior to the third injection (week-2) were cryopreserved and subsequently analyzed for 448 proteomic markers using quantitative, multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Raybiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA.). 54 patients had a baseline week-0 sample prior to the 1<sup>st<\/sup> vaccination; 50 had a week-2 sample just prior to the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> dose; 49 had paired samples for both time-points. The averages of paired samples were measured for all patients and for cohorts defined by median survival that were compared by 2-tail T-Tests. After two weekly injections there were significant (p&#60;0.01) increases in thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC, CCL17), chemerin, lipocalin-2 and angiopoietin, and decreases in thrombospondin-5, angiotensinogen, and beta-fibroblast growth factor. The changes in TARC are due to GM-CSF. 25 patients survived more than 15 months and 24 less than 15 months. Prognostic baseline markers associated with longer survival were higher CD14 (p=0.009), higher tissue-inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1), and higher insulin growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) 1 and 2 (p&#60;0.02). The only markers that appeared predictive for survival (p&#60;0.05) based on changes from baseline to week-2 were increased lipocalin-2, associated with longer survival (p=0.0369), and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) associated with shorter survival (p=0.0186). Because of the large number of analyses, these results are considered hypothesis generating and not definitive.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6aa2b342-1d40-4863-a352-38bdee7bec07\/@x03B8ZYw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Vaccines,Proteomic analysis,Dendritic cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21477"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Daniela A.
