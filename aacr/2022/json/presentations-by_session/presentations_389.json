[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> The mechanism of action of primary resistance to PD-1 blockade is largely unknown, however STK11\/LKB1 alterations have been reported to have a significant role in primary resistance to PD-1\/PD-L1 axis inhibitors in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. It is importsnt to identify treatments which can rescue the efficacy of PD-1 blocker in STK11\/LKB1-mutant patients. We have developed a STK11 knockout (KO) model using the CT26 colorectal cancer syngeneic line which harbors a KRAS mutation and evaluated the response to checkpoint inhibitor alone and in combination with MEK inhibitors.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> CT26-STK11KOwas developed by CRISPR\/Cas9 technology and STK11\/LTB1 deletion was verified by Western Blot. To test the response of the cell line to anti-PD-1 treatment (10mg\/kg), we engrafted CT26-WT and CT26-STK11KO tumor lines into BALB\/c mice. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was assessed as TGI%=(1-Ti\/Vi) x100%; Ti as the mean tumor volume of the treatment group on the measurement day; Vi as the mean tumor volume of control group at the measurement day. At termination FACS analysis of different major types of immune cells was performed. Combination with MEK inhibitors, including Trametinib (1mg\/kg) was also evaluated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In comparison to CT26-WT tumor growth, PD-1 blocker could not inhibit CT26-STK11KO tumor progression. However, Combinational treatment of Trametinib and anti-PD-1 antibody delayed CT26-STK11KO tumor growth. In CT26-WT tumor bearing mice, anti-PD-1 monotherapy increased total CD45<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells, suggesting an ongoing immune response; significantly increased the ratio between M1 and M2, which might be an indicator for enhanced type I T cell response. CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration in CT26-STK11KO tumors was dramatically decreased associated with increased percentage of G-MDSC which may have contributed to the loss of response to anti-PD-1 treatment. MET inhibitor, Trametinib, decreased G-MDSC and restored CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration and PD-1 blocker efficacy in CT26-STK11KO tumor.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We successfully generated a CT26-STK11KO cell line which was valuable for evaluation of PD-1 blocker and MEK inhibitor in STK11\/LTB1 deficient tumor, in which Trametinib could rescue the efficacy of PD-1 treatment in CT26-STK11KO tumor via inhibiting G-MDSC. Taken together, our data suggest that altered immune cell infiltration, particularly increased G-MDSCs, in tumor microenvironment might be the reason for poor PD-1 blocker efficacy in CT26-STK11KO tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a3fdb4b-c22f-4428-b572-3cb7199db67f\/@z03B8ZGz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Colorectal cancer,MEK inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17028"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Demi X.

However, their discovery is hindered by the complexity of the drug modes of action and the lack of adequate biological models.<br \/>We designed an approach to define biomarkers of response by subjecting dissociated tissue from human tumors to T cell-targeting biologics or their combinations, followed by single-cell transcriptomic profiling and TCR clonotype characterization. Responding cells are identified as those showing treatment-specific shifts in gene expression profiles. Specifically for T cells, TCR clonotypes can be used to match responding T cells in treatment conditions to their sister clones in the baseline state. Comparing the baseline gene expression profiles between T cell clonotypes that responded to the treatment and those that did not allows the discovery of gene expression signatures that can predict response.<br \/>We processed over 20 tumor samples obtained from cancer patients and treated them <i>ex vivo<\/i> with two novel biologics currently under clinical development - HFB301001, a potentially best-in-class 2nd generation OX40 agonist, and HFB200301, a potentially first-in-class TNFR2 agonist. We applied our biomarker discovery strategy to the pooled scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data from these samples to define predictive signatures of response to these drugs. To further validate this strategy, we also generated single-cell data in our <i>ex vivo<\/i> system to characterize response to anti-PD-1 treatment. In the anti-PD-1 predictive response signature, we identified genes involved in inflammatory response and genes in the pathway of other co-inhibitory checkpoints. Application of the anti-PD-1 predictive response signature to bulk transcriptomic data from clinical studies with checkpoint inhibitors successfully stratified patients into two groups with significantly different risk of progression. The predictive response signatures for the two novel agonistic antibodies shared genes involved in inflammatory pathway with the anti-PD-1 signature, but also contained other distinct gene sets. Application of these predictive response signatures to bulk transcriptomic data from TCGA was able to stratify patients across cancer indications by predicted likelihood of response to individual treatments or combinations. The predictive biomarkers of response for the novel OX40 and TNFR2 agonist antibodies will be validated in our Phase I clinical trials.<br \/><i>Ex vivo<\/i> single-cell profiling coupled with TCR clonotype characterization enabled the discovery of predictive response signatures that informed patient selection strategies for the early clinical development of novel therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2172462f-4608-4df0-a588-dad354cc0503\/@A03B8ZGA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,scRNA-seq,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17029"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dean Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monika Manne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roshan Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Silver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Staskus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julianna Crivello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dohyun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ross Fulton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhizhan Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christos Hatzis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Adrian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Raue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Schweizer<\/i><\/presenter>.

Specifically, antibodies directed against CTLA-4 and PD-L1\/PD-1 have yielded long-term remission and cure in many solid as well as hematological malignancies. However, as not all cancer types respond to current ICI therapies, the quest for novel strategies to re-enable anti-tumor immunity by blocking immune checkpoints or by activating prominent co-stimulatory receptors is crucial. The field of cancer immunology has developed rapidly over the past decades, with numerous studies adding up to the complexity of immune-related interactions taking place in the tumor microenvironment. Compounds or combinations of compounds designed to target traditional or novel pathways require early evaluation of effectiveness on <i>in vitro<\/i> assays using primary immune cells or representative mouse models. On top of classical T cell bioassays, expanding on current methods and the development novel strategies to assess the modulation of cancer-related immunological networks is a continuously important process. One classical approach is the functional evaluation of compounds in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Here, the potency of drug candidates to promote physiological T cell responses can be evaluated. Antigen-specific immune responses can be further assessed in Cytomegalovirus (CMV) recall- or in Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activation assays. Additionally, it might also be beneficial to generate tumor-associated antigen-specific T cell pools or clones to be used in functional assays. The classical MLR assay could be expanded on by <i>e.g.,<\/i> inclusion of specific tumor cell populations or T regulatory (Treg) cells, as evaluating reduced cancer cell viability, or reversing loss of immune effector cell functionality can be of interest. Furthermore, real-time evaluation of cancer cell killing by T cells upon addition of drug candidates could also provide pivotal information on the compound&#8217;s functional dynamics. With our deepening understanding of cancer-related immunological networks it becomes clear that different drug candidates may require customized and fine-tuned T cell bioassays to assess their full therapeutic potential. Moreover, quality controlled primary immune cells are an essential factor for the robustness of these assays and to yield reproducible and consistent results. Collectively, taking in mind these aspects will ease decision making and accelerate the drug discovery pipeline.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b7df0088-f736-4081-97bb-aecee816abcf\/@A03B8ZGA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,In vitro,T cell,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17030"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Thibaut J.

The CIVO (Comparative In Vivo Oncology) platform can simultaneously deliver up to 8 drugs and combinations in microdose amounts to distinct, trackable regions within a single intact tumor, enabling studies that can assess multiple drugs and combinations directly in patients during early drug development. This study employed CIVO to assess two combination strategies incorporating the STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) agonist TAK-676 and chemotherapies capable of inducing immunogenic cell death. We evaluated TAK-676&#8217;s ability to elicit pharmacodynamic (PD) changes suggestive of anti-tumor immune activation within the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a syngeneic mouse model, both as monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU or cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy doublets.<br \/>Materials\/Methods: TAK-676 and chemotherapy combinations were simultaneously microdosed via CIVO in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model (YUMM1.7). Successful injections were visualized after administration, during sample processing, and in biomarker-stained tissue sections via a fluorescent tracking marker co-injected through each needle, and PD responses were assessed via immunohistochemistry and <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization following tumor resection.<br \/>Results: Drug mechanism of action-specific biomarker activity was evident as early as 4 hours after injection. TAK-676 induced robust elevation of pIRF3 and CXCL10 along with IFN&#947; from both T and NK cell compartments, indicating STING pathway activation. Phospho-histone H3 accumulation was noted in response to paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest. 5-FU and cisplatin induced localized DNA damage, visible via elevated phospho-histone H2AX-positive nuclei. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) accumulation was detected around TAK-676 injection sites, likely recruited from the local TME via induction of chemokines such as CXCL10. Early tumor cell apoptosis and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL10 were detected in response to both triplet combinations. CTL activation was enhanced in response to both triplet combinations by 24 hours, whereas CTL enrichment at levels greater than induced by TAK-676 alone was noted specifically in response to the triplet combination with cisplatin and paclitaxel by 72 hours.<br \/>Conclusion: These studies highlight TAK-676&#8217;s potential to promote anti-tumor immunity and the utility of the CIVO platform to reveal and characterize combination-specific responses. This application of CIVO is being further evaluated in an ongoing Phase 0 trial in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (NCT04541108).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f956ffe1-d467-4630-a36d-2332880faee8\/@A03B8ZGA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,Microdose,CIVO,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17031"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Beryl A.

ZL-1211 is a monoclonal antibody targeting CLDN18.2 engineered to promote enhanced ADCC with the goal of achieving more potent activity in a wider spectrum of high- and low-CLDN18.2 expressing tumors than the leading clinical benchmark. To further assess the potency of ZL-1211, we utilized a panel of gastric tumor cell lines that endogenously express CLDN18.2 and more accurately reflect target levels in human gastric tumors than engineered overexpressing models. ZL-1211 demonstrated more robust in vitro ADCC activity than clinical benchmark not only in CLDN18.2-high but also -low expressing gastric cell lines. Greater anti-tumor efficacy was also observed in mouse xenograft models with CLDN18.2-high, -medium, and low-expressing gastric cell lines in response to treatment with ZL-1211 compared to the clinical benchmark. NK cell depletion abrogated ZL-1211-mediated ADCC activity in vitro. ZL-1211 efficacy in vivo was also dependent on the presence of an NK compartment, as CLDN18.2-expressing gastric tumors grown in Balb\/c nude with an intact NK function were sensitive to ZL-1211 treatment, while NOD-SCID with partially competent NK activity exhibited minimal response, and NCG without NK cells did not display any evidence of in vivo efficacy. Strikingly, NK cells strongly induced an inflammatory response in response to ZL-1211 treatment, including increased IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, and IL-6 production. Interestingly, ZL-1211 treatment led to NK cell and monocyte stimulation and enhanced CD8+ T cell activation, suggesting a mechanism of action that not only involves innate but also adaptive immunity. Taken together, our data suggest that ZL-1211 more effectively targets CLDN18.2-high gastric cancers as well as -low expressing malignancies that are not eligible for treatment with the leading clinical benchmark by inducing a robust ADCC response and activating innate and adaptive immunity to enhance anti-tumor efficacy.

It&#8217;s therefore crucial to develop innovative strategies aiming at improving current clinical benefit. To this end, a well-characterized sarcoma preclinical model that mimics resistance to immunotherapy is needed. Starting from the anti-PD(L)1-sensitive MCA205 sarcoma mouse model, we therefore aimed at developing and characterizing a novel model resistant to anti-PD1.<br \/>Methods: Anti-PDL1 antibody was first administered to the ICI-sensitive MCA205 mouse sarcoma model (MCA205-S) and tumor growth was followed overtime. Tumor from a &#8220;non-responder&#8221; animal - tumor growth profile being similar as in the vehicle group - was then retrieved and processed for tissue dissociation and cell culture. Tumor cells were then amplified and inoculated into immunocompetent C57BL\/6 mice that were exposed or not to anti-PD1 antibody, and tumor growth was monitored for a 8-week period. In addition, tumor samples from satellite animals were collected and processed for intratumoral immune landscape characterization by multiparametric flow cytometry as well as for gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing.<br \/>Results: While anti-PD1 antibody demonstrated a strong anti-tumor effect in MCA205-S tumor-bearing mice, administration of anti-PD1 to the mice inoculated with the non-responder mouse-originating MCA205 cells did not yield to a significant anti-tumor effect thereby validating the resistant profile of this new MCA205-R cell line. Flow cytometry analysis of tumor-infiltrated immune cells revealed a higher abundance of macrophages (defined as CD11b+\/F4:80+) in MCA205-R when compared to the MCA205-S model, which more likely harbor a M2 phenotype. Also, anti-PD1 treatment favored an important MCA205-R tumor infiltration by gMDSC which was more limited in the MCA205-S model. Gene expression profile of tumor samples is currently under investigation.<br \/>Conclusions: We developed and validated a novel preclinical mouse model of sarcoma (MCA205-R) characterized by its resistance to anti-PD1 and a high tumor infiltration by macrophages. This model - more reflecting the clinic in terms of immunotherapy sensitivity - can thus serve to evaluate novel immunotherapeutic regimens either alone or in combination with reference ICI, to ultimately translate into clinical benefit for STS patients treated with immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/762800b2-e350-49fd-b42a-2c44f6ee7eb0\/@A03B8ZGA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Immune response,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17033"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Imane Nafia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Philippe Guegan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Assia Chaibi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noëlie Bos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Doriane Bortolotto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Rey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loïc Cerf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florent Peyraud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Italiano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alban Bessede<\/i><\/presenter>.

Antigenic peptides can be packaged within DPX to elicit a robust and persistent tumor antigen-specific T cell response. Maveropepimut-S (MVP-S), formerly DPX-Survivac, contains 5 peptides derived from the tumor antigen survivin, as well as poly dIdC and a T helper peptide. In clinical trials, MVP-S consistently incites a robust and persistent, survivin-specific immune response and promotes T and B cell infiltration into tumor tissues. Importantly, MVP-S based therapy has provided compelling evidence for clinical benefit in multiple cancer indications, notably DLBCL and ovarian cancer. Herein, we provide the first evidence from clinical and preclinical studies that Natural Killer (NK) cells are involved in the anti-cancer efficacy of DPX-based therapy. We evaluated clinical samples from the DeCidE<sup>1<\/sup> trial in advanced, recurrent ovarian cancer (NCT02785250). RNA-profiling of immune cells within tumor tissue revealed the presence of both activated and resting NK cells. Prior to treatment, activated NK cells were more evident in samples from patients achieving partial response (by RECISTv1.1). A higher percentage of subjects within the partial response group were more likely to maintain or increase resting NK cell infiltration on-treatment. PBMCs obtained prior to and on treatment showed no difference in CD56<sup>high<\/sup> and <sup>low <\/sup>NK profiles related to clinical benefit, highlighting that these changes in NK cell involvement are specific within tumor tissue. We sought to explore whether NK cells may be involved in DPX-based therapeutic efficacy using the HPV E7 model, C3, implanted in Rag1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice, deficient in T and B cells. Mice were pre-treated with DPX packaged with the HPV E7 <sub>49-57<\/sub> T cell peptide antigen (DPX-R9F) and 16 days later implanted with C3 tumor cells. At 40 days post treatment, 100% of control mice showed C3 tumor growth. By contrast, in the DPX-R9F immunized group, 60% of the mice were tumor free. Moreover, in the remaining 40% of the immunized group, the C3 tumors grew significantly slower than C3 tumors of the control group. Together, these data indicate that immunization with DPX-R9F enabled tumor control even in the absence of T or B cell function. To assess whether tumor control involved NK cells\/ perforin function, we repeated the experiment in Rag1<sup>-\/- <\/sup>\/Perforin<sup>-\/- <\/sup>mice. In these mice, DPX-R9F immunization was far less effective than in the Rag1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice, showing that only 20% of immunized mice were tumor free and suggesting that DPX-R9F mediated tumor control was partially dependent upon NK cell\/ perforin function. Taken together, these results from both clinical\/ translational studies and preclinical models suggest a distinct role for NK cells, in addition to the previously recognized role for T and B cells, in DPX-mediated immunotherapeutic efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/602d5aa2-d116-48f2-a4df-c3592e86f51d\/@A03B8ZGA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,Immuno-oncology,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17034"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"76074fd0-df09-4053-9324-f4c5f76d9de5","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/76074fd0-df09-4053-9324-f4c5f76d9de5\/@A03B8ZGA\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Moamen Bydoun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Medina-Luna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brennan Dirk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Graff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Hrytsenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Makrigiannis<\/i><\/presenter>.

Particularly, response to immunotherapy is likely driven by both active cGAS-STING signaling that attracts immune cells, and by the presence of cancer neoantigens that presents as targets for cytotoxic T-cells. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer, but also leads to an accumulation of cytosolic DNA that in turn results in increased cGAS-STING signaling. To avoid triggering the cGAS-STING pathway, it is commonly disrupted by the cancer cells, either through mutations in the pathway or through transcriptional silencing. Given its effect on the immune system, determining the cGAS-STING activation status prior to treatment initiation is likely of clinical relevance, but to date no robust method has been developed. Here, we used combined expression data from 2307 tumors from five cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to define a novel cGAS-STING activity score based on eight genes with a known role in the pathway. Using unsupervised clustering, four distinct categories of cGAS-STING activation were identified. In multivariate models, the cGAS-STING active tumors show improved prognosis. Importantly, in an independent bladder cancer immunotherapy treated cohort, patients without cGAS-STING activation showed very limited response to treatment, while patients with strong cGAS-STING activation showed improved response and improved prognosis, particularly among patients with high CIN and high numbers of neoantigens. In a multivariate model, a significant interaction was observed between CIN, neoantigens, and cGAS-STING activation. Together, this supports a role of cGAS-STING activity as a predictive biomarker in combination with measures of CIN and neoantigens for the application of immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9448b4c5-f5d7-42a7-bf16-9cf7697052e0\/@A03B8ZGA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Immunotherapy,Immune response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17035"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mateo Sokac<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, this potential could be greatly improved by combining information about receptor clonotypes with immunophenotypes of T and B cells. To facilitate these studies, we developed a novel technology for combined profiling of all human TCR and BCR variable regions and phenotypic characterization of immune cells. The developed TCR\/BCR immunophenotyping method involves multiplex RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of CDR3 regions of TCR and BCR genes and a set of the most informative T- and B-cell phenotyping genes. Bioinformatic analysis of NGS data allows profiling of TCR\/BCR clonotypes, and identification of major immune cell subtypes and their activation status. Data will be presented showing how combined TCR\/BCR clonotype analysis combined with targeted expression profiling of immune cells can be applied for large-scale discovery of novel cell typing and activation biomarkers in several immune-responsive model systems. Preliminary studies indicate the assay has unparalleled throughput, sensitivity, and improved cost-effectiveness for high-throughput immunity biomarker discovery applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0286d6cd-4213-4ef5-97a3-89b9efb78a3c\/@A03B8ZGA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,T cell,B cells,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17036"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alex Chenchik<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikhail Makhanov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tianbing Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lester Kobzik<\/i><\/presenter>.

We recently reported that IGV-001-treated newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase promoter had a median progression free survival of 38.4 months compared with 8.3 months in historical standard-of-care-treated patients (P=0.0008). We have now found activity with the equivalent murine approach in multiple cancer models, highlighting the transformative potential of this immunotherapeutic platform beyond glioblastoma.<br \/>Methodology: We utilized several murine models including the ID8-luciferase (-Luc) intraperitoneal ovarian cancer and Hepa1-6-Luc hepatocellular carcinoma orthotopic model. BDC containing saline or 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> IMV-001-treated tumor cells (hereon IOV-001 and IHV-001, respectively) were implanted in flanks of C57BL\/6 mice and explanted 48 h later, as per glioblastoma clinical protocol. Tumor challenge for all models was conducted 28d after chamber implantation. Mice were monitored for survival and tumor growth, as determined by bioluminescence intensity. Cytokine assays and immunophenotyping were conducted.<br \/>Results: 60% of IOV-001-treated mice were alive 58d post-tumor challenge, compared to only 19% of mice in the saline group (MST=37d, p=0.004). In the Hepa1-6 model, 50% of IHV-001-treated mice were alive by 100d post-tumor challenge (MST = 60.5d). In comparison, there were no survivors in the saline group beyond 28d (MST = 18d; p = 0.004). Most of the long-term survivors had undetectable tumor; a fraction showed some level of tumor burden which rose and fell, demonstrating immune control. Circulating IFN&#947; was significantly higher in IOV-001-treated mice compared to controls on 1d post-tumor challenge (p&#60;0.001) and trended higher in those receiving IHV-001 14d after tumor challenge. Positive correlations were found between percentages of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup>and CD4<sup>+<\/sup>TIM3<sup>+<\/sup>, and tumor burden in IOV-001-treated mice. On 14d, PD1<sup>+<\/sup> expression in both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell subsets was significantly lower in surviving mice treated with IHV-001. Improved survival using this approach was also observed in the Pan02 orthotopic pancreatic model. Latest data will be presented.<br \/>Conclusions: These data support the antitumor activity of this novel immunotherapeutic platform in multiple cancers beyond glioblastoma. Results suggest that efficacy is associated with a systemic immunological response, resulting in generation of Th1 antitumor cytotoxic T cells. Future studies are seeking to resolve the factors triggering good v. poor responses using phenotypic evaluation of T cell activation\/exhaustion markers and Th1\/Th2 cytokine production.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d174041-3558-4f08-95f6-502332e54ddc\/@A03B8ZGA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Ovarian cancer,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17037"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jenny Zilberberg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amelia Zellander<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Uhl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Cultrara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Kirby<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Essam Elazaq<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles B.

Large-scale retrospective analysis shows patients with mature TLS in particular respond to PD-1\/PD-L1 antibody treatment with improved objective response, progression-free and overall survival [2]. Since not all patients respond to PD-1\/PD-L1 antibody treatment, identifying patients with mature TLS is clinically relevant as it enables selection of patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Mature TLS are composed of T cells (CD3<sup>+<\/sup>), follicular B cells (CD20<sup>+<\/sup>), germinal center B cells (CD23<sup>+<\/sup>), and follicular dendritic cells (CD21<sup>+<\/sup>) [3]. The ability to identify and evaluate TLS is limited by detection methods which traditionally employ hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) staining for visual quantification of immune aggregates, potentially significantly underestimating their quantity [4]. Multiplexed fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) detection assays have the capability to precisely quantify mature TLS within the TME. Colorectal cancer specimens expressing a dynamic range of TLS are stained with a novel custom Vectra&#174; Polaris&#8482; multiplex immunofluorescence panel detecting CD20, CD21, CD23, CD3 and pan-cytokeratin. Identification of mature TLS with CD3+CD20+CD21+ and CD3+CD20+CD23+ expression in the TME is reported.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Vectra&#174; Polaris&#8482; TLS multiplex immunofluorescence panel successfully identified mature TLS in the TME of colorectal cancer patient samples. TLS were quantified via custom analytics algorithms generated with Indica HALO software.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Characteristics of TME immunity in colorectal cancer differentially impact an individual patient&#8217;s odds of survival [5]. The novel Vectra&#174; Polaris&#8482; multiplex assay in this study shows a detailed picture of mature TLS in patient cancer samples. Future applications of this panel include investigations of TLS associated with successful anti-tumor immune development and therapeutic response to treatment.

The costimulatory molecule CD137 is inducibly expressed as a transmembrane or as a soluble protein (sCD137). Moreover, the CD137 cytoplasmic signaling domain is a key part in approved Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs). Reliable pharmacodynamic biomarkers for CD137 ligation and co-stimulation of T cells will facilitate clinical development of CD137 agonists in the clinic.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used human and mouse CD8 T cells undergoing activation to measure CD137 transcription and protein expression levels determining both of the membrane-bound and soluble forms. In tumor-bearing mice plasma sCD137 concentrations were monitored upon treatment with agonist anti-CD137 mAbs. Human CD137 knock-in mice were treated with clinical-grade agonist anti-human CD137 (Urelumab). Sequential plasma samples were collected from the first patients intratumorally treated with Urelumab in the INTRUST clinical trial. Anti-Mesothelin CD137-encompassing CAR-transduced T cells were stimulated with mesothelin coated microbeads. sCD137 was measured by sandwich ELISAs and Luminex and flow cytometry was used to monitor CD137 surface expression.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> CD137 co-stimulation upregulates transcription and protein expression of CD137 itself including sCD137 in human and mouse CD8 T cells. Immunotherapy with anti-CD137 agonist mAb resulted in increased plasma sCD137 in mice bearing syngeneic tumors. sCD137 induction is also observed in human CD137 knock-in mice treated with Urelumab and in mice transiently humanized with T cells undergoing CD137 co-stimulation inside subcutaneous implanted Matrigel&#174; plugs. CD137 signaling domain-containing CAR T cells readily released sCD137 upon antigen recognition in a manner favored by the CD137 signaling domain. Patients treated intratumorally with low dose Urelumab showed increased plasma concentrations of sCD137.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> sCD137 in plasma and CD137 surface expression can be used as quantitative parameters dynamically reflecting therapeutic co-stimulatory activity elicited by agonist CD137-targeted agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/28a198ac-d20a-434c-b421-4e0743f6c85d\/@B03B8ZGB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immunotherapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17039"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Javier Glez-Vaz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arantza Azpilikueta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Olivera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Assunta Cirella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Álvaro Teijeira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Ochoa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maite Álvarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iñaki Eguren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Luri-Rey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miguel F.

The markers allow for the differentiation of a large variety of immune cell populations, their change in frequency, and activation status upon treatment. Conventional flow cytometers, which use bandpass filters and need conventional compensation matrices, are limited by the number of parameters that can be simultaneously analyzed, restricting their utility. Spectral analysis technology promises a greater flexibility for panel design, a higher number of analyzed parameters, and more accurate visualization of results.<br \/>Our standard all-in-one flow cytometry panel uses all possible fluorescent detectors of the flow analyzer BD Fortessa, which permits the differentiation of the main immune cell populations in the tumor, such as T cells (CD4+, CD8+, Treg), B and NK cells, macrophages (M1\/M2), MDSCs (granulocytic and monocytic), and dendritic cells. However, in addition to immune cell frequency, it would also be interesting to investigate cell surface activation and memory markers like PD-1, CD40, CD44, or CD62L or intracellular activation markers like IFN-gamma, perforin, granzyme B, or Ki67.

However, predicting patient responses to ITx is difficult based solely on static correlates such as TIL localization and molecular signatures. Anti-tumor immune response depends on motile surveillance by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) which recognize antigenic determinants and engage target cells in serial stop-and-go interactions that result in cell killing. However, the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) can cause TIL dysfunction and lack of cytotoxicity which is manifested as either suppressed or aimless TIL motility. To determine which ITx works best for a given patient, we are developing a diagnostic platform using live tumor fragments (LTF) that preserves the TME and its immune cells. Antibody-based labeling of live tissues is hampered by slow diffusion and function-altering cross-linking. To overcome these limitations, we have used small camelid-derived monovalent antibodies (nanobodies) to monitor TIL motility in LTFs. Human tumor excisions were cut into 300 x 300 x 200 &#181;m LTFs, sorted into glass bottom multi-well plates and cultured. CD8+ cells in LTFs were labeled using an anti-hCD8a camelid VHH nanobody covalently labeled with AF594. The same reagent or a mouse anti-hCD8a whole IgG antibody was used to stain human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and staining patterns were compared by flow cytometry. Immune responsiveness of LTFs to ITx was ascertained by flow cytometry and secreted protein assays (data shown in a companion abstract). Multiphoton microscopy revealed LTF collagen fibrils and cellular autofluorescence. A fluorescent anti-CD8a nanobody, but not a similarly labeled whole IgG, yielded good contrast and fast staining of two cell subsets. The smaller cells were 12 &#181;m in diameter, cell surface-stained, and lacking autofluorescence, consistent with T cells. The larger cells were elongated, ramified, intracellularly stained, and distinctly autofluorescent, consistent with macrophages. 3D motility tracking revealed characteristic translational motility of the smaller cells at ~10 &#181;m\/min along collagenous structures. In contrast, larger cells exhibited only slow motility. Our results show that the motility of human CD8+ T lymphocytes can be revealed in LTF culture using a fluorescent CD8-binding camelid nanobody, likely due to its small size and monovalent binding. Further examination is needed to understand if T cell function is altered. The autofluorescence of larger, immotile cells was consistent with tumor-associated macrophages. Based on this distinction, T cells could be distinguished from the macrophages clearly. Our results support the use of camelid-derived VHH and other small monovalent reagents for live tissue lymphocyte tracking, possibly to evaluate TIL response to ITx in an LTF assay.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/983902d7-a9d1-4ec6-b272-cae278689837\/@B03B8ZGB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Precision medicine,Predictive biomarkers,Cancer diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17042"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Leung Kau Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelsey Tweed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Scribano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Wahl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christin Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>M.
