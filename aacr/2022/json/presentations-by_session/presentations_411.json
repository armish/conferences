[{"Abstract":"<b>INTRODUCTION: <\/b>Indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is upregulated in tumors. It facilitates catabolism of tryptophan to kynurenine and downstream metabolites, which are associated with psychiatric symptoms. To this point, 20% of patients at our institution developed psychiatric symptoms months before pancreatic cancer (PC) diagnosis. This proportion was threefold greater relative to non-cancer controls (6.7%), supplying indirect evidence of a biochemical link. Herein, we investigate IDO1 as a target in pancreatic cancer-associated depression.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>Human and murine PC cells were used in vitro. Protein levels were assessed using western blotting and cell survival by PicoGreen. For in vivo studies, murine PC cells were injected into the pancreatic tail. Control mice underwent an acellular injection. Mice were treated with epacadostat (an IDO1 inhibitor), escitalopram, or vehicle. To evaluate depressive-like behavior, mice were subjected to the forced swim and tail suspension tests. The open field test was used to monitor mobility. Tumors were analyzed using western blotting and serum metabolites were assessed using LC-MS.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Murine and human PC cells had undetectable basal IDO1 protein levels; however, there was a strong induction with interferon-gamma. There was a further increase in IDO1 with added epacadostat. Escitalopram had no effect on IDO1 levels. Epacadostat and escitalopram did not impact PC cell viability. <b><\/b>Physical mobility of PC mice was similar to controls over the study period. PC mice were more immobile relative to controls during the forced swim (percent immobile: 16.0% v 8.2%, p&#60;0.001) and tail suspension (24.1% v 15.4%, p=0.003) tests. There was a 2.3-fold increase in serum kynurenine levels in PC mice relative to controls (p&#60;0.001).PC mice treated with epacadostat were less immobile relative to PC mice receiving vehicle in both the forced swim (3.2% v 6.6%, p=0.002) and tail suspension (25.0% v 39.3%, p=0.002) tests. Metabolomics demonstrated a 95% reduction in serum kynurenine levels in mice receiving epacadostat relative to vehicle (p&#60;0.001). Tumors of mice treated with epacadostat exhibited a compensatory upregulation of IDO1. Mice treated with escitalopram performed similarly to vehicle-treated mice on the forced swim (7.6%, p=0.85) and tail suspension (38.7%, p=0.77) tests, and kynurenine levels were similar. <b>CONCLUSION: <\/b>Mice with PC exhibit depressive-like behavior relative to control mice with an associated increase in kynurenine. Treatment with epacadostat improved depressive-like behavior and dramatically reduced kynurenine. These data provide evidence to trial epacadostat in patients battling pancreatic cancer-associated depression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6429ea0-dbd5-47fd-a7af-8150cac05f3c\/@y03B8ZJ7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IDO1,Pancreatic cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12504"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jonathan J.

Thus, the use of multiple analytical platforms, such as combining the strengths of Mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), for metabolic profiling can maximize coverage and generate more global metabolomic profiles. In this study, we demonstrate the utilities of the combined NMR and MSI multiplatform in our metabolomics results on human prostate and lung cancers.<br \/>Statistical data on the natural history of prostate cancer (PCa) show that &#38;gt;70% of patients diagnosed by PSA screening will likely experience indolent disease with little impact on well-being. For about 17% of newly PSA-diagnosed patients, however, aggressive PCa proliferation ensues, truncating life expectancy. At present, no reliable clinical test can differentiate between these two groups. Using HRMAS <sup>1<\/sup>HNMR followed by quantitative histology, we showed statistically significant correlations between concentrations of Spm and the amount of histologically-benign epithelial (Hb Epi) prostatic cells and glands in human cancerous prostates. However, as above discussed that using HRMAS NMR alone we cannot prove that Spm was indeed generated or resided in the Hb Epi cells. Nevertheless, using MALDI MSI, we were able to locate Spm (m\/z: 203.223 &#177; 0.001Da) onto Hb Epi, where spermine on the PCa lesions appeared below detection limits. From these maps, for the first time, we could visualize and confirm the differential localizations of Spm in prostates. This proof of Sym relationship to prostate pathologies and its proposed PCa inhibitory effects may support further studies that are critical in differentiating aggressive from indolent PCa for disease evaluations and patient personalized treatment strategies.<br \/>To search for such screening metabolomics biomarkers in lung cancer, we used HRMAS NMR to analyze 93 pairs of human LuCa tissue and serum samples, and 29 healthy human sera. A number of potential metabolite candidates capable to differentiate LuCa characteristics were identified, including glutamate, lipids, alanine, glycerylphosphorylcholine, glutamine, phosphorylcholine, etc. This list can be further expanded by analyzing metabolite composition in the serum of cancer patients and control healthy subjects using LC-MS, which offers a dramatic increase in sensitivity compared to HRMAS NMR and, therefore, is better suited for the biomarker discovery. In addition to acquiring high-resolution mass data, the high data acquisition rate allows the fragment ion mass spectra (MS\/MS) to be generated for the most abundant ionic species in each chromatographic peak. This feature allows specific classes of tumor-attenuated metabolites to be identified based on the presence of unique structurally diagnostic fragment ions in MS\/MS spectra.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5dc6ea28-5ef4-48ae-9839-3d9d997c8612\/@y03B8ZJ7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Magnetic resonance spectroscopy,Lung cancer,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12505"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leo L.

Here, we introduce an assay workflow for screening and analyzing potential anticancer drugs affecting cellular metabolism using extracellular flux analysis. The Agilent Seahorse XF Real-Time ATP rate assay can be used as a starting point to identify therapeutic compounds that induce a perturbation in metabolic phenotype. It provides a quantitative comparison of basal mitochondrial and glycolytic activities using the universal unit of ATP production rate. Through this initial comparative screening, the effect of different compounds on basal energetic state and pathway-specific metabolic perturbations can be identified providing information that cannot be assessed by intracellular ATP level measurements or cytotoxicity assays. A more comprehensive functional analysis can then be applied to validate the target mode of action through pathway-specific analysis tools such as the XF Cell Mito Stress Test and the XF Glycolytic Rate Assay. In this study, we tested the proposed workflow in three different NSCLC cell lines with different genetic backgrounds using a mock panel of known metabolic modulators including thiosemicarbazones, EGFR inhibitors, KRAS inhibitors, a glutaminase inhibitor, a Glut1 inhibitor, a chemotherapy drug, and a radiotherapy sensitizer candidate. The ATP production rate data from lung cancer cell lines exposed for 1 hour or 24 hours to the compounds, successfully identified the effects of metabolic pathway-specific modulation as well as metabolic phenotypic switching. In addition, dose-response studies using cell lines with different genetic backgrounds demonstrated differential susceptibility to the tested compounds. The workflow was then applied using a broader panel of 72 potential mitochondrial toxicants compounds. The assay could identify potent mitochondrial and glycolytic suppressor compounds effective on A549, a lung cancer cell line. A more comprehensive XF analysis then validated the mode of action for the identified metabolic suppressors. These results demonstrate the benefit of using the XF Real-Time ATP rate assay as an initial assay to uncover novel metabolic targets in early drug discovery research, guiding further research toward functional validation with the appropriate comprehensive XF assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ef7ba14-5d67-44fd-8302-914c3060d9e6\/@y03B8ZJ7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Drug-discovery screen,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12506"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yoonseok Kam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Winer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalia Romero<\/i><\/presenter>.

CR cells activate the kynurenine (KYN) pathway (KP) during excessive oxidative stress to maintain high ROS for proliferation by catabolizing tryptophan (TRP) to KYN via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1); and by expressing (3-5x) higher levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) compared to platinum sensitive cells (p&#60;0.02; n=8). We detected significant increases in IDO1 activity (3-4x), identified by the KYN\/TRP ratio, in CR cells&#8217; culture media (p&#60;0.05; n=8). Extracellular KYN is known to program na&#239;ve T-cells to the immune suppressive regulatory T-cell (T-reg) phenotype. Using a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) co-culture system, we found a higher frequency of regulatory T-cells (Tregs; CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) and a lower frequency of effector T-cells (Teffs CD3+CD8+) and NK cell (CD3-CD314+CD335+) activity in co-culture with CR cells compared to cisplatin sensitive cancer cells. Importantly, inhibition of IDO1 and Tryptophan 2,3-Dioxygenase (TDO2), the enzymes involved in the rate limiting step in the KP, with the dual inhibitor AT-0174 at 20&#181;M (48h) suppressed Tregs, but enhanced Teffs and NK cell populations in CR co-cultures. Next, we used a syngeneic mouse model of LLC (Lewis lung cancer) vs cisplatin resistant LLC-CR, to examine the effects of AT-0174 (170 mg\/kg; P.O. once daily) in combination with anti-PD1 antibody (10 mg\/ml; I.P. once every 3 days). Consistent with the in vitro model, analysis of mice with LLC-CR tumors found higher intratumoral T-reg and lower NK cell populations. Treatment with AT-0174 resulted in higher tumor infiltrating lymphocytes of Teffs and NK and lower Treg frequency in LLC-CR tumors than treatment with a selective IDO1 inhibitor (epacadostat). More importantly, the combination of AT-0174+antiPD1 reversed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments with further enhancement in Teffs and NK frequencies and diminished tumor growth in CR allografts with a significant reduction of total tumor weight compared with LLC mouse tumors (n=10, P&#60;0.01).

In many tumor types ACSS2 is dramatically upregulated in response to the hypoxic and lipid-depleted conditions often encountered in the tumor microenvironment. In these conditions, ACSS2 allows tumor cells to switch to acetate as key carbon source to meet their anabolic and energetic needs and thereby they become dependent on both acetate and ACSS2. MTB-9655 is a novel, potent and selective ACSS2 inhibitor discovered at Metabomed. It is currently in Phase I clinical investigation on patients with tumors with high levels of ACSS2. The antitumor effect of MTB-9655 was characterized in a number of PDX models across various tumor types. PDX tumors that exhibit over 50 TPM copies of ACSS2 mRNA showed significant sensitivity to ACSS2 inhibition in vivo. TCGA analyses suggests that most GU tumors, such as hepatocellular, gastric, colorectal show high frequency of ACSS2 upregulation and therefore present an opportunity for treatment with MTB-9655. In addition, PDX studies revealed a significant combination effect with cisplatin and gemcitabine. This opens opportunities for combination treatments of several GU cancers expressing high levels of ACSS2, such as ovarian and breast cancers.As a potential PD biomarker assay, <sup>11<\/sup>C acetate PET imaging was explored preclinically in tumor-bearing mice as a way to assess inhibition of acetate flux in the presence of ACSS2 inhibitor. MTB-9655 resulted in robust inhibition of <sup>11<\/sup>C acetate uptake in tumors in a dose-dependent manner opening the possibility of using <sup>11<\/sup>C acetate PET as a clinical PD biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/525a258f-6c9b-45d1-aabc-74be117ef9a1\/@y03B8ZJ7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acetylation,Hypoxia,Metabolism,PET,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12509"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andreas Goutopoulos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Amanati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Fattaey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avital Hay-Koren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Nakache<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omri Erez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dimitri Kovalerchik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dikla Paz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Botti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannah Oppenheimer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irit Fainer<\/i><\/presenter>.

Endocrine therapies, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) and aromatase inhibitors (AI), along with cyclin-dependent kinase 4\/6 (CDK4\/6) inhibitors, are the current mainstays of treatment. Despite being initially effective, the majority of advanced ER+ breast cancers become resistant to the endocrine therapies. Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that enable or promote resistance to endocrine therapies. Rapidly proliferating cells have a high energy demand and consequently consume greater quantities of glucose to fulfill their energy and anabolic demands to support cell growth. Using endocrine therapy sensitive and resistant breast cancer cell models we investigated the metabolic flux of glucose by growing the cells in the presence of the stable glucose isotope, UC13-Glucose and measured the C13-labelled metabolites of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Glucose consumption was higher in endocrine therapy resistant MCF7\/LCC9 (LCC9) cells compared with parental MCF7 (MCF7) and estrogen independent, endocrine therapy sensitive MCF7\/LCC1 (LCC1) cells. The TCA cycle was noticeably impaired in LCC9 cells as the C-13 labelled citrate (m+4 and m+6) isotopomer was absent in these cells. In addition, C-13 labelled fumarate was very low in LCC9 cells with a concurrent increase in the succinate:fumarate ratio. These observations show that in LCC9 cells the TCA cycle is dysregulated at the succinate to fumarate conversion step, which is catalyzed by the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme. SDH is a multimeric protein comprised of four different subunits and SDH assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2), which is a tumor suppressor gene. Further investigation revealed that SDHAF2 was under expressed in LCC9 cells compared with LCC1 cells, likely contributing to lower SDH activity. Intriguingly, SDH inhibition by dimethyl-malonate re-sensitized LCC9 cells to both Fulvestrant and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Clinically, lower expression levels of SDHAF2 correlates with poor relapse free survival in ER+ breast cancer patients. In summary, our study suggests that accumulation of succinate driven by deficient SDH activity is functionally associated with endocrine therapy resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b2eadf01-95fb-4bf5-9103-cdf1d16bdd0e\/@y03B8ZJ7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Drug resistance,Endocrine resistance,Tamoxifen resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12511"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Surojeet Sengupta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karla Andrade De Oliviera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Clarke<\/i><\/presenter>.

With more than 3 million breast cancer survivors in the US, a number that is projected to increase, it is important to identify targets for precision intervention to improve breast cancer prognosis. With the rapid advancement of technology for metabolomics, the results from several recent studies have shown that metabolomics may have applications in breast cancer diagnosis and subtype analysis, characterization of heterogeneity of breast cancer, and prognosis. In the current study, we performed a global urinary metabolomic analysis of 120 breast cancer patients: 60 progression-free (PF) cases as the reference group and 60 with progressive disease (PD: recurrence, second primary, metastasis, or death). The urine samples were collected immediately after radiotherapy. Using UPLC-MS\/MS and GC-MS, Metabolon Inc. identified a robust set of 1,742 biochemicals (1,258 known and 484 unknown structure). The most notable differences between PF and PD patients involved multiple pathways and metabolites include: carbohydrate metabolism (e.g., glucose, sedoheptulose, and N<sup>6<\/sup>-carboxymethyllysine), branch-chain amino acid metabolism (e.g., alpha-hydroxyisocaproate and beta-hydroxyisovalerylglycine), phosphatidylcholine metabolism (e.g., 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-GPC (16:0\/18:1) and 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC (16:0\/18:2)), arginine metabolism (e.g., dimethylarginine, N-acetylcitrulline, and homocitrulline), oxidative stress-related metabolites (e.g., cysteine-glutathione disulfide, gamma-glutamylisoleucine, and gamma-glutamylthreonine), androgenic steroids (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and 16a-hydroxy DHEA 3-sulfate), and nucleotide metabolism. Some of these identified metabolomic differences may serve as potential predictive biomarkers of breast cancer prognosis. In summary, with increasing interest in targeting tumor metabolism in precision medicine and our pilot data suggesting multiple metabolic pathways in predicting breast cancer prognosis, future research is warranted to validate our findings and identify metabolomic targets for precision interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5ccf27c9-c705-4814-b862-89ef1c065c0e\/@y03B8ZJ7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metabolomics,Prognosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12512"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer J.

By contrast, HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) are generally sensitive to oxidative damage from radiation plus cisplatin, which are often curative. It is unknown whether the subset of HPV+ OPSCCs with poor outcomes exploit antioxidant capacity provided by high mitochondrial mass to evade therapy. It is also unclear whether the wide range of HPV oncoprotein expression among them contributes to diversity in mitochondrial mass and treatment outcomes.<br \/><b>A<\/b><b>IMS:<\/b> (1) evaluate HPV+ OPSCCs for associations between mitochondrial mass and clinical outcome (2) elucidate relationships among HPV oncoprotein levels, mitochondrial mass, and therapy response (3) delineate mechanisms by which variable HPV oncoprotein levels govern therapy response.<br \/><b>METHODS\/RESULTS:<\/b> High expression of genes involved in oxidative metabolism was associated with decreased survival in three patient cohorts. In PDX and cell line models, cisplatin resistance positively correlated with mitochondrial mass (<i>MTCO1\/B2M<\/i>), oxidative metabolism (basal OCR), and antioxidant capacity (NADPH\/NADP+). Among the HPV oncoproteins, only full length E6 (fl-E6) was linked to these features, showing negative correlation with mitochondrial mass in the cell lines, PDXs, and patient tumors. Fl-E6 levels also positively correlated with cisplatin response in the PDXs and cell lines. To test whether fl-E6 can mediate such effects, lentiviral fl-E6 expression in HPV+ cancer cell lines with low endogenous fl-E6 was used to increase levels to the high end of the range seen in human tumors. Doing so reduced <i>MTCO1\/B2M<\/i>, basal OCR, and NADPH\/NADP+ while sensitizing to radiation and cisplatin <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The same effects on mitochondrial biogenesis were maintained in nTERT\/E7 keratinocytes. Using luciferase reporter assays, fl-E6 was shown to repress the PGC-1\/ERR axis for mitochondrial biogenesis by attenuating p53-dependent PGC1&#945; promoter activity. The prediction of PGC1\/ERR axis activation in tumors with low fl-E6 was confirmed in PDXs and patient cohorts, where high ERR&#945; was negatively prognostic.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> These results reveal a novel ability of E6-mediated p53 downregulation to contribute to treatment sensitivity by depleting mitochondrial antioxidant capacity. They also provide evidence that differing fl-E6 levels across HPV+ cancers variably repress the PGC1\/ERR pathway, leading to diversity in mitochondrial mass that impacts therapy response. Therapy-refractory features may prove identifiable using expression-based biomarkers in the PGC1\/ERR axis and be mitigated through targetable nodes in this pathway. In addition, HPV+ OPSCCs may find competitive advantage in down-regulating fl-E6 upon acquiring alternate drivers to compensate decrease in its oncogenic functions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09c9c836-97b7-431d-83c0-a19b2cb96dcb\/@y03B8ZJ7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Mitochondria,Therapy resistance,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12517"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Malay K.

Here, we examined metabolic profiles of pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) tumor samples from patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). We performed spatially resolved, desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) on sections from clinically annotated HGSC samples collected according to a laparoscopic triage algorithm from patients pre- and post-NACT. Patients were considered to be either excellent (ER) if they presented complete response or only microscopic disease left at interval surgery, or poor responders (PR) if they presented stable or progressive disease after NACT. Tumor tissues from 50 patients (29 ER and 21 PR, 13 ER matched pre and post NACT, 13 PR matched pre and post-NACT) were eligible for the analyses Data relative to the detected metabolites, were collected from epithelium and stroma separately. We first identified differentially upregulated metabolites in ER and PR groups and performed pathway analysis. The over-represented pathways in the chemo-na&#239;ve PR tissues included the <i>nucleotide metabolism<\/i> pathway in epithelial areas, and <i>degradation of cysteine and homocysteine<\/i>, <i>metabolism of amino acids and derivatives<\/i>, as well as <i>sulfur amino acids metabolism<\/i> in the stromal areas (p values FDR adjusted 0.045) . In general, both the epithelium and stroma of PR tissues of chemo-na&#239;ve tumors, contained a higher number and a higher variety of lipid species compared with ER tissues. In post-NACT tumor epithelial areas, there was global downregulation of metabolites across all patient samples, compared to the pre-chemo specimens; this was more evident in ER patients. In post-NACT tumors from PR patients, <i>glutathione synthesis and recycling pathway<\/i>, and <i>sulfite oxidation to sulfate<\/i> pathway and many glycerolipids species were upregulated in the epithelium, while phosphatidic acids were upregulated in the stroma. Lastly, we evaluated the predictive power of the metabolic data extracted by the epithelial areas of chemo-na&#239;ve tissues, in classifying patients as ER or PR. We used 10-fold cross-validation to create a ridge regression model for the classification of ER and PR samples from pre-NACT tumor tissues. This model, based on 78 differentially expressed metabolites (small molecules and lipids), correctly classified patients as ER or PR with an accuracy of 76.2% (sensitivity 84.6% and specificity 62.5%). Our findings indicate altered metabolic pathways in ovarian cancer tissues based on response to NACT. The identification of differentially activated pathways, such as sulfate metabolism and glutathione metabolism in tumors with poor response, suggest novel actionable targets to overcome chemotherapy resistance in patients with HGSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d81d993d-2215-42bb-9ac4-b89bb493065e\/@z03B8ZJ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Ovarian cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12520"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara Corvigno<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meredith Spraldin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Keating<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Badal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Igor Pereira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaine Stur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Bateman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Waleed Barakat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Conrads<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanghoon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Maxwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan K.

As such, there is an imperative need for new and innovative therapies. Our lab has previously discovered that metastatic ascites-derived tumor cells have acquired a gain-of-function p53 mutation following interaction with the ovarian microenvironment in our orthotopic murine model of EOC. This p53 mutation is associated with an upregulation of the mevalonate pathway, which is known for its vital role in producing cholesterol. Tumor cells upregulate metabolic pathways as a survival advantage to fuel their rapid growth and metastasis. Simvastatin, a statin therapy, specifically targets HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, and inhibits its activity. As such, simvastatin may serve as a potential therapeutic opportunity for EOC. Gain-of-function p53 mutations in the epithelial cells of the distal fallopian tube is now widely accepted as the origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Thus, the purpose of our study was to investigate the relationship between p53 status and the mevalonate pathway in oviductal epithelial (OVE) cells as well as evaluate the effect of simvastatin treatment on OVE cell viability.<br \/>Methods\/Results: OVE cells were isolated from the distal oviducts of FVB\/N mice with a p53 wildtype status, and we either deleted the <i>Trp53<\/i> gene or introduced a gain-of-function R175H p53 mutation using CRISPR\/Cas9. Cell viability was measured following treatment with varying doses of simvastatin and p53 mutant cells showed the greatest sensitivity (IC50: 5.48 uM) compared to p53 wildtype (IC50: 14.80 uM) and p53 knockout (IC50:9.78 uM) cells. For subsequent experiments, OVE cells were treated with 10 uM simvastatin or DMSO and subjected to Resazurin, Transwell migration, CyQUANT proliferative and Caspase-Glo 3\/7 assays. Simvastatin significantly decreased resazurin reduction to resorufin in a time-dependent manner over 48 hours, regardless of p53 status, demonstrating reduced metabolic activity. Additionally, OVE cell invasion was significantly reduced in simvastatin treated p53 mutant cells, compared to p53 wildtype or p53 knockout cells. Simvastatin treatment diminished cell proliferation and enhanced apoptotic activity in all simvastatin treated OVE cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Overall, simvastatin appears to inhibit tumorigenic processes <i>in vitro<\/i>. The next steps of this project are to test simvastatin&#8217;s effect on disease regression in a novel murine oviductal cell injection model of EOC recently developed by our lab. In light of these results, repurposing simvastatin as a therapy for ovarian cancer may significantly improve the way we treat this vicious disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/247c677b-b787-4576-ac56-9198b12fecf4\/@z03B8ZJ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Statins,p53 mutations,Mevalonate Pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12522"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Madison Pereira<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathy Matuszewska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Haagsma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alice Glogova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trevor G.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up most cases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly improved the clinical management of some NSCLC cases, yet many lung cancer patients still fail to respond to conventional immunotherapy. Therefore, more research is needed to characterize cellular pathways contribute to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance in NSCLC patients. Dysregulated cellular metabolism is a common feature of many cancer types, and metabolites are now known to modulate several functions inside cells such as signaling pathways and epigenetic control of gene expression. Therefore, targeting tumor metabolism may be able to combat NSCLC immunotherapy resistance. To identify potential metabolic pathways involved in the anti-tumor immune response, we employed a metabolic inhibitor-based drug screen in human NSCLC cell lines and tested for expression changes in a panel of known immune regulator genes. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) downregulated the mRNA expression of anti-phagocytic surface protein cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24) in lung cancer cells. In line with this, shRNA knockdown and overexpression of DHFR, decreased and increased CD24 RNA and protein levels, respectively. These results show that the metabolic enzyme DHFR is involved in CD24 gene expression. Cancer cells heavily rely on DHFR for enhanced nucleotide biosynthesis to facilitate rapid tumor growth, and DHFR inhibitors are already used in the clinic for cancer therapy. This study highlights a novel interaction between reprogrammed cancer metabolism and the anti-tumor immune response, with possible clinical implications for DHFR inhibitors such as methotrexate in combination with conventional cancer immunotherapy agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a33661bc-2434-4ba9-96a9-e336412a280a\/@z03B8ZJ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Anticancer therapy,Immunotherapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12524"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Austin Boese<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Young<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jihoon Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Courteney Malin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung Seok Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sumin Kang<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, relapse remains the major cause of mortality post-transplant; while graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) - a T cell mediated immunological disorder is the major cause of non-relapse mortality. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) supports T cell proliferation by playing a critical role in <i>de novo <\/i>pyrimidine synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. We hypothesized that alloreactive T cells may rely on increased levels of pyrimidine pools and ATP to support rapid cell proliferation, making DHODH an interesting target to prevent GVHD. Additionally, DHODH inhibition is currently being pursued as a therapeutic option for AML. Therefore, we hypothesize that DHODH inhibition post-transplant will serve a dual purpose - i) target T cell metabolism to reduce GVHD and ii) prevent relapse due to direct anti-leukemic effects, thereby resulting in superior post-transplant outcomes.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We tested the efficacy of a novel DHODH inhibitor (Cmpd 41), a lead clinical candidate, in preventing GVHD and retaining graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Human T cells isolated from PBMCs were activated<i> <\/i>with CD3\/CD28 Dynabeads &#177; Cmpd 41. Cell proliferation (flow cytometry) and ATP production (Agilent Seahorse) was assessed. GVHD and GVL was assessedevaluated in a xenogeneic model where irradiated NSG mice received human PBMCS (~17x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells) and treated with vehicle or Cmpd 41 (10mg\/kg, 2x\/week) with addition of MOLM-13 cells (~1x10<sup>4<\/sup>) for GVL. Splenocytes were harvested for analysis of cytokine production (intracellular flow cytometry).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> DHODH inhibition with Cmpd 41 significantly reduced T cell proliferation and ATP production from both glycolysis and OXPHOS (fold change: Cmpd 41 vs. control- 0.56 and 0.68 respectively, p&#60;0.01) compared to vehicle. DHODH inhibition significantly improved survival (mean survival: Cmpd 41 vs. vehicle: 56 days vs. 40 days, p&#60;0.01) and reduced clinical scores (Cmpd 41 vs. vehicle: 1.8 vs. 4.2, p&#60;0.05) compared to vehicle in the xenogeneic GVHD model. There was a significant reduction in IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; cytokine producing T cells in the Cmpd 41 treated cohort compared to vehicle (Cmpd 41 vs. vehicle, IFN-&#947;: 8.33% vs. 31.28%, p&#60;0.01; TNF-&#945;: 1.37% vs. 27.25%, p&#60;0.01). In a GVL model, mice that received both human PBMCs and Cmpd 41 showed decreased tumor growth and improved overall survival over mice given either treatment alone (p&#60;0.01), showing that DHODH inhibition maintains GVL.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> DHODH inhibition is a novel approach to prevent and mitigate GVHD while retaining GVL effects. Combined with direct anti-leukemic effects, we propose that Cmpd 41 treatment in post-transplant relapse in the setting of past or active graft versus host disease will provide dual treatment of AML and GVHD thereby leading to improved patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc841edb-6b53-4c9c-939e-c6a12f95cc0a\/@z03B8ZJ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Acute myeloid leukemia,Metabolism,GVHD,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12526"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kara M.

NAMPT inhibition, via small molecule NAMPT inhibitors, disrupts cellular energy metabolism as well as other NAD<sup>+<\/sup>-dependent processes and has been shown to suppress cancer cell proliferation. The early clinical translation of NAMPT inhibitors has been hindered by toxicity, therefore the successful development of newer classes of NAMPT inhibitors will depend on identifying cancers with unique sensitivity to, and molecular biomarkers of susceptibility to NAMPT inhibition. Through our pan-cancer screens using several different NAMPT inhibitors on molecularly characterized cancer cell line panels, we have identified specific cancer types and subtypes that are consistently sensitive to NAMPT inhibition. In order to determine the efficacy of NAMPT inhibitors in different cancer cells, we performed proliferation assays on a large and fully characterized panel of human cancer cell lines (n=496) for response to several NAMPT inhibitors including FK866, KPT9274 and LSN3154567. Briefly, cells were treated with six dilutions of these inhibitors in duplicate, counted following a 6-day treatment window and IC50 values were determined for each cell line. Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), point mutation and RNAseq data for each cell line were then queried for correlation with NAMPT sensitivity\/resistance. Proliferation assays indicate a strong correlation between sensitive and resistant cancer cell types to all three compounds despite their different mechanisms of action. Most notably, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ovarian cancer, Ewing&#8217;s sarcoma and small cell lung cancer cells (SCLC) consistently demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with NAMPT inhibitors. Additional analysis revealed several baseline genomic and proteomic markers that were strongly associated with response to NAMPT inhibition. Our screening process provides a comprehensive overview of the cancer types and subtypes that demonstrate sensitivity to NAMPT inhibition. Furthermore, the molecular predictors of response identified in our screen may ultimately be useful in developing diagnostic tools for enrollment in biomarker-enriched clinical trials aimed at determining the potential use of NAMPT inhibitors.

Early detection of chemoresistance would help reduce the usage of ineffective and possibly toxic therapies and facilitate alternative treatment strategies. We present a new technique combining phasor-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (phasor-FLIM) and a machine learning algorithm that quantitatively identifies chemoresistant single cells, which may also be potentially applicable for evaluating heterogeneous circulating tumor cells (CTCs) obtained by liquid biopsy. We used parental HCT116 CRC cells sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a common chemotherapeutic agent used in CRC, to generate a cell line resistant to 5-FU; we confirmed resistance by a cell proliferation assay (MTS). We then analyzed phasor-FLIM patterns in sensitive and resistant cells before and after treatment with 5-FU of two endogenously fluorescent biomarkers, NADH and NADPH, which are key co-enzymes involved in energy metabolism. This was performed at 21% and 1% oxygen, which simulates both standard cell culture and tumor hypoxic conditions. Differences in phasor-FLIM signatures were found in resistant cells that suggested upregulation of the electron transport chain under normoxia (21% oxygen) and reprogrammed glucose metabolism under hypoxia (1% oxygen). Such changes were confirmed using NADH, lactate, and pyruvate production colorimetric tests, which are readouts of energy metabolism. To improve the quantification of changes in phasor-FLIM patterns, a new drug resistance indexing algorithm was developed to separate sensitive and resistant cells based on fluorescence lifetime multiparametric analysis of the intrinsic fluorescent biomarkers at the single-cell level. We then used single-cell total RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to explore gene expression differences between sensitive and resistant HCT116 cells. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering showed a clear separation of 5-FU-sensitive and -resistant cells. There was increased expression of proliferation markers in resistant cells and upregulation of genes involved in electron transport from NADPH to ferredoxin, consistent with our single-cell phasor-FLIM findings. We demonstrate proof of concept that the phasor-FLIM method combined with our new drug resistance indexing algorithm provides a marker-free technology for quantitatively assaying drug response and discriminating drug resistance at single-cell resolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e05e3a46-0dd4-4fbe-b9bd-ddf3bebc6bbf\/@z03B8ZJ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Fluorescence imaging,Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12529"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ning Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naveen Ramalingam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David King<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Banafshé Larijani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie S.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms of tumor growth, metastasis and adaptation, a comprehensive analysis of metabolic pathways is needed. Success of such studies requires rapid and reliable approaches for monitoring key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle. Due to its inherent robustness, sensitivity and broad dynamic range, bioluminescence detection provides an attractive opportunity for developing such assays. Here, we implement a panel of bioluminescent metabolite assays (glucose, lactate, glutamine\/glutamate, triglyceride\/glycerol, cholesterol esters\/cholesterol) to investigate the metabolic state of immune and cancer cells. We demonstrate flexibility of the assays in various volumes (96-, 384- well plates), sample types (2D, 3D cultures), automation platforms, and workflows, including detecting multiple metabolites in the same sample and monitoring metabolite changes over time by assaying multiple samples. We validate the performance of the assays by using metabolic pathway-specific inhibitors and demonstrating the utility of the assays as early indicators of cytotoxic T-cell activation. Finally, since metabolism is a dynamic process guided by fuel availability, we show the importance of medium composition when designing studies and suggest guidance for future work. In conclusion, understanding the crosstalk between tumor cells and their microenvironment is required for next-generation drug development. Bioluminescent metabolite assays provide the sensitivity, throughput and robustness required for rapid evaluation of changes in major metabolic pathways and are well suited for novel inhibitor screening and drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/415d4847-46a3-4f4c-b41f-73a44d1efa50\/@z03B8ZJ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Assay development,Tumor microenvironment,Glycolysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12530"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maggie Bach<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donna Leippe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natasha Karassina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Valley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Cali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jolanta Vidugiriene<\/i><\/presenter>.

Endocrine therapies can reduce glucose (GLC) and glutamine uptake and total cellular ATP production in BC cells, and the ability of cells to bypass this metabolic stress is fundamental to how endocrine therapies regulate BC growth in a way that leads to acquired endocrine resistance and cross-resistance to other drugs. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacylases. SIRT1 deacetylates histones and various transcription factors, and regulates GLC metabolism through TORC2, PGC1&#945;, FOXO1. SIRT3, activated by caloric restriction, modulates mitochondrial adaptation to low energy input. SIRT3 destabilizes HIF-1&#945;, and then regulates glycoytic gene expression. The role of SIRT3 in epigenetic regulation has been reported. Using Differential Dependency Network analysis to compare the wiring of the SIRTs and key metabolism-related genes in matched antiestrogen- sensitive <i>vs. <\/i>resistant BC cells, guided by gene related to the nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and associated with clinical outcome in ER+ patients treated with an endocrine therapy, we identifyed several novel signaling hubs including: CDKN2A (p16) Hub, linking SIRT3 to cell proliferation; TP53 Hub, linking SIRT5 to clinical resistance to aromatase inhibitors, cell survival and proliferation; ATM Hub that comprises ATM\/SIRT2\/SIRT4\/HIF1A and may functionally link endocrine resistance to chemoresistance, consistent with the relatively poor responses of ER+ BC to cytotoxic drugs. Hence, the ability of SIRTs to sense and respond to changes in energy, coupled with their deacetylase\/deacylase functions, could provide a mechanism for the cell to rewire signaling and maintain a newly acquired drug-resistant phenotype enabled by epigenetically maintained changes in genes that control metabolism. Using endocrine sensitive (LCC1) and resistant (LCC9) BC cells, we confirmed the higher expression of SIRT1 and 3 in LCC9, compared to LCC1 cells. We further showed an upregulation of SIRT3 expression within 24 hrs of Fulvestrant (1 &#181;M) treament (p=0.0176) in LCC1, but no effect was observed in LCC9 cells. Conversely, treatment with 17&#946;-estradiol (10 nM) did not significantly affect SIRT3 expression in either LCC1 or LCC9 cells. SIRT 1 expression in LCC1 cells was not regulated by ICI within 72 hrs of treatment. In ER+ BC patients, lower expression of SIRT3 is associated with poor relapse free survival (RFS) (HR=0.57; CI=0.43-0.76); p= 7.7x 10<sup>-5<\/sup>) whereas higher expression of SIRT5 is associated with poor RFS (HR=2.5; CI=0.99-6.59; p=4.4x10<sup>-2<\/sup>). We will use transfection assays for knockdown\/overexpression of SIRTs to investigate their roles in therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3aabcac5-045a-48cf-a6ae-77caba8053e5\/@z03B8ZJ8\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Sirtuins,Antiestrogens,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13946"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Karla A.

An overwhelming majority of this work has focused on the upstream metabolism of tryptophan, however, this has not resulted in clinical application. Using global metabolomic profiling of patient-derived brain tumors, we identify the downstream metabolism of tryptophan and accumulation of quinolinate (QA) as a metabolic node in glioblastoma and went on to demonstrate its critical role in promoting immune tolerance. QA acts as a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; in glioblastoma by inducing NMDA receptor activation and Foxo1\/PPAR&#947; signaling, resulting in amplification of immune suppressive macrophages. Using a genetically-engineered mouse model designed to inhibit production of QA, we identify kynureninase as a promising therapeutic target to revert the potent immune suppressive microenvironment in glioblastoma. These findings offer the scientific community an opportunity to revisit the biologic consequence of this pathway as it relates to oncogenesis and neurodegenerative disease and a framework for developing new immune modulatory agents to further clinical gains in these otherwise incurable diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0aafb4c-76ad-4643-8fb6-d6b4c42f0a2e\/@A03B8ZJ9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Macrophages,Immunosuppression,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13949"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pravin Kesarwani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiva Kant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antony Prabhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie L.

Andrographolide, a labdane diterpenoid that is the main bioactive component of the medicinal plant <i>Andrographis paniculata<\/i>, has shown a wide range of therapeutic potential against many factors including cancer. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that Andrographolide induces expression of DNA repair genes associated with double-strand break repair, cell growth suppression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in PCa <i>in vitro<\/i>. Andrographolide also showed an altered ATP production ratio between mitochondrial-ATP and glycolysis-ATP production in PC3 and 22RV1 cell lines treated with Andrographolide. However, the mechanism of action of Andrographolide in prostate cancer is not completely known. The objective of this study is to determine the role of Andrographolide in mtDNA damage, mitochondrial ROS production, and mitochondrial membrane potential in prostate cancer cell lines.<br \/>Methods: Prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and 22Rv1) were treated with Andrographolide (25&#956;M) for 24 and 48 hours. DNA isolated from treated and control cells was used to detect mtDNA damage using a PCR-based method. To evaluate ROS production, cells were incubated with MitoSOX and fluorescence detected using fluorescence microscopy. Membrane potential status was also determined with fluorescence microscopy, using the dye JC-1.<br \/>Results: Detection of mtDNA damage in PC3 cells treated with Andrographolide for 48 hours and in 22Rv1 cells treated with Andrographolide for 24 and 48 hours, show decreased mtDNA lesions in treated cells. Evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential shows membrane depolarization in 22Rv1 cells treated with Andrographolide. In addition, mitochondrial ROS production shows a 1.4-fold increase in 22Rv1 cells treated with Andrographolide for 24 hours.<br \/>Conclusion: This study shows that Andrographolide disrupts mitochondrial function in PC3 and 22Rv1 PCa cells, which in turn may trigger a metabolic phenotype leading to cell death PCa. This research could provide new insights into the role of Andrographolide in PCa altering bioenergetics and mitochondrial function, making Andrographolide a promising therapeutic candidate as a metabolic modulator and a chemo preventive agent in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dbaa84e6-379b-4719-8e86-0fcb251cee3b\/@A03B8ZJ9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,Mitochondrial DNA,Reactive oxygen species,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13950"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yarelis M.

Although prognosis for patients is positive overall, dedifferentiated thyroid tumors and invasive thyroid tumors are difficult to treat. There is one FDA approved targeted therapy in use for in BRAF mutant, highly dedifferentiated anaplastic thyroid cancer, a combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the ERK inhibitor trametinib. While this treatment improves outcomes, resistance is of great concern. In other cancers driven by BRAF mutations, particularly melanoma, a known driver of BRAF inhibitor resistance is enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. We therefore investigated the energetics of thyroid cancer cells to determine whether metabolic changes can drive resistance in thyroid cancer. We have previously determined sensitivity to dabrafenib by area under the curve to classify cell lines as sensitive or resistant (Hicks HM <i>et al<\/i>, 2021). We used CUTC5 cells as our primary model of intrinsically sensitive cells and CUTC60 cells to model intrinsic resistance. We observed both cell lines had similar basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR), however dabrafenib treatment reduced this in the sensitive CUTC5 cells and did not in the resistant CUTC60 cells. Additionally, maximum OCR was reduced in the CUTC5 cells with as little as 10 nM dabrafenib. In a preliminary experiment, CUTC60 cells were co-treated with dabrafenib and rotenone, an inhibitor of the electron transport chain, and synergistic inhibition of proliferation was observed. We further investigated energetics in the dabrafenib sensitive cell line KTC1 and KTC1-VA7, which are derived from KTC1 and BRAF-inhibitor resistant (Danysh BP <i>et al<\/i>, 2016). Unlike the other cells evaluated these cells did not have spare respiratory capacity. Additionally, dabrafenib treatment did not alter basal OCR except at the highest doses. Although, we did observe a reduction in glycolysis in the parental KTC1 upon dabrafenib treatment, which was not observed in the KTC1-VA7 cells. Sensitive CUTC5 cells also exhibited a greater decrease in glycolysis than resistant CUTC60 cells. From this, we conclude that glycolysis may contribute to dabrafenib resistance and merits further investigation. With regards to oxidative metabolism, we only observed a reduction in OCR in a dabrafenib sensitive cell line and there was synergistic inhibition in the resistant CUTC60 cells treated with both dabrafenib and rotenone, suggesting that oxidative metabolism aids the cells in tolerating BRAF inhibition. Further screening of dabrafenib sensitive and resistant cells is necessary to determine if this is a function of dabrafenib sensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Oxidative Phosphorylation,BRAF,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13951"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eric Bolf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Schweppe<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, much less attention has been given to the role of estrogen metabolism in carcinogenesis. Parent estrogens are metabolized to 2- and 4-hydroxyestrogens (2-OHEs and 4-OHEs) that can retain their estrogenic activity, form reactive quinones that cause DNA damage, or become inactivated primarily by the rate-limiting conjugation enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). The ability of 4-OHEs to induce genomic instability and the malignant transformation of human breast epithelial cells has been reported. Glucuronidation or sulfation of methylated hydroxyestrogens, produced by COMT, increases their solubility and facilitates their excretion via urine or feces. The extent to which catechol estrogens are methylated dictates, in part, their ability to initiate carcinogenesis verses protect against tumor formation. COMT is a ubiquitous polymorphic enzyme that is expressed in humans in both peripheral tissues (soluble, s-COMT) and the central nervous system (membrane-bound). The goal of the present study was to compare the rate at which human wild type (WT) s-COMT and its major polymorphic variant (V108M s-COMT) transfer the methyl group from <i>S<\/i>-adenosylmethionine to 2-OHE and 4-OHE. This was accomplished by expressing COMT in <i>E. coli<\/i>, followed by protein purification and steady state Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Production of methylated hydroxyestrogens (2-MeOEs and 4-MeOEs) was quantified using LC-MS\/MS methodology. The resulting data indicate that WT s-COMT methylates catechol estrogens more efficiently than V108M s-COMT. In addition, the specificity constant (k<sub>cat<\/sub>\/K<sub>M<\/sub>) of WT s-COMT for methylation of 4-OHE<sub>2<\/sub> was 12-fold greater than that of V108M s-COMT. The k<sub>cat<\/sub>\/K<sub>M<\/sub> of V108M s-COMT was 4-fold greater for 2-OHE<sub>2<\/sub> vs. 4-OHE<sub>2<\/sub>. Based on the enhanced catalytic efficiency of WT s-COMT in converting 2-OHEs to 2-MeOEs, 4-OHEs may have greater potential to cause DNA damage. Additional studies are needed to determine if the V108M s-COMT variant contributes to increased risk for cancer. These data provide novel insight into the potential mechanism by which 4-OHEs promote hormone-induced carcinogenesis.<br \/>This work was supported by an In Vino Vita Award from Fox Chase Cancer Center.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9fffd4cb-9845-4e28-8ade-600b2785f1b6\/@A03B8ZJ9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen metabolism,Enzyme Kinetics,Catechol-O-Methyltransferase ,Hydroxy Estrogen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13968"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel D.
