[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Fibroblast Activation Protein-&#945; (FAP) is a transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed on activated fibroblasts. It is a constitutively active 170 kDa serine protease and a member of the dipeptide peptidase (DPP) family, sharing ~50% homology with DPPIV. FAP expression is only rarely expressed in normal adult tissues and is overexpressed in many epithelial cancers through upregulation on cancer-associated fibroblasts present in the stroma of various types of tumor. POINT BioPharma is developing PNT6555, which comprises a DOTA chelator linked to a FAP-targeting moiety, for imaging and therapeutic applications.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>PNT6555 and its radiometal chelates were evaluated for potency, selectivity, biodistribution and efficacy using biochemical and cellular assays as well as imaging, biodistribution and efficacy studies in tumor bearing mice.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>PNT6555 and its gallium (<sup>nat<\/sup>Ga-PNT6555) and lutetium (<sup>nat<\/sup>Lu-PNT6555) chelates showed potent activity in FAP inhibition assays using human, mouse, and rat sources of FAP. PNT6555, <sup>nat<\/sup>Lu-PNT6555 and <sup>nat<\/sup>Ga-PNT6555 also showed significantly reduced potency when tested against PREP and DPPIV, two closely related homologous proteins. <i>In vivo<\/i> time-course biodistribution studies (by PET-imaging) with <sup>68<\/sup>Ga-PNT6555 showed rapid clearance of <sup>68<\/sup>Ga-PNT6555 from blood through the kidneys and urinary tract, with rising <sup>68<\/sup>Ga-PNT6555 activity observed in the tumor through 60 minutes. At 60 minutes, the tumor was the only site of significant retained activity (&#62;10 %ID\/g). <i>In vivo<\/i> biodistribution studies (by SPECT imaging and direct organ assay) with <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PNT6555 showed rapid renal clearance into the bladder. After 24 hours, the tumor was the only tissue with significant activity retention. Direct organ assay showed little <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PNT6555 accumulation and retention in normal tissues with a high level of tumor retention observed out to 168h (&#62;10 %ID\/g). Therapeutic studies, using a single dose of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PNT6555 or <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-PNT6555, were completed in pre-clinical mouse models of cancer.

RNA sequencing was performed using full-thickness leg skin at 5 days after radiation revealing major pathways regulated by F-PRT and S-PRT. In an endeavor to identify the full repertoire of cells and gene expression profiles that are involved in the sparing effects of FLASH PRT, we expanded our studies to include single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA seq) and examined additional time points such as Day 2 and Day 10 after radiation. Single-cell transcriptome libraries were generated on a 10X Genomics Chromium system. Datasets were acquired from cell samples derived and sequenced from pooled skin samples of three mice per group. Skin from the sequenced mice was also embedded for spatial analysis of gene expression.<br \/>Results: RNA sequencing revealed that F-PRT uniquely upregulates almost four times more genes compared to S-PRT (F-PRT-uniquely upregulated 489 genes vs S-PRT-uniquely upregulated 129 genes). Also, F-PRT uniquely downregulated 178 genes, compared to the 125 genes uniquely downregulated by S-PRT. GO analysis demonstrates that the keratinization and apoptosis pathways are uniquely upregulated by S-PRT, whereas F-PRT uniquely upregulates genes involved in vascular development pathway. During submission of the abstract, analysis of sc-RNA seq samples was pending.<br \/>Conclusion: Our comprehensive studies inform on the transcriptomic profiling of skin cell populations that are affected by F-PRT vs S-PRT; this insight will further spur discoveries on the biology of FLASH radiotherapy effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/628fe18f-abc4-4022-9844-39955d6ea454\/@w03B8ZFr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 Normal tissue\/cellular stress responses to radiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin,Single cell,Radiotherapy,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12887"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anastasia Velalopoulou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilias V.

Repair of DNA double strand breaks induced by RT are mediated by the protein kinase Ataxia Telangiectasia <i>mutated<\/i> (ATM). In this study, the novel ATM inhibitor WSD-0628 was evaluated in combination with RT using GBM and melanoma models. <i>In vitro<\/i> evaluation of 10uM WSD-0628 binding to a panel of potential drug targets, including receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and transporters, indicated a satisfactory safety profile with low risk for off-target liability. WSD-0628 potently inhibits ATM-mediated phosphorylation of the DNA damage response protein KAP1 in MCF-7 cells at sub-nanomolar (nM) concentrations (IC50 0.42nM) in comparison to much less potent inhibition of the related kinases ATR (phosphorylation of CHK1, IC50 742nM) or DNA-PKcs (auto-phosphorylation of DNA-PK, IC50 169nM) in HT29 cells assessed by ELISA. In U251 GBM cells, 30 nM WSD-0628 potently inhibited RT-induced phospho-KAP1 and robustly reduced clonogenic survival by 5-fold when combined with 5 Gy irradiation (combination vs RT alone, p&#60;0.01). Similar potent radiosensitizing effects were seen in a melanoma brain metastasis PDX line M12 (10nM WSD-0628+IR-5Gy 1% survival vs 5% survival with IR-5Gy alone. p&#60;0.01), and the SV-40 transformed astrocyte line SVG-A (10nM WSD-0628 + IR-2.5Gy survival 0.2% vs 15% with IR-2.5Gy alone. p&#60;0.01). Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of WSD-0628 in mice 2h after a single 5 mg\/kg oral dose reveals a high level of free drug availability in the brain (34nM) and in the CSF (50nM) with little to no Pgp\/BCRP substrate liability. An initial <i>in vivo<\/i> dose finding study in orthotopic GBM43 PDX yielded significant benefit with WSD-0628 at either 5 or 10 mg\/kg PO daily when combined with radiation (2Gy QD for 5 days); Median survival for sham RT (29d) or RT alone (34d) were significantly different from RT combinations with 5 mg\/kg (54d) and 10 mg\/kg (73d; p&#60;0.01 for both dose levels), although the higher dose combination was poorly tolerated with body weight loss between 15-20% one week after RT completion. Dosing of WSD-0628 (7.5 mg\/kg PO, QD) given just before and 24h after a single dose of RT (12.5Gy) in mice with orthotopic M12 was well tolerated and provided robust radiosensitizing effects with median survival for combination treatment of over 180d vs 17d for control and 49d with RT alone groups (combination vs RT alone, p=0.04). Collectively, these results suggest a promising role for WSD-0628 in combination with RT in GBM and melanoma metastatic to the brain.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9327bceb-0809-4367-833e-34b77352e44c\/@w03B8ZFr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12889"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ann Mladek Tuma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lily Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danielle M.

In addition, upregulation of HER3 in response to HER1 or HER2 targeted therapies, is implicated in the acquired resistance against these therapies. Therefore, effective targeting of HER3 can potentially overcome resistance and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Although a number of anti-HER3 antibodies have failed clinical testing with the development focus being shifted to other approaches such as antibody drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies, there are currently no approved HER3-targeted therapies. Here we describe a novel approach that can enhance therapeutic efficacy in HER3+ cancer patients by conjugating an anti-HER3 antibody with the alpha-emitting cytotoxic radioisotope Actinium-225 (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac) to create an anti-HER3 antibody radiation conjugate (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC). Alpha emitting radioisotopes like <sup>225<\/sup>Ac can cause double-strand DNA breaks for which there is no known resistance mechanism. Due to the cytotoxic properties of the radioisotope, lower levels of antibody may be needed, resulting in reduced incidence or less severe toxicities. We hypothesize that targeting HER3 in solid tumors with an ARC will result in tumor specific cell killing especially in a setting where HER-targeting agents are not a viable option. We developed a novel <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC and evaluated its efficacy in HER3<sup>+<\/sup> in vitro and in vivo tumor models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> AT-02, an anti-HER3 antibody, was conjugated with <i>p<\/i>-SCN-Bn-DOTA and radiolabeled with <sup>225<\/sup>Ac. <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC specific binding to HER3 was assessed by ELISA using human recombinant HER3 and by flow cytometry on HER3<sup>+<\/sup> cells. The cytotoxic effect of HER3 ARC was evaluated in a panel of HER3 expressing cells. We further evaluated the maximum tolerated dose and therapeutic efficacy of the ARC in nude mice bearing human HER3<sup>+<\/sup> xenograft tumors.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In this study we successfully radiolabeled anti-HER3 with <sup>225<\/sup>Ac. <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC showed similar binding properties to those of the native antibody by ELISA (HER3-ARC: EC<sub>50<\/sub> = 0.0017 &#181;g\/ml, HER3 EC<sub>50<\/sub> = 0.0022 &#181;g\/ml) and flow cytometry. Treatment with ARC was cytotoxic to HER3<sup>+<\/sup> cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC<sub>50<\/sub> = 54 kBq\/ml). <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC showed potent in vivo efficacy in preclinical solid tumor xenograft models that was correlated with the in vitro cytotoxicity findings. Treatment with <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC (7.4 - 22.2 kBq, 200 - 600 nCi) led to complete responses and significantly prolonged survival compared to control groups (p &#60; 0.0001).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our findings demonstrate that targeting HER3 with a novel <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-HER3-ARC results in potent tumor cell cytotoxicity and complete anti-tumor response in HER3 tumor xenograft model.

Despite its role in radioresistance in AR+ TNBC, the mechanistic role of AR and specifically its role in mediating DNA damage repair in response to radiation therapy (RT) remains unknown.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Nuclear fractionation experiments were performed to assess cellular localization of AR protein in AR+ TNBC cell lines (ACC-422, MDA-MB-453). Cells were cultured in media containing hormones (FBS) with treatment of enzalutamide (ENZA), apalutamide (APA), or darolutamide (DARO). Cells were alternatively cultured in media containing charcoal stripped serum (CSS) without hormones with R1881 stimulation. RNA-sequencing was performed to compare AR+ TNBC cells treated with CSS or R1881 stimulation alone or in combination with ionizing radiation. Reverse phase protein arrays were performed in cells treated with ENZA, RT, or combination treatment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> While stimulation with R1881 was sufficient to induce nuclear translocation of AR in MDA-MB-453 cells, AR inhibition with ENZA, APA, or DARO blocked AR nuclear translocation under CSS or FBS growth conditions. When cells were treated with R1881+RT, AR nuclear translocation was induced at similar or greater levels compared to R1881 alone in MDA-MB-453 and ACC-422 cells. Combination treatment of RT with ENZA in the presence of hormones reduced AR nuclear localization (39% reduction in MDA-MB-453 cells and 32% reduction in ACC-422 cells) compared to RT alone. These results suggest that decreased promoter region binding, and gene expression upregulation may be a mechanism of radiosensitization with AR inhibition. In addition, transcriptomic analyses demonstrated at least 979 genes differentially expressed in multiple models. Pathway analyses in these models showed common affected pathways included ECM-receptor interaction, PPAR-gamma activation, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the MAPK\/ERK signaling pathway. Proteomic analysis in the same cell lines identified apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell cycle pathway changes after RT when AR-signaling was blocked. Common affected pathways in combined analyses identified PI3K-Akt and MAPK\/ERK signaling pathway changes that may be responsible for this radiosensitizing phenotype.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data suggest that AR inhibition in AR+ TNBC is sufficient to inhibit AR nuclear translocation suggesting that AR may play a nuclear role in response to RT to promote DNA repair and radioresistance. We identify potential pathways, including ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the MAPK\/ERK signaling pathway that may be regulated by AR in response to RT and therefore may be responsible for radioresistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/69e51297-4af4-4469-b4a4-047bd633b62f\/@w03B8ZFr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Radiosensitization,Androgen receptor,Enzalutamide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12891"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna R.

To further investigate alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) induced by PARPi, we utilized syngeneic mouse models and showed that the combination of radiotherapy, PARPi, and PD-L1 blockade achieved superior tumor control effects. By applying single cell RNA sequencing technologies to the mouse tumors, we found that PARPi combined with CRT or immunotherapy significantly reprogrammed the tumor cells and TME, resulting in the increase of tumor-infiltrating T cells which elicit potent tumor control effects. Our data showed that PARPi sensitizes NSCLC tumors to CRT and immunotherapy through a combination of tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic phenomenon.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/107ebd27-f472-4f17-a07a-deed789d00c6\/@w03B8ZFr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Chemotherapy,Single cell,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12892"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rui Ye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaile Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yawei Qiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenna Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianzhong He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yifan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanshan Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emi Sei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Navin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Lin<\/i><\/presenter>.

GD2-SADA is comprised of an anti-GD2 single-chain variable fragment (scFv), an anti-DOTA scFv that binds specifically to DOTA metal chelates, such as <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-DOTA, and a SADA domain based on the human P53 tetramerization sequence, which can self-assemble from a monomeric 60-kDa polypeptide into 240-kDa tetrameric protein. We have previously demonstrated (1) that GD2-SADA has a unique clearance profile that allowed for the delivery of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-DOTA to tumors with minimal exposure to normal tissues like the bone marrow or kidneys and shrank established neuroblastoma in preclinical mouse models. We now provide additional mechanistic data demonstrating the importance of the SADA domain in providing this potent anti-tumor function.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To study the role of the SADA domain, we designed a modified version of GD2-SADA that could not self-assemble into a tetrameric state by removing the entire SADA domain. The resulting P53(-\/-)GD2-SADA protein retained binding to GD2 and Lu-DOTA but remained in a 60 kDa monomeric state in assays. P53(-\/-)GD2-SADA and GD2-SADA were compared using SPR to measure antigen binding affinities, flow cytometry to evaluate cell binding, and in preclinical mouse models to evaluate tumor uptake and anti-tumor efficacy.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> GD2-SADA demonstrated stronger binding affinity to GD2 antigen compared to P53(-\/-)GD2-SADA, but comparable binding affinity to Lu-DOTA. In SPECT\/CT imaging studies using tumor bearing mice, GD2-SADA demonstrated substantially higher uptake and persistence in GD2-expressing tumors compared with P53(-\/-)GD2-SADA. Finally, treatment of tumor bearing mice with 3 cycles of GD2-SADA or P53(-\/-)GD2-SADA and <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-DOTA (once per week each for 3 weeks) resulted in potent anti-tumor responses from GD2-SADA, with only modest anti-tumor efficacy from P53(-\/-)GD2-SADA at two different dose levels corresponding to equal molar doses (1 GD2-SADA to 1 P53(-\/-)GD2-SADA) or equal mass doses (1 GD2-SADA to 4 P53(-\/-)GD2-SADA i.e. same number of binding sites).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The tetramerizing function of the SADA domain is critically important to the binding activity and anti-tumor efficacy of GD2 SADA. These data confirm that the SADA domain increases tumor antigen binding, uptake and persistence in tumor tissue, and markedly improves anti-tumor responses in preclinical models.<br \/><b>References:<\/b> Santich BH, Cheal SM, Ahmed M, McDevitt MR, Ouerfelli O, Yang G, et al.

Despite an initial response to treatment, patients eventually progress, and novel therapeutic approaches are required. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA; FOLH1) is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in prostate cancer but has limited expression in normal tissues. PSMA-TTC (227Th-pelgifatamab corixetan; BAY 2315497) consists of the alpha emitter thorium-227 complexed to a 3,2-HOPO chelator conjugated to a PSMA targeting antibody. PSMA-TTC delivers potent radiation to PSMA expressing cells. Here we evaluated the efficacy of PSMA-TTC in combination with darolutamide, a novel AR inhibitor in a hormone insensitive prostate cancer model and investigated the mode of action of the combination treatment. <i>In vitro,<\/i> darolutamide induced the expression of PSMA in the androgen-independent cell lines C4-2 and 22Rv1 more than 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively. Expression of the apoptosis marker CDKN1A was significantly induced in the PSMA-TTC alone and in the combination group compared to vehicle. Expression of the DNA repair genes BRCA1, XRCC2 and XRCC3 were significantly reduced in PSMA-TTC alone and in the combination group compared to vehicle. <i>In vivo,<\/i> a single i.v. injection of PSMA-TTC at 300 kBq\/kg resulted in a tumor\/control (T\/C) ratio of 0.44 on day 19 in the 22Rv1 hormone-insensitive prostate cancer model while a twice daily oral treatment with 100 mg\/kg darolutamide showed a T\/C ratio of 0.82. The combination of darolutamide and PSMA-TTC resulted in a higher efficacy with a T\/C ratio of 0.27. Tumor area on day 19 after treatment was significantly reduced in the PSMA-TTC alone group and more so in the combination group, compared to vehicle. As expected, darolutamide alone was not efficacious in this hormone insensitive model. Nine out of 10 mice showed disease control (CR, PR or SD) in the combination group whereas no animals showed disease control in either of the monotherapy groups. This difference was significant by Fisher&#8217;s exact test analysis. Treatments were well tolerated with no significant changes in body weight in any of the treatment groups. Using the tumor dissociation kit Miltenyi individual tumor cells were isolated from darolutamide treated and untreated 22Rv1 xenograft tumors. FACS analysis showed a 50fold increase in PSMA expression in the darolutamide treated 22Rv1 tumors compared to vehicle treated animals. These data indicate that darolutamide induces PSMA expression in the hormone independent 22Rv1 model, which may have contributed to the stronger efficacy observed when combined with PSMA-TTC. Altogether these results support the further evaluation of darolutamide combination with PSMA radionuclides.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/819a9a6d-619a-4015-816a-672e28201c5a\/@x03B8ZFs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PSMA,Prostate cancer,Radioimmunotherapy,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12897"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"65f652b5-cb9d-4b07-8579-721ad55a402f","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/65f652b5-cb9d-4b07-8579-721ad55a402f\/@x03B8ZFs\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christoph Schatz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Urs Hagemann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Zitzmann-Kolbe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernard Haendler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hartwig Hennekes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Hammer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arne Scholz<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therapy for patients with meningioma is individualized and comprised of a combination of surgery and\/or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy is not effective and there is no approved targeted treatment. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are warranted. We used CRISPR screening-based technology to uncover novel mechanisms of radiation resistance that may be therapeutically relevant in meningioma.<br \/>Methods: A patient-derived meningioma cell line with TRAF7\/KLF4 mutations (Tm77) was transduced with a Human Kinome CRISPR KnockOut (KO) library containing 3,052 RNA guides (sgRNA) targeting 763 kinase genes involved in cancer therapy. Following radiation, cells were collected (400x coverage) and analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). MAGeCK analysis was used to evaluate sgRNA enrichment and depletion.<b> <\/b>Radiation survival was determined by clonogenic analysis. Kinase activity and downstream signaling were assessed by phospho-blot analysis. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry and DNA damage was assessed by gH2AX immunofluorescence.<br \/>Results: Analysis of NGS results shows that after radiation ATM and DNA-PK sgRNAs were depleted (p&#60;0.001; FDR&#60;0.001), suggesting that the inhibition of either induces radiosensitivity. These genes, together with ATR, are involved in the DNA damage response induced by external stress such as radiation. ATM (AZD1930) and ATR (AZD6738) inhibitors were used to test the screening results. While AZD1390 reduces ATM signaling, gH2AX foci, and radiation survival with a dose enhancement ratio (DER) at 2Gy of 2; AZD6738 did not induce any changes in signaling, gH2AX foci, or radiosensitivity. These results indicate that inhibition of ATM can regulate radiation response in meningioma and thus validated the screening results. The CRISPR-Cas9 KO screen also identified a potential novel druggable target, GCN2. In the NGS analysis, GCN2 sgRNAs were enriched (p&#60;0.001; FDR&#60;0.005), and in agreement with this finding GCN2-KO enhanced radiation survival with a DER at 2Gy of 1.4. In contrast, halofuginone, a natural product that activates GCN2 reduced radiation survival in Tm77 with a DER at 2Gy of 1.25 through activation of ATF4 and cell cycle arrest. These effects were not observed in GCN2-KO cell lines. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, also activates ATF4 signaling, causes cell cycle arrest, and radiosensitization with a DER at 2Gy of 1.3.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>CRISPR-Cas9 KO screening provides a novel and unbiased approach to identify cellular targets that modify the response to radiation. These results suggests that the activation of ATF4 radiosensitizes meningioma. The evidence provided in this study supports further basic and preclinical research on approaches for activating GCN2 in combination with radiation therapy in meningioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27f9e5d3-0ae2-4948-949b-3af6a09195bc\/@x03B8ZFs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,MENINGIOMA,Radiation therapy,GCN2\/ATF4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12898"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marta Baro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murat Gunel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Moliterno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph N.

In these experiments, the goal is to establish the relationship between absorbed dose and cell survival probability. However, absorbed dose is not readily known and needs to be estimated. Current models to estimate this commonly idealize cells as biologically inert spheres (geometric model). This results in inaccurate and non-generalizable results, which could hamper the rigorous study of the underlying radiobiology. The purpose of this study was to estimate the variability in absorbed dose on a single-cell level by combining 3D measurements of cell geometries, as well as the dynamics of carrier molecule binding and trafficking in individual cells with full physics simulations of the alpha emissions. This comprehensive integration of the biological and physical aspects allows for a more accurate way to model cell survival in these &#945;RPT experiments. Live cells were imaged on a confocal microscope. Experimental conditions of previous cell survival experiments with <sup>212<\/sup>Pb on NT2.5 HER2+ breast cancer cells were replicated. A relevant antibody was tagged with AF488. 3D time lapses of membrane binding kinetics and internalization were recorded. All cells were segmented into nuclei, membrane and cytosol compartments using a purpose-build algorithm. Pharmacokinetic models were fit to the temporal antibody signals, which enabled validation with experimental binding assays. Monte Carlo simulations using the exact antibody locations in each time frame allowed for the precise estimation of dose rate over time. Single-cell absorbed dose estimates were used to model previously obtained cell survival curves. Over 300 cells were measured between 0 and 26 hours post incubation. A large range in absorbed doses was observed (coefficient of variation 0.74). The median contribution of membrane-bound activity to absorbed dose was in agreement with geometric models (error less than 6%). However the contribution of antibody internalization and perinuclear trafficking to absorbed dose varied widely between cells and over time. Cell clustering contributed 46% of the total dose, and was 6x higher than in the geometric model. Applying this to previous cell survival data yielded an estimated radiosensitivity kappa of 7.1 (geometric model: 2.8). Cell clustering has a larger, and cell geometry has a smaller impact than is assumed in current models. Perinuclear trafficking of internalized Ab positively impacts cell nucleus absorbed dose, which is typically ignored. Dose variability should be included in radiosensitivity modeling. More accurate absorbed dose estimations which result from a better understanding of the different contributing factors, will improve generalizability of the radiobiological models established in these cell monolayer experiments to more complex models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a9ab295-529e-4c37-bf6d-ace9ee20e516\/@x03B8ZFs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioimmunotherapy,In vitro,Modeling,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12899"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Remco Bastiaannet<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ioanna Liatsou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Hobbs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Sgouros<\/i><\/presenter>.

Aberrant HDAC activity is an indicator of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), generally leading to hypoacetylation of histones and a transcriptionally repressed chromatin state. Most noticeably, HDAC4 expression increases 61,000 % in brain tumors!<sup>1<\/sup> Upregulation of HDAC4 in human glioma cells (U87-MG) stimulates proliferation and invasiveness, making HDAC4 a therapeutic target. The effectiveness of pharmacological HDAC inhibitors is hampered by non-specific targeting and low selectivity, especially in solid tumors like GBM, and by side-effects with systemic delivery, e.g. cardiac toxicity.<sup>2<\/sup> Existing electroporation-based approaches to GBM aim to induce cell death either directly<sup>3<\/sup> or in combination with adjuvants such as excess extracellular calcium<sup>4<\/sup> or chemotherapy drugs<sup>5<\/sup>.A cytostatic approach is introduced in which the initial electroporation from non-thermal, localized &#181;sPEF exposure elicits downstream epigenetic responses that decrease cell proliferation, circumventing obstacles experienced by pharmacological agents. Accumulation of HDAC4 in the nucleus of U87-MG cells following exposure to &#181;sPEF is hypothesized to lead in a dose-dependent manner to cell death via apoptosis and decreased proliferation.A BTX GeminiX2 electroporator delivered square-wave &#181;sPEF of 100 &#181;s and 1.45 kV\/cm, while the number of pulses (0, 1, 10, 20 pulses, delivered at 1 Hz) were varied to determine thresholds for HDAC4 translocation and proliferation reduction of U87-MG cells. For immunofluorescence assay to track HDAC4 location at 3 h after exposure, cells were cultured and exposed on glass-bottom dishes. For MTT and ATP kinase assays, cells were exposed in electroporation cuvettes and transferred to 96-well plates to measure proliferation at 6, 24 and 72 h after exposure.<b> <\/b>The ratio of HDAC4 in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm (N\/C ratio) more than doubles after 20 pulses, compared to sham control with no &#181;sPEF exposure. Cell concentration relative to control drops over 90 % given 20 pulses. Our data reflect the inhibition of cell proliferation and HDAC4 accumulation in nuclei. Although electroporation-based therapies for GBM have been studied pre-clinically, this study delves further into fundamental mechanisms and optimization of the energy delivered by &#181;sPEF exposure that induces cell death with respect to epigenetic modification.<br \/>1.

As radiation is a frontline treatment for HNSCC, we sought to uncover novel actionable targets that affect cellular responses to radiation therapy.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: We performed a kinome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen in UM-SCC47, FaDu, Cal27, and Detroit562 HNSCC cell lines using a multi-fraction radiation regimen as a selective pressure. These four cell lines were chosen to enhance molecular diversity as they represent the classical, atypical, basal, and mesenchymal transcriptional subtypes of HNSCC. sgRNAs from irradiated and unirradiated controls underwent Next Generation Sequencing, and the results were analyzed via MAGeCK analysis. This approach provided a systematic method to identify sgRNAs that were enriched (loss of gene causes radioresistance) or depleted (loss of gene causes radiosensitivity) following HNSCC cell radiation treatment.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Our results indicate that Cal27 and Detroit562 cell lines share multiple targets that govern cell responses to radiation despite the different mutational backgrounds and transcriptional subtypes. In particular, sgRNAs targeting ATM and PRKDC were significantly depleted in Cal27 and Detroit562 cells (FDR&#60;0.01, p&#60;0.01). ATM and PRKDC are regulators of the DNA damage response, and loss of function of these genes is known to radiosensitize cells. Therefore, depletion of sgRNAs targeting these genes serves as internal validation of our screening methodology. sgRNAs targeting JAK1 were enriched in the Cal27 and Detroit562 cell lines (FDR&#60;0.01, p&#60;0.01), suggesting that loss of JAK1 caused decreased radiation-induced cell death. As a role for JAK1 in the cell response to DNA damage has not been described, we sought to validate and characterize the role of JAK1 in HNSCC cell radiation treatment using JAK1 knockout (KO) cell lines. Clonogenic assays revealed that JAK1 KO cells were radioresistant when treated with both single and multi-fraction radiation regimens, validating the results of the CRISPR screen. We observed cell signaling changes consistent with loss of JAK1 including decreased phospho-STAT3 and IRF9 signaling. To uncover pathways that may contribute to JAK1 KO cell radioresistance, we performed bulk RNA sequencing of JAK1 KO and control cell lines. Our analysis revealed that JAK1 KO cells may undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition among other signaling changes.<br \/>Conclusion: The use of a CRISPR-Cas9 screen with radiation as a selective pressure revealed both known and novel targets that govern HNSCC cell line responses to radiation therapy. Loss of JAK1 causes radioresistance, and its role in HNSCC DNA damage response warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b5e239b2-6cee-4840-89ab-d03be0a1b6e8\/@x03B8ZFs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,CRISPR\/Cas9,Radiation,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12902"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vanessa M.

TTFields is believed to inhibit mitosis as its primary mechanism of action. We previously showed that TTFields exposure decreased the expression of FANC\/BRCA1 pathway genes, which play an essential role in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. As a result, DNA DSB repair under IR exposure is downregulated, and most importantly, the TTFields alone increased gH2AX foci and chromatid aberrations as a function of TTFields time exposure. The length of newly replicated DNA decreased and R-loop formation increased after TTFields treatment, suggesting replication stress is induced by TTFields. Our research revealed that TTFields are involved in DNA damage and replication stress pathways besides mitosis, thus, we predicted that, by applying TTFields first, a conditional vulnerability environment would be created, rendering cells more susceptible to agents like radiation and chemotherapy. In accordance with our hypothesis, radiation susceptibility increased when cells were exposed to TTFields prior to IR treatment compared to IR treatment followed by TTFields. The combination of TTFields together with Radiation has been tested in-vivo with the newly designed Inovivo system. To measure tumor growth delay caused by TTFields treatment, three distinct syngenic tumor mouse models were utilized, namely LLC (Murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma), KPC63 (Pancreatic Cancer) and MC38 (Colon Cancer). Although TTField exposure decreased tumor volume in the three mouse models tested, there was no statistically significant difference in tumor growth between the heat and TTField groups. In IR combination experiments, the MC38 mouse model was chosen since TTFields induced a greater TGD effect in this model. In the first Inovivo experiment, we combined TTFields and radiation therapy, which delayed tumor growth significantly. Following that, we tested the combined efficacy of two rounds of TTFields and radiation treatment. The tumor growth delay was more pronounced after two rounds of TTFields treatment compared to one, which confirms the hypothesis that TTFields treatment induces conditional vulnerability. The results are consistent with observations made by the researchers in the clinic that high compliance patients (who have received more exposure to TTFields) have better prognosis compared to low compliance patients. Our inovivo experiment results not only confirm our earlier in vitro results, but also support the use of TTFields in IR combination therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bea09003-27f6-4426-b2e1-0d6eaba50296\/@x03B8ZFs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Radiotherapy,Lung cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12903"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Narasimha Kumar Karanam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zengfu Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael D.

FAP-2286 and FAPI-46 are radiotracers in clinical development that target FAP through different modalities: FAP-2286 employs a peptide macrocycle, whereas FAPI-46 is a quinoline-based small molecule. Here, the biochemical and cellular properties of FAP-2286 and FAPI-46 were evaluated, as well as their in vivo biodistribution and efficacy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> FAP-2286 and FAPI-46 were assessed in biochemical and cellular assays for affinity to FAP and cellular uptake.

PSMA-targeted thorium-227 conjugate (PSMA-TTC, BAY 2315497) consists of a human PSMA-targeting antibody covalently linked to a 3,2-HOPO (hydroxypyridinone) chelator moiety, radiolabeled with alpha-particle emitting thorium-227. Previous studies have demonstrated PSMA-TTC to be an attractive therapy option for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In this study, we investigated the efficacy of PSMA-TTC in the LNCaP intratibial model mimicking prostate cancer metastasized to bone.<br \/>LNCaP prostate cancer cells were inoculated into the right tibiae of male NOD.scid mice. The mice were randomized to treatment groups (n=12\/group) based on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and treated with a single dose of vehicle or PSMA-TTC (300 kBq\/kg, 0.75 mg\/kg, i.v.). Tumor growth was followed by biweekly serum PSA measurements for 42 days. Tumor-induced abnormal bone growth, PSMA-TTC uptake, bone microarchitecture, bone formation rate and tumor area in tumor-bearing tibiae were determined by radiography, gamma counter, microCT, and dynamic and static histomorphometry, respectively.<br \/>A single injection of PSMA-TTC efficiently inhibited intratibial tumor growth (p&#60;0.001) as evidenced by a 82.6% decrease from baseline PSA value in the treatment group at the end of the study, whereas the vehicle group increased by 380% from baseline. Furthermore, the tumor-bearing tibiae were heavier (138%) than the non-tumor-bearing tibiae in the vehicle group, whereas in the PSMA-TTC-treated mice no such difference was observed (103%). PSMA-TTC decreased tumor-induced abnormal bone area in the tumor-bearing tibiae (43.5% of the vehicle). PSMA&#8209;TTC uptake relative to tibia weight was higher in the tumor-bearing tibiae compared with the non-tumor-bearing tibiae, resulting in higher levels of thorium-227 and its daughter isotype radium-223 both 3 days and 3 weeks post injection.<br \/>In this preclinical study, PSMA-TTC showed robust antitumor efficacy, for the first time, in a model mimicking prostate cancer metastasized to bone as evidenced by a decrease in serum PSA levels, tumor-induced abnormal bone changes, and tumor-bearing tibia weights in the PSMA-TTC-treated mice. PSMA-TTC binds to PSMA-expressing cancer cells, delivering a cytotoxic dose of alpha radiation. The decay product of thorium-227, radium-223 binds to bone matrix and this could also contribute to the antitumor efficacy in this bone-metastatic model. Taken together, our data indicate activity of PSMA-TTC in bone-metastatic CRPC. PSMA-TTC as a monotherapy as well as in combination with darolutamide is currently being investigated in patients with mCRPC in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03724747).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/12a46067-ff5f-4028-a023-03d10694860a\/@x03B8ZFs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted alpha therapy,Prostate cancer,Bone metastasis,PSMA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12905"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"2395adda-2e98-4b43-96f6-39f0398d67e6","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2395adda-2e98-4b43-96f6-39f0398d67e6\/@x03B8ZFs\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Christoph Schatz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mari I.

Acute RILT, pneumonitis, is an early inflammatory-driven toxicity that develops within weeks to months following RT. Purified poloxamer 188 (PP188) is a triblock copolymer that associates with and protects cell membranes from oxidative insult, minimizing secondary inflammatory damage. This study aimed to investigate the effects of PP188 to mitigate the onset of acute radiation pneumonitis in a rat model of RILT, and to test the effect of PP188 on the efficacy of RT on tumor growth of a syngeneic CT26.WT murine colon carcinoma in Balb\/c mice. To evaluate the efficacy of PP188 to mitigate RILT in healthy tissues, Sprague Dawley rats were given 200mg\/kg PP188 or vehicle via IV 1hr prior to a single dose of partial volume (6mm) 20Gy X-irradiation to the right lung, and then were followed for 6 weeks. To validate PP188 treatment does not interfere with RT efficacy to reduce tumor volume, Balb\/c mice were implanted with CT26.WT murine colon adenocarcinoma in the high axilla space, given 5Gy SARRP irradiation, and tumor volume was monitored. Rats were evaluated for histopathological changes indicative of acute RILT, including leakage of proteins into alveolar space, thickening of alveolar septa, and alteration of bronchial epithelium and capillaries; for presence of inflammatory infiltrate (Hanker-Yates Peroxidase Leukocyte kit); and for immunohistochemical expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA). Without PP188, significant inflammatory infiltrate was observed in all lungs bilaterally (p&#60;0.001) contributing to significant bronchiole epithelium thickening (p&#60;0.001) and alveolar septa thickening (p&#60;0.001). Within the thickened alveoli there was significant SMA expression (p&#60;0.001) indicative of cells undergoing a myofibroblast transition that was not observed in the PP188+RT animals or controls. Morphological assessment demonstrated that PP188 significantly attenuated pathological changes in the functional subunits of the lung, alveoli, as well as the vasculature including bronchiole epithelium and small capillaries, with no significant differences from control animals. Finally, it was shown that PP188 does not abrogate radiation-induced tumor volume reduction. The unique mechanism of PP188 provides radioprotection to healthy tissue without interfering with tumor control, and has the potential to mitigate radiation-induced toxicities in the majority of cancers treated with RT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/694ffe36-d40c-430a-b24f-8fea7ffe287e\/@y03B8ZFt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Toxicity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12906"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah G.

Our group has designed and tested the first system to accurately deliver dosimetrically identical FLASH Proton RT (F-PRT; 60-110 Gy\/sec) or Standard Proton RT (S-PRT; 0.5-1 Gy\/sec) using double-scattered protons. Our purpose is to identify if F-PRT is superior to S-PRT in protecting normal tissues, while equipotent in controlling tumor growth. We previously demonstrated that compared to S-PRT, F-PRT significantly decreases overall mortality from late epithelial gastrointestinal (GI) fibrosis (p&#60;0.005) in mouse models following 14 (males) and 15 Gy (females) whole-abdomen and 18 Gy focal intestinal RT, whereas tumor growth inhibition is essentially indistinguishable between the two modalities. We also found that F-PRT-treated mice displayed a significantly higher percentage of regenerated crypts (EdU incorporation) in comparison to the S-PRT (p&#60;0.01). To better understand the differential responses of the normal intestine between the two treatment modalities, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 14 Gy F-PRT and S-PRT-treated intestines at 2, 10, and 20 days post-RT. Analysis revealed enrichment of stem\/progenitor epithelial cell populations with increased proliferative signatures and expression of genes related to the interferon-alpha signature in epithelial and immune cells post F-PRT treatment compared to the S-PRT. Immunofluorescence staining of F-PRT and S-PRT treated intestinal tissues confirmed a) the higher proliferation rate of epithelial cells observed in F-PRT-treated mice, b) significantly higher number of infiltrated immune cells in F-PRT- compared to the S-PRT-treated mice and c) higher expression of interferon signaling in immune cells in F-PRT treated mice. Collectively, our preliminary findings suggest that F-PRT may enhance a regenerative or facultative stem cell program that is associated with greater and more persistent IFN Type I signaling. Moreover, using a model of epithelial-specific knockout of p53 (Villin-Cre;p53), we found that mice treated with 13 Gy S-PRT quickly succumb to acute radiation GI syndrome, while F-PRT treated mice had significantly improved survival (median survival: 8.5 days for S-PRT vs 164 days for F-PRT; p&#60;0.05). This suggests that F-PRT may preserve a higher proportion of progenitor epithelial cells with enhanced regeneration potential. Understanding the cellular and molecular basis for the effects of F-PRT provides a framework for clinical application of this novel modality with the potential to improve the therapeutic outcome and quality of life of cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f74fde4-7562-47f3-853d-9f52aa22e188\/@y03B8ZFt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 Normal tissue\/cellular stress responses to radiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblasts,Interferons,Immune cells,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12907"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ioannis I.
