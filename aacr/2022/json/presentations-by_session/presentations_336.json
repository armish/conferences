[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Individuals with cancer may be at higher risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, sufficient data are lacking in AF risk among breast cancer survivors, especially for the mid-to long-term risk of AF and the impact of cancer treatment on this association. We aimed to investigate the risk of incident AF in women diagnosed with breast cancer and evaluate the association by length of follow-up and breast cancer treatment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Using the Korean Health Insurance Service database, we studied 96,476 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer (aged&#8805;20 years) without prior history of AF and breast cancer and underwent breast cancer surgery between January 2007 and December 2013. They were matched 1:3 to a cancer-free population (n=289,428) based on birth year and sex and were followed to the end of 2018. Using ICD-10 codes (I48.0 to I48.4, I.48.9), AF was defined when it was a discharge diagnosis or was verified more than twice in an outpatient clinic. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of AF associated with breast cancer relative to the cancer-free population, adjusting for age, income, and comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, AF developed in 2,105 women with breast cancer (3.2 per 1,000 person-years). Mean age at baseline among participants was 49.6 years. Having breast cancer was associated with increased risk of AF (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.93-2.15). This association was stronger for women aged &#60;50 years (HR, 3.98; 95% CI, 3.59-4.40). When we repeated analyses with lag periods of two years to explore the possibility of reverse causation and mid-to long-term risk of AF (n=91,370), the association was largely attenuated but remained significant (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28 for total women and HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.38-1.86 for women aged &#60;50 years). However, no increased risk of AF was observed in women with breast cancer aged &#62;65 years. Compared with no use of anthracyclines and taxanes, respectively, ever use of anthracyclines and taxanes was associated with increased risk of AF after further adjusting for other cancer treatment modalities including use of trastuzumab, radiotherapy, and endocrine treatment (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.12-1.40 and HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.23-1.53, respectively). This association persisted only among women with breast cancer ever treated with anthracyclines when analysis was limited to those with two year-lag periods (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.45).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> In this large-scale nationwide cohort study in South Korea, women with breast cancer had an elevated risk of incident AF, especially for women with breast cancer younger than 50 years, regardless of the length of follow-up. Our findings also suggest that cardiotoxic side effects of cancer treatment such as use of anthracyclines might increase both short-term and mid-to long-term risk of AF among women with breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/242ee321-1d94-4d6b-b8a0-33caa89414d6\/@y03B8ZCQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,atrial fibrillation,cardiotoxicity,Anthracycline,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13500"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yong-Moon (\"Mark\") Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wonyoung Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yohwan Yeo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Hyun Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronda Henry-Tillman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Seok Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tasneem Z.

Circadian rhythms are 24 hour cycles that control physiologic processes including sleep. Disrupted circadian rhythms have been proposed as a cause of insomnia. Here, we describe the use of a novel biomarker, BloodCCD, to assess circadian rhythms from RNA-sequencing of blood samples from two independent clinical trials and one observational study. BloodCCD was adapted from Clock Correlation Distance (CCD), which assesses normal progression of the molecular circadian clock from gene expression in tissue samples. We used BloodCCD to interrogate whether 1) cancer patients and survivors with insomnia have disrupted circadian rhythms compared to healthy good sleepers, and 2) whether the degree of circadian disruption correlates with severity of insomnia in survivors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> For BloodCCD analysis, time-series RNA-sequencing of human blood from healthy subjects were used to construct a reference correlation matrix of 42 genes which oscillate with 24-hour rhythms. To assess the Aims, RNA-sequencing from patient and survivor blood samples were compared to this reference correlation matrix to generate a BloodCCD score. A higher score indicates a further distance from a healthy clock, and thus clock disruption. For the first Aim, blood RNA-sequencing from cancer patients undergoing active treatment and survivors at least 2-months post-treatment and with insomnia were compared to healthy good sleepers. For the second Aim, blood RNA-sequencing from cancer survivors with insomnia were assessed, stratified by Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Score into mild (ISI 10-14), moderate (ISI 15-21), and severe (ISI 22-28) insomnia.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Patients (n=28, 100% prostate cancer) and cancer survivors (n=497, ~72% breast cancer) had higher BloodCCD scores, indicating disrupted circadian clock, compared to healthy good sleepers (n=14), with scores of 9.98, 7.99, and 4.13, respectively. When cancer survivors were stratified by insomnia severity, those with severe insomnia (ISI 22-28) had the highest BloodCCD, 9.00, while those with moderate insomnia (ISI 15-21) had a score of 8.24 and those with mild insomnia (ISI 10-14) had the lowest score of 7.93, indicating that survivors with severe insomnia had a more disrupted circadian clock. All BloodCCD values were p &#60; 0.001 for each value compared to reference correlation.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> BloodCCD shows promise as a biomarker to biochemically detect disrupted circadian rhythms in cancer patients and survivors, and as a readout for insomnia severity.

The choice between these two treatment strategies is controversial as there are no standardized guidelines for clinical decision support. As such, there remains a critical unmet need to identity biomarkers to personalize the most effective treatment strategies. The primary objective of this study is to identify and validate radiomic biomarkers that predict treatment response among patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer treated with upfront surgical debulking.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Intratumoral radiomic features (n=308) were extracted from pre-treatment contrast-enhanced CT images; analyses were conducted to remove correlated, non-stable, and non-reproducible features. Patients treated with upfront surgery (N=182) were split into training (N=91) and test (N=91) cohorts and a cohort of patients treated with upfront neoadjuvant (N=116) was used to determine if the radiomic features were prognostic or predictive. Overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were the main endpoints. Classification and Regression Tree analysis was used to identity the most informative radiomic features in the training cohort, which were then analyzed in the test cohort and the upfront neoadjuvant cohort.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Decision tree analysis identified a volumetric feature, ROI volume center of mass (CoM) in X direction, as the most informative radiomic feature which stratified upfront surgery patients into high- and low-risk. In the training cohort, high-risk patients were associated with significantly worse OS versus low-risk patients (HR=2.01; 95% CI 1.07-3.77 vs. 1.00 and 5-year OS=39.9% vs. 56.1%, respectively; log-rank p-value=0.03). In the test cohort, the high- vs. low-risk patients were also associated with poor OS (HR=2.23; 95% CI 1.19-4.17 vs. 1.00 and 5-year OS=23.3% vs. 51.3%, respectively; log-rank p-value=0.01).

This treatment can cause significant toxicities and may require treatment modifications. Obesity and low muscle mass (=sarcopenia) may portend increased toxicity to chemotherapy and\/or radiation and may further affect mortality in rectal patients. The present study investigates associations of pre-treatment body composition parameters with toxicity in prospectively followed rectal cancer patients.<br \/><b>METHODS<\/b> This initial analysis includes data from n=320 stage II and III rectal cancer patients from four study sites of the ColoCare Study. All patients underwent neo-adjuvant treatment. Pre-treatment CT scans were semi-automatically segmented at spinal level L3 <i>vertebrae<\/i> using SliceOmatic + ABACS software v5.0 rev13 to quantify: subcutaneous and visceral fat area (SFA\/VFA, cm<sup>2<\/sup>) and skeletal muscle area (SMA, cm<sup>2<\/sup>). Information on toxicities was abstracted from medical charts and categorized into gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and other system-specific toxicities. Median values were calculated for continuous variables (e.g., age at diagnosis, VFA, SFA, and SMA) and compared among patients who did versus did not experience toxicities. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b> Among n=320 rectal cancer patients, n=48 (15%) patients experienced at least one toxicity that required treatment modification (defined as dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy). Patients who experienced toxicities were older (58 years <i>vs<\/i> 56 years), more likely to be male (63% <i>vs<\/i> 59%), and more likely to be diagnosed with stage III cancer (92% <i>vs<\/i> 69%) compared to patients who did not experience toxicities. Patients who had higher VFA (166 cm<sup>2<\/sup> <i>vs<\/i> 148 cm<sup>2<\/sup>), lower SFA (197 cm<sup>2 <\/sup><i>vs<\/i> 208 cm<sup>2<\/sup>), and lower SMA (144 cm<sup>2 <\/sup><i>vs<\/i> 147 cm<sup>2<\/sup>) were more likely to experience toxicities compared to patients with lower VFA, higher SFA, or higher SMA.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS<\/b> Body composition parameters may differ between rectal cancer patients who experience toxicities <i>versus<\/i> those who do not. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard analyses are underway to investigate in more detail the associations of body composition parameters (VFA, SFA, SMA), sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity with toxicity and survival in rectal cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e25ef832-3041-46e4-93de-52713ec564e8\/@z03B8ZCR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal,Obesity,Body composition,Treatment Toxicities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13491"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer Ose<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey T.

These extracellular vesicles (EVs) promote angiogenesis, premetastatic niches formation and the communication between the tumor and its environment. Ovarian cancer (OC) is a highly lethal tumor that typically spreads within the abdominal cavity rather than through the blood vessels. Based on this behavior, we aimed to study the presence of exosomes in ascitic fluid of OC patients and explore their potential as predictors of tumor volume and chemoresistance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We designed an observational prospective study in advanced OC patients who underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy or cytoreductive surgery at our institution. Abdominal washings of a cohort of non-cancer patients were collected as controls. All cases provided written consent. Clinical data and tumor genomic alterations (NGS, FoundationOne CDx) were recorded. EVs pellets were collected by ultracentrifugation and profiled by NTA and western blot (WB) (EVs markers: CD9, TSG101 and ALIX; non EVs related markers: ALB and APOB). PAX8, a protein characteristically expressed in OC cells, was used as a marker of tumor EVs. EVs proteins were quantified by BCA assay; mass spectrometry profiling is ongoing.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>45 peritoneal fluids from 40 OC patients (median age [range] 62 [44-79] years) and 29 peritoneal washings from controls have been collected. Our cohort comprise various histological subtypes (high-grade serous, n=32 [80%]; low-grade serous, n=2 [5%]; endometrioid, n=3 [8%)]; clear cells, n=2 [5%] and mucinous, n=1 [2%]) and tumor stages (TI-II, n=5 [12%]; TIII; n=24 [60%]; TIV, n=11 [28%]). Samples were collected either from primary, n=18 (40%); interval, n=15 (33%); or relapse surgery, n=12 (27%). Pathogenic BRCA events were detected in 25% of patients. Mean concentration of exosomes (MCE) was 6.5x10<sup>6 <\/sup>vs. 3.2x10<sup>6<\/sup> particles\/ml (p\/ml) in cases vs. controls (p&#60;0.0005). No differences in MCE were observed regarding stages I-II vs. stages III-IV (7.1x10<sup>6<\/sup> vs. 6.5x10<sup>6<\/sup> p\/ml; p=0.84), <i>BRCA<\/i> status (mutant=6.9x10<sup>6<\/sup> vs. wild type=6.8x10<sup>6<\/sup> p\/ml, p=0.46) or platinum response (resistant=7.7x10<sup>6<\/sup> vs. sensitive=9.5x10<sup>6<\/sup> p\/ml, p=0.14). WB analysis showed an enrichment in EVs markers from cancer patients vs. controls (&#62;3-fold). Protein mean concentration in EVs of cancer patients vs. controls was 0.85&#181;g\/&#181;l and 0.51&#181;g\/&#181;l respectively (p=0.04). Proteomic characterization through mass spectrometry is ongoing and will be presented at the time of the meeting.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data, although preliminary, show a higher concentration of EVs and EVs proteins in OC cases vs controls with no difference between stages or genomic backgrounds. These results lead to the notion that exosomes could be involved in OC evolution and spread regardless of tumor volume or the molecular subtype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/242de432-123b-43ec-9fe2-5b8e0b1a37ae\/@z03B8ZCR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Exosomes,Peritoneal fluid,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13462"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Miguel Quiralte<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arantzazu Barquin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Sevillano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paloma Navarro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Yagüe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Barba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan F.

Our goal was to build a contextual understanding of the needs of patients and clinical staff in a large urban NCI-designated cancer center to inform strategies for creating smoking cessation services for all patients. During one-on-one interviews with patients (n=13) and clinical stakeholders (n=9), we asked about experiences receiving or providing cessation support during treatment, as well as views on patients&#8217; readiness and needs regarding cessation. Transcribed interviews were coded thematically using Green&#8217;s predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing influences on cessation service delivery, uptake by patients, and successful cessation, identifying factors as having positive, negative, or mixed impact on each of these three influences. Patient-identified positive predisposing factors to cessation included cancer diagnosis as a wake-up call, health problems, persistent healthcare providers, and cost of cigarettes. Identified negative predisposing factors were excessive pestering by providers and the futility of quitting with an existing diagnosis. Family, friends, intrinsic motivation, and fear played a mixed role. Patients felt developing other ways to deal with stress, cessation programs, and laws and policies could enable them to quit. Negative enablers included cost and time commitment of cessation programs and busy healthcare providers. The role of medication was uncertain. Reinforcement for quit attempts came via societal disapproval of smoking, encouragement, and positive health effects. Negative reinforcers included addiction, anxiety relief via smoking, and triggers from other smokers. Providers identified similar positive predisposing factors as patients, but also felt that providers could be less predisposed to facilitate cessation due to its physical and psychological burden on patients, &#8220;therapeutic nihilism&#8221; in the medical community, and patients&#8217; limited health literacy, with differing opinions on the role of cessation services in the cancer treatment process. Enabling barriers included lack of a standardized approach, limited time with patients, lack of training in cessation, and perceived barriers for patients in accessing cessation resources. NCI policies, as well as clinicians&#8217; personal experiences with smoking could reinforce the value of cessation efforts but extra work and lack of follow-up when working with cessation programs, and a lack of readiness to quit in many patients served as negative reinforcement. Findings illustrate unmet needs for patients and providers related to cessation and provision of comprehensive cessation care. Results can inform development of improved cessation programs in cancer centers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bbaca861-dd56-42d4-ac13-606bc235a2c8\/@z03B8ZCR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tobacco,Survival,Cessation,Policy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13495"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luke M.

Only a few studies have examined this relation separately by molecular features of the tumor; two observed poorer outcomes for women with hormone receptor positive tumors. A better understanding of the relation between time since last birth and risk of recurrence and death could lead to targeted treatments and\/or surveillance of young women who develop breast cancer within 10 years of giving birth. There has been little research on this topic among Black women, who have a higher incidence of breast cancer at young ages compared to White women. We assessed the relation of time since last birth to breast cancer mortality according to estrogen receptor (ER) status of the primary tumor among breast cancer patients who are participants in the prospective Black Women&#8217;s Health Study (BWHS).<br \/>The BWHS includes 59,000 U.S. Black women who enrolled in the study in 1995 and have been followed by biennial questionnaire since then. The present analysis was restricted to parous women diagnosed before age 50 (N=658) because older patients would have been unlikely to have given birth within the past 10 years. ER status was positive for 348 cases, negative for 199, and unknown for 111. Follow-up time was from time of diagnosis to death or the end of 2018, whichever came first. Cox regression analysis, adjusted for age and stage at diagnosis, was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer specific death for women diagnosed &#60;10 years since last birth relative to women diagnosed &#8805;10 years since last birth.<br \/>The median age at diagnosis was 44, with 41% of cancers diagnosed at stage I, 43% at stage II, and 16% at stage III. About a third (31%) had given birth &#38;lt10 years before diagnosis. During follow-up, there were 159 total deaths, 132 of which were due to breast cancer. Among women diagnosed with ER-positive breast cancer, the HR for breast cancer death for women who gave birth &#38;lt10 years prior to diagnosis relative to women who had not had a recent birth was 2.45 (95% 1.07-5.58). The association was even stronger among women who survived the first five years, with an HR of 3.38 (95% CI 1.34-8.51). Time since last birth was not associated with ER-negative breast cancer mortality (HR 1.06, 95 % CI 0.46-2.46).<br \/>Late recurrences are a particular problem with ER-positive breast cancer. The present findings suggest a relatively short interval (e.g., &#38;lt10 years) between childbirth and a breast cancer diagnosis may increase risk of a late recurrence and death from ER-positive breast cancer. Greater awareness of this association may lead to improved surveillance of survivors of early-onset breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f329ec84-11ac-4160-a9b1-c5a5c9b50c67\/@z03B8ZCR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Survival,Pregnancy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13499"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gary R.

Multiple studies have found that cancer survivors report poorer sleep than the general population. More than 3 million men in the US are prostate cancer survivors, yet few existing studies have focused on sleep in this population, especially among men with metastatic disease. Thus, a better understanding of sleep problems among prostate cancer survivors could help characterize how sleep affects the quality of life among men with prostate cancer.<br \/>Aim<b>:<\/b> To describe sleep behaviors and problems among prostate cancer survivors overall and specifically among those with metastatic disease.<br \/>Methods<b>:<\/b> Self-reported sleep data, including sleep disruption, sleep apnea, and insomnia, were obtained from the 2018 Prostate Cancer Follow-up Survey (PCFS) administered to participants of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study with a diagnosis of prostate cancer. We evaluated each item individually and calculated a score for clinical insomnia using the validated Women&#8217;s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (range 1-20; score &#62;10 indicative of clinically relevant insomnia). Descriptive analyses on sleep measures were conducted overall and stratified by metastatic disease. We utilized multivariable linear regression models to compare metastatic disease status and insomnia score, adjusting for age, race, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, and other health information.<br \/>Results: Of 2,431 men (median age: 83 years) who completed the 2018 survey, 87 had metastatic disease, de novo or men who progressed after diagnosis. Sleep disturbances were relatively common in this population. Among all men with prostate cancer, 33% (n=290) reported waking up several times a night five or more times a week, 14% (n=337) rated their sleep quality as restless, and 15% (n=368) reported a clinical diagnosis with sleep apnea. The Insomnia Rating Scale scores were relatively high among all prostate cancer survivors with a mean score of 9.0 (95% CI 6.0-12.0). Scores significantly differed by metastatic disease status and men with metastatic disease had scores that were 1.30 (95% CI 0.19-2.41) points higher than men without metastatic disease.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>The growing global number of prostate cancer survivors with metastatic disease and the potentially high prevalence of negative cancer-related quality of life effects pose pressing challenges to health systems. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbances are common among prostate cancer survivors. Men with metastatic disease had poorer sleep overall and higher rates of clinical insomnia than men without metastatic disease. These results could highlight the importance of sleep among men with prostate cancer and could increase the clinical treatment of sleep problems.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2f683689-be31-418e-9dd2-8772a87b6129\/@z03B8ZCR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Sleep,Prostate Cancer,Cancer Survivorship,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13498"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alaina H.

No studies have prospectively examined association of angiogenesis-related biomarkers with clinical outcomes in colon and rectal cancer.<br \/>Patients and Methods: In pre-surgery serum samples from n=426 non-metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (stage I-III), we investigated associations of inflammatory (e.g., CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1) and angiogenesis biomarkers (VEGF-A, VEGF-D) with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and risk of recurrence. We computed hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, stage, tumor site, and study site, and also exploratory stratified by tumor site (colon <i>vs. <\/i>rectum).<br \/>Results: N=65 patients (15%) were deceased and n=59 patients (15%) had a recurrence after a median follow-up of 31 months. Overall, doubling of CRP was associated with a ~24% increase in risk of death (OS: HR<sub>log2<\/sub>: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.11-1.40), a 19% increase in risk of recurrence: HR<sub>log2<\/sub>: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.08-1.32, and a non-statistically-significant 12% increase for DFS HR<sub>log2<\/sub>: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.98-1.28.

For the angiogenesis marker VEGF-D, significant heterogeneity was observed in analyses stratified by tumor site: doubling was associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of death for rectal cancer (OS: HR: 3.26; 95% CI: 1.58-6.70) and a 22% reduction in mortality for colon cancer (OS: HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.35-1.73; p<sub>heterogenity <\/sub>&#60;0.001).

Associations with overall survival (OS) were quantified by Hazards Ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from Cox proportional hazards regression; multivariable adjustment included age, stage, grade, histologic subtype, treatment, race, and year of diagnosis.<br \/>Results: We evaluated 13,676 peri- and post-diagnosis BMI observations for 616 predominantly Caucasian (87.0%) cases; the majority had serous histology (62.5%), advanced stage (58.1% Stage III or IV), high grade (52.4% poorly or undifferentiated) disease. Compared to peri-diagnosis (median =29.0), BMI was lowest 6 months post-diagnosis (median=27.4) and then gradually increased over time among survivors. In multivariable adjusted models, each 5-unit increase in mean peri-diagnosis BMI corresponded with a nonsignificant increase (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97-1.18) while higher mean post-diagnosis BMI corresponded to a significantly decreased risk of death (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.84-1.00). Adjusted models that incorporated all peri- and post-diagnosis BMI observations evaluated indicated that each 5-unit increase in BMI was associated with a 15% reduced risk of death (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.77-0.94).<br \/>Conclusions: Whereas lower adiposity may be beneficial in terms of risk, higher adiposity appears to benefit ovarian cancer survival. Factors including cancer cachexia, weight loss among ill patients, and weight gain among survivors may contribute to this seemingly protective association. Additional research to disentangle the influence of BMI on ovarian cancer outcomes and inform adiposity guidance for ovarian cancer survivors is needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fa17912a-af84-43c0-b07a-fe4ca0d0a389\/@z03B8ZCR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Body mass index,Overall survival,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13505"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alicia Beeghly-Fadiel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharon Phillips<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Bukenya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pranoti Pradhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Duque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nneka Anyanwu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deok-Soo Son<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew J.
