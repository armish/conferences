[{"Abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Non-small lung cancer accounts for 85% of diagnoses and the predominant subtype is lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Previously, we identified a population of Tumor Propagating Cells (TPCs) in the Kras; TP53 GEM model of LUAD. We demonstrated that TPCs have a greater capacity for secondary tumor formation and are enriched after treatment. The TPC population is defined by the expression of CD24, ITGB4 and Notch, with further functional validation showing that Notch3 contributes to this propagation phenotype in a non-redundant fashion. To investigate the biology of these TPCs, we have produced a Kras<sup>FSFG12D<\/sup>; Tp53<sup>FRT\/FRT<\/sup>; Notch3CreER<sup>T2<\/sup>; RFP; inducible Diphtheria toxin receptor mouse (KP<sup>FF<\/sup>NRiDTR) for lineage tracing and ablation of Notch3 expressing tumor cells to get a granular understanding of the cell types\/progeny generated by Notch3 expressing cells and the effects of removing these cells on the tumor microenvironment.In this model, adenovirus expressing FLP is delivered intra-tracheally resulting in expression of an oncogenic form of Kras and deletion of TP53, initiating LUAD tumors. Upon administration of Tamoxifen, Notch3 expressing cells are labelled by induced expression of RFP and DTR, then these cells can be ablated by subsequent dosing with Diphtheria toxin. By labelling\/ablating cells at different disease progressions we can infer the importance of Notch signaling at key timepoints and assess the contribution of Notch3 expressing cells to the tumor microenvironment and tumor progression. We have found that Notch3 is expressed in the epithelial progenitors during early embryogenesis up to ~p5 and then gets turned off in the epithelial compartment of distal lung during alveologenesis, and in adults Notch3 is only expressed in the lung pericytes. Thus, the cell of origin for LUAD does not express Notch3, even if the TPC does, and we see the acquisition of Notch3 expression during early tumorigenesis. If we ablate Notch3 positive cells during this state we effectively prevent further growth of the tumors, however we still see similar tumor numbers at endpoint, suggesting that all lesions that will progress are already present when we ablate the TPCs. Considering that the total number of Notch3 cells in the tumor is approximated 1%, this is a profound effect on the overall growth of the tumor and suggests that the TPCs are fundamentally required for lung adenocarcinoma progression and may be a viable target for treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3edcf17b-f4c6-472a-990d-87e446bb5df7\/@q03B8ZM5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Microenvironment,Heterogeneity,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14259"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kieren D.

One particularly aggressive subtype is H3.3G34R mutant gliomas, which are currently incurable and in need of improved therapies. Interestingly, H3.3G34R mutant gliomas commonly harbor <i>TP53<\/i>mutations, <i>ATRX <\/i>mutations, and alterations in PDGFRA signaling. The mechanism by which H3.3G34R promotes gliomagenesis is still somewhat unclear and additional models are needed to dissect its role in tumorigenesis. We used the RCAS Tv-a system to model H3.3G34R pHGG in mice. Nestin expressing progenitors in the frontal cortex of Nestin-Tva (Ntva); p53 fl\/fl; ATRX fl\/fl or Ntva; p53 fl\/fl mice were infected with H3.3G34R or H3.3WT, PDGFA, and Cre, and monitored for signs and symptoms of tumor formation. RNAseq analysis and immunophenotype were used to characterize the tumors. We observed that H3.3G34R did not significantly impact tumor latency independent of ATRX status. ATRX loss significantly increased tumor latency independent of H3.3G34R (P &#60; 0.01) from 90 days to 143 days. H&#38;E analysis revealed that the majority of tumors in all groups were high grade and that mice with ATRX loss were more likely to develop low grade tumors though this trend did not reach significance (P = 0.075) . Expression of Ki67, GFAP and Olig2 was present in all groups, as shown by Immunophenotypic analysis. RNAseq analysis of murine tumor tissue revealed that ATRX loss in the context of G34R led to significant differential expression of 113 genes (78 upregulated and 35 downregulated) including upregulation of PRC2 target genes including HoxA genes. These findings highlight the cooperation between ATRX loss and H3.3G34R in gliomagenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/db266775-122b-46e6-887f-b400d2196f51\/@q03B8ZM5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Brain tumors,Transgenic mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14260"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aalaa Abdallah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Herminio J.

TPMs enhance <i>TERT<\/i> transcription, which is otherwise silenced in adult tissues, thus reactivating a <i>bone fide<\/i> oncoprotein. To study <i>TERT<\/i> deregulation and its downstream consequences in a biologically accurate model, we generated a <i>Tert<\/i>-mutant promoter mouse model via CRISPR\/Cas9 editing of the equivalent murine <i>locus<\/i> and crossed these animals with thyroid-specific Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>-mutant mice. Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup> animals develop highly penetrant papillary thyroid tumors (PTC) by week 5, but do not progress. In contrast, Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>+Tert<sup>MUT<\/sup> animals showed an increased incidence of poorly differentiated thyroid cancers (PDTC) by 20 weeks (30% <i>vs.<\/i> 0% in Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>; chi-squared <i>P<\/i>= 0.03), mimicking those exhibited by an alternative transgenic model of <i>Tert<\/i> overexpression (Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>+K5-Tert; 36% PDTCs). Mouse <i>Tert<\/i> promoter mutation increased <i>Tert<\/i> transcription <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, as reported in patients&#8217; tumors carrying TPMs. Braf+Tert animals partially responded to MAPK pathway inhibition (dabrafenib plus trametinib), showing that MAPK signaling remains relevant in these specimens. Interestingly, RNA sequencing of Tert-reactivated murine thyroid tumors showed unique transcriptomic profiles (compared to Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup> alone), suggesting that downstream effects, other than the canonical Tert-mediated telomere maintenance, operate in cancers harboring TPMs. These cancer models of telomerase reactivation provide excellent pre-clinical settings to understand the regulatory mechanisms and biological underpinnings of TPM-induced progression of thyroid and other tumors, and to explore novel therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf472b9c-979a-42e5-bf18-ecfec825b34a\/@q03B8ZM5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TERT,Thyroid cancer,Mouse models,Promoter,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14261"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Inigo Landa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingzhu Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bin Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Giacalone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zach Herbert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria A.

While much is known about the signaling pathways affecting breast cancer cell growth and apoptosis, the transcriptional programs driving these responses are less understood. C\/EBP&#946; is a transcription factor essential for proper cellular proliferation, differentiation, tissue function, metabolism, and the immune response, and is deregulated in breast cancer. C\/EBP&#946; and its protein isoform LIP have long been postulated to promote breast cancer progression, however, the precise mechanisms and gene regulatory networks induced by C\/EBP&#946; are less understood. Analysis of available human patient gene expression data reveals that increased <i>Cebpb<\/i> mRNA is associated with poor overall survival amongst all breast cancer subtypes, and analysis of available liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry data shows that increased C\/EBP&#946; total protein is associated with poor overall survival in triple-negative breast cancer patients. To test the function of C\/EBP&#946; in tumor initiation and progression, several genetic mouse models were generated. Genetic ablation of tumor C\/EBP&#946; in mouse models of basal-like [C3(1)TAg] and luminal (MMTV-Neu) breast cancers results in a complete block in mammary tumorigenesis. Interestingly, C\/EBP&#946;-null tumor cells upregulate genes involved in antigen presentation and interferon gamma response in vitro, while overexpression of the C\/EBP&#946;-LIP induces chemokines involved in immune cell recruitment and immunosuppression, such as CCL5. In support, RNA sequencing of human breast cancer cells shows that deletion of <i>Cebpb<\/i> in BT-20 cells causes de-repression of immune genes. Specifically, genes associated with interferon &#945; and &#947; signaling (<i>JAK1, TNFA, CCRL16, CSF2, IL32<\/i>) as well as genes involved in antigen processing and presentation (MHC class I and class II molecules) are upregulated in the absence of <i>Cebpb<\/i>. These data suggest that C\/EBP&#946; may repress genes important for immune visibility. Ongoing studies are aimed at identifying gene regulatory programs induced by C\/EBP&#946; and specifically by C\/EBP&#946;-LIP. These studies will have critical implications for whether C\/EBP&#946;-induced pathways can be targeted in combination with other drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, improving patient outcome.

Resection remains the only chance for long term survival though most patients die from metastatic recurrence. While most patients recur within the first two years, many develop recurrence much later indicating they harbor dormant disseminated tumor cells (dDTCs). Currently there are no murine models which recapitulate this disease pattern and as a result pancreatic cancer dormancy is poorly understood. We sought to better understand PDAC dormancy using a novel murine model of human pancreatic cancer from which we investigate the genetic and molecular contributions to dormancy. A model of resected PDAC was developed using murine PDAC cells expressing luciferase\/mCherry orthotopically implanted into FVB hosts. Primary tumors are resected after 4 weeks and mice followed for recurrence. dDTCs&#8217; are harvested from the livers of mice without evidence of recurrence by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and subjected to transcriptomic profiling using single cell RNA sequencing. Dec2&#8217;s contribution to dormancy was evaluated by overexpression and knockout using CRISPR. Overall survival in the mouse model mirrored 41,552 stage I, II PDAC patients from the National Cancer Database with similar frequency and location of recurrence. One third of mice exhibited latent recurrence with median survival of 568 days before succumbing to recurrence. These mice were used to study dDTCs. Transcriptomic profiling of FACS sorted dDTCs revealed a distinct transcriptome from primary tumors and early recurrences, indicating cell plasticity. dDTCs exhibited decreased proliferation markers and upregulated genes involved in immune modulation, cell stemness, linoleic acid (LA) metabolism, and Dec2. dDTCs were resistant to chemotherapy. An in vitro model of dormancy was constructed in which LA treatment inhibited cell proliferation and increased Dec2. Dec2 overexpression resulted in cell quiescence, and knockout increased apoptosis with LA exposure. Dec2-KO cells implanted in the murine model dramatically improved survival compared to Dec-WT cells (Dec2-WT median survival 30 days, Dec2-KO median survival was not reached, p=0.013). Livers of mice in the resection model where Dec2-KO cells were used had decreased dDTC burden with fewer mice showing detectable luciferase gDNA (p&#60;0.01) indicating that loss of Dec2 reduced survival of dDTC&#8217;s. This is the first murine model of pancreatic cancer dormancy that recapitulates outcomes of resected PDAC patients. These studies reveal pancreatic cancer dormancy is characterized by a distinct, plastic cellular state characterized by chemotherapy resistance. Dec2 appears required for dormancy, its absence leads to disseminated tumor cell apoptosis. This suggests Dec2 may be a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer dormancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c80615f4-b88f-42ac-8018-6594032ef1e3\/@q03B8ZM5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Mouse models,Pancreatic cancer,Pancreas,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14264"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3b807bf8-5c01-4a63-8511-20f0c6069376","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3b807bf8-5c01-4a63-8511-20f0c6069376\/@q03B8ZM5\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anthony S.

We have developed a streamlined platform for <i>in vivo<\/i> gene activation using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) technology. Our model system allows for flexible, sustained and timed activation of one or more target genes, <i>in vitro<\/i> or <i>in vivo<\/i>, using single or pooled lentiviral guides. Using Myc and Yap1 as model oncogenes, we implemented this platform to study the effect of oncogene activation on the tumorigenic potential of primary pancreatic organoids, as well as in an autochthonous model of lung adenocarcinoma. We found that Myc-activation in pancreatic organoids increased their tumorigenic potential and resulted in significantly shorter survival relative to controls when transplanted orthotopically<i>. <\/i><i>In vivo<\/i> Myc activation in the lung accelerated tumor progression and resulted in significantly shorter overall survival relative to non-targeted tumor controls. Furthermore, we found that Myc-activation drives the acquisition of an immune suppressive &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment. Through cross-species validation of our results, we were able to link MYC to a previously described, immunosuppressive transcriptomic subtype in patient tumors, thus identifying a patient cohort that may benefit from combined MYC\/immune-targeted therapies. Our work demonstrates how CRISPRa can be used for rapid functional validation of putative oncogenes and may allow for the identification and evaluation of potential metastatic and oncogenic drivers through competitive screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1181ce02-9ed1-44f9-ad34-35a99eeff0ed\/@r03B8ZM6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Oncogene,Organoids,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14266"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fredrik Ivar Thege<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dhwani N.

In 2021, there are an estimated 83,730 new cases and 17,200 deaths from bladder cancer. Only about 15% of patients with metastatic disease survive past five years. The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) is overexpressed in bladder tumors compared to corresponding healthy tissues. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cytidine to uracil playing an important physiologic role in restricting viral replication. When aberrantly over-expressed, APOBEC3B can damage single-stranded DNA present during DNA replication and transcription, resulting in an increased tumor mutational burden. Strikingly, APOBEC mutagenesis accounts for 70% of all single-nucleotide variants found in bladder cancer. Despite the strong evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis in bladder cancer, the effects of APOBEC3B on the disease progression remain unclear. To address this question, we generated the UPPA (urothelial specific over-expression of mouse Apobec3 along with Pten and p53 knock-out) and control UPP mouse models to interrogate the role Apobec3 in bladder cancer progression. Apobec3 over-expression shortened tumor latency in the UPPA model with the median tumor free survival time of 43.3 weeks compared to 53.6 weeks in the UPP model. Histological analysis showed that bladder epithelial cells in the UPPA mice underwent squamous differentiation which is associated with aggressive disease in human. Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis showed up-regulation of krt6a (a squamous marker) in UPPA urothelium compared to a complete lack of krt6a signal in the urothelium of UPP mice. Necropsy revealed the presence of metastatic nodules in lung, liver and peritoneum in UPPA mice. Cell lines derived from a matched pair of UPPA primary tumor and peritoneal metastatic tumor formed lung and liver nodules in wild-type C57BL\/6J mice via tail vein injection. Our results so far suggest that Apobec3 promotes tumor progression, squamous differentiation and metastasis. Additional work utilizing bladder organoids and scRNAseq are underway to unravel the mechanism by which Apobec3 promotes these observed phenotypes. Currently, single-cell RNAseq analysis on primary UPPA tumor demonstrated high degree to T cell infiltration. Approximately 60% of cells sequenced were annotated as T-cells and natural killer T-cells by SingleR. We treated mice bearing UPPA primary bladder tumors with anti-PD-1 antibody and observed significant tumor growth inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/42d209f4-60c4-4295-beac-64d0834c993e\/@r03B8ZM6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Mouse models,Tumorigenesis,Squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14267"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew S.

Identification of novel molecules regulating HCC facilitates development of targeted therapies having a lasting impact on HCC patient survival. The oncogene MDA-9\/SDCBP promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in many cancers. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 8% of HCC patients show amplification of MDA-9 gene. However, the role of MDA-9 in regulating HCC has not been well-studied.<br \/><b>Objective: <\/b>To unravel the function of MDA-9 in HCC<b> <\/b>using a transgenic mouse model with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of MDA-9 (Alb\/MDA-9).<b><br \/>Study design: <\/b>Alb\/MDA-9 mice were generated in B6\/CBA background by using the mouse albumin promoter\/enhancer element to drive human MDA-9 expression. N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)\/phenobarbital (PB) was used for induction of HCC. Tumor immune profile was analyzed by Opal multiplex staining and flow cytometry. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to analyze MDA-9-mediated gene regulation.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>At 18 months of age, none of the WT mice developed liver tumor, while one male and one female Alb\/MDA-9 mice (n = 11) developed one isolated tumor each, suggesting that MDA-9 may not be a strong driver oncogene, rather it might promote HCC progression once tumor is initiated. Indeed, at 32 weeks after induction of HCC using DEN\/PB, tumor burden in the livers of Alb\/MDA-9 mice was significantly higher compared to WT. These tumors showed loss of hepatic architecture and hepatocyte ballooning, features of HCC. Increased staining for the proliferation marker PCNA, HCC markers AFP and cytokeratin, and angiogenesis marker CD31 in tumor sections, and significantly increased levels of serum liver enzymes, AST and ALT, were observed in Alb\/MDA-9 mice vs WT. Macrophage-mediated inflammation plays a central role in HCC. Compared to WT, Alb\/MDA-9 tumors showed marked infiltration of CD11b+ myeloid cells, FoxP3+ T regulatory cells and F4\/80+ macrophages. RNA-seq in na&#239;ve WT and Alb\/MDA-9 hepatocytes identified activation of signaling pathways associated with invasion, angiogenesis and inflammation.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>MDA-9 overexpression in hepatocytes promotes HCC by stimulating inflammation, angiogenesis and immune modulation. Studies are ongoing to obtain in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which MDA-9 exerts these pleiotropic effects.

While it develops to metastatic stage, the treatment options are limited. Hence, it desires in vivo models to test novel strategies for treating PCa. Current murine models of prostate cancer need long time for the diseases to progress to an invasive and metastatic cancer. Here, we combined AAV delivery and CRISPR-Cas9 technology to mutate several genes simultaneously in the mouse prostate. Four weeks after delivering of engineered virus, benign prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) can be achieved and within eight weeks, the tumor developed to an extremely aggressive cancer. Surprisingly, a basic virus, engineering quintuple gRNAs of Cas9 including Pten, Trp53 and Rb1 induced a primary tumor without formation of metastasis. While adding triple gRNAs targeting epigenetic factors to the basic viral vector, all mice developed lung metastasis with metastasis started to appear after 6 weeks. Castration of the tumor baring mice 5 weeks after initiation did not alter primary tumor and metastasis formation, indicating the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) nature of the model. To reveal the molecular mechanism for cancer progression and metastasis formation, whole genome sequencing (WGS) were performed on lung metastasis samples in combination with mRNA-seq on primary and secondary tumors from the two groups and PBS-injected mice control. Up to 5,000 mutations were accumulated in the genome, although the number varied across the metastatic samples, which were mainly due to chromosome 6 and 8 and revealed heterogeneity of the tumors. Among it, novel key mutations were identified, which will be addressed in the future. Tumor cell plasticity, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition and de-differentiation, were conformed. A short 100kb genomic window at mouse chr5 was captured and found to be sensitive to mutation status of an epigenetic factor. This window is highly conserved to a region at human chr4 and in vitro work confirm evolutionary preserved mechanism. Finally, p-Src\/p-Lyn-cMyc related pathways showed clear difference between the two primary tumors with and without metastasis potency. Overall, our model of mCRPC can provide very diverse angles to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this model can be used to rapidly verify ideas and hypothesis regarding the mechanism behind the disease, and to test the treatment strategies in vivo in both pre-clinic studies and pharmacy field.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ea50eda-fa51-48fe-bf61-6cc2e925d461\/@r03B8ZM6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,CRISPR,metastatic and castration resistant mouse model,epigenetic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14272"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huiqiang Cai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johanne Ahrenfeldt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolai Birkbak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Thomsen<\/i><\/presenter>.

This protein changes DNA cytosines into uracils (C-to-U), which can become &#8220;immortalized&#8221; in the genome as C-to-T or C-to-G mutations depending on how each uracil lesion is processed. However, mice lack analogous carcinogenic A3 enzymes, which makes a definitive cause-and-effect model of A3-induced carcinogenesis difficult to establish.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Using C57BL\/6 mice, we have generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) expressing the human protein A3B, where it is driven constitutively from the Rosa26 locus in combination with the strong synthetic CAG promoter. Importantly, tumor-free survival data suggest that CAG A3B mice develop tumors at an increased rate compared to wild-type mice. These CAG A3B mice develop predominantly lymphoid neoplasms including B- and T-cell lymphomas and marked splenomegaly, and less frequently lung and liver cancers. Using immunohistochemical and whole-genome sequencing techniques, we have further characterized the tumors arising in these novel GEMMs. The above analyses thus far have revealed that A3B is actively driving tumor formation, as seen by an enrichment of canonical APOBEC-related mutations in these cancers.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Overall, the CAG A3B mice are the first GEMMs demonstrating the potential for A3B to drive tumor formation <i>in vivo<\/i>, with a predilection towards blood malignancies. They will be an invaluable tool for characterizing A3B-driven mutational processes in an organism and testing novel therapeutic strategies against APOBEC-induced cancer initiation and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/92b971d2-b5d3-4988-9ac0-1f163164e373\/@r03B8ZM6\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutagenesis,Animal models,Cancer genetics,Somatic mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14273"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cameron C.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and greater than 75% of human lung cancer deaths can be attributed to metastasis. Metastatic disease in most existing mouse models of pulmonary adenocarcinoma is typically sporadic and often requires aging mice for several months. These factors limit the usefulness of mouse models for basic and pre-clinical research aimed at identifying effective treatments of metastatic disease.<br \/>METHODS AND RESULTS: We have developed new mouse models of pulmonary adenocarcinoma in which we added mutations in <i>Dicer1<\/i>, an RNAse III enzyme within the microRNA (miRNA) biosynthesis pathway to a mouse model of<i> Kras<\/i>-driven pulmonary adenocarcinoma. For both models, we induced tumorigenesis by conditionally expressing an oncogenic allele of <i>Kras <\/i>(<i>Kras<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup>), deleting of both alleles of <i>Trp53<\/i> and deleting one allele of <i>Dicer1<\/i> in one cell population then expressing truncated <i>Dicer1<\/i> in a different cell population. In the absence of <i>Dicer1<\/i> truncation, mice expressing <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> and deleting <i>Trp53<\/i> in Club cells have a reported median survival of 28.6 weeks after tumor induction. When we also deleted one allele of <i>Dicer1<\/i> in Club cells and truncated <i>Dicer1<\/i> in alveolar type II cells of these mice, they exhibited respiratory distress and began dying 12.1 weeks after tumor induction. In our initial pilot study, all animals (12\/12) developed pulmonary adenocarcinoma and 30% (3\/10) had lymph node metastasis. We did not observe accelerated tumorigenesis, however, when we switched cell types, inducing tumorigenesis in alveolar type II cells and truncating <i>Dicer1<\/i> in Club cells, or when induced tumorigenesis and truncating <i>Dicer1<\/i> within the same cell populations.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Through cell type specific truncation\/deletion of <i>Dicer1<\/i> we have generated a new mouse model that rapidly develops pulmonary adenocarcinomas and metastatic disease. Our findings support our hypothesis that tumorigenesis and metastasis are influenced by miRNA regulated communication between different cell types. These models have potential for both understanding the basic processes of metastasis and for pre-clinical studies aimed at preventing and\/or treating metastatic lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f75ea3b-6e66-4830-bf50-3cb5510bbaeb\/@r03B8ZM6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Mouse models,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14275"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julie Wells<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Maser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Tucker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa McGee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendy Memishian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosalinda Doty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carol J.

Here, we crossed a conditional <i>Usp13<\/i> overexpressing knock-in mouse with a conditional knockout of <i>Trp53<\/i> and <i>Pten<\/i> mouse, and generated a novel ovarian cancer genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), which closely recapitulates the genetic changes driving ovarian cancer in humans.

Notably, USP13 greatly enhanced peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors with frequent development of hemorrhagic ascites. The primary and metastatic tumors exhibited morphology and clinical behavior similar to human high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Co-inhibition of USP13 and AKT significantly decreased the viability of the primary murine ovarian cancer cells isolated from the GEMM. USP13 also increased the tumorigenic and metastatic abilities of primary murine ovarian cancer cells in a syngeneic mouse study.

We reported CDKN2A\/p16 deletions in up to 69% of BE patients who progressed to dysplasia and EAC, suggesting that p16 loss may drive progression of BE to EAC. LGR5+ cardia like stem cells in the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) of mouse stomach have been implicated in the cellular origins of BE, and glandular hyperplasia\/metaplasia (MGHP) and dysplasia and enhanced inflammation in SCJ were reported in interleukin 1 beta (IL1b) transgenic mice. Our hypothesis is that p16 deletion in LGR5+ cells that give rise to glandular epithelium in SCJ of IL1b mice may accelerate glandular hyperplasia and metaplasia and augment progression to dysplasia and EAC.<br \/><b>Design: <\/b>We tested the hypothesis using conditional knockout of CDKN2A\/p16 in IL1b mouse targeting SCJ LGR5+ cells. Model A genotype is p16del: (Lgr5-CreERT2 +\/-; IL1b wt\/tg; p16 fl\/fl) and control model C is p16 wild type (wt): (Lgr5-CreERT2 +\/-; IL1b wt\/tg; p16 wt\/wt). Conditional knockout was induced with intraperitoneal tamoxifen injection. All mice were given bile acid in drinking water, daily. Mice were euthanized and gross and histologic alterations in SCJ, stomach, small intestine (SI) and colon were assessed over time, until 16 months. MGHP was scored as the number of glandular profiles in each section of SCJ, and inflammation and dysplasia were evaluated and scored (0 to 3) in H&#38;E-stained sections.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We examined 39 mice: 19 model A (p16del) and 20 model C (p16wt). Mice were grouped into 3 groups from 3 to 16 months. The SCJ of p16del mice exhibited larger areas of hyperplastic cardia-type mucous glands compared to p16wt mice, showing higher numbers of gland profiles (median 17 vs. 8 gland profiles, P=9<sup>-5<\/sup>). Higher inflammation scores were also seen in p16del mice ages 3-7 and 7-12 months (P=.036 and P=.013). P16del mice showed higher dysplasia scores overall (P=.013), particularly in mice ages 7-16 months (P=.038). There was a positive correlation between MGHP and inflammation (P=.004) and between inflammation and dysplasia (P=.021). No significant alterations were seen in the stomach, SI, or colon of p16del vs p16wt mice.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Loss of p16 alone is not sufficient to develop neoplastic alterations in stomach, SI and colon. Deletion of p16 in LGR5+ cardia-like stem cells in the squamocolumnar junction of mouse stomach, together with IL1b and BA-induced inflammation and cellular injury, is associated with increased MGHP, inflammation, and dysplasia. The model implicates p16 in the early stages of esophageal carcinogenesis, similar to human disease, providing a model to further dissect the contributing molecular mechanisms of progression to esophageal dysplasia and cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/88f430e3-c0ab-4725-a8e3-72e3e1d89d7c\/@s03B8ZM7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p16,Esophageal cancer,Knockout mice,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14481"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jing Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena V.

B6-KPC mice ( LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>, LSL-Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>, Pdx1-Cre) generate spontaneous PDAC which could recapitulate the pathogenesis and genomic features of human PDAC. Although B6-KPC model is a wildly used for the exploration of the mechanisms of PDAC, some drawbacks of the model, such as long time for tumorigenesis, individual variation and difficulties in tumor observation, limit its application in cancer therapy. It is necessary to develop the pancreatic tumor cell lines from these models. In this study, we successfully established and well-characterized the luciferase-labled cell line mPA<sup>KPC<\/sup>-Luciferase. This cells carried the Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> and Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup> mutation. The orthotopic mPA<sup>KPC<\/sup>-Luciferase tumor model was well established by implanting tumor cell line into pancreas of B6 wild type mice and the tumor growth was traced by in vivo imaging. Moreover, Gemcitabine or combined with CD40 agonist presented significant tumor growth inhibition in B6 bearing mPA<sup>KPC<\/sup>-Luciferase orthotopic mouse models. While anti-PD1 or anti-OX40 had no anti-tumor effects in this model accordance with the low T cell infiltration of mPA<sup>KPC<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>modle as a &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. In addition, the immune profiling of this cell line showed highly expressed of potential therapeutic targets, including Claudin 18.2, CD47, CD73. Thus, mPA<sup>KPC<\/sup>-Luciferase cell lines are valuable models for the PDAC preclinical therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b638925-0af9-435a-929b-e3407c2302c8\/@s03B8ZM7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,B6-KPC,PDAC,mPAKPC-luciferase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19186"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Fang Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiwei Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunlong Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongjing Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Steve Smith<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiying Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang  Gao<\/i><\/presenter>.

We constructed CD137 humanized mice based on two different backgrounds, C57BL6 and BALB\/c mice, as well as dual-target and triple-target mice crossbred with PD1\/PDL1 humanized mice to create an ideal model to study CD137 target drugs. The normal immune cell population in peripheral blood were not affected in CD137 humanized mice, and hCD137 was expressed on T cells after the stimulation with a anti CD3 antibody. We verified the efficacy of anti-CD137 drugs in BALB\/c-hCD137 mice inoculated with different cancer cell lines (i.e. CT26, EMT6 and 4T1). The drug Urelumab showed a dramatic response in the hCD137 mice model inoculated with CT26 and EMT6 but not with 4T1 cell line. In a rechallenge study, no tumors grew in tumor-free mice previously treated with Urelumab, with effector memory T cells increased in peripheral blood, indicating Urelumab has a relatively long-lasting anti-tumor effect. The combination of Urelumab and anti-PD1 has a stronger tumor growth inhibition effect than that of anti-CD137 or anti-PD1 monotherapy on dual-target or triple target mice. These data show that the humanized CD137 mouse is a suitable model for evaluating the monotherapies or combination therapies targeting CD137.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b38517a2-65eb-4108-9a53-482310094668\/@s03B8ZM7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,CD137,humanized,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21434"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yunlong Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tingting Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weiwei Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingkun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cunxiang Ju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mark W.
