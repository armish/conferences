The poster will hopefully also include progress made in these funded programs, anecdotal stories from patients who have benefitted from them.<br \/>Because of the work of the St. Baldrick''s Foundation, the groundbreaking Childhood Cancer STAR Act was passed in 2018. The STAR Act focuses on creating and maintaining biorepositories at the National Cancer Institute, conducting nationwide childhood cancer surveillance programs, and developing best practices for long-term survivorship care. STAR also authorizes $30 million in new federal funding each year for five years.<br \/>St. Baldrick''s Foundation developed the STAR Act and crafted and implemented the strategy to get this bill signed into law. While many people and organizations from the pediatric cancer community contributed ideas, resources, and manpower to get the STAR Act to the finish line, St. Baldrick''s compiled and synthesized the policy ideas into one comprehensive legislative package, establishing relationships with key childhood cancer congressional champions, led the effort to build support for STAR on Capitol Hill, and negotiated final legislative language with congressional leadership.<br \/>The STAR Act has been funded every year since 2018. Most recently in 2020, Congress provided $80 million for childhood cancer research, $30 million to implement the STAR Act for the third year, and $50 million to implement CCDI for a second year. St. Baldrick''s was critical in making this happen by leading the childhood cancer community''s advocacy strategy and working directly with policymakers to make the case for fully funding both programs.<br \/>SOURCE: www.stbaldricks.org<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21655"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>MELISSA Alexander<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

ICPV has held study days in Leeds, Velindre, Barts' &#38; The London, the House of Lords, Universities of Birmingham, Sussex, Glasgow, Warwick and Stirling, CRUK, and a Radiotherapy Day in London. The training was formalised into the VOICE (Vision On Information, Confidence &#38; Engagement) Science Course for patient advocates which has been run since 2013 jointly by the Barts&#8217; Cancer Institute and ICPV. So far, the course has trained 56 graduates. ICPV believes that \"Clinical research is improved by patients being partners with clinicians and healthcare professionals, rather than passive recipients of healthcare\" ICPV was initially almost entirely breast cancer patients, but now has 67 members across most tumour groups, although breast still predominate. ICPV members are now involved in over 95 cancer related National, European and International Committees; the Breast CSG and all Subgroups; have been to NCRI conferences and San Antonio; are on over 100 Trial Management and Steering Groups; have been co-applicants on at least 30 trials; and have also been involved in the initial design of trials. Good examples are treatment reduction trials (PERSEPHONE, PRIMETIME, LORIS &#38; OPTIMA), MENOS4 (Nurse delivered CBT for Hot Flushes) and the SWEET programme (Adherence to endocrine therapy) which are unmet needs highlighted by ICPV members. Other trials include: Add Aspirin, AsCaP, AZURE, POETIC, MAMMO-50, MENOS4, NEPTUNE, PALLET, PEACE, FASTForward, SMALL, ROSCO, IMPORT HIGH &#38; LOW, PRECISION (CRUK Grand Challenge), MyPeBS (Horizon 2020). ICPV is an established partner in cancer research in the UK, has received affirmation from cancer researchers, works with Cancer52, AllTrials, use MY data, BCN, BCN tissue bank, WCRF, the MHRA, HTA, CCB and is a stakeholder with the APPGC, APPGBC, and ABPI","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/730515f3-b0c3-49e7-8474-8258cc333956\/@v03B911c\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21651"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>PATRICIA Fairbrother<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The goal of the EGFR Resisters Research Summit was to help identify, cultivate, and prepare physician and related clinician and PhD investigators working in targeted lung cancer therapies for successful careers that help to advance the rapidly evolving field of EGFR-mutated lung cancer. The idea to develop a Research Summit focused on EGFR was first proposed at the 2018 Inaugural EGFR Resisters Think Tank. One of the main Call to Action Points from the Think Tank was to expand bench and translational research efforts for EGFRm lung cancer. The involvement of patients in educational planning can increase the relevance, meaning, and impact of CME. Through sharing their experiences, they can provide essential feedback and can guide educators and clinicians in meeting their needs and priorities. Trained patient advocates have been shown to augment translational research, which we have demonstrated our role in early career professional development of lung cancer clinician-scientists. The poster will highlight the impact of the EGFR Research Summit and the involvement of trained patient advocates in advancing the professional development of the next generation of clinician-scientists and the value of the Summit in continuing to advance substantive research in EGFRm NSCLC<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1aa46bbe-f60b-4285-9ce4-cde48b0067c1\/@v03B911c\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21650"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jill Feldman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The steps of achieving government funding are multi-layered, time consuming and an enormous commitment.

Most women under 40 find their breast abnormalities themselves and have no family history of disease, which gives them a false sense of security that they are &#8220;too young&#8221; and &#8220;not at risk&#8221; for breast cancer. To do this, The Project has a three-pillar approach: (1) we use data and stories that we collect from the survivor community to educate our physicians on the difficulties that the majority of young women face getting diagnosed with accuracy and urgency; (2) we connect to young women and all young people with breasts through creative, fun, captivating events and social media on breast health; (3) we provide an opportunity for storytelling and open dialogue amongst young survivors and those affected by the disease to promote personal healing and a greater sense of community within the Young Breast Cancer community. We plan to establish a communication loop with physicians to improve the timeliness from detection to diagnosis of breast cancer, in effect helping women to start treatment sooner and\/or identify those who are high-risk sooner. Through these efforts, The Project serves to decrease the rate of delayed and difficult diagnosis among young women of average risk and women with hereditary risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/01ea10b7-30fe-43d6-a68a-3c23b17e13e9\/@v03B911c\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21646"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>MISSY Peters<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
