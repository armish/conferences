[{"Abstract":"Purpose: This phase 1\/2 trial evaluates the novel immunotherapy BMS-986253 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (NCT03400332). Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an immunosuppressive chemokine often elevated in the serum of patients with cancer. High serum IL-8 concentration is associated with poor prognoses and resistance to immunotherapies, including anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) agents (Schalper et al. <i>Nat Med<\/i> 2020;26:688). The addition of anti-IL-8 therapy to anti-PD-1 nivolumab (NIVO) and anti-CTLA-4 ipilimumab (IPI) may sensitize patients with high serum IL-8 levels to immune checkpoint inhibition. BMS-986253, a fully human IgG1 anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibody, in combination with NIVO &#177; IPI is under investigation in a phase 1\/2 trial of patients with advanced solid tumors. Initial results from part 1 indicate BMS-986253 + NIVO was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities (Davar et al<i>.<\/i> <i>J Immunother Cancer<\/i> 2020;8. Abstract 394). Preliminary antitumor activity was observed, including partial responses in 5 of 28 patients with melanoma that had progressed on or after prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, a population with high unmet medical need. Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind phase 2 study comparing the efficacy of BMS-986253 in combination with NIVO + IPI vs NIVO + IPI in patients with advanced melanoma that progressed on or after prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.<br \/>Trial Design: Patients eligible for part 2 have histologically confirmed, unresectable, stage III\/IV melanoma, have progressed on or after anti-PD-(L)1 treatment, had an anti-PD-(L)1 agent as their most recent therapy, and have not received anti-CTLA-4 treatment. PD-L1 and <i>BRAF<\/i>V600 mutation status (wild-type and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations permitted) must be documented, and serum IL-8 levels will be measured at screening. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive BMS-986253 + NIVO + IPI or placebo + NIVO + IPI and stratified by serum IL-8 level, <i>BRAF<\/i><sup>V600E<\/sup> status, and lactate dehydrogenase level. The dose and frequency of BMS-986253, NIVO, and IPI will be determined by part 1 data. Treatment with BMS-986253 or placebo and NIVO will continue &#8804; 3 years or until disease progression or intolerance. The primary objective is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1 between treatment arms in patients with baseline serum IL-8 levels &#62; 10 pg\/mL. Secondary objectives include PFS by BICR in all randomized patients, overall response rates by BICR per RECIST v1.1, overall survival, safety, pharmacokinetic profile, immunogenicity of BMS-986253, and associations of baseline factors with response. Recruitment will continue until &#8776;170 patients are enrolled.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/571bb9fb-91d5-4f16-a309-15e1d63f8569\/@x03B8ZYQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-8,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Nivolumab,Ipilimumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20340"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Matteo Simonelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emiliano Calvo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diwakar Davar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Melear<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donald Richards<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Dallos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Gutierrez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Moreno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Marron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvie Rottey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Orcurto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susana Barriga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessy Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Gibson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santanu Dutta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivek Arora<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ignacio Melero<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Metastatic TNBC has been difficult to treat due to a general lack of targeted therapies, however, immunotherapy has shown substantial activity in a subset of patients. In metastatic TNBC patients with PD-L1-positive (combined positive score (CPS) &#8805; 10) disease, KEYNOTE-355 demonstrated that addition of pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) to chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or carboplatin\/gemcitabine) prolonged median progression free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone (9.7 months vs 5.6 months). Median 1-year PFS was also increased from 12.0% to 39.1% in these patients treated with pembrolizumab. These data led to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy in PD-L1-positive metastatic TNBC patients. Despite these encouraging results, the majority of patients do not have long-term disease control. Radiotherapy (RT) in combination with immunotherapy and chemotherapy represents a promising avenue to prolong long-term response. RT can stimulate cellular damage and cause the release of tumor antigens, promoting a local T cell response. In addition, localized RT can result in the shrinkage of distant sites of metastasis via the abscopal effect when used with immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the benefit of combining RT with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with metastatic PD-L1-positive TNBC.<br \/>Methods: This two-stage, single-arm phase II study will assess the efficacy of RT in combination with nab-paclitaxel\/paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab in PD-L1-positive unresectable or metastatic TNBC patients aged &#8805;18 years. To be included, patients must have only received <u>&#60;<\/u> 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or adjuvant\/neoadjuvant setting if metastatic recurrence was within 12 months of treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is the 1-year PFS rate and a total of 29 subjects will be enrolled. Patients will be treated first with RT followed by the initiation of systemic therapy within seven days. Ablative RT will be directed at 1-4 sites of metastatic disease in 3 fractions of 8 Gy each. Nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel will be given weekly day 1, day 8 every 3 weeks and pembrolizumab will be given every 3 weeks. Imaging will be repeated every 9 weeks to assess response based on RECIST 1.1. Systemic treatment will be continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Treatment beyond progression will be allowed in certain patients who had initial response followed by progression. In these patients, repeat RT to new sites of disease can be administered with continuation of pembrolizumab to investigate the potential of re-sensitizing patients to immunotherapy. Blood will be collected before and after treatment for immune profiling. The sample size was determined using a null hypothesis for the 1-year PFS rate of 39% and an alternate hypothesis of 60%. The sample size of 29 yields a power of 80% to detect this difference with an alpha of 0.1 (1-sided). An interim analysis will be performed after enrollment of seventeen subjects in stage one.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/484d341b-da41-40aa-ba5c-7a436cab5437\/@x03B8ZYQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Radiation therapy,Immunotherapy,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20341"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna R.

MDM2 induces degradation of p53 and promotes tumorigenesis in solid tumors, and preclinical models have shown that inhibition of MDM2 can restore p53 tumor suppressor activity in <i>TP53<\/i>-wild type (WT), <i>MDM2<\/i>-amplified tumors. We performed a mutual exclusivity analysis of patients with solid tumors (n=42,125; AACR Project GENIE) and found that the frequency of co-occurring <i>TP53<\/i> mutations decreased with increasing <i>MDM2<\/i> copy number. An <i>MDM2<\/i> copy number of 12 was chosen as the threshold. An estimated 1.1% of solid tumors meet this molecular criteria, excluding glioblastomas, de-differentiated liposarcomas, and intimal sarcomas where this signature is enriched. Milademetan (RAIN-32), an oral, selective MDM2 inhibitor, inhibits growth of <i>TP53-<\/i>WT\/<i>MDM2<\/i>-amplified cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models from varying tumor types. Furthermore, tumor regression was observed in 3\/3 non-liposarcoma patients with <i>MDM2<\/i> copy number &#62;12 in a phase 1 trial of milademetan. MANTRA-2 (RAIN-3202) is a phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, basket trial designed to evaluate the efficacy or clinical benefit of milademetan in <i>TP53-<\/i>WT solid tumors with <i>MDM2<\/i> amplification (copy number &#8805;12).<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients must be &#8805;18 years of age with histologically and\/or cytologically confirmed locally advanced, incurable or metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. Local testing demonstrating <i>TP53<\/i> WT and <i>MDM2<\/i> amplification is required, defined as a <i>MDM2<\/i> copy number &#8805;12 or 6-fold increase. Patients with well-differentiated\/de-differentiated liposarcomas, intimal sarcomas, or primary central nervous system tumors are excluded. Prior treatment with an MDM2 inhibitor is not permitted. Patients receive milademetan 260 mg orally once daily on Days 1-3 and 15-17 of a 28-day cycle. Tumor response is evaluated by RECIST v1.1 at Weeks 8, 16, 24, and 32, and then every 12 weeks. Primary endpoint: objective response rate. Secondary endpoints include: duration of response; progression-free survival; growth modulation index; disease control rate; overall survival; safety; health-related quality of life scores. Exploratory endpoints include: biomarkers in blood and\/or tumor tissue; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics. Enrollment of 65 patients is planned to ensure that 57 patients have centrally confirmed <i>TP53<\/i> WT and <i>MDM2<\/i> copy number &#8805;12. The trial opened in November 2021 and is actively enrolling patients.

PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC, in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. The anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) durvalumab, in combination with either the anti-CD73 mAb oleclumab or the anti-NKG2A mAb monalizumab, improved response rates and progression-free survival in patients with unresectable, Stage III NSCLC in the phase 2 COAST trial (NCT03822351). The NeoCOAST trial (NCT03794544) is currently evaluating the combination of durvalumab with oleclumab or monalizumab as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC. NeoCOAST-2 (NCT05061550) is a multicenter study of neoadjuvant durvalumab combined with CT and either oleclumab or monalizumab, followed by surgery and adjuvant durvalumab plus oleclumab or monalizumab, in patients with resectable, Stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients must have previously untreated, histologically\/cytologically confirmed NSCLC, a WHO\/ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and life expectancy of &#8805;12 weeks. Patients must have tumor samples available for biomarker analyses, have planned surgery consisting of lobectomy, sleeve resection, or bilobectomy, and have a pre- or post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1<\/sub> of 1.0 L and DLCO &#62;40% postoperative predictive value. Patients with sensitizing <i>EGFR <\/i>mutations or <i>ALK <\/i>translocations, history of allogeneic organ transplantation, active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, or uncontrolled intercurrent illness, are excluded. Approximately 140 patients will be randomized 1:1, stratified by PD-L1 expression (&#60;1% vs &#8805;1%), to receive IV durvalumab + oleclumab or monalizumab + CT Q3W for 4 cycles prior to surgery, followed by durvalumab + oleclumab or monalizumab Q4W post surgery. Surgery must occur within 40 days of the last dose of neoadjuvant therapy. Patients will receive adjuvant therapy starting within 10 weeks after surgery, for 12 cycles or until disease progression (per RECIST v1.1). The primary endpoints are pathological complete response rate per blinded independent pathologist review, and safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed event-free survival and disease-free survival, feasibility of planned surgery, major pathological response rate, changes in circulating tumor DNA, investigator-assessed objective response rate following neoadjuvant therapy, overall survival, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3db8959c-660f-4f26-85e0-cbba81efd393\/@y03B8ZYR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,Durvalumab,Adjuvant,Neoadjuvant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20345"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tina Cascone<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Spira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosario G.

Novel agents that target CD19 and CD20 on B cells, such as bispecific T-cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, have demonstrated benefit for patients in the relapsed and refractory setting. However, these agents can often be associated with significant toxicity and there is a need for new therapies that can provide clinical benefit while providing an improved safety profile.IGM-2323 is a novel CD20 x CD3 bispecific antibody utilizing an IgM backbone. This allows targeting of up to 10 CD20 binding sites for every CD3 site. In preclinical models, IGM-2323 demonstrated excellent antitumor activity with controlled T-cell activation. IGM-2323 is able to stimulate T cells at a more physiologic level than IgG-based antibodies, which may reduce adverse events typically associated with T-cell engagers and CAR-T, such as CRS and neurotoxicity.<br \/>Methods: This study is a phase 1\/2, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial of IGM-2323 monotherapy for patients with relapsed\/refractory NHL. The Phase 1 component consists of a dose escalation and limited dose expansion evaluating multiple titration dose levels. As part of the titration dosing regimen, subjects receive weekly dosing on Day 1, 8, and 15 of each 21- day cycle. Dosing begins at 15 mg and is increased weekly for 3-4 weeks to reach the plateau dose. Patients then stay at the plateau dose until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a response by Week 12 may switch to a less frequent dosing interval of every 3 weeks. The Phase 2 component will randomize patients at two different dose levels (100 mg and 300 mg plateau dose) in two separate indications (R\/R DLBCL and R\/R FL). Primary endpoints include frequency and severity of adverse events and objective response rate (ORR) based on Lugano criteria. Correlative biomarker studies will evaluate the correlation of clinical benefit with blood and tissue biomarkers. In Phase 2, there will be a formal analysis after 30 subjects are evaluable at each dose level and the best dose for each indication will be selected for further evaluation. The study is currently open with 47 patients enrolled at time of submission. Phase 2 is expected to begin enrollment in the first quarter of 2022. <u>Clinical trial information: <\/u><u>NCT04082936<\/u><u>.<\/u><u><\/u>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/becfeb39-2cd2-47b4-a04d-e0ec47b2ba76\/@y03B8ZYR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,T cell engager,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20346"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Loretta Nastoupil<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Budde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Won Seog Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Gopal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chan Cheah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian Flinn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gareth Gregory<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Matasar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Diefenbach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Ku<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung-Soo Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ibrahim Qazi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maya Leabman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Genevive Hernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Sison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce Keyt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Manley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phillipe Armand<\/i><\/presenter>.

LIF overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in multiple tumor types including PDAC. Preclinical data show that LIF promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, hindering cytotoxic CD8+ T cell recruitment; low T cell infiltration also correlates with mortality in patients with PDAC. Preclinical studies show LIF-blocking antibodies sensitize tumors to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibition, inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and prolong survival in combination with CT. In patients with PDAC, higher LIF levels correlate with more aggressive pathology, elevated CA19-9 (a PDAC biomarker), and lower response and survival rates. AZD0171 (formerly MSC-1), a first-in-class, humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody, binds specifically and potently to LIF, preventing downstream signaling. In a phase 1 dose escalation study (NCT03490669), AZD0171 monotherapy had manageable safety and led to stable disease (SD) in 34.2% of patients with advanced solid tumors across all dose levels. AZD0171 + CT may improve survival outcomes vs CT alone. Based on preclinical data, AZD0171 may function to stimulate antitumor immune response, and combination with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab could prolong that response and overcome peripheral tolerance in patients with metastatic PDAC.<br \/>Methods: This is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of AZD0171 + durvalumab and CT in treatment-naive patients with metastatic PDAC (NCT04999969). Eligible patients must have an ECOG performance status 0 or 1, a Gustave Roussy Immune Score 0 or 1, &#8805;1 measurable target lesion per RECIST v1.1, and confirmed presence of tumoral CD8+ T cells. Patients with central nervous system metastasis, history of leptomeningeal disease or cord compression, a thromboembolic event &#8804;3 months prior to study treatment, unresolved grade &#8805;2 toxicities from prior therapy, or a sensitizing mutation or tumor characteristic for which there is a preferred treatment, are excluded. As PDAC is poorly immune infiltrated, a novel clinical trial assay will be used to select for patients who have existing resident CD8+ T cells and may therefore be more likely to respond. About 115 patients will receive intravenous AZD0171, durvalumab and CT until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoints are safety and overall survival (OS) rate at 12 months. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate, disease control rate (confirmed response or SD &#8805;16 weeks), duration of response, median progression-free survival (PFS), PFS rate at 4 months, median OS, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (changes in serum CA19-9 level and tumor CD8+ T cell infiltration) and immunogenicity.

Several PI3K inhibitors are approved to treat relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) and, more recently, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Nonetheless, potential class-specific and PI3K-isoform-related toxicities may limit their clinical utility. Capivasertib is an oral, potent, selective inhibitor of the 3 AKT isoforms that demonstrated a manageable safety profile (n&#62;1500) and survival benefit in combination with other agents in patients (pts) with solid tumors. Unlike PI3K inhibitors, colitis or pneumonitis have not been a concern with monotherapy. Preclinically, capivasertib was active both in vitro in a large panel of B-NHL cell lines and in vivo in PTEN-null GCB-DLBCL PDX models, where it downregulated the oncogenic factor MYC. In the JVM2 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell line, capivasertib showed superior activity vs PI3Ka\/d (AZD8835) and PI3Kb\/d (AZD8186) inhibitors. Of note, AKT activation following dysregulation of PTEN has been frequently described in FL (where &#62;85% of tFL or FL\/DLBCL exhibited a GCB phenotype). Therefore, capivasertib may represent an effective treatment option for pts with R\/R B-NHL.<br \/>Trial Design: This modular phase II study will enroll pts in 3 cohorts according to B-NHL type. Core inclusion criteria include: age &#8805;18 years and ECOG PS &#8804;2. Module-specific criteria include: cohort 1A: R\/R FL after &#8805;2 prior systemic lines (max 5), including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and an alkylating agent; cohort 1B: R\/R MZL of splenic, nodal, and extranodal subtypes after &#8805;2 prior systemic lines (max 5) including &#8805;1 anti-CD20 mAb; cohort 1C: R\/R MCL after &#8805;2 prior systemic lines (max 4), previously exposed to anti-CD20 mAb and a BTK inhibitor. Pts with FL grade 3B, transformed disease, blastoid or <i>TP53<\/i> mutation MCL, active CNS disease, diabetes requiring insulin, or being &#60;3 months post-CD19-directed CAR-T therapy will be excluded.Capivasertib will be administered orally at 480 mg BID with an intermittent schedule (4 days on\/3 days off; 28-day cycles) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint in<br \/>1<br \/>AACR 2022_Capivasertib TiP Abstracteach cohort is objective response rate based on 2014 Lugano criteria per blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, patient-reported outcomes, safety, and pharmacokinetics. An interim analysis of safety will occur when approximately 30 pts across all cohorts have been treated for 8 weeks. An interim analysis of efficacy will occur after 28 pts (cohorts 1A+1B) or 24 pts (cohort 1C) have been treated for 4 months. A total of 272 pts are planned across 28 sites in 7 countries globally (US, Europe, and Asia).

Furthermore, identification of novel genomic alterations and other biomarkers has the potential to lead to customized, targeted treatments. Matching specific therapies to tumor biomarkers has the potential to yield valuable clinical information. Here we present a multiarm basket trial that matches patients with a broad array of metastatic solid cancers to investigational therapies alone or in combination based on specific, targetable genomic alterations or protein expression patterns that are potentially predictive of response (MyTACTIC). Historically, such trials have been conducted at large academic medical centers rather than community centers, where most US patients with cancer receive treatment. Prioritizing community centers for this study presents an exciting opportunity to generate data from a more representative patient population.<br \/>Methods: MyTACTIC (NCT04632992) is a phase II, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study aiming to enroll approximately 260 participants with advanced solid tumors that harbor alterations including mutations, fusions, amplifications and protein loss in specific biomarkers that include ROS proto-oncogene 1 (<i>ROS1<\/i>), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (<i>PIK3CA<\/i>), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK<\/i>), protein kinase B (<i>AKT<\/i>), phosphatase and tensin homolog (<i>PTEN<\/i>), high tumor mutational burden (TMB), high microsatellite instability (MSI), deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (<i>ERBB2<\/i>) and Ret proto-oncogene (<i>RET<\/i>). Patients aged &#8805;18 years with positive local biomarker results from tissue or blood samples will be enrolled from academic and community oncology centers and practices. Eligibility criteria have been broadened to allow enrollment of a diverse population of patients, including those with nonmeasurable disease, HIV or viral hepatitis infections, and to allow for previous treatment with anticancer agents in the same class. Once general and arm-specific criteria are met, patients will be assigned to 1 of 15 treatment arms to receive mono- or combination therapy with targeted agents, immunotherapy and\/or chemotherapy (&#8804;25 patients per arm). The primary objective is to evaluate confirmed objective response rate, as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST version 1.1 or RANO criteria for primary central nervous system tumors. Progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival and safety will also be assessed. Special attention has been paid to the study design and implementation to ensure equitable access, along with flexibility to add additional baskets. Enrollment is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51226e95-3a56-4730-9be9-730d3d053e4c\/@z03B8ZYS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Solid tumors,Phase II,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20350"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David R.

Preclinical models and early clinical data have shown enhanced antitumor activity when an anti-TIGIT antibody is co-administered with an anti-PD-1 antibody. The efficacy and safety of a novel coformulation of the anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab and the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab (vibostolimab\/pembrolizumab), alone or in combination with other anticancer therapies, will be investigated in select advanced solid tumors in a multicohort, open-label, phase 2 basket trial (NCT05007106).<br \/>Trial Design: Key eligibility criteria are histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic) solid tumor naive to anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 therapy (Table 1). Patients will be assigned to treatment randomly (cohort A1) or nonrandomly (cohorts A2-G) by tumor type and biomarker status (Table 1). All patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient\/physician decision to withdraw, or 35 cycles of vibostolimab\/pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. Primary end points are objective response rate (all cohorts) and progression-free survival (PFS; cohort A1) per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (cohort A1) or investigator (cohorts A2-G). Secondary end points include PFS per RECIST v1.1 assessed by the investigator (cohorts A2-G), quality of life (cohort A1), and duration of response, overall survival, and safety (all cohorts).

Early clinical experience with LN-145, an autologous TIL cell therapy, in heavily pretreated patients with mNSCLC has demonstrated feasibility, safety, and a 21.4% objective response rate (ORR), including 2 of 6 responders with PD-L1-negative tumors (Schoenfeld AJ, SITC<i> <\/i>2021 [abs 458]). Based on the results of this signal-finding study and to address an unmet medical need in 2L, we amended the ongoing IOV-LUN-202 study, evaluating LN-145 in patients with stage IV mNSCLC after confirmed disease progression on front-line standard-of-care treatment, including concurrent or sequential ICI + chemotherapy &#177; bevacizumab.<br \/>Methods: IOV-LUN-202 (NCT04614103) is an open-label, nonrandomized, phase 2 study. Cohorts 1 (tumor proportion score [TPS] &#60;1% prior to ICI use or no historical TPS) and 2 (TPS &#8805;1% prior to ICI use) are actively enrolling patients. Cohort 3 (any TPS) uses core biopsies for tumor procurement and a 16-day Gen 3 manufacturing process for patients unable to undergo surgical resection. A retreatment cohort (n not prespecified) will enroll prior responders to LN-145 or patients with unconfirmed progressive disease from cohorts 1-3. A total of approximately 95 patients is planned for cohorts 1-3. Key eligibility criteria include mNSCLC with no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 genomic alterations, progressing after &#8804;2 prior lines of therapy (if concurrent ICI + chemotherapy; &#8804;3 prior lines if sequential), including targeted therapy in those with actionable mutations (eg, MET, HER2, RET, BRAF, KRAS); in those without actionable mutations, progression after 1 prior concurrent ICI + chemotherapy (&#8804;2 prior lines if sequential); &#8805;1.5-cm lesion(s) for TIL generation; &#8805;1 remaining RECIST-measurable lesion(s) after tumor harvest; and ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Tumor harvest and TIL manufacturing can occur before or after confirmed progression. LN-145 is generated at centralized GMP facilities, and the final cryopreserved infusion product is shipped to the sites. Upon progression, patients receive a conditioning regimen of nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion with 2 doses of cyclophosphamide (60 mg\/kg) and 5 doses of fludarabine (25 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), followed by one-time infusion of LN-145 (1-150 &#215; 10<sup>9<\/sup> cells), and &#8804;6 doses of IL-2 (600,000 IU\/kg). The primary endpoint is ORR per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints include complete response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety (incidence of Grade &#8805;3 treatment-emergent adverse events [AEs] and serious AEs).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/201d6a2f-4183-4423-9a8f-de6a525626bc\/@z03B8ZYS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Adoptive cell therapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20352"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason Alan Chesney<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam J.

(Dannappel et al. 2019; Rzymski et al. 2015; Philip et al. 2018). CDK8 and CDK19 work by incorporating in a mutually exclusive manner, into a Mediator kinase module, that reversibly associates with a protein complex regulator of RNA Polymerase II, to mediate gene transcription. Targeting cancer-specific gene transcription via CDK8\/19 inhibition has potential for treatment of solid tumors. RVU120 (SEL120) is a selective CDK8\/19 inhibitor with preclinical efficacy in hematologic malignancies and a variety of solid tumor types (Rzymski et al. 2017). RVU120 showed strong anticancer activity in preclinical triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models, especially in the mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) molecular subtype (Rzymski et al SABCS 2021).<br \/>Methods: SOL-021 is a Phase I\/II clinical trial of RVU120 in Patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors, who have exhausted available treatments, currently ongoing in Poland and Spain under NCT05052255 clinical trial register number. RVU120 is administered as single oral dose every other day (QOD) for a total of 7 doses on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, in a 3-week treatment cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The study is designed in 2 parts: Part 1 follows a 3+3 dose escalation design and has primary objectives to characterize the safety and tolerability of RVU120 (SEL120) as single agent in patients with different tumors types and determination of the RP2D. Secondary objectives include objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST criteria v1.1, duration of response (DoR), disease-control rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and pharmacokinetic profile of RVU120.Part 2 will primarily explore the anti-tumor activity of RVU120 as single agent in different patient populations. Based on strong preclinical evidence of anticancer activity of RVU120 on TNBC cells (Tomasz Rzymski SABCS #1766), patients with relapsed\/ refractory TNBC will be enrolled. Additionally, relapsed\/refractory patients agnostic of their solid tumor type and selected based on their biomarker profile will be enrolled. The total duration of the study is approximately 27 months (12 and 15 for part 1 and 2, respectively).<br \/>Results: At 11 Feb 2022 data cut off, 5 patients have been enrolled in part 1 of the study and no SAE have been observed: First cohort, 75 mg, was closed on 24 Nov 2021 with no DLT observed; current ongoing cohort, 100 mg dose level, is expected to be closed in the upcoming week, and subsequent cohort, 125 mg, to be opened mid-March.<br \/>Conclusion: The trial is continuing as planned; the next data analysis will occur first week of March 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/db84ae99-2f83-4613-a578-961e9b5e99c4\/@z03B8ZYS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL01-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,Solid tumors,Phase I,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20465"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rafal Dziadziuszko<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Garralda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noemi Angelosanto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomasz Rzymski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renata Dudziak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krzysztof Brzózka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Littlewood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hendrik Nogai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Axel Glasmacher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iwona Lugowska<\/i><\/presenter>.

CD8+ cell content and its changes with treatment are important to understand tumor immunobiology, prognosis, and to guide therapy.<br \/>Trial design: ImaginAb has developed an imaging agent, <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam (formerly <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-Df-IAB22M2C\/<sup>89<\/sup>Zr-Df-crefmirlimab), with an 80 kDa minibody lacking a functional Fc domain, conferring high affinity to CD8, conjugated via deferoxamine to <sup>89<\/sup>Zr for PET imaging: specific binding is to both CD8&#945;&#945; and CD8&#945;&#946;, facilitating recognition of mature CD8+ cells and a small number of other cell types expressing CD8. The minibody structure was optimized for organ perfusion and pharmacokinetics, thereby maximizing the signal-to-background ratio. The long T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> (~3 d) of <sup>89<\/sup>Zr permits repeat scanning during the week following an infusion. A previous Phase I study of single-dose <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam was designed to select the optimum Phase II dose [Pandit-Taskar et al J Nuc Med 2020; Farwell et al J Nuc Med 2021]. After establishing the lack of toxicity across several dose levels, 1 mCi of <sup>89<\/sup>Zr and 1.5 mg of minibody are now being used in Phase II studies. Our recently-completed Ph IIA study was designed to test the correlation of CD8+ cells in tumor biopsies with CD8 PET\/CT before and during IOT in several tumor types routinely treated with IOT (including melanoma, renal, driver oncogene-negative lung). The present Ph IIB study, (first patient\/first visit accomplished in 12\/2021) tests the correlation of CD8 PET\/CT with <u>subject response<\/u> by RECIST 1.1 (primary objective), and with <u>lesion response<\/u> (secondary objective). Adults with solid tumors receive <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam i.v. and undergo PET-CT scan 24 hours later (non-contrast CT for localization). IOT (usually one or two immune checkpoint antibodies, using most commonly-used standard-of-care regimen for the disease) is then initiated. A second <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam infusion and PET\/CT are performed 4-6 weeks after the start of IOT followed 6-8 weeks later by standard tumor assessments (preferably CT with i.v. contrast to obtain RECIST-qualifying measurements). Thereafter, IOT and standard tumor assessments are continued according to standard practice and data for the present study collected up to 12 months after the start of treatment. For participants who progress on treatment there is an optional third <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam infusion and PET\/CT. For all participants optional biopsies are collected to coincide with PET\/CT timepoints. Accrual is ongoing at three sites in USA, and up to 20 sites globally (USA, Europe and Australia) will participate. The overall accrual goal is 80 patients, distributed across the four tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2fc3696e-e019-4697-b181-f5f7f3bd25b9\/@A03B8ZYT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,T cell,Immunotherapy,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21369"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kim Margolin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Hays<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Delphine L.
