[{"Abstract":"Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of men death in the US, annually killing &#62;34,000 men. Despite progress in early PC diagnosis and treatment, many patients have locally and distant disease recurrence. Therapeutic androgens deprivation have limited curative potential and associated with severe side effects and rapid resistance development justifying the dire need for discovery of novel recurrence inhibitors. (1<i>S<\/i>,2<i>E<\/i>,4<i>R<\/i>,6<i>R<\/i>,-7<i>E<\/i>,11<i>E<\/i>)-2,7,11-cembratriene-4,6-diol (&#946;-CBT) and its 4-<i>epi<\/i>-analog (&#945;-CBT) are the precursors to key flavor ingredients in leaves of most <i>Nicotiana<\/i> species. Nearly 40-60% of &#946;- and &#945;-CBT are purposely degraded during the commercial tobacco fermentation. Earlier, we reported the lack of &#946;-CBT cytotoxicity below 50 &#181;M while at 50 nM it reversed the calcitonin-stimulated decrease in transepithelial resistance and increased paracellular permeability in PC-3M PC cells. &#946;-CBT also proven to stimulate tight junction formation between PC-3M cells, producing a tighter intercellular barrier. &#946;-CBT 10-50 nM potently inhibited the calcitonin-stimulated PC-3M cells invasion in Matrigel assay. This study demonstrates the in vitro &#946;-CBT anti-migratory (wound-healing assay) and anti-clonogenicity (colony-formation assay) activities against five PC cell lines, including the metastatic castration-recurrent human prostate cancer (mCRPC) CWR-R1ca. Meanwhile, &#946;-CBT potently suppressed the <i>in vivo<\/i> locoregional and distant recurrences after the primary tumor surgical excision of the tumor formed by engrafting the human metastatic prostate PC-3M-Luc cells at the suprascupular region in male nude mice model. &#946;-CBT treatments prevented organ and significantly suppressed bone metastasis and lacked any major toxicity over the 60-day study course. Therefore, &#946;-CBT emerges as an effective promising PC recurrence and metastasis suppressive lead appropriate for near future use as a prospective nutraceutical.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/01783d0f-083b-4d1f-9276-61095f628710\/@t03B8ZLE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural products,Recurrence,Prostate cancer,Tobacco,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11755"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ethar A.

Fucosyltransferases (FUTs) contribute to the formation of sialofucosylated epitopes, which alter cellular signaling and mediate early steps in metastasis. However, few studies have examined the effect of FUT expression on H&#38;N cancer survival. Here, we sought to examine the association between fucosyltransferase expression and H&#38;N survival and investigate the mechanistic role of fucosylation in H&#38;N cancer.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> FUT1-11 expression (mRNA) data was extracted from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC dataset (n=499). Kaplan-Meier, logrank, and Cox proportional hazards tests were conducted. Levels of &#945;1,2-fucosylated epitopes H-antigen, Lewis Y (LeY), and Lewis B (LeB) were measured in normal, dysplastic, and H&#38;N tumor cell lines via flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR was performed to assess FUT expression. To identify fucosylated signaling and adhesion molecules, fucosylated glycopeptides were enriched from CAL27 and HSC-3 tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lysates via AAL lectin, followed by nLC-MS\/MS. EGFR signaling was assessed via western blot, and parallel plate flow assays were performed to assess in vitro metastatic potential, in tumor cell lines with differential FUT expression.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> In TCGA analyses, the median survival time (MST) of the FUT2 high expression group was 4.7 years, while low expression group MST was 2.7 years, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.72 (CI = 0.54-0.95). The FUT6-high group MST was 4.7 years versus 2.9 years for low expression (aHR = 0.62, CI = 0.47-0.83). The FUT7-high group MST was 4.7 years versus 3.5 years for low expression (aHR = 0.72, CI = 0.54-0.95). Expression of the LeY epitope, with both &#945;1,2- and &#945;1,3-linked fucose, varied widely in tongue SCC lines, while pharyngeal SCC lines FaDu and Det-562 displayed intermediate LeY levels, via flow cytometry. EGFR, CD44, and integrins, were among the fucosylated glycoproteins identified via mass spectrometry. HSC-3 cells, sorted into low- and high-LeY populations, demonstrated differential EGFR Tyr-1086 phosphorylation, and differences in adhesion to endothelial cells under flow conditions (in vitro), with implications for tumor metastasis.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> Overexpression of FUT2, FUT6, and FUT7 were associated with statistically significant increases in survivorship. FUT6 and FUT7 are prominently expressed in immune cells, while FUT2 is expressed in endoderm-derived epithelium. Therefore, FUT6 and FUT7 expression may indicate immune cell infiltration into tumor tissue. Future studies will seek to sort tumor tissue based on cell type, to gain an understanding of the cell-type specific glycosyltransferase expression in HNSCC tumors. Our current results will serve as the foundation to interrogate the role of fucosylated glycoproteins in HNSCC metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6ce3951-96e5-422d-b108-b1c09448cdcd\/@t03B8ZLE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Glycosylation,Metastasis,Head and neck cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11757"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kevin Brown Chandler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Brittany Montesino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nan Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan M.

Among breast cancer subtypes, patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+ breast cancer experience elevated rates of brain metastasis. The cytokines IL4 and IL13 are overexpressed by many human solid tumors. Both are associated with invasive and metastatic phenotypes; IL13 is additionally consequential in primary brain tumors. These cytokines signal through type I (IL4 only) and type II (IL4\/IL13) IL4 receptors (IL4R). Importantly, expression of type II IL4R correlates with poor patient prognosis in basal-like (i.e., triple-negative) breast cancer, and HER2+ tumors display elevated type II IL4R expression. Our laboratory has shown that genetic loss of IL4R signaling in tumor cells attenuates lung and liver metastasis in mice. Additionally, we recently identified a role for IL4R signaling in modulating glycosylation in tumor cells. We hypothesize that IL4R signaling influences TNBC brain metastasis at least in part via modulating glycosylation. In a pilot mouse study, pharmacological blockade of IL4R after intracardiac injection of syngeneic TNBC cells resulted in attenuation of brain metastatic growth and circulating tumor cell burden. We have also observed significant changes in the expression of a sialyltransferase (ST8SIA1) that has been implicated in primary brain tumors, as well as in the abundance of several sialic acid-containing protein species in breast cancer cells following treatment with IL4 or IL13. Further, IL4 stimulation increases the overall glycosylation of several proteins of interest, including a glucose transporter and a glutamine transporter, without altering gene expression. Overall, our data suggest that type II IL4R signaling promotes metastasis, potentially through a mechanism involving protein glycosylation. Blockade of this receptor may be a useful therapeutic approach for patients with breast cancer brain metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3601be4e-dbf7-48a5-834a-8befc4e03b32\/@t03B8ZLE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Brain metastasis,Cytokines,Glycosylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11760"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wendy Bindeman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Demond Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ebony Hargrove-Wiley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Fingleton<\/i><\/presenter>.

The activity of FAK is closely associated with the phosphorylation of diverse residues, which are mediated by various protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. Previous studies have demonstrated that serine\/threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) promotes cell migration, while protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibits cell migration. However, whether PP5 and PP2A regulate cell migration by mediating FAK phosphorylation is poorly understood. In this study, we found that overexpression of PP5 decreased FAK phosphorylation at S722, and knockdown of PP5 increased p-FAK (S722) in a spectrum of tumor cell lines. Our co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) results showed an interaction between PP5 and FAK. In addition, we observed that overexpression of PP5 induced S178 phosphorylation of paxillin, an FAK interacting protein. However, there was no physical interaction between PP5 and paxillin, indicating an indirect regulation. In addition, knockdown of PP2A enhanced the phosphorylation of FAK and conferred resistance to rapamycin inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated phosphorylation of FAK. To our surprise, by co-IP, we failed to detect any direct interaction between FAK and PP2A. Further research will determine how PP5 and PP2A regulate cell migration through FAK and paxillin.<br \/><b>Acknowledgements <\/b>This work was supported by the Feist-Weiller Cancer Center (FWCC) Bridge Award (S.H.), Shreveport, LA, USA","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e40150a-16bb-4d47-ba94-40781f8157a1\/@u03B8ZLF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein phosphatase,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11762"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lin Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lie Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shile Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

A dispersed (or fragmented) Golgi ribbon is often seen in stressed cells and in various pathologies, including neurodegeneration or cancer, but whether and how a fragmented Golgi apparatus affect cellular function is poorly defined. Previously our lab has performed and analyzed published RNAi screens to identify genes required to maintain the Golgi ribbon. These candidate genes were filtered for altered expression patterns in breast cancer patients and for their association with survival data. The selected genes reevaluated by RNAi in BT549 breast cancer cells to assess the effect on Golgi fragmentation. One of the most effective hits was TPD52L2, a poorly characterised gene that encodes a membrane-associated protein that is overexpressed in various types of cancer. The aim of this project is to investigate the role of TPD52L2 in cell migration and cell invasion in breast cancer in order to understand the role of Golgi fragmentation in tumorigenesis. In random cell migration assays in dense and sparse seeding conditions, TPD52L2 depleted cells showed an altered actin cytoskeleton and were found to migrate faster in dense seeding without any change in directional persistence. These findings suggest that TPD52L2 not only is required to maintain an intact Golgi structure but also plays an important role in cellular motility and potentially metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0ec51c9-49a4-43d1-b360-6974dae66d2d\/@u03B8ZLF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell migration,Actin cytoskeleton,Breast cancer,Cell invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11763"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seyedamirabbas Parizadeh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephan Geley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronika Reiterer-Farhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hesso Farhan<\/i><\/presenter>.

With the 10-year survival rate of 20%, the only life extending technique is to remove the eye and surrounding socket contents followed by extensive chemoradiation. Despite radical treatment, LGACC has a poorer prognosis than head and neck adenoid cystic carcinoma in part due to its propensity for perineural invasion (PNI) and intracranial spread. Analysis of LGACC tumors has revealed signatures enriched for pathways known to be involved in normal LG development, suggesting LGACC tumor cells re-engage or hijack developmental programs during its progression. This project sought to evaluate if developmental pathways involved in embryologic LG innervation were similarly recapitulated by LGACC tumors, and whether any of those markers could be correlated to perineural invasion phenotypes. We performed microarray analysis of embryonic and adult murine lacrimal glands and generated a differential expression signature associated with normal LG developmental pathways. Among other pathways, Notch and FGF signaling are significantly upregulated during LG organogenesis and our group and others have shown that activating mutations in these pathways are correlated with poor prognosis in LGACC. Interestingly, among the highest differentially expressed genes in the embryonic LG was the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75NTR). We thus subsequently evaluated the expression of p75NTR in LGACC tumors and its correlation to PNI. Our immunofluorescent imaging of histologically confirmed tumors with PNI demonstrated that p75NTR is highly correlated to cancer cells that have invaded the nerve. This correlation of p75NTR expression in nerve infiltrating LGACC cells can inform our investigation into the mechanisms for LGACC PNI and elucidate possible therapeutic targets to limit this aggressive manifestation in LGACC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49304f82-6b27-4eec-8e2d-0074d71953a1\/@u03B8ZLF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Perineural invasion,Adenoid cystic carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11764"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Acadia H.

However, how mSin1 regulates cell migration is poorly understood. In this study, we found that knockout of mSin1 suppressed cell spreading and migration in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, knockdown of mSin1 also inhibited cell spreading and migration in rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. Furthermore, we observed that knockout or knockdown of mSin1 reduced the activities of the small GTPases (RhoA and Rac1) in the cells. Ectopic expression of constitutively active Rac1, but not RhoA, partially attenuated the reduced cell spreading and migration induced by mSin1 deficiency. In addition, depletion of mSin1 remarkedly inhibited the phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr397 and paxillin at Tyr118 in the cells. The results suggest that mSin1 controls cell spreading and migration at least partly by mediating the activity of Rac1 and the phosphorylation of FAK.

The presence of distal metastasis at the time of the first diagnosis represents a worst prognosis factor for patients&#8217; long-term survival. Therefore, finding new targets to arrest the metastatic process is a main challenge for successful CRC therapy. Our laboratory focused its attention on the Chloride Intracellular Channel 1 (CLIC1), a metamorphic protein able to switch from a cytoplasmic to a transmembrane form associated to ion channel activity. Previous experiments demonstrate that tmCLIC1 functional activity is negligible in normal colon cells, while increases proportionally to CRC cells&#8217; aggressiveness. Moreover, we also reveal that tmCLIC1 supports CRC cells abnormal proliferation rate. Here, we show that tmCLIC1 pharmacological inhibition or its stable downregulation led to a significative reduction of CRC cells migrative and invasive potential, <i>in vitro<\/i>. To further confirm our hypothesis, we analysed downregulation of metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) protein and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, both involved in migration and metastatic processes. Moreover, we demonstrate in murine model that CLIC1 knock-down impairs tumor growth and limits cancer cells dissemination. We tried to investigate the alteration of metastatic pathways after CLIC1 silencing. We obtained that many different genes are downregulated when CLIC1 protein is absent; in particular, genes regulated by Reactive Species of Oxygen (ROS) levels. In this scenario, we tried to define the mechanism of action in which CLIC1 is involved. Altogether, all the results obtained in the present work could be considered a starting point to design a new therapeutic strategy to counteract against metastatic colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/70dbe464-8d6e-48a7-8d90-17d62fe9b3cb\/@u03B8ZLF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Metastasis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11775"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Francesca Cianci<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Verduci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Carlini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlotta Tacconi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Ranucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandro Fantin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tullio Florio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Mazzanti<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus, identification of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that promote or inhibit tumor migration and invasion are critical. Increasingly, the dysregulation of cellular metabolism is being linked not only to tumor growth but tumor cell migration. Phosphorus (Pi) is an essential micronutrient necessary for energy metabolism, cell signaling via ATP, formation of nucleic acids and the cell membrane, and mineralization of the skeleton. Unsurprisingly, high levels of Pi are observed in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue, consistent with a demand for this metabolite in rapidly growing cells. Further, our lab has reported that high extracellular Pi increases cell growth, alters gene expression and protein translation, and promotes angiogenesis. High dietary Pi levels has also been shown to increase tumorigenesis in both lung and skin cancer models. However, it remains unknown how phosphate metabolism affects tumor migration and invasion. Here we report that high levels of Pi increases gene expression of EMT-related genes such as Twist, Vimentin, CD44, and OPN in the lung cancer cell line, A549. Further, increased Pi promotes tumor cell migration in a transwell assay and decreased Pi levels or inhibition of phosphate transport by phosphonoformic acid (PFA) impaired migration. Suggesting that high Pi can promote a pro-migration phenotype by upregulating EMT in cancer cells and by increasing directed cell migration. Ongoing research will focus on how intracellular Pi flux changes during cell invasion using a novel FRET-based phosphate sensor <i>in vitro<\/i> and the effect of Pi inhibition on metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. These findings provide further evidence for the role dysregulated Pi metabolism in promoting cancer progression and the potential for therapeutic intervention with broad impacts on patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/962c7306-a8a8-4b39-9183-6c66ff6543f5\/@u03B8ZLF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Migration,Invasion,Phosphate Metabolism,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11776"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jamie Arnst<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Beck<\/i><\/presenter>.

Castration resistance and resistance&#8239; to the next-gen androgen receptor&#8239;(AR) targeted drugs are major challenges. Castration resistance involves multiple mechanisms, including androgen-independent signaling by androgen receptor (AR)- or its variants, and lineage plasticity (LP) with AR-indifferent neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Identifying new vulnerabilities across these multitude mechanisms could provide new therapeutic avenues against castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). The cell-surface di-ganglioside GD2 is overexpressed in neural crest cell tumors such as neuroblastoma &#38; melanoma and chimeric (Dinutuximab) or humanized (Naxitamab) anti-GD2 antibodies are now FDA-approved for high-risk neuroblastoma therapy. GD2 expression is reported in other cancers such as breast cancer and glioma and is linked to cancer stem cell behavior. While limited prior studies have detected GD2 expression in PCa cell lines or tumor tissues, nothing is known about the functional role of GD2 in PCa.<br \/>Objectives: We hypothesized that GD2 overexpression in PCa could play a pro-tumorigenic role and that linkage of GD2 overexpression with CRPC progression&#8239;may reveal the potential of targeting GD2 for CRPC therapy.<br \/>Study Design &#38; Results: Immunohistochemical analysis of PCa patient and patient-derived xenograft tissue microarrays (TMAs) revealed GD2 expression in a subset of tumor cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of PCa cell lines showed strong constitutive GD2 expression on murine CRPC cell line RM-1 (derived from mutant Ras and c-Myc overexpressing prostatic epithelial cells) and human PCa line 22Rv1 (overexpresses wild-type AR and ARv7 splice variant). GD2 expression was induced <i>de novo<\/i> upon induction of lineage plasticity in GD2-negative LNCaP C4-2 prostate adenocarcinoma cell line by shRNA knockdown (KD) of RB1 or TP53. High GD2 expression was also induced when C4-2B cells were made enzalutamide resistant (C4-2BER). Induction of GD2 expression correlated with increased expression of rate-limiting GD2 biosynthetic pathway enzyme GD3 synthase (GD3S). CRISPR-Cas9 mediated stable GD3S knockout (KO) in the RM1 cell line led to the loss of GD2 expression. The GD3S-KO RM1 cells exhibited reduced proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor sphere forming ability compared to the control cells. Intratibial injections in castrated male C57BL\/6 mice showed a significant reduction in tumor development by GD3S KO RM1 cells compared to control cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that GD2 is expressed in a subset of prostate cancers. Cell line-based studies show that GD2 expression promotes pro-tumorigenic traits. Future studies will assess the biological roles of GD2 in PCa and the potential of targeting GD2<sup>+<\/sup> CRPC with antibody-based approved therapeutic agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ba0a7577-2c25-4509-84ae-c28ec4261619\/@m03B8ZLG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Ganglioside,Metastasis,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11783"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aaqib M.

Our laboratory has been developing a novel cyclic peptide coined MTI-101, which induces cell death via calcium overload, a finding dependent on the TRPC1\/TRPC5\/TRPC4 complex. To better understand determinants of sensitivity and resistance to MTI-101, we developed drug resistant isogenic lung cancer cell lines. Two isogenic drug resistant cell lines were generated with chronic exposure to MTI-101 in PC-9 (NSCLC EGFR Driven) and H446 (SCLC PTEN Deleted and c-MYC amplified). Drug resistance was confirmed in both cell lines with over two-fold increases in IC50 values upon treatment with MTI-101 in MTT assays. Interestingly, pushing the resistant levels beyond a two-fold increase was not obtained as cultures did not sustain growth with increased selection pressure. Using the isogenic systems coupled with RNA-SEQ, the top enriched GSEA hallmark was downregulation of genes that contribute to EMT in both MTI-101 resistant lines. The RNA-SEQ data correlated with changes in the phenotype which included a significant decreased invasion in Matrigel and changes of MET markers (E-Cadherin, Vimentin) at the protein level. Furthermore, in the EGFR driven PC-9 cell line, selection for resistance towards MTI-101 resulted in collateral sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. To determine the stability of the MET phenotype, cells were removed from drug, then tested for invasion and drug resistance every month. Our data indicated that the MET phenotype and genotype was stable for a minimum of six months. RNA-SEQ data continued to demonstrate decreased expression of EMT in cells removed from drug compared to the parental cell line. MTI-101 treatment in PC-9 and H446 cells showed synergistic activity with standard of cares Erlotinib, Osimertinib, and Cisplatin when used in combination on the wildtype cells as well. Finally, in vivo data indicates that MTI-101 treatment selects for increased E-Cadherin and decreased Vimentin. Similar to the cell line model, this finding correlated with decreased incidence of bone metastasis in the PC-9 in vivo model. Together our data indicate that MTI-101 treatment could be used as a tool to delay the emergence of resistance and potentially inhibit or delay the emergence of metastatic disease for the treatment of lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6518e47d-1e68-4f26-a10d-36921322be45\/@m03B8ZLG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Drug resistance,Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11784"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Clark Jones<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lori Hazlehurst<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although expression of, and signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly seen in TNBC, anti-EGFR antibodies such as Cetuximab have had limited therapeutic efficacy, used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Primary TNBC tumor growth and metastases require supporting vasculature, which develops through a combination of endothelial angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Our laboratory previously developed a novel targeted therapy, &#945;EGFR-E-P125A, an antibody-endostatin fusion protein, by linking an anti-EGFR antibody targeting domain to a mutated version of the anti-angiogenic protein endostatin (E-P125A). &#945;EGFR-E-P125A delivers a dimeric E-P125A payload which inhibits TNBC angiogenesis and VM <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, and decreases metastatic tumor growth (lung metastasis) in both the MDA-MB-231-4175 and MDA-MB 468 TNBC xenograft models. Preliminary studies of the mechanism of &#945;EGFR-E-P125A action indicate that &#945;EGFR-E-P125A downregulates VM through combined inhibition of EGFR and integrin signaling. Phospho-array analysis of &#945;EGFR-E-P125A treated MDA-MB-231-4175 cells demonstrated downregulation of phosphorylation of EGFR at Y1069, a site of aberrant EGFR signaling which promotes TNBC motility. The phospho-array also demonstrated inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation at Y397. FAK signaling occurs downstream of &#946;1 and &#946;3 integrins, and the Y397 site is implicated in the regulation of endothelial and TNBC motility, VM, and metastatic behavior. We specifically inhibited FAK at the Y397 site using a small molecule inhibitor, PF-573228, and demonstrated that FAK inhibition at Y397 alone inhibited the TNBC VM <i>in vitro<\/i>. shRNA-mediated knockdown of FAK in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells confirmed that downregulation of FAK inhibited VM formation <i>in vitro<\/i>. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of EGFR detected the presence of &#946;1 integrin, and IP of &#946;1 integrin detected EGFR in both MDA-MB-231-4175 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells treated with &#945;EGFR-E-P125A. &#945;EGFR-E-P125A treatment increased levels of bound &#946;1 integrin following IP of EGFR relative to untreated or Cetuximab treated TNBC cells. These results indicate that &#945;EGFR-E-P125A is binding to both EGFR and &#946;1 integrin simultaneously, suppressing downstream EGFR and integrin signaling. Simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and &#946;1 integrin signaling by &#945;EGFR-E-P125A fusion is a promising approach to inhibition of TNBC growth and metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a9c146c-1114-44d1-a555-a94cd043d36c\/@m03B8ZLG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Integrins,Vasculogenic Mimicry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11785"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ankita P.

The primary hurdles facing PDAC patients and clinicians are early dissemination, a lack of therapeutic targets and desmoplasia that renders the primary tumor refractory to chemotherapy. In this regard, we have previously reported that pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1) and integrin &#945;1 (ITGA1) mediate gemcitabine resistance and metastasis in PDAC. To identify new mechanisms of PDAC progression, we mined the Cancer BioPortal and Human Cell Map BioID databases for additional pseudopodium-enriched (PDE) proteins that predict poor patient outcomes, correlate with PEAK1 and ITGA1 expression in PDAC, and interact with PEAK1 and ITGA1. Here, we identify Retinoic Acid Induced 14 (RAI14, Ankycorbin or NORPEG) as a new candidate driver of PDAC that is a constituent of the KRasG12D PDAC cell autonomous phosphoproteome, localizes to cytoskeleton\/adhesion domains in PDAC cells and correlates in expression with ITGA1-binding collagens in PDAC. Knockdown or knockout of RAI14 in KRas mutant PDAC cells impaired adhesion-dependent proliferation\/survival in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Single cell cyclic immunofluorescence (CycIF) further revealed that RAI14 supports a subpopulation of PDAC cells positive for proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and antiapoptotic programs. By using a RAI14-focused bioinformatics pipeline in combination with proteomic and immunofluorescence data on the composition of ITGA1-dependent adhesion complexes in PDAC cells, we identified Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1) as a candidate that may control RAI14 function and adhesion-regulated mitosis during PDAC progression. Notably, the potency of volasertib, a PLK1-specific inhibitor, was reduced in RAI14 knockout cells, supporting a model in which RAI14 mediates adhesion-dependent PLK1 functions in PDAC. Taken together, these studies uncover a mechanism for RAI14-driven PDAC progression and the development of strategies to increase chemotherapy sensitivity, reduce primary\/metastatic tumor burden and improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ecb092df-55ba-4123-99e1-e82a7cf8f44a\/@m03B8ZLG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Metastasis,Cell cycle,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11786"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Farhana Runa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luke Tomaneng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yvess Adamian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Cox<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albert-Fred Aquino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Wallace<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolina Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kishan Bhakta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malachia Hoover<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurelin Wolfenden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan D.

It is also a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The disease is potentially curable when diagnosed early with survival records of more than 90%. This number, however ,sharply declines to less than 20% when diagnosed at advanced stages. Therefore identification of functional molecular markers that can predict the progression of the disease is of utmost importance as early diagnosis enhances the chances of successful therapeutic intervention. Kr&#252;ppel-like Factors (KLFs) are a family of evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators with zinc finger DNA binding domains. KLFs have been shown to play important roles both in normal development as well as in disease progression. In cancers, KLFs have been reported to regulate diverse cellular processes like cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Of the 17 KLFs identified to date, KLF4 and KLF 5 show significantly altered expression in GC tissues compared to normal gastric tissues (TCGA sample analysis of gene expression pattern for KLFs). WhileKLF5 typically pro-proliferative and acts as a tumor promoter, KLF4 has been both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive. KLF4 downregulation is associated with a poor prognosis in GC. However, the specific role of KLF4 in GC progression has not been fully elucidated. Using human GC tissues, orthotropic gastric tumors developed in athymic nude mice, and<i> in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vitro <\/i>functional assays, we hereby report that loss of KLF4 in GC disrupts tight junction stability of epithelial cells. Loss of KLF4 expression correlates with altered expression of tight junction proteins such as claudins and ZO1 in GC. Altered expression of these proteins results in disruption of epithelial barrier integrity leading to cell detachment and metastasis. Therefore, our work indicates that loss of KLF4 observed in GC may promote cell metastasis and can serve as a prognostic marker for GC metastasis. The knowledge generated from this study not only imparts insight into the pathogenesis of GC metastasis but also will be helpful in the development of newer treatment strategies in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86e55169-d840-4f56-a2ef-73028ab07743\/@m03B8ZLG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,KLF4,Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11787"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sandeep Goswami<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chandrani Sarkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendy L.

Recently, this relationship was found to be conserved in mammalian cells, and mTORC2 was shown to be an effector of oncogenic Ras. Deregulated mTORC2 signaling in cancer is mostly associated with increased survival and metabolic reprogramming, but mTORC2 has also been linked to cancer cell migration, particularly in breast cancer. Interestingly, although Ras is rarely mutated in breast cancer, it is often upregulated due to amplification and overexpression of growth factor receptors. Here, we investigated the role of Ras in promoting the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells through mTORC2. We observed that Ras and mTORC2 promote the migration of breast cancer cells, independently of the breast cancer molecular subtype. Using breast epithelial MCF10A cells transformed with HER2 or mutant Ras, we found that Ras promotes mTORC2 activation, and mTORC2-dependent migration and invasion. We further observed that while mutant Ras-transformed MCF10A cells display uncontrolled cell proliferation and an invasive phenotype, silencing of the mTORC2-dependent component Rictor mostly leads to loss of invasiveness. Together, our findings suggest that, whereas Ras activation of mTORC2 is likely to play a minor role in breast tumor formation, the Ras-mTORC2 pathway plays a key and general role in promoting the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b8aafa7-fc71-48e8-90b5-b9a278e52aaa\/@m03B8ZLG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,mTOR,Migration,Invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11788"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mollie E.

Animal model investigations can accelerate the understanding of human diseases and since few models are available for OS, we refined a rat model to ask questions regarding pathways of metastasis and metastasis biomarker predictiveness. The outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model is an immunocompetent, syngeneic model, as we implant UMR106 OS cells (ATCC), which were originally isolated from a SD OS. We developed a reproducible method to orthotopically implant cells into the tibia microenvironment and to amputate the limb for longitudinal studies. Using young rats, we also modeled pediatric OS. We found that rats develop reproducible primary and metastatic pulmonary tumors which histologically resemble human primary and metastatic osteosarcoma. Using immunohistochemistry methods, we found that primary OS is infiltrated with numerous macrophages with relatively fewer CD3+ T cells. A protein expression survey of these OS cells revealed significant expression of ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases (ErbB2, ErbB4), which have recently been shown to be anti-inflammatory against macrophages. We also discovered that rats with osteosarcoma have markedly high serum levels of Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15), also called Macrophage Inhibitory Cytokine 1, a member of the TGF beta family of proteins, which is also frequently expressed with ErbB2 in cancers. GDF15 was measured by ELISA. Western blot analysis showed that GDF15 precursor (pro-peptide) was expressed in primary and metastases. This model will enable studies with anti-ErbB2 or GDF15 pathway inhibition to assess the role of macrophage activation in the setting of pathway inhibition and chemotherapy, as well as how pathway inhibition modulates metastasis incidence. In vivo and invitro, systems will enable the assessment of the role of GDF15 as a potential biomarker of metastasis, compared to tibial radiographic patterns, serum alkaline phosphatase, and lung histopathology. In conclusion, we have an immunocompetent, syngeneic orthotopic osteosarcoma rat model which affectively resembles human osteosarcoma, and can be used for better understanding metastasis mechanisms and metastasis biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9baaff0f-7e0b-4ab8-9265-63a0ed057896\/@n03B8ZLH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Animal models,Cytokines,ErbB receptors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11790"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shun Ishiyama<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bailey West<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyo-Jeong Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomoaki Ito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harumi Saeki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malcolm V.

Locoregional invasion, an early step in metastasis, is driven by the development of finger-like processes on the tumor cell known as invadopodia. Mature, active invadopodia secrete matrix metalloproteases (MMP) that enable extension of the cell into the extracellular matrix (ECM). Kinesins haul RAB-bound vesicles containing MMPs along microtubules the length of invadopodia for secretion to the most distal aspect of the invadopodia. It is unclear how these kinesins are modulated within invadopodia. In preliminary studies on patient samples, we identified high levels of doublecortin like kinase (DCLK1) at the invasive front of HNSCC. We hypothesize DCLK1 supports the function of kinesins as a mechanism of invasion. DCKL1 was knocked down in HNSCC lines with a short hairpin RNA (shDCLK1). Invasion and migration assays were performed in shDCLK1 and shcontrol tumor cells by utilizing a transwell assay. Confocal microscopy using Leica LAS X, was performed to assess colocalization of DCLK1 and markers of mature invadopodia (cortactin, TKS5, MT1-MMP) in HNSCC lines for. . To validate the association of DCLK1 with Kif16B and RAB40b, we carried out a co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Finally, conditioned media from shDCLK1 and shControl HNSCC cells was used to assess MMP activity using gelatin zymography and MMP profiler arrays. Transwell assay demonstrates reduced movement in shDCLK1 compared to shcontrol tumor cells (p &#60;0.0001 invasion, p &#60;0.001 migration). Confocal microscopy shows colocalization of MMP 9 and DCLK1 to invadopodia. DCLK1 immunoprecipitation show RAB40b and Kif16b complex together. Additionally, DCLK1, RAB40b, and Kif16b colocalize to invadopodia in confocal studies. We found that DCLK1 colocalizes with markers of mature invadopodia, and that DCLK1 colocalizes to Rab40b, Kif16b, and MMP9 within invadopodia. DCLK1 and MMP9 co-localize to invadopodia as well. Cells expressing DCLK1 had increased MMP 1, and 9 (p &#60;0.041, p &#60;0.001) expression compared to shDCLK1 cells. Further, shDCLK1 cells have significantly attenuated MMP 1 and 9 activity as measured by gelatin zymography. These studies reveal a novel role of DCLK1 in the molecular mechanism driving invadopodia, MMP trafficking and signaling. These early studies indicate that targeting DCLK1 in HNSCC may reduce locoregional invasion and help prevent early metastatic spread.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/46ba8a38-22c8-4344-a55e-f0139ecf2685\/@n03B8ZLH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Invasion,Metastasis,Extracellular matrix,Kinesin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11791"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Levi K.

Here we expand on these findings through <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse studies and retrospective patient analysis. To elucidate how colorectal cancers may use the IL4 pathway to grow and infiltrate surrounding tissue, we performed two <i>in vivo<\/i> studies independently targeting <i>IL4ra<\/i> in myeloid and intestinal epithelial tissues. Mice with a deleted allele of <i>IL4ra<\/i> and a floxed allele of <i>IL4ra<\/i> were crossed with either a line expressing a myeloid-specific Cre (<i>LysM Cre<\/i>) or an intestinal epithelial-specific Cre (<i>Villin Cre<\/i>). Our results indicate that myeloid-expressed <i>IL4ra<\/i> facilitates tumorigenesis but is not a significant contributor to later growth. In contrast, epithelial <i>IL4ra<\/i> significantly contributes to tumor number and size, but had little effect on the observed number of aberrant crypt foci, an early indicator of colon cancer.<br \/>We hypothesized that effects of atypical IL4 activity could also be observed in the medical record. Atopic diseases such as asthma and eczema are characterized by an overabundance of IgE, a protein regulated by the IL4 pathway. Using Vanderbilt University Medical Center&#8217;s SD Discover program, we obtained de-identified records for patients diagnosed with at least stage II colorectal carcinoma between 2005 and 2015. We then stratified patients by metastatic progression. Patients who were diagnosed with asthma prior to age sixty were significantly less likely to develop an advanced form of colorectal cancer and at reduced risk of metastatic disease or recurrence. This may be a result of medication prescribed for atopic disease such as inhalers and corticosteroids and we are performing further analyses to test these hypotheses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e379f2da-cab9-4032-b331-7a7ce18c6a2e\/@n03B8ZLH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Mouse models,Colorectal,Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11792"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jacob Beckstead<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Petros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kunaal Mehrotra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Fingleton<\/i><\/presenter>.

Mutations in the tumor suppressor <i>TP53<\/i> (human homolog of mouse <i>Trp53)<\/i><i>, <\/i>which encodes p53, are detected frequently in ESCC that in turn correlate with poor survival and high metastatic rates. We have conducted RNA-Seq and cytokine array on primary and metastatic tumor cells harvested from our mouse models with <i>Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup><\/i> mutation. We have identified colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) to be upregulated. Our data suggest the existence of CSF1-CSF1R autocrine signaling, and its functional relationship to the promotion of metastasis in ESCC, recognizing that CSF1 is known to be critical in the polarization of macrophages to M2-like tumor associated macrophages. Our goal is to investigate the role and mediators of CSF1\/CSF1R signaling by which missense <i>TP53<\/i> mutations<i><sup> <\/sup><\/i>can promote invasion and lung metastasis in ESCC.<br \/>Methods: We used <i>L2<\/i>-<i>Cre; LSL<\/i>-<i>Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup>; Rosa26<sup>LSL<\/sup><\/i><sup>-<\/sup><i><sup>YFP<\/sup><\/i> mice and 2D\/3D cell culture systems to model ESCC. To assess the functional role of CSF1, we established a CRISPR approach to knockout <i>Csf1<\/i>in our cells introducing ribonucleoprotein (RNP) Cas9\/gRNA complex via nucleofection and overexpressed <i>Csf1<\/i>. We also utilized a small molecule inhibitor of CSF1R, GW2580. We conducted TCGA analysis on the association of distinct <i>TP53<\/i> mutations with ESCC prognosis and <i>Csf1<\/i> expression, as well as <i>Csf1<\/i> expression in metastatic tumors. Based on this, we modeled ESCC by introducing various DNA contact and conformational p53 mutations into esophageal cells with wildtype p53 via base editing.<br \/>Results: TCGA data and our models demonstrate that metastatic ESCCs have increased <i>Csf1<\/i> expression compared to primary tumors and it is dependent upon p53 mutation status. In addition, analysis of ESCC patients&#8217; datasets reveal that specific p53 mutations are associated with markedly differential overall survival rates and <i>Csf1<\/i> expression. We show that <i>Csf1<\/i> function is related to tumor cell invasion, primary tumor growth and metastatic tumor burden in a mutant p53 background. We have identified both bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) protein BRD4 and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) as proteins that interact with Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup> at higher levels compared to wildtype p53 to induce <i>Csf1<\/i> expression. In addition, inhibition of CSF1R with small molecule GW2580 downregulated JAK-STAT3 pathway mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanisms that would contribute to increased invasiveness and metastasis.<br \/>Conclusion: We have demonstrated novel roles and mechanisms of mutant p53-dependent CSF1-CSF1R autocrine signaling and its mediators in promoting lung metastasis from ESCC that may be applicable to other squamous cell cancers. We believe this mechanism can be targeted therapeutically.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/50c40380-79ec-4dff-a7a6-cc97cfe198a2\/@n03B8ZLH\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Esophageal cancer,Metastasis,BET bromodomain,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11846"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gizem Efe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiaosi Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ricardo Cruz-Acuna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kensuke Suzuki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kensuke Sugiura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joel Gabre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uma Sachdeva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carol L.

Activated BRAF <sup>V600E<\/sup> hyperactivates ERK signaling and causes ERK dependent dysregulation of proliferation. However, BRAF <sup>V600E<\/sup> alone is insufficient to drive melanoma formation in genetically engineered mice models. Moreover, 82% of benign nevi harbor BRAF V600E mutations. In contrast, in BRAF <sup>V600E<\/sup>\/PTEN<sup>-\/-<\/sup> GEMM models, rapid onset of aggressive and disseminated melanomas occurs. We show here that cell migration and invasion of melanocytes expressing BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> is depressed in vitro and in vivo and significantly accelerated by pharmacologic inhibition of ERK signaling or by deletion of PTEN. Upon ERK inhibition, cells lose their cell-cell junctions and become single cells with actin rich protrusions and a mesenchymal morphology. ERK pathway activation affects each step of the migration cycle, impeding cell spreading, assembly of stress fibers, and focal contact formation, all of which are associated with decreased mobility and invasion. Hyperactivation of ERK signaling by BRAF V600E has been shown to cause potent feedback inhibition of RTK signaling and wild type RAS. We now show that this is associated with feedback inhibition of RAC1, a RAS-like small GTPase required for cell migration. Moreover, ERK pathway inhibition reactivates RAC in an RTK-dependent manner. Consistent with these findings, expression of RAC1 P29S, an activating mutant, and overexpression of PREX2, an activator of RAC1, both rescue migration in BRAF V600E cells, as does loss of PTEN expression, which converges with RAC1 activation downstream. Taken together, these data suggest that whereas hyperactivation of ERK signaling by BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> dysregulates proliferation, ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAC1 inhibits cell mobility and invasiveness and prevents full transformation. Selection of secondary genetic events that overcome or bypass RAC1 feedback is thus required for full transformation. In support of this view, RAC1 mutation, PTEN loss, or PREX2 amplification occurs in 38% of human melanomas. Thus, oncogene induced feedback may be deleterious and directs tumor evolution by causing selection of mutations that restore functions necessary for transformation","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f0cb663f-d08d-4c40-aab9-97448c89b1a7\/@n03B8ZLH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Rac,Migration,PTEN,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11847"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sunyana Gadal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob A.

Cells at the front lead and direct collective migration, yet how these leader cells form and interact with the microenvironment to direct migration are not fully appreciated. From live videos of primary mouse and human breast tumor organoids in a 3D microfluidic system that mimics the native breast tumor microenvironment, we developed 3D computational models. These hypothesize that for leader cells to polarize to the leading edge and lead directed collective migration they need to generate high protrusive forces and overcome extracellular matrix (ECM) resistance. From scRNAseq of migrating primary tumor organoids, we identify significant K14+ &#8220;leader&#8221; cell heterogeneity that differs depending upon the environmental signal. We isolate a unique Cadherin-3 (Cdh3) positive leader cell subpopulation that is necessary and sufficient to lead collective migration. Cdh3 controls leader cell protrusion dynamics through controlling the local production of Laminin-332 which is required for integrin\/focal adhesion function. Loss of Cdh3 expression in mouse and human primary breast tumor organoids and invasive breast tumor cell lines significantly impairs directed collective migration. In the absence of leader cell Cdh-Cdh3 intercellular adhesions there is reduced cellular &#946;-catenin levels and Laminin 332 production. In syngeneic, orthotopic transplant mouse models, Cdh3 depletion in tumor cells resulted in decreased laminin 332 production at the invasive edge of primary tumors and decreased lung metastasis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that in contacted cells &#946;-catenin and TCF4 are present on Lam &#945;3, &#946;3, and &#947;2 promoter regions. Laminin 332 production by leader cells was required for optimal Integrin\/FA function and cellular protrusion stability. These results indicated that in leader cells local Cdh3-Cdh3\/&#946;-catenin regulated Laminin 332 production controls protrusion dynamics and overcomes resistance to ECM to lead directed collective tumor migration. Our findings highlight how a unique subset of leader cells in breast tumors interact with the microenvironment to direct collective migration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b436c8a1-79a5-4d34-8614-42dd24e5f937\/@n03B8ZLH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Collective migration,P-cadherin,Laminin 332,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11848"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanyang Cao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priscilla Y.

However, the exact mechanism of PCa cell spread is still unknown. We uncovered a novel interaction between two unrelated promotility factors, tousled-like kinase 1 (TLK1) and MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), which initiates a signaling cascade promoting metastasis. In PCa, TLK1-MK5 signaling might be crucial as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) leads to increased expression of both TLK1 and MK5 in metastatic patients. Moreover, TCGA analysis also revealed higher expression of both TLK1 and MK5 in metastatic tumors. Therefore, we hypothesize that <b>TLK1-MK5 axis promotes PCa cell migration and invasion through actin reorganization as well as focal adhesion proteins modification and disruption of this interaction may help to keep the tumor localized.<\/b><br \/><b>Methods and Results:<\/b> We conducted scratch wound repair and proliferation assays to determine if TLK1 and MK5 can regulate motility and proliferation. Both genetic depletion and pharmacologic inhibition of TLK1 and MK5 resulted in reduced migration of both non-malignant MEF and PCa cells without affecting cellular proliferation rate. Trans-well invasion assays also demonstrated reduced invasion of MK5<sup>&#8722;\/&#8722;<\/sup> MEF cells in Matrigel and other ECMs. However, TLK1 overexpression alone in the MK5<sup>&#8722;\/&#8722;<\/sup> MEF cells did not increase the wound healing and invasion which suggested that TLK1 cannot enhance cellular migration and invasion in absence of MK5. We confirmed TLK1 binding of MK5 by co-IP, His- and GST-pull down assays and established that TLK1 phosphorylates MK5 on three residues (S160, S354, S386) that results in the catalytic activation of MK5. While WB detected substantial amount of pMK5 S354 and TLK1 in all major PCa cell lines, anti-androgen treatment increases pMK5 S354 level in a dose-dependent manner and pharmacologic inhibition of TLK1 reduces pMK5 S354 level in LNCaP cells, which suggest TLK1 as an authentic pMK5 S354 kinase. IHC analysis of TRAMP mice and human PCa TMA also revealed higher pMK5 S354 level in metastatic lesions compared to the low-risk tumors. In addition, pMK5 S354 was found to colocalize with neuroendocrine marker chromogranin A, together of which may suggest pMK5 as a potential biomarker of PCa aggressiveness. The motility reduction of PCa cells upon MK5 inhibition is a consequence of impaired actin filamentation as we observed in LNCaP and PC3 cells. Our WB analysis demonstrated that MK5 inhibition by a repurposed inhibitor results in decreased FAK Y861, Paxillin Y118, HSP27 S78\/82 phosphorylation, and ERK3 stabilization, which could lead to altered actin filamentation, focal adhesions, morphology, as well as motility and invasion.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data support that TLK1-MK5 axis is involved in driving PCa cell metastasis and clinical aggressiveness, hence, disruption of this axis may inhibit the metastasis of PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a947cfa3-074d-4ef2-aac7-aa0267d7da63\/@o03B8ZLJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,TLK1,MK5\/MAPKAPK5\/PRAK,Migration and Invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11849"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Md Imtiaz Khalil<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vibha Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judy A.

Cancer cells at the invasive front mimic the behaviors of non-tumorigenic epithelial cells at wound edges but show less coordinated migration comparatively. While most wound healing studies use a timeframe of 24-48 hours, our previous studies have shown that ATP released from wounded cells initiates a calcium (Ca2+) signal within seconds that spreads to neighboring cells through activation of the P2Y2 surface receptor. RNAseq data of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells with stepwise mutations of PTEN knockout and KRas activation alone or in combination, demonstrate that P2Y2 is downregulated specifically by active KRas. Fluorescence microscopy was used to measure Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial membrane potential in parental and mutant MCF10A cells. Change in total fluorescence was measured and compared to baseline using Fluo-4, a Ca2+ fluorescent indicator, and TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester), a fluorescent mitochondrial membrane potential dye on Nikon analysis software. We show that KRas activation disrupts ATP stimulation and Ca2+ signaling. This change was further quantified using a FlexStation III plate reader with Fluo-4 to read specific fluorescent changes in Ca2+ after ATP addition. ATP-stimulated Ca2+ was also disrupted in other breast tumor cell lines harboring Ras activating mutations, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436, both showing a similar decrease in P2Y2 expression. These data show that ATP stimulation can be used to further understand the differences in Ca2+ signaling and mechanical-response between normal breast epithelial cells and cancer cells. Clarifying these molecular mechanisms could reveal targets for new cancer treatments, especially since 90% of human tumors are epithelial carcinomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b88f3da8-7d45-4ed3-99b7-6023abeb6b58\/@o03B8ZLJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Migration,Calcium,ATP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11850"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Makenzy Mull<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Pratt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abanoub Gad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katarina Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Annis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keyata Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Vitolo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liron Boyman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stuart Martin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our prior studies have shown that deletion of the <i>ING4<\/i> tumor suppressor in breast cancer cells enabled migration in response to Cxcl10. Further, migration was blocked by small molecule inhibition of either the Cxcl10 receptor Cxcr3, or G&#946;&#947;, but not G&#945;i, indicating that G&#946;&#947; was a key component downstream of Cxcl10\/Cxcr3 signaling. There are 5 <i>GNB<\/i> genes encoding G&#946; and 14 <i>GNG<\/i> genes encoding G&#947; subunits in the human genome, however the precise subunits downstream of Cxcl10\/Cxcr3 in breast cancer are unknown.<br \/>Methods: RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes in response to Cxcl10 treatment in <i>ING4<\/i>-deleted MDAmb-231 breast cancer cells, with a focus on <i>GNB<\/i> or <i>GNG<\/i> genes. Clinical and gene expression data of primary tumors obtained from NCBI GEO dataset GDS806 were used to evaluate correlation between <i>GNG4<\/i> expression and patient survival. A CRISPR\/Cas9 system was used to delete <i>GNG4<\/i> in MDAmb231 cells and Western blot was used to confirm the gene deletion. We evaluated Cxcl10-induced migration of <i>GNG4<\/i>-deleted cells using transwell assays.<br \/>Results: RNA sequencing showed that expression of <i>GNG4<\/i> and <i>GNG14<\/i> among the <i>GNG<\/i> genes was increased by 9 fold and 8 fold, respectively, in <i>ING4<\/i>-deleted MDAmb231 cells treated with Cxcl10, suggesting that these may encode effector(s) downstream of Cxc10\/Cxcr3. <i>GNG4<\/i> expression alone did not correlate with disease free survival (DFS) in breast cancer patients. However, a trend towards improved DFS was observed in patients with tumors expressing high <i>ING4<\/i> and low <i>GNG4<\/i> levels compared to those with low <i>ING4<\/i> and high <i>GNG4<\/i> expressing tumors (HR=0.32, 95% CI 0.10-1.03, p=0.051), suggesting high <i>GNG4 <\/i>expression in the absence of ING4 may contribute to aggressive breast cancer. Effects of <i>GNG4<\/i> deletion in Cxcl10-induced migration are currently being evaluated.<br \/>Conclusions: <i>GNG4<\/i>, encoding G-protein subunit &#947;-4, was induced following Cxcl10 treatment specifically in <i>ING4<\/i>-deleted breast cancer cells, suggesting that ING4 may repress <i>GNG4<\/i> expression. Low <i>ING4<\/i> and high <i>GNG4<\/i> expression in breast tumors correlated with poor patient survival, implicating <i>GNG4<\/i> as a candidate G&#947; subunit in the Cxcl10\/Cxcr3\/ING4 axis. The function of <i>GNG4 <\/i>and <i>GNG14<\/i> (G&#947;-14) in Cxcl10-mediated breast cancer cell migration will be determined in the near future. These results may provide evidence that G&#947; subunits, in particular, G&#947;-4 or G&#947;-14, play a role in Cxcl10\/Cxcr3 signaling that mediates cancer cell migration. These results present G&#946;&#947; subunits as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of <i>ING4<\/i>-deficient breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73eba29d-8932-4997-bfc6-10ccb3c6a494\/@o03B8ZLJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Migration,Chemokines,G proteins,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11851"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sukriti Bagchi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suwon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.
