Specifically, MVP-S is a lipid-in-oil formulation of the DPX delivery platform, incorporating five survivin-specific immunogenic peptides, the innate immune stimulant, polydIdC, and a CD4 T cell helper peptide. In prior clinical studies, MVP-S and intermittent low-dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) elicited confirmed clinical responses (both partial and complete by RECISTv1.1) and induced a robust, durable survivin-specific CD8 T cell response. Moreover, the combination with pembrolizumab appeared to be well tolerated in solid tumors and lymphomas. The purpose of this phase 2 study is to explore whether this combination may be safe and effective in advanced, metastatic bladder cancer patients, both na&#239;ve to, and previously treated with, immune checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/><i><\/i>Results: Seventeen (17) subjects were treated with the combination of MVP-S, CPA and pembrolizumab. Subjects received an average of 3 prior lines of therapy with 13\/17 (76.4%) having previously received an anti-PD1\/L1. Seven subjects progressed on or after anti-PD1\/L1 as last line of therapy prior to entering the trial. The combination was well-tolerated, with majority of AEs being grade 1 or grade 2. Five (5) out of 17 subjects showed response: 3 subjects with PR (unconfirmed) and 2 with CR (confirmed). Three of these, including the 2 CRs, had progressed on anti-PD-1\/L1. Long-term clinical benefit has been observed in several subjects (one patient is still on treatment after 17 months) and coincides with an increase in detectable survivin-specific T cells in peripheral blood.<br \/>Conclusion: Preliminary data suggest that MVP-S\/CPA and pembrolizumab is a well-tolerated combination and shows encouraging preliminary clinical activity in the treatment of advanced or metastatic bladder cancer patients, including patients who have progressed on prior anti-PD-1\/L1 therapy.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL02-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Immunotherapy,Targeted therapy,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Olivier Rixe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Castonguay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henry Conter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Chalas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pratibha Desai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Squillante<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa A.

The CG0070 mechanism of action includes cell lysis and immunogenic cell death which is enhanced in the presence of GM-CSF. In an open label ph. 2 study, an overall CR rate of 62% and a CR at 12 months (m) of 29% have been observed in patients with high risk NMIBC previously treated with BCG. IV pembrolizumab, was recently approved by the FDA for patients with BCG-unresponsive CIS (with or without papillary tumors) with an overall complete RR of 41% and a 12 m CR rate of ~20%.This ph. 2 study will assess the potential synergy of the two agents in the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.<br \/>Methods:35 pts with BCG-unresponsive CIS with or without concurrent Ta or T1 disease will be treated with intravescical CG0070 (1x10<sup>12 <\/sup>vp) in combination with pembrolizumab at a dose of 400 mg IV q6 weeks. CG0070 will be administered weekly x 6 as induction followed by weekly x 3 maintenance instillations at months 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18. Pts with persistent CIS or HG Ta at 3 m may receive re-induction with weekly x 6 of CG0070. Pembrolizumab will be administered up to 24 m. Assessment of response will include q 3 m cystoscopy with biopsy of areas suspicious for disease, urine cytology, CTU\/MRU, and mandatory bladder mapping biopsies at 12 m. Recurrence of HG disease will be enumerated as disease recurrence. The primary endpoint of the study is CR at 12 m. Secondary endpoints will include CR at any time, progression free survival, duration of response, cystectomy free survival and the safety of the combination. Correlate assessments will include changes in the tumor immune microenvironment, systemic immune induction, viral replication and transgene expression. Baseline expression of PD-L1, coxsackie adenovirus receptor, E2F transcription factor as well as anti-Ad5 Ab titer will be correlated with tumor response.<br \/>Results: Thus far, 10 patients are evaluable at the 3 m timepoint for efficacy. Assessment of these 10 pts demonstrates 100% CR at 3 mos. Six of the 10 pts have also reached the 6 m hallmark in a CR as well as 2 at the 12 mos timepoint. Treatment related AE have been limited to transient grade 1-2 local-regional genitourinary adverse events with no grade 3 or 4 treatment related AE reported date.<br \/>Conclusions: This initial data on the efficacy and safety of CG0070 plus pembrolizumab for the treatment of BCG unresponsive NMIBC is encouraging.

However, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS remain disappointing for most patients and can vary depending on programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. This highlights the need for additional therapeutic options. Canakinumab is a monoclonal anti-interleukin-1&#946; antibody that inhibits pro-tumor inflammation and potentially enhances anti-tumor immune responses, with the potential to synergize with programmed death 1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy.<br \/>Methods: CANOPY-1 is a randomized, double-blind phase 3 study investigating the addition of canakinumab or placebo (PBO) to 1L pembrolizumab + PDC. Patients with previously untreated stage IIIB\/C or IV NSCLC, of any histology and no known <i>EGFR<\/i> or <i>ALK<\/i> alterations, were randomized 1:1 and stratified based on PD-L1 status, geographic region, and histology to canakinumab 200 mg or PBO every 3 weeks, plus pembrolizumab and histology-guided PDC for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance canakinumab or PBO, with pembrolizumab &#177; pemetrexed. The primary endpoints were investigator-assessed PFS (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1) and OS. Exploratory biomarker analyses were also investigated and will be presented at the time of the congress. The cut-off dates for these analyses were May 18, 2020 (PFS) and August 9, 2021 (OS).<br \/>Results: A total of 643 patients were randomized to canakinumab (n=320) or PBO (n=323) in combination with pembrolizumab + PDC. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms. Median PFS was 6.8 months for both treatment arms (HR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.67-1.09; one-sided <i>P<\/i>=0.102). Median OS was 20.8 and 20.2 months for the canakinumab and PBO arms, respectively (HR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.70-1.10; one-sided <i>P<\/i>=0.123). Grade 3\/4 adverse events (AEs) were reported for 205 (64.1%) patients in the canakinumab arm and 191 (59.3%) patients in the PBO arm, and fatal AEs were reported for 37 (11.6%) and 47 (14.6%) patients, respectively. AEs (any grade) leading to discontinuation of any study drug were reported for 72 (22.5%) patients in the canakinumab arm and 61 (18.9%) patients in the PBO arm.<br \/>Conclusions: The addition of canakinumab to pembrolizumab plus PDC did not statistically improve PFS nor<b> <\/b>OS for 1L treatment of patients with aNSCLC.

Immunotherapy has recently showed robust clinical activity in ES-SCLC. In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we evaluated adebrelimab (SHR-1316), a novel anti-PD-L1 antibody, in combination with standard chemotherapy (chemo) as first-line treatment for ES-SCLC.<br \/>Methods: Patients na&#239;ve to systemic treatment for ES-SCLC were randomized 1:1 to receive 4-6 cycles of adebrelimab (20 mg\/kg, iv, d1, q3w) or placebo with carboplatin (AUC 5, d1, q3w) plus etoposide (100 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, d1, d2, d3, q3w), followed by maintenance therapy with adebrelimab or placebo. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: 462 patients were randomized and treated (adebrelimab+chemo, n=230; placebo+chemo, n=232). As of Oct 08, 2021, with an median follow-up of 13.5 mo (all patients; 22.5 mo for patients alive), OS was significantly prolonged with adebrelimab+chemo vs placebo+chemo (median, 15.3 mo [95% CI 13.2-17.5] vs 12.8 mo [95% CI 11.3-13.7]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.72 [95% CI 0.58-0.90], 1-sided p=0.0017); OS rate was 62.9% vs 52.0% at 12 mo and 31.3% vs 17.2% at 24 mo. Progression-free survival (PFS) per independent review committee (IRC) was 5.8 mo (95% CI 5.6-6.9) with adebrelimab+chemo vs 5.6 mo (95% CI 5.5-5.7) with placebo+chemo (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54-0.83); PFS rate was 49.4% vs 37.3% at 6 mo and 19.7% vs 5.9% at 12 mo. Objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) also favored the adebrelimab+chemo group (Table 1). Grade &#8805;3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 85.7% vs 84.9% of patients with adebrelimab+chemo vs placebo+chemo, with the most common (frequency &#8805;5%) being hematological toxicities in both groups.<br \/>Conclusions: The addition of adebrelimab to chemotherapy significantly improved OS with an acceptable safety profile, supporting this combination as a new first-line treatment option for ES-SCLC.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{BBE2CCDA-0A2B-4B35-9B72-9C6B952F18C8}\"><caption>Efficacy outcomes<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Adebrelimab+Chemo (n=230)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Placebo+Chemo (n=232)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median OS (95% CI), mo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.3 (13.2-17.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12.8 (11.3-13.7)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI)<sup>*<\/sup>, 1-sided log-rank p<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.72 (0.58-0.90);

However, most patients (pts) do not experience durable responses and new treatment options are needed to improve clinical outcomes. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that intratumoral CD40 activation synergizes with anti-PD-1 based therapy and induces systemic and distant anti-tumor effects. In this ongoing phase I\/II study, we assessed intratumoral sotigalimab (APX005M), a CD40 agonist antibody, in combination with systemic pembrolizumab in CPI treatment na&#239;ve, unresectable stage III or IV MM. A total of 40 participants will be enrolled. As of December 15, 2021, 30 pts were enrolled. Pts received sotigalimab every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses. The dose escalation portion of the trial has been completed, with 14 pts enrolled in 5 dosing cohorts of sotigalimab at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3 and 10 mg. The primary objectives include safety and tolerability, determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and assessment of the overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1. Biomarker analyses of blood and tumor samples were performed to measure immune activation using immunophenotyping including imaging mass cytometry, TCR sequencing, and a cross-cohort comparison of gene expression data (sotigalimab plus pembrolizumab versus anti-PD1 monotherapy). The combination therapy has been well-tolerated, and there were no study discontinuations or death due to treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Most common TRAEs were injection-site reactions; six pts experienced grade-3 immune-related adverse events. Efficacy analysis of 30 pts with post-baseline disease evaluations demonstrated an ORR of 50% (5 CR and 10 PR) in distant lesions and a disease control rate of 67%. The ORR at the RP2D of 10 mg is 55% (12\/22). Responses were observed in PD-L1<sup> <\/sup>negative pts and those with elevated LDH. Comprehensive transcriptome and immune cell profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor biopsies obtained from local lesions at baseline and 24 hours post sotigalimab injection demonstrate that sotigalimab effectively engaged CD40 pathway. In comparison to anti-PD1 monotherapy, the combination therapy significantly increased expression of genes associated with antigen presentation and effector T cells in local lesions accompanied by an increase in T cell activation genes at distant lesions. Additionally, T cell repertoire analysis demonstrated a significant increase in T cell clonality with expansion of new clones shared between local and distant tumors. Importantly, these immunologic changes were correlated with clinical response. Collectively, this combination therapy is well tolerated and has a notable clinical response rate, accompanied by broad innate and adaptive immune activation at both local and distant lesions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Salah-Eddine Bentebibel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodabe Amariae<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel McGrail<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Srisuda Lecagoonporn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cara Haymaker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dzifa Duose<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khalida Wani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Houssein Safa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabella Claudia Glitza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sapna Pradyuman Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael K.

Here we report an update on the safety and efficacy of the combination treatment.<br \/>Methods Dose escalation followed a standard 3+3 design. Objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The evaluation period for dose-limiting toxicities in each dose step was 21 days. The RP2D was defined as the MTD or a dose below, considering pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. The study is ongoing (data cut-off 26 January 2022).<br \/>Results: Twenty-one patients with a median of 2 (range 1-6) lines of previous systemic therapies were treated with 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, and 12.0 &#956;g\/kg of SOT101 subcutaneously in combination with pembrolizumab. The MTD was not yet reached at the ongoing dose level 12.0 &#181;g\/kg, which is the RP2D in SOT101 monotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were transient and included pyrexia, chills, injection site reaction, anemia, transaminase elevation, vomiting, and lymphopenia. One dose-limiting toxicity with rash, hypotension, and oliguria was reported at 6.0 &#181;g\/kg. The event resolved within 2 days and the patient continued with SOT101 at a lower dose. No treatment-related death was reported. One patient achieved a confirmed complete response (CR): mesothelioma at 9.0 &#181;g\/kg, on treatment 20 weeks with CR. This patient was immune checkpoint blocker (ICB)-na&#239;ve. Four patients achieved a partial response (PR): thyroid gland carcinoma at 3.0 &#181;g\/kg, ICB-na&#239;ve, on treatment 61 weeks with PR; skin squamous cell carcinoma at 6.0 &#181;g\/kg, ICB-relapsed, with PR and disappearance of target lesions, then fluctuating lesions, and on treatment 46 weeks with significant clinical benefit; skin melanoma at 6.0 &#181;g\/kg, ICB-relapsed, on treatment 41 weeks with PR; cervical melanoma at 9.0 &#181;g\/kg, ICB-pretreated, discontinued treatment after 8 weeks while still on PR. Five patients had confirmed stable disease (SD): anal squamous cell carcinoma (anal SCC) at 1.5 &#181;g\/kg, gastric cancer at 3.0 &#181;g\/kg, cervical cancer at 6.0 &#181;g\/kg, liver cancer at 6.0 &#181;g\/kg, and colorectal cancer at 9.0 &#181;g\/kg, with 1 patient (anal SCC) having a long-lasting SD over 40 weeks. In this heavily pretreated population, the observed preliminary clinical benefit rate was 63 %.<br \/>Conclusions: SOT101 in combination with pembrolizumab showed a favorable safety profile. Highly promising efficacy signals were reported in ICB-na&#239;ve and ICB pre-treated patients, including ICB-resistant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL03-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,SOT101,IL-15 superagonist,phase 1 solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephane Champiat<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurelien Marabelle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vladimir Galvao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia LoRusso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Grell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Cassier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Gomez-Roca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iphigenie Korakis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aung Naing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lenka Palova Jelinkova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irena Adkins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrich Moebius<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Sachse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sascha Tillmanns<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Bechard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joachim Kiemle-Kallee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Garralda<\/i><\/presenter>.

Davoceticept (ALPN-202) is a variant CD80 vIgD-Fc fusion that mediates PD-L1-dependent CD28 costimulation and inhibits the PD-L1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints. It has demonstrated superiority to CPI-only therapies <i>in vitro <\/i>and in <i>in vivo <\/i>tumor models, while demonstrating favorable preclinical safety.<br \/>Methods: This is a first-in-human, cohort-based, open-label dose escalation and expansion study of davoceticept in adults with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma (NCT04186637). Patients with cancers refractory to standard therapies (including approved CPIs), or cancers without available standard or curative therapy are eligible. After two single-subject cohorts, a standard 3+3 dose escalation has been implemented with two dose schedules in parallel, Q1W and Q3W. Objectives include evaluation of safety and tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary anticancer activity. Disease assessments are evaluated by RECIST v1.1 for solid tumors. A prior presentation discussed the initial first 5 cohorts of the Q1W schedule; this presentation includes the remainder of dose escalation, including the Q3W schedule.<br \/>Results: As of December 2021, 57 adults with various advanced solid tumors, most commonly colorectal and pancreatic, received davoceticept monotherapy, which was well tolerated through 10 mg\/kg Q3W. Davoceticept demonstrated dose-dependent PK and target saturation. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs), occurred in 20\/54 (35%), mostly involving the skin, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems. All but 2 of the irAE were grade 1-2. One DLT, chronic active gastritis grade 3, was observed at 3 mg\/kg Q3W. Among 47 evaluable, unconfirmed partial responses were observed in 2 (colorectal carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma). Stable disease, defined as first scan at 6 weeks, was observed in 22; 9 (41%) demonstrated tumor volume reduction, 2 (9%) demonstrated SD for &#62; 6 months, and 1 has an ongoing SD at 8 months. At doses above 0.1 mg\/kg, pharmacodynamic ex vivo analyses demonstrated agonistic engagement of CD28 on T cells, and flow cytometry demonstrated increased circulating activated (ICOS+) and proliferating (Ki-67+) T cells, increased central memory T cells, and reduced regulatory T cells, consistent with active CD28 engagement.<br \/>Conclusion: First-in-human dose escalation with davoceticept was well tolerated at doses capable of engaging CD28 costimulation <i>in vivo<\/i>, with early signs of activity in a largely treatment-refractory, non-immunogenic tumor population. These findings suggest a potential additive benefit of combining CD28 agonism with checkpoint inhibition and identify biologically active dose regimens of davoceticept for subsequent single agent development, and demonstrate further rationale for combination development. Expansion cohorts, including cutaneous melanoma and PD-L1-positive cancers, are planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,CD28; PD-L1; CTLA-4,Costimulation,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Michael Millward<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin C.
