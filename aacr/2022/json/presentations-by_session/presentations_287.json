Nerves and cancer associated fibroblast (CAFs) represent two key components of TME. Schwann cells (SCs), the most prevalent cell type in peripheral nerves, have been reported to support neurons and facilitate neuronal guidance during repair, but their role and mechanism in PDAC development remain largely unknown. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to be mainly responsible for desmoplasia in PDAC TME, but whether they are also involved in the regulation of SCs functions in PDAC is yet to be explored. Here, we aimed to illustrate the function and underlying mechanism of SCs in PDAC TME and verified its clinical relevance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed tissue microarray to evaluate the enrichment of SCs in tumors of different stages, as well as in adjacent normal tissues. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and microarray-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) were used to determine the interactions among SCs, tumor cells, and CAFs. We utilized co-culture and conditioned medium (CM) model to evaluate the role of SCs in reshaping TME. We employed intrasplenic injection model and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models to determine the role of SCs in tumor progression. To evaluate the differentiation of CAFs after SCs CM treatment, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), qPCR and bulk-RNA seq were performed. Mass spectrometry (MS), ELISA, and IF assays were also performed to identify the key regulators of SCs.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Significant neural hypertrophy and SCs infiltration were observed in tumor tissues and were associated with worse prognosis in PDAC patients. More cancer cells and CAFs could also be seen in proximity to SCs. scRNA-seq of PDAC samples demonstrated high degree of heterogeneity in both cancer cells and CAFs. We found a basal-like subgroup of cancer cells with more malignant behavior, and a pro-inflammatory subpopulation of CAFs (iCAFs) that promotes tumor progression. ST further showed that both basal-like cancer cells and iCAFs were located immediately adjacent to SCs in human PDAC tissues. The malignant phenotypes of cancer cells including migration, invasion, and proliferation were significantly promoted by SCs CM treatment. Furthermore, SCs CM treatment promotes iCAFs formation and PDAC progression <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Lastly, IL-1&#945; was identified as a SCs-secreted ligand that generate iCAFs.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Collectively, we find that SCs play an oncogenic role in PDAC by promoting the shift of cancer cells and CAFs toward more malignant phenotypes, and suggest that targeting SCs in TME represents a promising therapeutic strategy for PDAC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Schwann cells,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meilin Xue<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongsheng Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lijie Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rui Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Xiong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youwei Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yizhi Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minmin Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianjun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baiyong Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingxi Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

CAFs are also a major cell type in the desmoplastic stroma in PDAC and may account for half of the entire tumor tissue. Multiple subtypes of CAFs have been suggested, but the tissue origin(s) of CAF subtypes are unknown and genetic tools to robustly target them <i>in vivo<\/i> are lacking. Here we aimed to examine three potential tissue sources of CAFs: the pancreatic epithelium (through epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition), the bone marrow (through circulation), and the pancreatic tissue resident fibroblasts (TRFs) in the normal pancreas (through proliferation). We utilized a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC, where <i>Kras<\/i> and <i>p53<\/i> mutations were engineered in the pancreatic epithelium using an <i>Flp-Frt<\/i> system. To determine whether the pancreatic epithelium gives rise to CAFs, we permanently labeled the pancreatic epithelium with a GFP reporter and traced their cell descendants by GFP expression. Despite robust GFP labeling of the epithelium, GFP expression was rarely identified in CAFs, suggesting little contribution of epithelium to the CAF pool. To determine whether the bone marrow gives rise to CAFs, we transplanted donor bone marrow carrying a ubiquitously expressed GFP reporter allele to GFP-negative recipient mice. We found that only a small portion of pancreatic CAFs were tagged with GFP. Lastly, to determine whether pancreatic TRFs give rise to CAFs, we used an inducible <i>CreER-LoxP<\/i> system to allow for permanent Tomato labeling in TRFs progenitors, the splanchnic mesenchyme, during mid-gestation. Lineage tracing in PDAC showed that the vast majority of CAFs were labeled with Tomato expression, suggesting their splanchnic origin. Furthermore, certain splanchnic gene expression signatures were persistent in subsets of CAFs in both the PDAC mouse model and human patient samples. In summary, we found that bone marrow contributes to a small portion of CAFs in PDAC, and the pancreatic epithelium contributes even less. Meanwhile, pancreatic TRFs are derived from the splanchnic mesenchyme during fetal development and they expand to contribute to the vast majority of CAFs in PDAC. Moreover, the persistence of splanchnic signature defines subtypes of CAFs. This study provides approaches to robustly target CAFs <i>in vivo, <\/i>and novel insights into CAF origin and heterogeneity in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblasts,Pancreas,Microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lu Han<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongxia Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melodie Parrish<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Khushbu Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tony Trimboli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Lefler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuezhong Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Zimmermann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Mathison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raul Urrutia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Ostrowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gustavo Leone<\/i><\/presenter>.

After surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are the next lines of therapy. However, these treatments have not significantly improved clinical outcomes due in part to its unique and characteristic desmoplasia, which limits treatment efficacy. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to contribute in PDAC&#8217;s stromal reaction in part viasecretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth factors, suggesting that CAFs are pro-tumorigenic. This understanding led to several CAF ablation preclinical studies; surprisingly, these studies demonstrated tumor-suppressive potential for CAFs, highlighting the functional heterogeneity among CAFs in PDAC. This emphasizes the need for greater developmental understanding of this influential cell population. Lineage tracing via our recently established Fabp4-Cre;Rosa26<sup>mTmG<\/sup> mouse model revealed that pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), thought to be the main cellular origin of PDAC CAFs, contribute to a minor faction of CAFs yet appear to have non-redundant functions to alternatively-derived CAFs. Here we delve further into the specific functions of PSC-derived CAFs via single-cell RNA sequencing of pancreatic stellate cells in healthy and tumor pancreas with our Fabp4-Cre;Rosa26<sup>mTmG<\/sup> mouse model. To our surprise, initial scRNA-seq analysis illustrated that quiescent pancreatic stellate cells from healthy tissue appear to be more heterogeneous to PSC-derived CAFs, with quiescent pancreatic stellate cells clustering into three &#8220;super clusters&#8221; while PSC-derived CAFs clusters into one &#8220;super cluster&#8221;. Additionally, clusters specific to normal pancreas tissue revealed potential transcripts-of-interest that are anti-tumorigenic. Current efforts seek to analyze stromal evolution with respect to CAF cell of origin in pre-malignant lesions and throughout stepwise tumorigenesis to metastasis. Furthermore, we are investigating the functional significance of potentially anti-tumorigenic factors lost from the PSC compartment upon differentiation to a CAF phenotype during PDAC progression. These findings shed light on the increasingly appreciated heterogeneity of PDAC CAFs, whilst suggesting that PSC-derived CAFs may be specifically targeted as a singular cell population for therapeutic treatment. Importantly, these findings help gain a greater understanding of PDAC disease progression and development in order to better serve patient care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Pancreatic cancer,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>M.

Two defining features of PDAC are the dense stroma composing the bulk of the tumor mass and mutations in KRAS, the primary oncogene in most PDAC patients. Advances in knowledge on both fronts have led to promising avenues for therapeutics: recently described heterogeneity within the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) population residing in the stroma offers insight into the lack of success with therapies only targeting CAFs; and mutant KRAS inhibitors directed at the G12C isoform have received accelerated FDA approval for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, the nature of this CAF heterogeneity is not yet fully understood, and any effects of KRAS blockade on the stroma have not been evaluated with consideration of this heterogeneity in mind. To assess how loss of Kras affects CAF heterogeneity and plasticity, we employed a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC harboring a reversible oncogenic Kras<sup>G12V<\/sup> allele conditionally expressed from the endogenous <i>Kras<\/i> locus. This FPC compound mouse (<i>Kras<sup>Frt-LSL-G12V-Frt<\/sup>; p53<sup>LSL-R172H<\/sup>; PDX-CRE; Rosa26<sup>FlpOERT2<\/sup><\/i>) spontaneously develops pancreatic lesions and allows for irreversible excision of the mutant <i>Kras<\/i> allele upon the application of Tamoxifen.

Mutant Kras loss leads to decreased <i>Tgfb1<\/i> expression in the cancer cells, but surprisingly also to increased <i>Il1a<\/i> levels, correlating with a reduction in myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) and an expansion in inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), respectively.

Frustratingly, the phenotype could not be recreated in simple co-culture models.<br \/>In order to maintain the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization that characterizes PDAC, we developed a novel tumor explant system for short-term cultures of both murine and human PDAC. Briefly, we cultured intact 300 &#956;m slices of PDAC tissue on a modified gelatin platform system with a novel culture medium informed by the metabolic composition of PDAC tumor interstitial fluid. This system replicates some of the nutrient\/waste gradient of PDAC and enables tumors to be cultured up to one week maintaining the representation of multiple cell types. Studies in explants were complemented by work in the Kras-LSL.G12D\/+, p53-LSL.R172H\/+, Pdx1-Cre (KPC) genetically engineered model of PDAC.<br \/>Comparison of short versus long-term Smo inhibition in KPC mouse pancreatic tumors revealed a robust increase in vessel density in short-term treatment that is lost at later timepoints. Studies in murine and human PDAC explants employing different Smo inhibitors demonstrated increased endothelial tip cell formation upon two days of treatment, resulting in increased vessel density after four days. Computational analyses of human PDAC single cell RNAseq data identified candidate cellular subsets potentially involved in the signaling cascade. RNAseq of pre- and on-treatment tumor samples from KPC mice identified Wif1 as a candidate Hh pathway target gene that effected these programs. Mechanistic studies in tumor explants reveal a complex, multi-step mechanism involving several cell types that led to suppression of angiogenesis in PDAC. These studies both provide a candidate mechanism for Hh-mediated angiosuppression and also demonstrated how the tumor explant platform can elucidate complex intercellular signaling cascades in both murine and human PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hedgehog,Paracrine signaling cascades,Angiogenesis,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marie C.

A unique feature of PC is its fibrous tumor microenvironment (TME), marked by the expansion of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), highly bundled collagen I, and absence or inactivation of antitumor immune cells. As this TME is a physical and biochemical therapeutic barrier, a better understanding of how pro-tumor immunosuppression is modulated constitutes a highly sought-after goal. Herein we report that in addition to the identified ectopic expression of NetrinG1-Ligand (NGL1) in PC cells, NGL1 is detected in both immune cells and CAFs, with increased levels in CAFs associated with short PC patient overall survival. Further, in tumor-bearing mice, fibroblastic NGL1 expression correlates with PC progression while assorted immune cells express high levels of NGL1. To question the pro-PC role of stromal NGL1, we evaluated tumor progression in NGL1 knockout (KO) mice, using orthotopic PC allografts, and observed that tumors were significantly smaller. Single-cell RNA sequencing pointed to downregulation of pro-tumor transcripts in key assorted KO TME cells (e.g., T Cells). We also noted that tumor-bearing KO tissues included a TME with limited immunosuppressive cytokines, increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing low levels of tumor-promoting factors, and a limited amount of desmoplastic bundled collagen, all suggestive of a TGF&#946;-deficient milieu. In order to further dissect between the NGL1-dependent contributions of hematopoietic\/immune vs. local stroma (e.g., CAFs) cells, we generated bone marrow KO\/WT chimeras. Results suggested that loss of NGL1 in one of the two compartments fails to phenocopy the full-body loss of NGL1, and was thus insufficient to hinder PC tumorigenesis. Further, depletion of selected immune cell subsets informed on NGL1-dependent T- and myeloid-cell contributions. Functional assays showed that KO macrophages released limited pro-tumor factors while KO T cells displayed increased proliferation compared to the WTs of both cell types. Fibroblastic NGL1-dependent immuno-regulatory effects were confirmed with human immune cells collected from healthy donors. Mechanistically, while immune cells and CAFs deficient in NGL1 are both tumor-suppressive, the latter can regain pro-tumor functions in response to TGF&#946;, explaining the chimera and full-body KO results. Finally, KO effects were mirrored in WT CAFs treated with an NGL1-neutralizing molecule. Overall, our data suggest that <b>stromal NGL1 is a novel and targetable modulator of PC immunosuppression<\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Immunomodulation,Pancreatic cancer,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Débora B.

PDAC is characterized by an extensive desmoplastic stroma and the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been recognized to play crucial roles in tumor development, therapy resistance, progression and metastasis. Although different cell types of the TME have been molecularly analyzed, tumor-infiltrating neurons could not be considered so far, because their cell bodies are located in adjacent ganglia of the peripheral nervous system and thus they are not part of the tumor mass (Demir, Thiel <i>et al<\/i>, Nature Cancer 2020; Demir, Thiel <i>et al<\/i>. Cancer Cell 2020). One of the unique features of PDAC is the strong infiltration by nerve fibers which correlates directly with tumor malignancy. In recent years it has been shown that either neurotransmitters secreted by neurons, or modulators of neuronal infiltration secreted by cancer cells can influence tumor growth.<br \/>Here we use 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging (LSFM) of full tissue cleared PDAC specimen of tumors growing in genetically engineered mouse models or patient-derived xenograft models. Our data showthat these PDACs are innervated by a complex array of sensory and sympathetic neurons. To molecularly analyse neurons innervating the tumor mass, we have developed a novel approach we termed Trace&#8217;n&#8217;seq. This combines retrograde axonal tracing and FACS analysis with single cell RNA sequencing with the aim to identify, isolate and analyse hundreds of traced neurons infiltrating tumors or their respective healthy organs. Thereby, we have identified previously undescribed neuronal cell types and provide a landscape of sympathetic and sensory nerves innervating the healthy pancreas as well as PDAC. Our single cell transcriptomic analysis revealed signs of reprogramming of neuronal behaviour orchestrated by the tumor cells. These datasets combined with single cell profiling of PDAC cells and its associated stroma provide a first complete, unbiased insight into neurons infiltrating both healthy pancreas and PDAC. Based on a comprehensive interactome analysis of the interplay between tumor cells, stroma and the neurons, we have identified various candidate genes involved in tumor-nerve signalling. We are currently performing gain-and loss- of function approaches to dissect the role of individual factors. In summary, with Trace'n'seq, we have developed a novel technology pipeline to isolate tissue innervating neurons to investigate the role of neuronal infiltration in the development and progression of PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vera Thiel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Renders<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jasper Panten<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julian Mochayedi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rienk Offringa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Sprick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Trumpp<\/i><\/presenter>.
