[{"Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly infiltrative and aggressive malignancy with few treatment options; all patients develop recurrence after initial therapy. Due to the dismal outcome of these patients, identification of GBM-specific targets for therapeutic development is urgently needed. PRMT5 is a protein arginine methyltransferase that catalyzes the symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues within histones marks, resulting in chromatin restructuring, which in turn promotes oncogenic processes. PRMT5 inhibition has shown efficacy against multiple malignancies; MTAP loss has been associated with increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibitors. Here, we examined the effects of pharmacological abrogation of PRMT5 function using highly specific, brain penetrant, orally bioavailable inhibitors and assessed the role of MTAP and p53 expression on sensitivity to these agents. MATERIALS AND<br \/>METHODS: Using pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 using with the highly specific inhibitors PRT808 and PRT811, we examined their effects on apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and methylation markers in patient-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSC) with epigenetic and genetic signaling. Additional studies to identify transcriptomic (RNA-seq), and proteomic (RPPA) landscape related to PRMT5 in gliomas are ongoing.<br \/>RESULTS: PRT808 and PRT811 induced potent reduction of symmetrical dimethylation (SDMA) protein marks in all GSC tested. However, treatment of GSC214 (mutant p53), GSC262 (mutant p53), GSC811 (truncated p53), and GSC11 (wild type p53) showed that wild type and truncated p53-expressing lines (GSC811 and GSC11) were more sensitive than GSC cell lines expressing mutant p53 (GSC214 and GSC262). There was no correlation between MTAP status and sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition. In addition, PRMT5 inhibition resulted in reduced proliferation and alteration of several cell survival pathways; induction of apoptosis in GSC cell lines at late time points around 8-9 days after single dose treatment even though SDMA reduction occurred as early as 3 days.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate pharmacological PRMT5 inhibition induced SDMA reduction and late apoptosis in genetically and epigenetically heterogeneous patient-derived GSC lines and that mutant p53 lines are less sensitive to PRMT5 inhibition. Additional studies related to splicing defects upon PRMT5 inhibition are ongoing and will be presented at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2298f51f-6dc0-4293-ab8e-aacf9170cbbb\/@E03B8ZEX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,PRMT5,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16257"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tsung-Lin (Gavin) Tsai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

As the gut microbiome influences intestinal homeostasis, we investigated the effects of PAA on colorectal cancer (CRC).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Serum PAA levels and feces microbiota from 30 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls were analyzed by targeted GC-MS\/MS and metagenomic sequencing. A validation cohort of 75 CRC patients and 53 healthy controls was analyzed for PAA level in serum. CRC cell lines and CRC-patient derived organoids were cultured and treated with PAA alone and in combination with 5-fluouracil (5-FU, standard chemotherapy used for CRC), then evaluated for viability, proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell death <i>in vitro<\/i>. We interrogated the mechanistic pathways induced by PAA treatment using RNA sequencing and western blot.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>PAA levels were significantly decreased in the circulation of CRC patients compared to healthy controls in our study population and the validation cohort. Metagenomic sequencing indicated the bacteria that positively correlated with PAA levels were significantly more abundant in healthy controls; while bacteria that negatively correlated with PAA were more abundant in CRC. <i>In vitro<\/i>, PAA inhibited the viability and colony formation of CRC cell lines as well as human-derived organoids in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanistically, PAA treatment induced a P53-dependant G1 cell cycle arrest and cell death in HCT116 and RKO cell lines. Proteomic analysis also demonstrated a downregulation in PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR and ERK pathways. Investigation by RNA sequencing showed that PAA inhibits CRC by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced autophagy. When combined with 5-FU, PAA enhanced the potency of 5-FU on viability, cell death, and cell cycle arrest by inducing DNA damage.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b>The bacteria metabolite PAA increased CRC cell death by endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced autophagy and downregulation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR and ERK pathways. PAA also potentiated chemotherapeutic efficacy of 5-FU through induction of DNA damages. These findings warrant further exploration of PAA as a potential CRC biomarker and novel therapeutic agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/017d3188-c773-4e58-9a7a-b3d095f4ae0f\/@E03B8ZEX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,Microbiome,Autophagy,Signaling pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16258"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sylvain Ferrandon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Fedro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rami-James Aoun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chureeporn Chitchumroonchokchai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Clinton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew F.

Cells were treated with 9-ING-41 at dose range (0-20&#181;M). After 24 and 48 hours of 9-ING-41 cells were analyzed by western blot. After 72 hours of 9-ING-41 cell viability was assessed with Cell Titer Glo 2.0 and IC50s were analyzed by GraphPad. RNA seq was performed on cells after 12, 24, and 48 hours of 9-ING-41 treatment. Total RNA was isolated with miRNeasy Mini Kit. RNA integrity was evaluated by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer profile. rRNA was selectively depleted by employing RiboZero Globin. Next generation sequencing libraries were prepared using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kits. Read mapping was performed using STAR in BaseSpace. DESeq2 was used for normalization and differential expression analysis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed.<br \/>Results: The IC50s of 9-ING-41 in the cell lines BT183, CHLA02-ATRT, ATRT-787197, and ATRT-2187 are 145.5nM, 481.2nM, 503.1nM, and 528.3nM, respectively. In BT183 cells treated with 150nM 9-ING-41 for 48 hours, XIAP decreased significantly by 55% and cleaved caspase 3 increased significantly by 29-fold, quantified by densitometry. In addition, western blot showed a decrease in LIN28A and an increase in TP53 protein levels. RNA-seq data show an increase in the p53 signaling pathway in the ETMR BT183 cell line with z-scores of 2.53 and 3 (p=3.73x10<sup>-13<\/sup> and 2.35x10<sup>-14<\/sup>) after 12 and 24 hours of 150nM 9-ING-41, respectively.

Inhibitors of ATR, WEE1 and CHK1 are being tested for antineoplastic activity as monotherapies and in combination with chemotherapy. Although these agents impair cell cycle checkpoints, fork stabilization, origin firing and homologous recombination (HR), little is known about the apoptotic pathways that are engaged and the critical mediators activating cell death mechanisms. The present study utilizes high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cell lines and patient derived xenografts (PDXs) to identify the primary mechanism of cell death in ovarian cancer and assess changes involved in the resistance setting after treatment with these inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: A panel of HGSOC cell lines was examined for responses to ceralasertib (ATRi), prexasertib (CHK1i) or adavosertib (WEE1i) using colony forming assays, immunoblotting and assays for apoptosis. Mechanisms involved in acquired resistance and downstream changes in cell fate were evaluated by generating prexasertib-resistant HGSOC cell lines. Subsequent NGS analysis was performed in the sensitive and resistant pairs.<br \/>Results: Irrespective of the homologous recombination (HR) status, ovarian cell lines and PDXs underwent cell death during prolonged exposure at clinically achievable concentrations. Treatment of ovarian cancer cell lines with ATRi, CHK1i or WEE1i activated the replication checkpoint, consistent with previously published reports. The subsequent apoptotic response involved PMAIP1 and BCL2L11 upregulation rather than the TNFa-induced death receptor-mediated apoptosis we recently described in acute leukemia (Cancer Res. PMID: 33414171). Additionally, ovarian lines selected for CHK1i resistance failed to die in response to either ATRi or WEE1i.<br \/>Conclusions: Prexasertib, ceralasertib, and adavosertib exhibit monotherapy activity in both HR deficient and proficient HGSOC cell lines and PDX models. Unlike AML, death receptor mediated apoptosis was not observed; instead, the primary mechanism of cell killing in HGSOC lines involves activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Cross-resistance of these DNA damage repair modulators is likely multifactorial and mainly involves diminished replication stress response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f37add58-63ed-430d-ad2f-8b2394b0544d\/@E03B8ZEX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle inhibitors,Ovarian cancer,Apoptosis,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16260"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Annapoorna Venkatachalam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin L.

Current multimodal treatment has led to a 70-90% five&#8209;year overall survival rate, however, the prognosis for patients with tumor dissemination and recurrent MB remains poor. Additionally, the majority of survivors exhibit long-term neurocognitive and neuroendocrine complications because of the cytotoxic drugs and high dose radiation. Consequently, more effective and less toxic treatments are necessary in order to raise the quality of life for these young patients. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are an exciting new therapeutic opportunity for MB. TTFields are low intensity, alternating electric fields that disrupt cell division through physical interactions with key molecules during mitosis. The side effects from TTFields treatments are incredibly low, making it an ideal candidate for MB therapy. Currently TTFields were found to increase the survival of adult brain tumor patients by dysregulating the cytoskeletal network leading to mitotic arrest as well as other varied multi-modal mechanisms of action. To determine if TTFields can be an effective treatment for MB, we conducted an <i>in vitro<\/i> study treating multiple MB cell lines with TTFields. We discovered that TTFields treatment reduced cell growth in three different MB molecular subgroups (SHH, Group 3, and Group 4) with an optimal frequency of 200-300 kHz. We also observed that TTFields treatment dysregulated actin polymerization that corresponded with a reduction in cell motility and invasion. TTFields treatment also increased DNA damage (&#947;H2AX, 53BP1) that correlated with an increase in apoptotic cells. To expand on these initial findings, we conducted a combinatorial study with the small molecule inhibitor, CX-4945. CX-4945 is an inhibitor to casein kinase 2 and is currently being used in a phase I clinical trial to treat recurrent MB (NCT03904862). We discovered that CX-4945 enhanced the growth reduction of TTFields treatment. In addition, combining CX-4945 and TTFields increased the number of cells with dysregulated actin which correlated with a decrease in MB migration and invasion. Our findings demonstrate that TTFields may be a novel and less toxic method to treat MB patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2de3db00-fa81-479d-b468-13a4a3cab0b3\/@E03B8ZEX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Medulloblastoma,Migration,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16261"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan T.

FUDR-MP, the primary anticancer metabolite of 5-FU, exerts its activity via TS inhibition which results in increased dUMP, depletion of dTMP and DNA damage. 5-FU can also generate FdUTP, which is incorporated into DNA, resulting in DNA damage. 5-FU can also be metabolized to FUTP, which results in the RNA mediated dose-limiting toxicities of myelosuppression and GI tract inflammation. NUC-3373 is a phosphoramidate transformation of FUDR designed specifically to inhibit TS. It generates higher intracellular levels of FUDR-MP, lower levels of toxic metabolites and through its favorable PK profile can be administered via a short infusion. NUC-3373 is a more potent inhibitor of TS than 5-FU and we tested the hypothesis that it more effectively targets DNA than 5-FU.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>CRC cells (HCT116 &#38; SW480) were exposed to sub-IC<sub>50<\/sub> doses of NUC-3373 or 5-FU for 6 or 24h. Cells were harvested and analyzed as follows:<b> <\/b>metabolite levels and incorporation of FdUTP into DNA and FUTP into RNA (using FdUr and FUr as surrogates) by LC-MS and LC-MS\/MS. Gene expression of dUTPase was knocked down by siRNA and protein assessed by western blot. Cytotoxicity of NUC-3373 and 5-FU was determined by IC<sub>50<\/sub>, measured with sulforhodamine B.<br \/>Results: NUC&#8209;3373 generated significantly higher levels of FUDR-MP compared to 5-FU (AUC &#62;45x greater) resulting in a pronounced increase in dUMP levels (AUC &#62;162x compared to 5-FU). NUC-3373 treated cells incorporated FdUTP into DNA, while incorporation by 5-FU treated cells was below the LLOQ (0.1 nM). NUC-3373 was effective in the presence of dUTPase, but its potency increased after dUTPase knockdown demonstrating that FdUTP incorporation contributes to NUC-3373&#8217;s cytotoxicity. At equimolar doses, 42x more FUTP was incorporated into RNA in 5-FU treated cells compared to NUC-3373.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>NUC-3373 generates higher intracellular levels of the anticancer metabolite FUDR-MP and is a more potent inhibitor of TS than 5-FU resulting in markedly greater accumulation of intracellular dUMP. Additionally, in contrast to 5-FU, NUC-3373 treatment results in incorporation of FdUTP into DNA which indicates that NUC-3373 is a more efficient DNA damaging agent. Through bypassing the FUTP-generation pathway, NUC-3373 avoids the RNA damage that is known to be associated with dose-limiting toxicities such as myelosuppression and GI tract inflammation. This is consistent with the very low rates of FUTP-related toxicities observed in patients treated with NUC-3373 (NCT03428958). By exploiting a more DNA-directed approach, NUC-3373 provides a potentially more effective, safer and convenient therapeutic option than 5-FU for patients with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1bdc5ee7-31ed-4e37-9ac4-cdf3caba57da\/@F03B8ZEY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thymidylate synthase,Metabolism,5-Fluorouracil,DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16263"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer Bré<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alison L.

RBN-2397 is a first-in-class PARP7 inhibitor, inducing cancer cell autonomous and immune stimulatory effects in preclinical models through enhanced Type I IFN signaling in cancer cells. Moreover, RBN-2397 induces CD8 T cell-dependent tumor-specific immune memory in an immunocompetent mouse cancer model [1]. RBN-2397 is currently being tested in an ongoing Phase I clinical study (NCT04053673) [2]. Here we present evidence of proof of mechanism in the paired biopsies of tumors from Phase 1 patients.<br \/>Methods: Plasma CXCL10 from patients was measured by MSD while ISG expression in PBMCs was measured by NanoString. Baseline and on-treatment patient tumor biopsies were analyzed by NanoString, CD8\/GZMB IHC, and MIBI-TOF to characterize immune changes in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Results: In peripheral blood from patients treated with RBN-2397, neither plasma nor PBMC CXCL10 increased more than 2-fold over baseline. Expression of 42 ISGs was not consistently induced in a dose-dependent manner in PBMCs. However, in tumor types of interest (e.g., cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract), CXCL10 expression increased, with similar effects observed for a subset of ISGs in multiple evaluable paired biopsy samples. Confirming preclinical studies [1], increases in CD8 T cell infiltration along with induction of granzyme B expression were observed in several evaluable paired patient tumor biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Using the MIBI-TOF technology, we observed up to 50-fold increases in intratumoral activated T cells as well as monocytes and M1 macrophages, most strikingly in two NSCLC patients.<br \/>Conclusions: In patients treated with RBN-2397 pharmacodynamic effects were preferentially observed in tumor tissue relative to the periphery, including an increase in immune infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. These data provide evidence for induction of an adaptive immune response and confirm the tumor-intrinsic, immunomodulatory mechanism of action of RBN-2397 in patients.<br \/>References: 1.

However, the notorious toxicity profile limits its widespread application in cancers including cancers of the aerodigestive tract. Recent studies show that combining low-dose ActD with existing chemotherapies could potentially reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs through p53 mediated cyclotherapy (protection of normal cells while eliminating cancer cells), a recently coined concept. An understanding of ActD&#8217;s effect on p53 signaling is critical for meaningful application of ActD in cyclotherapy-based combinations. This study evaluated the antitumor efficacy and mechanism of action of ActD in aerodigestive tract cancers. We found that ActD strongly inhibited the growth of a panel of aerodigestive tract cancer cell lines and induced efficient apoptosis although the sensitivity varies among cell lines. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of ActD spanned between 0.021-2.96nM. Mechanistic studies revealed that ActD time- and dose-dependently increased the expression of total and phosphorylated p53 (ser15). Furthermore, ActD-induced apoptosis is dependent on p53 in cells expressing wild-type p53. Further studies demonstrated that ActD induced context-dependent differential expression of downstream targets p21 and PUMA without significant effects on p27. Interestingly, our study revealed that p53-p21 is the predominant pathway activated by low-dose ActD in cells with wild type p53. Therefore, our findings further rationalize the premise for future studies to explore the application of low-dose ActD as a chemoprotectant for cyclotherapy combinations in aerodigestive tract cancers.<b><i> (Supported by NIH Grant P20GM103434 to the West Virginia IDeA Network for Biomedical Research Excellence)<\/i><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/20b97c06-37ef-4761-9bc0-58838a040ddb\/@F03B8ZEY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Cell cycle mechanisms of anticancer drug action,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Apoptosis,p21,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16265"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adeoluwa A.

Traditional treatment consists of platinum-based therapy; however, the rapid development of platinum resistance contributes to lower life expectancy, warranting newer therapies to supplement the current platinum-based protocol. Repurposing market-available drugs as cancer therapeutics is a cost- and time-effective way to avail new therapies to drug-resistant patients. The anti-HIV agent nelfinavir (NFV) has shown promising toxicity against various cancers; however, its role against HGSOC is unknown. Here, we studied the effect of NFV against HGSOC cells obtained from patients along disease progression and carrying different sensitivities to platinum. NFV triggered, independently of platinum sensitivity, a dose-dependent reduction of HGSOC cell number and viability, and a parallel increase in hypo-diploid DNA content. Moreover, a dose-dependent reduction of clonogenic survival of cells escaping the acute toxicity was indicative of long-term residual damage. Western blot analysis of underlying molecular mechanisms revealed activation by NFV of the three signaling arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR): PERK, IRE1alpha and ATF6 - in a similar manner to the classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor tunicamycin. NFV-mediated modulation of the UPR was accompanied by the inhibition of global protein synthesis as analyzed through a non-radioactive method by labelling the nascent polypeptides with puromycin. NFV maintained a proapoptotic environment through the UPR, evidenced by a dose- and time-dependent enhanced expression of ATF4, CHOP, increased Bax\/Bcl2 ratio, and cleavage of executioner caspase-7. Enhanced gamma-H2AX suggested NFV-mediated induction of DNA damage, which was associated with decreased proliferation signals driven by the AKT and ERK pathways. NFV increased the level of autophagosome-associated protein LC3II in HGSOC cells of varying platinum sensitivities; however, the autophagic flux was not increased during co-treatment with NFV and the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1, suggesting a likely impairment of the lysosomes by NFV impeding autophagosome clearance. Finally, we show that NFV potentiates the short-term cell cycle arrest and long-term toxicity caused by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Overall, our <i>in vitro<\/i> study demonstrates that NFV can therapeutically target HGSOC cells of differential platinum sensitivities via several mechanisms, suggesting its prospective repurposing benefit considering its good safety profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5822e732-3724-43b7-8218-028ff8cde593\/@F03B8ZEY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Proteasome inhibitors,Ovarian cancer,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16285"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mahbuba R.

Mechanistically, VPA\/SIM treatment, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, induced e-Cadherin and impaired vimentin and ZEB-1 expression, functionally linked to the synergistic inhibition of cell migration. In line, IPA highlighted a protein network connecting HDACs and HMGCR, the targets of VPA and SIM respectively, with the two main EMT markers.

While early data are encouraging, approximately one-third of<i> KRAS<\/i>-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients develop brain metastases and this remains a significant unmet medical need. P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp)-mediated efflux is a major mechanism for the active transport of small molecules out of the CNS. MRTX849 is a P-gp inhibitor and inhibits its own efflux at plasma exposure levels achieved in humans at the 600 mg BID dose level resulting in achieving appreciable drug levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Total and free-fraction adjusted plasma concentrations of MRTX849 were 8.6 &#956;M and 43 nM; respectively, 8 hours post administration of a clinically relevant oral dose of 200 mg\/kg to mice. In addition, the CSF concentration, a measure of the free brain concentration, was 52 nM, which is above the cellular pERK1\/2 IC<sub>50<\/sub> value measured at 24 hours in cancer cell lines (~5 nM). Administration of 100 mg\/kg MRTX849 to mice also resulted in CSF exposure above the cellular IC<sub>50<\/sub> and a CSF\/plasma (free-fraction adjusted) partition coefficient (K<sub>p,uu<\/sub>) value of 0.4. To evaluate the tumor growth inhibition following oral administration of MRTX849 in an orthotopic model of lung cancer brain metastasis, immunocompromised mice were intracranially implanted with luciferase-labeled human NSCLC LU99 cells. Lower bioluminescence imaging (BLI)-based tumor flux was observed for the 100 mg\/kg BID MRTX849-treated mice compared to vehicle and an 88% reduction in bioluminescence signal compared to baseline was observed suggesting strong tumor regression and consistent with significantly longer survival in treated mice. In addition, MRTX849 treated brain tumors demonstrated 85% reduced ERK phosphorylation. Similarly, treatment with MRTX849 resulted in potent tumor regression and significant survival extension in another intracranial <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C model of NSCLC using LU65 cells. CSF levels were determined at steady-state in two patients in the MRTX849-001 Phase1\/2 clinical trial. The CSF\/plasma (free fraction adjusted) K<sub>p,uu <\/sub>value was 0.47 with patient CSF levels achieved consistent with CSF levels observed in responding mouse models (24-35 nM). These data demonstrate MRTX849 crosses the blood brain barrier in preclinical models and cancer patients. In addition, antitumor activity observed in mouse models of brain metastases provides rationale for exploring the utility of MRTX849 for the treatment of patients harboring <i>KRAS <\/i>G12C mutant lung cancer with brain metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82a84675-e00f-4f89-bce2-e6ceeb5a3873\/@F03B8ZEY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-04 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Brain metastasis,KRAS,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16287"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kazuhide Shimizu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jill Hallin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohini Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naema Nayyar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew R.

Although glioblastoma has been extensively molecularly profiled along with other cancers, this knowledge has not yet been translated into improved survival outcomes. We used a bioinformatics approach to identify potential novel therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma. Objectives: Comprehensive online datasets which have assessed up to 1376 cancer cell lines in multiple ways were interrogated to identify potential drug candidates for glioblastoma.<br \/>Methods: Datasets included were from the cancer cell line encyclopedia (mRNA expression), the Achillies project (cell viability following Crispr-Cas9 knockout) and PRISM (drug treatment). A t-test comparing cell viability of glioblastoma cell lines versus other cancers was used to identify potential drug candidates, followed by the use of multiple statistical tools to investigate potential mechanism of action and status of biomarkers.<br \/>Results: Fluvastatin and pitavastatin were amongst the drugs with the most significant effects against glioblastoma cell lines while also being FDA approved. These effects were found in both glioblastoma cells and other cancer types with a mesenchymal-like expression phenotype. The anti-cancer properties of statins have previously been attributed to the inhibition of HMG-Coa reductase. Here, we found their effects correlated with the gene knockout of UBIAD1, which participates in non-mitochondrial ubiquinone and menaquinone-4 synthesis. We tested the effects of statins on patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines with a mesenchymal (n = 2) and non-mesenchymal phenotype (n=2). Mesenchymal-like glioblastoma cells lines were found to be particularly susceptible to multiple statins.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>Statins appeared to be especially effective against glioblastoma lines and the effect could be linked to the direct or indirect inhibition of UBIAD1.

These transporters have been targets for the creation of therapeutic molecules as a means to cross the BBB. The BBB has been a major limitation for the successful development of treatments for brain tumors. To date, only a limited number of lipophilic small chemical entities, which can cross the BBB, have been approved for the treatment of GBM. These include the nitrosoureas such as carmustine (BCNU) and lomustine (CCNU) and temozolomide (TMZ). VAL-083 is a di-epoxide substituted hexitol sugar (galactitol). It has a molecular weight of 146 and is highly water soluble. VAL-083 is active against several GBM cell lines and animal models and acts as a DNA targeting agent rapidly forming cross-links at the N7 position of guanine, resulting in lethal DNA double strand breaks and cancer cell death. Its is active in GBM patients, both newly diagnosed and recurrent. Furthermore, its activity is independent of the DNA repair enzyme MGMT which limits the effectiveness of O6 guanine alkylating agents such as the nitrosoureas and TMZ.In clinical pharmacology studies, VAL-083 rapidly accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tumor tissue. Studies with radiolabeled VAL-083 have shown a half-life of ~ 20 h in CSF vs 2h for plasma post-IV infusion. Recent clinical studies in newly diagnosed GBM patients demonstrated levels of VAL-083 in CSF at least as high as in plasma two hours post infusion (ratio 1.24 &#177; 0.35). In comparison, peak TMZ concentrations in the CSF are ~30 % of that of the plasma.Due to its structural similarity with glucose, we have initiated <i>in vitro<\/i> glucose transporter studies to identify if SGLTs (sodium dependent glucose cotransporters) or GLUTs (glucose transporters) are contributing to brain penetration. Our initial studies evaluated VAL-083 as a substrate of the human SGLT1 and SGLT2 SLC (solute carrier) transporters. HEK293 cells expressing either the SGLT1 or SGLT2 transporter were exposed to VAL-083 at 3 and 15 &#181;M for 2 and 20 min. The probe substrate methyl-&#945;-D- glucopyranoside (AMG) was used as a positive control, as well as comparison against the reference inhibitors phloridzin dihydrate (100 &#181;M, 20 min) for SGLT1 and dapagliflozin (0.3 &#181;M, 10 min) for SGLT2. Surprisingly, no transporter-specific accumulation of VAL-083 by SGLT1 or SGLT2 was observed. Ongoing studies in CaCo-2 cells are investigating whether VAL-083 is transported via other glucose transporters including GLUT1. GLUT1 is expressed on erythrocytes and the endothelial cells of the BBB and may be highly relevant to the uptake of VAL-083 into brain tissue. The results of these studies will be reported at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b0f5923b-4ea2-4015-b978-dc4ce02c7ded\/@F03B8ZEY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Blood-brain barrier,VAL-083,Transporters,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16305"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John M.

Despite adequate locoregional treatment, up to 40% will develop metastatic disease. Doxorubicin represents the standard 1<sup>st<\/sup> line of treatment for patient with advanced disease. However, its activity is limited with a response rate of only 10% and a progression-free survival of less than 6-months. Identification of new therapeutic strategies is therefore an important medical need. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins, cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CBP), and the E1A-binding protein of p300 (EP300) are important players in histone acetylation. BET inhibitors have already shown pre-clinical activity in translocation-related sarcomas such as Ewing tumors. However, BET and dual BET\/P300 inhibitors could have also relevant anti-tumor activity if MYC driven tumors. We previously found that at least a subgroup of UPS is characterized by a strong expression of MYC-targets pathway (Toulmonde et al, EBIOMEDICINE, 2020)<br \/>Methods: The anti-tumor activity of three compounds which inhibits either CBP\/P300 only (CPI-637) or dual inhibitors of both BET and CBP\/P300 proteins (NEO1132 and NEO2437) was investigated in four UPS cell lines and two patient-derived xenografts (PDX) established at Institut Bergoni&#233; (Bordeaux, France). A CRISPR-KO screen was used to identify genes that mediate resistance to NEO2734.<br \/>Results: We found that the 3 compounds act mainly by inhibiting the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of MYC expression. NEO2734 was the most potent one with IC50 range between 0.2 to 1 &#181;M <i>in vitro<\/i> and an antitumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i> in the two PDX models of UPS. To investigate the mechanism of action, we performed a transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that NEO2734 induced a downregulation of G2M checkpoint and E2F targets hallmarks. We confirmed these results at the protein level showing a downregulation of several proteins involved in these pathways such as PLK1, AURKA or CCNB1. Interestingly, two of our four UPS cells lines were resistant to NEO2734 (IC50 27&#181;M and 73&#181;M). To elucidate the genetic factors involved in this resistance, we performed a CRISPR-KO screen. We identified more than 200 genes as potential candidates involved in drug resistance and decided to focus on hnRNPU which is an interactor of P300 and play a role in cell cycle regulation through the formation of the mitotic spindle with PLK1 and AURKA.<br \/>Conclusion: Dual inhibition of BET and CBP\/P300 proteins has promising antitumor activity in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Suppressing hnRNPU may enhance the activity of dual BET and P300\/CBP bromodomain inhibitor in sarcoma and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7138e504-d420-468d-94f4-f3513ef57e4f\/@F03B8ZEY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,BET inhibitors,Drug resistance,CRISPR screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16306"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephanie Verbeke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederic Bertolo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanessa Chaire<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurelien Bourdon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amina Naït Eldjoudi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie-Alix Derieppe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francis Giles<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Italiano<\/i><\/presenter>.

TNBC has a higher incidence in younger women and those of African descent. Due to the inability to target a receptor, treatment is mostly limited to anthracycline and taxane-based nonspecific chemotherapy. Within the past two years more therapies have become available for later stage TNBC, such as antibody-drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. A potential water-soluble ruthenium-based chemotherapeutic agent was developed in our lab, showing high cytotoxicity against different cancer types in a National Cancer Institute 60-cell line panel. A preliminary <i>in vivo<\/i> study of this complex showed a pronounced 56% reduction of tumor growth with a TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line xenograft mouse model, with little system toxicity and preferential accumulation of the complex in tumor tissue. These studies prompted us to further evaluate it in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HCC-1806, derived from Caucasian and African ancestry patients respectively. This investigation revealed significant anti-angiogenic, anti-invasive, and anti-migratory properties for the complex, along with subcellular accumulation in the mitochondria and an apoptotic mechanism of cell death in both cell lines. Preliminary proteomic analysis was completed to understand the molecular pathway involved, which was determined to be P53-independent. Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) showed an inhibition of protein expression, implicating the ruthenium complex as a potential inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinases\/protein kinase B (PI3K\/Akt) pathway which acts downstream of M-CSF, and is involved with enhanced cancerous proliferation. In light of these findings, we report here on <i>in vitro <\/i>studies focused on further investigating the involvement of the PI3K\/Akt molecular pathway and mechanism of action of this ruthenium complex.<br \/><b>Experimental Design:<\/b> Western blot studies directed toward key markers in the PI3K\/Akt pathway will be assessed, which include Akt, c-Raf, PI3K, PTEN, and PDK1. Furthermore, mitochondrial involvement was determined through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and changes to mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A significant increase of ROS generation was seen with exposure to the compound, along with slight MMP depolarization. Western blot analysis may further implicate an inhibition of the PI3K\/Akt pathway.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Our results show that the mechanistic action of the tested ruthenium complex has mitochondrial involvement, with inhibitory effects in the PI3K\/Akt pathway. The very significant anti-cancer properties outlined in the preclinical evaluation of this complex will be further investigated in PDX mice models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d96f354a-9fe3-4bd9-a703-900d0a5face8\/@F03B8ZEY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Reactive oxygen species,In vitro,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16307"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nazia Nayeem<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen Hubbard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Contel<\/i><\/presenter>.

About 43,600 women in the U.S. are expected to die from the disease by the end of the year. Chemo- and radio-therapies, primarily, exert anti-tumor effects through the activation of apoptosis, or programmed cell death pathways. As many current therapies have severe side effects, and\/or lose their effectiveness over time due to developed resistance, there is a need for novel agents that can improve patient outcomes including the quality and length of life. Ceramide-mimicking drugs have such potential. Ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid, is a powerful tumor suppressor molecule that is thought to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation. As part of our ongoing efforts toward the development of a potent anti-cancer drug, ceramide analog 315, (S,E)-3-hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino-N-tetradecylpropanamide, was synthesized. Ceramide analog 315 has been shown to induce apoptosis <i>in vitro.<\/i> In the present study, an attempt is made to determine the cell death pathway induced during the treatment of chemo-resistant breast cancer cells with this analog. The MCF-7TN-R cell line is a derivative of the MCF-7 cell line obtained after prolonged exposure to increasing concentrations of TNF-&#945;. These chemo-resistant cells, 24 hours after plating, were treated with a 40 &#181;M solution of ceramide analog 315. Caspase 9 and cytochrome c Elisa assays were performed according to the vendor protocols. Cytochrome c and caspase 9 are believed to activate several pro-apoptotic proteins like APAF-1, BAX, and BCL-2, supporting the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway. Caspase 9 and cytochrome c are both released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, increasing the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability. Cytochrome c is a heme protein that, when released, binds to apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF-1). APAF-1 then creates an apoptosome that acts as a platform for caspase 9 activation. Caspase 9, in turn, activates the cascade pathway and induces apoptosis. In this study, cytochrome c levels were shown to be decreased. Controls were found to have a concentration of 8.8 +\/- 0.268 ng\/mL, while treated cells had a concentration of 7.46 +\/- 0.181 ng\/mL, with a P value of less than .05. Caspase 9 levels were shown to be even more significantly decreased with controls having a concentration of 678,800 +\/- 24,462 ng\/mL, while treated cells had a concentration of 496,444 +\/- 49,542 ng\/mL, with a P value of less than 0.10.We further determined the protein level expression in these cells using microarrays, which revealed the upregulation of death receptors TNFR1, and TRAIL. Our findings help us in better understanding the mechanisms of action of ceramide-mimicking agents, and in working toward the development of strategies to improve the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82cda088-2bf6-497a-a749-5514da1770f5\/@F03B8ZEY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Caspases,Ceramide,Pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16308"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Teresa C.

Therefore, we have identified small molecules that kill ES-CSCs, and examined their efficacy alone and in combination with chemotherapy.<br \/>ES patient-derived cultures and paired ES-CSCs established from treatment-na&#239;ve tumors were investigated<sup>1<\/sup>. The effect of 1293 small molecules (5&#181;M, 48h) on ES-CSC cell number was examined using high content imaging (Operetta). The effect of the most active small molecules was examined in combination with chemotherapies used to treat ES using high content imaging and CalcuSyn (Biosoft).<br \/>ES-CSCs were more resistant to chemotherapy than paired patient derived cells (p&#60;0.05)<sup>1<\/sup>. In the drug screen, 6% (75\/1293) of small molecules were more effective at killing ES-CSCs than doxorubicin. Eight percent (6\/75) of the most effective small molecules targeted the Ras\/MAPK pathway, including inhibitors of aurora kinases (n=3) and RAS GTPases (n=3). The efficacy of aurora kinase inhibitors, CCT137690 and CD532, was confirmed in 6 ES-CSCs. Patient-derived cells were more sensitive to aurora kinase inhibitors than ES-CSCs (p&#60;0.0001). In combination with chemotherapy, CCT137690 and CD532 synergistically killed patient-derived ES cells (Table 1).<br \/>We have identified small molecules that kill patient-derived ES-CSCs and confirmed they have synergistic activity with classic chemotherapies, supporting our hypothesis that ES-CSC targeted drugs in combination with existing chemotherapies is a promising therapeutic strategy.<br \/><sup>1<\/sup> Roundhill <i>et al.<\/i> 2021.

High concentrations of NO are known to have an anti-tumor effect. It is anticipated that NO induces cancer cell cytotoxicity through DNA damage induction, leading to apoptotic cell death. To examine the cytotoxic effect of gaseous NO (gNO) on various cancer types, we exposed 6 cancer cell lines to gNO at ultra-high concentrations, of 10,000-100,000 ppm.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Four mouse cancer cell lines, colon (CT26), breast (4T1), melanoma (B16F10) and lung (LLC1), and 2 human cancer cell lines, pancreatic (Panc02.03) and ovarian (OVCAR-3), were exposed directly to gNO at 10,000 - 100,000 ppm for 10 - 600 seconds (n=3). Air and nitrogen controls were used to assess whether the effect is mediated by gas flow or lack of oxygen (n=3). Cell viability was measured 24 hours after exposure by an XTT-based cell proliferation method. Additionally, cells were examined after exposure using Annexin V and Propidium Iodide cell apoptosis assays to determine cell death mechanisms.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>gNO resulted in significant death of cancer cells in a dose and time dependent manner as revealed by XTT assay: 1. At a concentration of 100,000 ppm gNO, cell viability of CT26, 4T1, B16F10, LLC1 and Panc02.03 was reduced by ~100% after 10 seconds of exposure compared to non-treated (NT) cells (p&#60;0.001) and OVCAR-3 was reduced by 84%. 2. Exposure of cells to 25,000-50,000 ppm gNO resulted in complete eradication of CT26, 4T1, B16F10, LLC1, Panc02.03 and OVCAR-3 cell viability after 1 minute of exposure compared to NT cells (p&#60;0.001). 3. Exposure to 10,000 ppm gNO resulted in elimination of CT26, 4T1, B16F10 LLC1 and Panc02.03 after 2.5 minutes compared to NT cells (p&#60;0.001) with OVCAR-3 viability reduced by 94%. 4. Viability of cells exposed to both nitrogen and air was comparable to NT cells. Additionally, a longer exposure time to 50,000 ppm gNO resulted in an increase in late apoptosis phase for LLC1 (from ~16% for 10 seconds to ~85% for 1 minute).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>gNO treatment resulted in a dose dependent cytotoxic response on various cancer cell lines, with higher concentrations leading to near instant cell death and lower concentrations requiring a longer exposure period to elicit cell death. Together with the known ability of NO to activate and recruit the immune system, these results suggest that gNO may be a potent therapeutic agent for tumor treatment across a range of tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a3ebcfd-0d4b-4349-9647-8d86b78cda9a\/@G03B8ZEZ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nitric oxide,Cytotoxicity,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16311"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hila Confino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matan Goldshtein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shani Puyesky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shay Yarkoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amir Avniel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steve Lisi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ido Wolf<\/i><\/presenter>.

One of the very promising strategies is blocking the activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). SCD1 is the enzyme responsible for de novo fatty acid (FAs) synthesis by converting saturated fatty acids (SFAs) into monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). In our laboratory, we developed a novel, highly specific SCD1inhibitor - SSI-4. We have tested the biological activity of SSI-4 against different HCC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) mouse models. Of the twelve tested HCC cell lines, four were highly sensitive to SSI-4 (IC50 1-50 nM). Other cell lines showed moderate or no sensitivity to SSI-4. We conducted analysis of the enzymatic protein levels involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis. Protein expression levels for these enzymes don&#8217;t predict response to therapy. To determine whether lipid metabolites predict response to SSI-4 therapy, lipidomic analysis was investigated. Our studies showed thatSSI-4 sensitive cells when exposed to SSI-4 had a higher baseline level of key lipid metabolites such as phospholipids (PL), diglycerides (DAG), diglycerides (TAG), ceramides (CE), and free fatty acids (FFA),compared to insensitive cells. We are currently validating these results in our in vivo models at the tumor tissue and blood levels. Additionally, mechanistic studies are in progress to determine if SREBP1c, an AKT regulated transcription factor known to regulate each of the fatty acid synthetic enzymes plays a role in HCC fatty acid synthesis and sensitivity to SCD1 inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,SCD1,Lipid metabolism,Novel therapies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16312"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justyna Joanna Gleba<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Despite this advance in the field, it remains unclear how PARP inhibitor (PARPi) sensitive cells respond to treatment. We previously demonstrated that treatment with the PARPi olaparib induces not only cell death, but also G2\/M arrested senescence characterized by activation of the p53 signaling pathway. We hypothesize that targeting PARPi induced senescence may provide a means to enhance the efficacy of PARPi treatment. In our current work, we sought to 1) understand whether senescence induction is a generalized response to all PARPi&#8217;s and 2) characterize senescence induction to guide the development of novel treatment strategies combining a PARPi with a senolytic drug.<br \/>Methods: PARPi sensitive LNCaP and C4-2B prostate tumor cells were treated with olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, or talazoparib for 5 days to induce senescence. Both vehicle treated and quiescent cells (LNCaP and C4-2B cultured in FBS-low (0.2%) conditions) were used as controls. Cell viability, flow cytometry, and beta-galactosidase activity assays tested response to PARPi&#8217;s. Western blot was used to detect PARP activity, apoptosis, and DNA damage response. RNA-sequencing was performed to characterize senescence induced signaling alterations.<br \/>Results: We found that exposure to rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib all induce a robust G2\/M arrested senescence response in LNCaP and C4-2B cells, suggesting that senescence induction is a class effect of PARPi&#8217;s. PARPi induced senescence is characterized by activation of the p53 signaling pathway and significantly increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Furthermore, PARPi induced senescence is distinct from quiescence, suggesting that response to PARP inhibition is phenotypically different from a more general growth arrest. RNA-sequencing revealed several signaling changes associated with senescence which may provide novel treatment opportunities.<br \/>Conclusions: Senolytics are a class of drugs thought to specifically target senescent cells. Our results demonstrate that PARPi&#8217;s induce senescence. Future work will be directed at further characterizing PARPi induced senescence, leading to rationally selected senolytic drug combinations which may enhance the efficacy of PARPi therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d9bf479-14f6-4819-8a9a-041469cafcb1\/@G03B8ZEZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,PARP inhibitors,Senescence,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16313"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alan P.

We hypothesized that the pharmacological properties of MTM can be ameliorated by rational semisynthetic modifications that improve its pharmacokinetic (PK) liabilities and expand its efficacy toxicity window. Further, we reasoned that the MTM core of each analog can facilitate DNA docking while the substitutions may interact uniquely with oncogenic ETS transcriptional complexes in different cancers. Here we present the pharmacologic properties of two analogs and their unique transcriptome profiles in TC32 Ewing sarcoma and VCaP prostate cancer cells, both of which depend on the aberrant oncogenic activity of an ETS gene fusion.<br \/>Methods: MTM analogs were generated by semisynthetic conjugation to the 3-side chain of MTM. Cytotoxicity (GI<sub>50<\/sub>) was assessed using the resazurin assay following 72 hr incubation with test compounds (0.3nM-10uM). PK properties were assessed in athymic nu\/nu mice after a bolus tail-vein injection and concentrations were assessed in plasma using LC\/MS\/MS methods. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was estimated based on weight loss and blood hematology. In vivo efficacy was assessed in subcutaneous xenografts established, which were dosed SIDx5 at the respective MTD or fractions of the MTD. Transcriptomic profiles were assessed in cells exposed to their respective 72 hr GI<sub>50<\/sub> for 24 hr and in livers of mice that were dosed SIDx5.<br \/>Results: Here we demonstrate that select modifications displayed unique cytotoxicity and efficacy Ewing sarcoma (EWS-FLI1) and VCaP prostate (TMPRSS2-ERG) cancer cell lines. Analogues with bulky amino acid substitutions in the 3-side chain of MTM had significantly improved PK in mice, as compared to MTM. Select analogs displayed selective efficacy in xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma at doses ranging as low as 1\/3 of the MTD. Significantly, analogues of MTM displayed significantly different transcriptomic profiles in each cell line, which suggests that these molecules have unique properties despite sharing a core DNA-binding structure with MTM.<br \/>Conclusions: MTM analogues with bulky hydrophobic amino acid substitutions on the 3-side chain showed the greatest improvement in PK properties and efficacy. Presumably PK are affected due to increased protein binding and an increase in the pK<sub>a<\/sub>, which leads to a lower ionized fraction and decreased uptake in the liver by organic anion transporters. This increase in plasma exposure may lead to increased drug partition in the tumor, as compared to MTM, and, therefore, improved efficacy. Transcriptomic data suggest that the analogs have unique transcriptional effects and therefore unlikely to manifest the same toxicity profile as MTM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86b86a61-8432-4cc3-8363-6db9f9bf9fd0\/@G03B8ZEZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Prostate cancer,Ewing sarcoma,Transcription factor inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16314"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Markos Leggas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ambika Dudhate<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jurgen Rohr<\/i><\/presenter>.

Nearly 50% of the patients develop hepatic metastasis, and when this occurs the 1-year survival rate is 12 months. While the primary tumor can be treated with radiotherapy and surgery, current treatments for metastatic disease have shown limited clinical activity in UM patients and there is an urgent need for new effective therapies. Recent reports have shown that male patients have more metastases than female patients, and the time from the diagnosis until development of metastases was shorter, suggesting a potential role of female hormones in disease progression. The G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER) has distinct functions from those of the classic estrogen receptors ER&#945;\/&#946; and its activation with a specific agonist has tumor-suppressive roles in several cancers. Here, we demonstrate that the novel clinical GPER agonist, LNS8801 (Linnaeus Therapeutics), has potent anticancer activities in UM cells including inhibition of cell migration and cell proliferation. LNS8801 treatment induced a G2\/M cell cycle arrest due to disruption of tubulin polymerization and defective mitotic spindle formation. There was a time-dependent increase of mitotic proteins, such as phosphorylated aurora-A, aurora-B and histone-3, while c-Myc and phospho-Rb were downregulated. The drug treatment also induced significant cell death, as detected by caspase 3\/7 activation and PARP cleavage. Finally, LNS8801 inhibited tumor growth in a UM xenograft model <i>in vivo<\/i>. In conclusion, our studies suggest that GPER agonists may be a novel treatment for uveal melanoma, and clinical trials with the GPER agonist LNS8801 are warranted and currently underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f575c1bc-e774-4cef-8230-b06f4ff172ba\/@G03B8ZEZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle arrest,Tubulin,G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16315"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Grazia Ambrosini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher A.

In cancer indications such as breast and ovarian cancers, CSC have been shown to be involved in vasculogenic mimicry (VM) and to express the receptor protein sortilin (SORT1). The newly developed SORT1-targeted peptide-docetaxel conjugate (TH1902) has been reported to inhibit both the growth of xenograft tumors in mice and the formation of VM. This work now examines the efficacy of TH1902 against CSC and its potential to circumvent some of the known drug resistance phenotype associated with this population of cells. The effects of TH1902 on human triple-negative breast cancer or ovarian CSC (hTNBCSC and hOvCSC respectively) were explored using two commercial CD133-positive cell lines which are highly resistant to docetaxel and doxorubicin, and which express SORT1 along with the drug efflux pump P-gp and other CSC markers such as CD44, Oct4, Nanog and Sox2. The cellular uptake of the fluorescent Alexa488-peptide from TH1902 was inhibited by SORT1 ligands and in cells where SORT1 expression was repressed using siRNA. In contrast to docetaxel, the addition of TH1902 <i>in vitro<\/i> induced a marked increase in cell apoptosis and produced cell cycle arrest in the G2\/M phase. Interestingly, TH1902-mediated cell cycle arrest was unaffected by the presence of the P-gp inhibitors cyclosporine A or PSC-833. However, the cell cycle which was unaffected by docetaxel was arrested in the G2\/M phase in the presence of P-gp inhibitors to levels similar to those of TH1902 alone. These results suggest that TH1902 bypasses the P-gp drug efflux pump. Also, in contrast to docetaxel, exposure to TH1902 inhibited <i>in vitro<\/i> migration of the hTNBCSC in a wound-healing assay. <i>In vivo<\/i>, in both CSC models, TH1902 significantly inhibited the growth of CSC-tumor xenografts when administered weekly as intravenous bolus for three cycles at a dose equivalent to the maximal tolerated dose of docetaxel (15 mg\/kg) and TH1902-treated mice showed an increased tolerability when compared to those treated with docetaxel. A decrease of approximately 80% of hTNBCSC or hOvCSC tumor growth was observed in TH1902-treated animals while tumor volumes were diminished by about 35% in docetaxel-treated mice. Overall, these results demonstrate that TH1902 exerts superior anticancer activity than the unconjugated docetaxel in two CD133-positive CSC animal models. Furthermore, these results show that TH1902 can circumvent the chemoresistance phenotype of CSC through use of a SORT1-mediated internalization process and therefore could possibly reduce the potential recurrence of cancers associated with CSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f55db855-7c76-4f4b-ad60-7f125147052a\/@G03B8ZEZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Docetaxel,Cancer stem cells,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16316"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christian Marsolais<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cyndia Charfi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel Demeule<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Christophe Currie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Zgheib<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Larocque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Béliveau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Borhane Annabi<\/i><\/presenter>.
