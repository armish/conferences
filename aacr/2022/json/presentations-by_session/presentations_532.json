[{"Abstract":"Genetic variants in the <i>DPYD <\/i>gene that are deleterious to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme function have demonstrated clinical validity as predictive biomarkers for severe (i.e., CTCAE grade &#8805;3) and potentially lethal toxicity to fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine chemotherapies. Variants within the coding region only explain 5-10% of 5-FU-related toxicities; and GWAS approaches have been unable to identify validated predictive biomarkers to date. Our previous studies demonstrated that DPD expression was controlled by multiple epigenetic processes; considerable variation was also noted in liver <i>DPYD<\/i>\/DPD levels. Using CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa), we identified functional enhancer regions within liver tissues and cells. Epigenetic status at these regions was shown to correlate with <i>DPYD <\/i>expression in cell models and human liver tissues. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) confirmed direct promoter-enhancer interactions. A multi-omics analysis of &#62;1000 human liver specimens identified a proximal eQTL for <i>DPYD<\/i> expression within an enhancer, with a global minor allele frequency of 27%. This variant was subsequently shown to directly alter <i>DPYD<\/i> expression in knock-in cell line models. The variant disrupts transcription factor binding at the <i>DPYD<\/i> enhancer, leading to reduced enhancer-promoter interaction, reduced DPD expression, and increased cellular sensitivity to 5-FU. Collectively, our data suggest that the variant could represent a novel predictive biomarker for severe 5-FU toxicity. The evaluation of this marker in the clinical setting is currently underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0a7a7a26-fc09-485e-9bef-bb5e3d2cb075\/@z03B8ZRq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacogenomics,Epigenetics,Drug sensitivity,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17660"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ting Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alisa Ambrodji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huixing Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Bouchonville<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Etheridge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Remington Schmidt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Cardiel Nunez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoey Temesgen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federico Innocenti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Diasio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlo Largiadèr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven M.

Recent clinical data with anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) indicate that TIGIT blockade is a highly promising therapy when combined with PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade. However, unlike PD-1 receptor occupancy (RO), there is a lack of information regarding RO in peripheral blood and tumors at different dose regimens with anti-TIGIT therapies. This study aims to predict intratumoral RO for a series of anti-TIGIT antibodies with known pharmacokinetic (PK) and binding characteristics (ociperlimab [BGB-A1217], vibostolimab, domvanalimab, etigilimab, tiragolumab) utilizing a physiologically-based PK (PBPK)\/RO model.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: The PBPK\/RO model describes biodistribution of mAbs within bodily fluids, detailed transport across the endothelial barrier, two-step binding with the membrane-bound TIGIT receptor (taking into account target expression level, number of cells expressing target receptor and internalization process), linear and non-linear clearance of mAbs (via uptake by endothelium and internalization of mAb:TIGIT complexes, respectively). Physiological parameters were taken from the literature, while other parameters were identified based on available <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> data. Clinical PK data of anti-TIGIT mAbs were used for model calibration.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The model-predicted results for RO in peripheral blood demonstrated almost complete occupancy, which is supported by clinical data available for ociperlimab and domvanalimab (predicted 99.9% vs observed 100%). A similar tendency was observed for all studied cell types (CD8, CD4, regulatory T cells) despite the significant differences in TIGIT expression on different cell types. According to model predictions, the intratumoral RO was close to the values reported for blood over a range of doses close to the recommended Phase 2 dose (e.g. ociperlimab 900 mg Q3W median trough RO with 95% CI: blood 99.96% [99.89, 99.98] vs tumor 99.75% [98.88, 99.94]). The direct comparison of extended dosing regimens (e.g. ociperlimab 150\/200\/300 mg per week regimens) demonstrated a sustainable level of TIGIT blockade and comparable values of trough RO.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: The PBPK\/RO model accurately predicted the RO in peripheral blood and tumors for different anti-TIGIT mAbs by taking into account their PK and binding properties. Moreover, the model allowed a direct comparison of RO across different regimens and different anti-TIGIT mAbs. The predicted TIGIT receptor occupancy within the tumor may be useful for future dose selection or optimization in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6df6c16b-f1c3-4cd2-8ea3-ae634e738658\/@z03B8ZRq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Modeling,TIGIT,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17661"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Dmitry Shchelokov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Oleg Demin Jr<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oleg Demin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahsan Rizwan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Srikumar Sahasranaman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nageshwar Budha<\/i><\/presenter>.

During the dose-escalation phase, no dose-limiting toxicity event was observed, and the maximum administered dose(MAD) was 10 mg\/kg Q2W. The RO% of all dose groups (1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg\/kg Q2W) reached 80%~100%. Penpulimab was administered in a fixed dosing regimen (200 mg Q2W) in a phase II study (AK105-201) demonstrating efficacy and safety in R\/R cHL patients. Longer dosing intervals may offer greater flexibility and convenience to both patients and healthcare professionals. So we explored the feasibility of a longer dosing regimen (200 mg Q3W and 400 mg Q6W).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b><b><\/b>A penpulimab population PK (PPK) model was established based on PK data from a total of 332 subjects from six clinical studies. The following PK parameters were determined and used in subsequent analyses: C<sub>min,ss,<\/sub> C<sub>max,ss, <\/sub>AUC<sub>ss<\/sub>. Exposure-response (ER) evaluation was conducted using univariate logistic regression. The efficacy endpoints included complete response (CR), overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) in AK105-201 study. Safety endpoints included grade &#8805; 3 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), grade &#8805; 3 immune-related adverse events (irAE), or AE leading to suspension in all the six clinical studies. PK simulation was conducted using the PPK model among different regimens (200 mg Q3W and 400 mg Q6W vs. 200 mg Q2w regimen), and in comparison with C<sub>min,ss <\/sub>of 3 &#956;g\/mL (6 x concentration for 80% RO in vitro).<br \/><b>Result: <\/b><b><\/b>The final PPK structural model for penpulimab was a two-compartment model with first-order elimination.

Relatively flat ER relationships were observed betwedn the efficacy endpoints (CR, ORR and DCR) and PK exposure (simulated C<sub>max,ss<\/sub>, C<sub>min,ss<\/sub>, AUC<sub>ss<\/sub>) in R\/R cHL patients. No apparent correlation was observed between PK exposure and safety response in patients with different types of cancer. The PK simulation showed that the steady-state concentration-time curves for 200 mg Q2W or 3 mg\/kg Q2W administration were generally consistent. Compared to the 200 mg Q2W regimen, the mean C<sub>min,ss<\/sub> of 200 mg Q3W and 400 mg Q6W regimens were approximately 36.5% and 55.5% lower, respectively. But in both cases, the C<sub>min,ss<\/sub> of 97.5% of the population were higher than 3 &#956;g\/mL, suggesting sufficient receptor occupancy.

In the dose escalation (DE) part of NCT02022098, 200 mg\/day was the maximum tolerated dose and a trend of dose-response for efficacy in the 100-300 mg\/day dose range was observed. The phase III TrilynX study of xevinapant plus CRT in patients with LA SCCHN is currently enrolling (NCT04459715). Here we present the integrated rationale for the recommended phase III dose (RP3D) of xevinapant 200 mg\/day based on all available clinical and preclinical data and modeling and simulation (M&#38;S).<br \/>At the RP3D, ~95% of the patients are projected to have free trough concentrations<sub> <\/sub>above <i>in vitro <\/i>IC50 for cIAP1 degradation (a pharmacodynamic [PD] marker), based on a population (pop) PK M&#38;S.

Pop PK\/PD M&#38;S<br \/>suggests that maximal cIAP1 degradation is maintained in PBMCs with 100-200 mg\/day doses during the 14-day dosing period, with a trend of dose-response for the partial cIAP1 degradation at the end of the 3-week cycle.<br \/>Exposure response (E-R) analyses were conducted based on the pooled datasets of DE and randomized parts of study NCT02022098 (n=62 treated with xevinapant). Logistic regressions showed that probabilities of LRC18, overall response, complete response, and the composite safety endpoint of &#8220;mucositis and\/or dysphagia&#8221; increase with increasing exposure (p&#60;0.05).

Cumulative sun exposure plays a leading role in the pathogenesis of cSCC. In our previous studies, topical application of Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor AZD4547 was associated with a significant reduction in Ultraviolet B-induced (UVB)-induced acute skin changes such as epidermal hyperplasia and hyperproliferation. Further, chronic, topical application of AZD4547 was associated with significant inhibition in UVB-induced tumor incidence and multiplicity. Unfortunately, oral administration of FGFR inhibitors in clinical trials for solid tumors is associated with notable side effects such as hyperphosphatemia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, and liver dysfunction. Therefore, our objective was to investigate whether topical administration of AZD4547 could potentially circumvent systemic absorption, leading to a low toxicity profile. Accordingly, mice were topically administered AZD4547 (400ug\/200ul acetone) followed by exposure to UVB three times a week for two weeks. Blood was collected at the end of the study. AZD4547 was extracted using methanol extraction and concentrated using a Savant SpeedVac system. Samples were reconstituted in 25% acetone\/75% water solution and analyzed using Reverse-phase HPLC (Shimadzu) with a Zorbax Eclipse C18 3.5-&#181;m 4.6x100mm analytical column operated at ambient temperature and gradient elution using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Mobile A) and 0.1% TFA in Acetonitrile. Data from HPLC analysis demonstrated non-appreciable absorption of AZD4547 (blood levels only from 108-358nM) suggesting that the topical application of AZD4547 was not systemically absorbed and the effect of treatment was restricted to the local skin tissue. Based on the efficacy and low systemic absorption profile, AZD4547 could potentially be utilized as a topical agent to both prevent and treat UVB-induced cSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2cb55c56-d76d-41bf-ac8f-727b7abfe7a7\/@z03B8ZRq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),Skin carcinogenesis,Ultraviolet radiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18612"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rema Anisha Kandula<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Claire Babin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Latimer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Mc Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Linquest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tara Moore-Medlin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megha A.

Further, PFAS enhanced cell steatosis in liver (HepaRG and HepG2) cells which was accompanied by upregulation of steatotic, and fibrogenic markers as well as activated Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling. RNA-seq data suggested that chronic exposures of PFOA modulated the expression of fatty acid\/ lipid metabolic gene expression that is involved in the development of fatty liver disease.

This subset of GBM patients could potentially benefit from targeted FGFR inhibitor treatment, thus making it imperative to explore FGFR inhibitors as a therapeutic option. In this study, seven pan-FGFR inhibitors (infigratinib, AZD4547, debio1347, erdafitinib, LY2874455, pemigatinib, and TAS-120) were evaluated for their brain penetration ability employing cassette dosing strategy with an aim to identify the optimal candidates for brain tumor targeting. Cassette-dosing strategy was confirmed to be an acceptable approach for screening the panel of FGFR inhibitors by comparing pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from discrete- vs cassette-dosing studies. Subsequently, cassette-dosing strategy was utilized to investigate distributional kinetics of FGFR inhibitors in normal brain and brain tumor in wild-type and triple-knockout (<i>Mdr1a\/b<sup>-\/-<\/sup>Bcrp1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>) mice. The comparison of brain-to-plasma partition coefficients for total (K<sub>p,brain<\/sub>) and unbound (K<sub>p,brain<\/sub>) drug levels in wild-type and triple-knockout mice revealed the importance of major blood-brain barrier (BBB) efflux transporters in four out of seven FGFR inhibitors. The impact of BBB and efflux transporters were further evaluated in flank and orthotopic patient-derived xenograft mouse models of brain tumors. All FGFR inhibitors were shown to accumulate significantly in both flank and orthotopic brain tumors relative to normal brain. Furthermore, the levels in flank brain tumors were at least 10-fold higher as compared to the levels in orthotopic brain tumors with five FGFR inhibitors, indicating the critical role of efflux transporters and the impact of BBB disruption in the brain and brain tumor distribution. The predictive parameters of brain penetration calculated based on physico-chemical properties have been estimated and shown not to correlate with the experimentally obtained neuro-pharmacokinetic values. In summary, our study provides comprehensive evaluation of neuro-pharmacokinetic behavior of seven FGFR inhibitors and delivers rationale for selection of most optimal candidates for future investigation in brain tumor clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f9fc029b-beec-467c-8ecf-edf9b5fecbdb\/@z03B8ZRq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Pharmacokinetics,Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21140"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William Knight<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamal Shaik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tigran Margaryan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shwetal Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nader Sanai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Artak Tovmasyan<\/i><\/presenter>.

PI3K&#947; is predominantly expressed in leukocytes and plays a critical role in activation of myeloid cells at sites of inflammation and tumorigenesis, and in lymphocyte recruitment into tumor microenvironment. Previous studies reported that blockade of PI3K&#947;-mediated signaling limits tumor growth and metastasis by activating CD8+ T cell and M1-like macrophage in the tumor milieu, and thereby overcome resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. ZX-4081-101 (NCT05118841) is a phase 1 first-in-human, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose ascending study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of twice daily oral ZX-4081 in 28-day cycles in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. Part 1 dose escalation is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ZX-4081. Part 2 dose expansion will evaluate ZX-4081 activity in a cohort of up to 40 patients with advanced solid tumors to obtain additional safety, tolerability, PK and PD at the RP2D dose. ZX-4081didn&#8217;t show significant inhibitory effects on solid tumor cell lines including 4T1 and CT-26 in <i>in vitro<\/i> cell proliferation assay. In contrast, in the 4T1 syngeneic mouse model, ZX-4081 treatment at 25 mg\/kg BID, 50 mg\/kg QD, and 50 mg\/kg BID for 28 days reduced tumor growth by 34.6%, 21.2%, and 44.1% in size, respectively (p&#60; 0.0001). No body weight loss was observed in all treatment groups. The <i>in vivo<\/i> inhibitory effect of ZX-4081 on 4T1 tumor growth was attributed to its enhancement on the mouse anti-tumor immunity. In CT26 syngeneic mouse model, TGI of ZX-4081 at 5 mg\/kg BID in combination with anti-PD1 antibody was 80.6% (p value &#60;0.01) in comparison with vehicle and anti-PD1 antibody alone groups. Flow Cytometry analysis illustrated that the combination of ZX-4081 and anti-PD1 treatment increased the ratio of CD8+ T cells to regulatory T cells relative to ZX-4081 alone and anti-PD1 alone treatment groups. Combination treatment also decreased M2-like macrophages (CD206+MHCII-) proportion in macrophages, consequently increased the ratio of M1-like to M2-like macrophages in comparison to ZX-4081 alone and anti-PD1 alone treatment groups. Overall, our studies suggest that ZX-4081 inhibits tumor growth by reprogramming tumor microenvironment via impairing PI3K&#947;-AKT-mediated macrophage polarization to enhance anti-cancer immunity. Its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and safety profile, through a series of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, support the clinical development of ZX-4081. Inclusion of combination therapy is planned after obtaining the initial clinical assessment of ZX-4081 on its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae2e1b5c-a444-44c6-bdf2-1d931f887854\/@A03B8ZRr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor immunity,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20488"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaoli Qin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edgar Bautista<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying-ying Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaomin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyuan Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deming Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinfu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolin Hao<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is a very heterogeneous disease where some frequent mutations remain untargetable. Among them there are those affecting <i>STK11\/LKB1<\/i>, the third most commonly mutated gene in NSCLC adenocarcinomas. Patients harboring LKB1-mutated tumors often have a poor prognosis due to the aggressiveness of this type of cancer and the lack of specific and efficacious therapies. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated a peculiar <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> activity of ERK inhibitors (ERKi) on LKB1-mutated NSCLC preclinical models. However, due to the huge heterogeneity of this type of tumor, it is likely that ERKi alone will have limited clinical application. In this scenario, the aim of this project is to find ERKi synthetic lethal partners in order to enlarge NSCLC patient population amenable to this therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed high-throughput screenings of a FDA-approved drug library on two different cell line systems (LU99 and H358) each composed by the LKB1 wild-type (wt) parental cell line and the CRISPR-CAS9-derived LKB1 deleted clone. In both the screenings, we treated the cell lines with the FDA-approved library alone or in combination with a subtoxic concentration of the ERKi.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> According to our aim, for each screening, we analyzed the results selecting as hits those combinations preferentially active on the LKB1-deleted clones compared to their LKB1-wt cell lines. We verified that the FDA-approved compounds were subtoxic when used as single treatment in both the parental cell lines and their clones. We highlighted 28 and 42 hit combinations for LU99 and H358 isogenic systems, respectively. Some hits were common between the two screenings and the most represented FDA-approved drug&#8217;s classes of the hit combinations were PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR inhibitors, tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, MAPK inhibitors and compounds involved in anti-inflammatory pathways neuronal signaling, metabolism and DNA damage. Among the hits, we have cross-validated 4 ERKi-based combinations (a tyrosin kinase inhibitor, a MAPK inhibitor, a serine-threonine selective protein inhibitor and a farnesyl transferase inhibitor) in four different isogenic systems and we are now performing further validation on a panel of NSCLC cell lines with different LKB1-status as well as on NSCLC organoids.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> From the FDA-approved drug library screenings, different ERKi-based combinations showed promising results worthy to be deeply studied. Further analyses are ongoing to verify their efficacy on more complex models as NSCLC 3D organoids and to clarify the mechanism of action at the basis of the hit combinations. Positive results could give the chance to develop effective and specific therapies for patient with LKB1-mutated NSCLCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f66f6621-9cd5-4dba-8856-351ee7620575\/@A03B8ZRr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,High-throughput drug screening,Preclinical models,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21412"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marika Colombo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Demetrio Tripodi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriel Caso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Perin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mirko Marabese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimo Broggini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Caiola<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recent large-scale cancer pharmacogenomic studies have opened new avenues of research to develop predictive biomarkers by profiling thousands of human cancer cell lines at the molecular level and screening them with hundreds of approved drugs and experimental chemical compounds. Many studies have leveraged these data to build predictive models of response using various statistical and machine learning methods. However, a common challenge in these methods is the lack of interpretability as to how they make the predictions, hindering the clinical translation of these models. To alleviate this issue, we used the recent logic modeling approach to develop a new machine learning pipeline that explores the space of bimodally expressed genes in multiple large in vitro pharmacogenomic studies and builds multivariate, nonlinear, yet interpretable logic-based models predictive of drug response. We showcased the performance of the approach in a compendium of the three largest in vitro pharmacogenomic data sets to build robust and interpretable models for 101 drugs that span 17 drug classes with high validation rate in independent datasets. These results along with in vivo validation support a better translation of gene expression biomarkers between model systems using bimodal genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1134c6bf-87e3-48c5-9102-567d502fe926\/@A03B8ZRr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Pharmacogenetics and therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacogenomics,Machine learning,Bioinformatics,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20030"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin Haibe-Kains<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wail Ba-alawi<\/i><\/presenter>.

In addition, ATR inhibitors may offer even broader<i> <\/i>clinical utility when combined with PARPi&#8217;s, chemo, immune or radiation therapy. Flat-fixed dosing of ATR inhibitors alone or in combination has provided clinical benefit but is associated with on target, dose limiting haematological toxicity. Strategies to refine dose selection of this class of medicine may further optimize clinical benefit. The aim of our ongoing investigation is to determine if the dose selection for clinical development of the novel ATR inhibitor ART0380 (IACS-030380) may be optimized based on the degree of PD engagement in both tumor and normal tissue from patients. To do this, we have utilized in vitro and in vivo cancer models to help us understand the dynamic and temporal response to several biomarkers of ATR inhibition and DNA damage. Once established in vitro, we selected key markers, such as &#947;H2AX and pKAP1, to explore in vivo using doses predicted to be biologically effective in man and have shown that these are modulated following exposure to ART0380. To enable the serial assessment of PD engagement in both tumor and normal tissue, we have developed an assay in the phase 1 study of ART0380 (NCT04657068) to measure &#947;H2AX levels in circulating tumor cells (CTC&#8217;s) and normal cells (PBMC&#8217;s). A significant advantage of this approach is that samples are taken from the same blood draw and at several timepoints following exposure to ART0380. So far, our studies have shown that in patients, who have experienced drug exposures predicted to be biologically effective, &#947;H2AX levels in CTC&#8217;s increase by up to 20% respectively from baseline while &#947;H2AX in PBMC&#8217;s remains unaffected. This observation may highlight that target engagement has taken place for ART0380 in the tumor without an effect in normal tissue, a phenomena perhaps explained by the pharmacokinetic profile of ART0380. The clinical study is ongoing and we continue to monitor individual patient responses, toxicity, and correlate with PD engagement in tumor and normal tissue circulating biopsies. In addition, we are now expanding our analysis into a multiplexed assay where we will measure pKAP1 as well as &#947;H2AX to build a more detailed assessment of PD activity in patients. Updated data will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10a04b58-4400-496f-9c42-fa11fce4f1ae\/@A03B8ZRr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,DNA damage response,Pharmacodynamics,Circulating tumor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20031"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manish Patel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathleen N.
