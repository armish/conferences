[{"Abstract":"Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment; however, only a subset of patients benefit. Individuals with a loss-of-function single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) are at increased risk for autoimmune disease and display a lower incidence of certain cancers. Studies in PTPN22 knockout (KO) mice have established it as a negative regulator of T cell responses in autoimmune and cancer models attributed to a hyperactive T cell response. However, these studies have not defined the cell lineage-intrinsic roles of PTPNN22 in distinct immune cell compartments, and the potential role of PTPN22 in myeloid cells remains undefined. Myeloid cells in general, and dendritic cells specifically, are critical modulators of antitumor T cell responses. We have developed a novel dendritic cell (DC) PTPN22 conditional KO (cKO) mouse model that enables deletion in CD11c+ cells. Deletion of PTPN22 in DCs resulted in augmented tumor control, evidenced by a significant reduction in tumor burden at endpoint. We found that at end point total CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, but not CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells or Tregs, were increased in the tumors of CD11c<sup>+<\/sup> PTPN22 cKO mice compared to control mice. The use of the syngeneic murine melanoma cell line B16.F10 expressing the model antigen &#8220;SIY&#8221; (B16.SIY) allowed for the tracking of endogenous tumor antigen-specific T cell responses. Indeed, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells demonstrated increased expression of both activation and memory markers at day 10 in the tumor draining lymph node (tdLN) and in day 27 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Depletion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with an anti-CD8&#946; monoclonal antibody eliminated the tumor growth control in this model, suggesting a mechanism of action based on the DC-CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell axis. To test precisely for increased antigen-specific T cell priming, we utilized IFN-&#947; ELISpot analysis on the tdLN and spleen of tumor bearing mice. We found an increased frequency of IFN-&#947;-producing T cells in the presence of tumor antigen SIY, but not irrelevant control antigen SIINFKL. Spectral analysis of tumor antigen-specific T cells in the tdLN at the same timepoint showed a significant increase in the number and percentage of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> SIY<sup>+<\/sup> T cells displaying elevated activation and memory markers. Lastly, analysis of DCs in the tdLN similarly revealed an increase in the quantity and percentage of DCs attributed to an increase of CD103<sup>+<\/sup> DCs, but not CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> DCs, displaying increased activation and proliferation markers. Thus, we show that deletion of PTPN22 in DCs is sufficient to drive a tumor antigen-specific T cell response resulting in enhanced tumor control. This work highlights the potential to modulate anti-tumor immunity through the manipulation of DCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eba4e7d9-3c7e-44ea-ae36-5c73a0110a9f\/@t03B8ZGW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Tumor immunity,Dendritic cells,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13217"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Santiago Acero-Bedoya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily F.

Nat Commun 2017). To investigate whether and how NFAT2 affects treatment resistance in CLL, we generated a CRISPR\/Cas9 based NFAT2 knockout (KO) in MEC-1 CLL cells to model aggressive CLL. In immunodeficient NSG-mice, the NFAT2 KO cells showed a ten-fold higher engraftment in the bone marrow after three weeks compared to scrambled (SCR) controls. Cytotoxicity assays revealed a profoundly higher resistance of NFAT2 KO cells to NK cell killing without detectable differences at the level of recognition as revealed by analyses of NK cell activation, degranulation and IFNy release, which excluded resistance to NK cells was due to altered immunogenicity. As CLL patients are routinely treated with anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, which mediates its therapeutic efficacy in large part by inducing antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of NK cells via secretion of perforin and granzymes. When we exposed the target cells to the cytotoxic content isolated out of NK cells, MEC-1 NFAT2 KO cells showed higher resistance for membrane permeabilization compared to SCR controls. In line, perforin blockade equalized susceptibility to membrane permeabilization of both, NFAT2 KO cells and controls, confirming the involvement of NFAT2 in maintaining membrane integrity. In addition, caspase 3\/7 activation was reduced in NFAT2 KO cells upon exposure to NK cell granule content as well as upon treatment with staurosporine. This shows an important role of NFAT2 for resistance of the leukemic cells at early stages of apoptosis. The results on the role of NFAT2 in resistance to NK effector function were confirmed with primary CLL patient cells, which were grouped according to high and low NFAT2 expression followed by treatment with NK cell content. Our results demonstrate that loss of NFAT2 allows CLLs cells to evade NK cell effector function. This holds true for both, constitutive cytotoxicity and therapeutically induced ADCC and is due to lowered susceptibility of the leukemic cells to perforin mediated membrane permeabilization and intrinsic resistance to granzyme induced apoptosis. Thus, NFAT2 loss, which correlates with aggressive clinical course in patients, facilitates resistance of CLL cells to CD20 antibody-based treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/25bb56f1-eb3e-4267-a30d-c0eebe2037f9\/@u03B8ZGX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Rituximab,Resistance,Nuclear Factor of activated T cell (NFAT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13903"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samuel J.

Tumorigenesis and successful establishment of metastases depend upon tumor cell interactions with the surrounding immune microenvironment. Elevated tumor infiltration of immunosuppressive (M2) macrophages correlates with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. The tumor microenvironment remarkably orchestrates molecular mechanisms that program these macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. Also, metabolic programming is instrumental in orchestrating the polarization of macrophages to assume an M1 (tumor-eradicating) or an M2 (tumor-promoting) phenotype. Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in breast cancer cells enables them to survive, proliferate, and metastasize, thus making it a promising target for breast cancer treatment. Hh signaling also enables a crosstalk between breast cancer cells and cells in their milieu, thus contributing to M2 macrophage polarization. We used two immunocompetent orthotopic mouse models of mammary tumors to test the effect of inhibiting Hh signaling on tumor-associated macrophages, and discovered that treatment with the pharmacologic Hh inhibitor, Vismodegib, induced a significant shift in the profile of tumor-infiltrating macrophages. We <b>hypothesized <\/b>that Hh activity calibrates the metabolism in macrophages, leading to enhanced M2 phenotype and function within the tumor microenvironment. Using a mass spectrometry-enabled untargeted metabolomics approach, we identified that inhibiting Hh signaling reduces flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, resulting in reduced cellular O-GlcNAcylation in M2 macrophages. This impinges upon diminished STAT6 O-GlcNAcylation, which consequently decreases fatty acid oxidation and ultimately enacts a metabolic cascade including lipid utilization, cellular bioenergetics, and mitochondrial dynamics. As such, inhibiting Hh activity mitigates the metabolomic and bioenergetic underpinnings of the immunosuppressive program of M2 macrophages, resulting in macrophages that are functionally and phenotypically reminiscent of inflammatory, anti-tumor macrophages. In conclusion, we discovered a novel role for Hh signaling in promoting polarization of tumor-associated macrophages to the M2 type through recalibrating their metabolic circuitries, ultimately leading to diminished M2 phenotype and function within the tumor microenvironment<b>. <\/b>This is the first evidence highlighting the relevance of Hh signaling in controlling a complex metabolic network in immune cells.<b> <\/b>This knowledge will help us to better understand how to target and diminish the pro-tumorigenic functions of tumor-infiltrating macrophages.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2355ee89-df56-4ad5-a61f-11985f7a8818\/@u03B8ZGX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Tumor immunity,Metabolism,Glycosylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13905"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dominique C.

One of the major transcriptional regulators in lymphoid cells is NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells), controlling lymphocyte development and activity. However, while the role of NFAT signaling is well defined in T cells, the cytotoxic lymphocytes of adaptive immunity, surprisingly little is known regarding the relevance of this transcription factor family in NK cells as effector cells of innate immunity. Available data indicate that NFAT activity is dispensable for development of NK cells. However, several lines of evidence including reports on the effects of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and tacrolimus, which mediate their effects through inhibition of calcineurin and consecutively NFAT, implicate an involvement of the NFAT family in NK cell function. We here employed different genetic mouse models to unravel the role of NFAT1 (NFATc2) and NFAT2 (NFATc1) in NK cell reactivity.<br \/>When NK cells with knockout (KO) of NFAT1 or NFAT2 compared to NK cells of control mice (WT) were employed in <i>in vitro<\/i> analyses, lack of either NFAT was found to surprisingly result in enhanced NK cell degranulation as well as increased production of granzyme B and perforin upon stimulation of activating receptors like NK1.1 or Nkp46 or upon co-culture with different leukemia and solid tumor tumor cells. In line, cytotoxicity assays revealed increased lysis of YAC-1 and B16F10 tumor cells by both NFAT1- and NFAT2-deficient NK cells as compared to WT controls. The inhibitory effect of NFAT transcription factors on NK cell effector function could also be confirmed <i>in vivo<\/i> by employing WT and NFAT KO animals in syngeneic B16F10 melanoma and RMA-S flank tumor models, which revealed a significantly reduced tumor burden in NFAT1 and NFAT2 KO mice. Comparative analyses with single NFAT as well as NFAT1+NFAT2 double KO and WT animals further confirmed the inhibitory effect of NFAT1 and NFAT2 and pointed to additive effects of NFAT1 and NFAT2 in NK cell tumor immunosurveillance.<br \/>Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for the direct functional involvement of NFAT1 and NFAT2 in NK cell antitumor reactivity and, in contrast to T and B cells, identify NFAT as a negative regulator of NK cell function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d3060a16-f12e-4569-beae-f0b7e0139e5c\/@u03B8ZGX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,NFAT,Transgenic mouse models,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13911"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melanie Märklin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Holzmayer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kübra Kaban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin R.

Their immunogenic and tolerogenic states in cancer remain controversial. Our objective was to define the range of DC activation states <i>in vitro<\/i> and to determine their relevance <i>ex vivo <\/i>in cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> First, <i>in vitro<\/i>, we activated healthy donor cDC with 16 different stimuli and measured cDC and T cells cytokine and chemokine secretion upon co-culture (n = 130 individual experiments) to define new maturation archetypes. Second, we established the relevance of these archetypes in cancer, <i>ex vivo<\/i> in human. We performed in depth analysis of cDC infiltrating head and neck cancer (HNSCC) by flow cytometry (n = 22 patients), transcriptomic analysis (n = 6 patients), and cDC-enriched single-cell transcriptomics (ScRNAseq) (n = 10503 cells from 2 patients). Then we performed a merged analysis of cDC from <i>in house<\/i> and public ScRNAseq datasets (n = 36 tumor samples from HNSCC, Lung, and Breast cancer, and, as comparator, n = 33 blood and juxtatumor samples, n = 19 healthy donor samples, and n = 23 samples from inflammatory diseases).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> <i>In vitro<\/i>, we identified two archetypes of cDC activation: (i) PD-L1<sup>high<\/sup>ICOSL<sup>low<\/sup> cDC that produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, labeled Secretory cDC; (ii)PD-L1<sup>low<\/sup>ICOSL<sup>high<\/sup> cDC that induce a broad range of Th cytokines, labeled Helper cDC. This functional dichotomy of cDC was mutually exclusive and not receptor specific. In cancer, we identified Secretory cDC, and these cells aligned with mature LAMP3+cDC.

The cellular composition of the HCC tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) has a major impact on cancer biology as the TiME can influence tumor initiation, progress, and response to therapy. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells can represent the most abundant T cell subtype in the human liver and have been found to be impaired in both number and function in liver cancer. These innate-like T cells are assigned crucial roles in regulating immunity and inflammation in the context of infection, albeit their role in HCC remains elusive.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> High-dimensional flow cytometry was used to analyze MAIT cell phenotypic changes in murine and human liver cancer. Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy was used to quantify immune cell infiltration in primary human HCC samples. We developed and validated a comprehensive 37-plex antibody panel for immunofluorescence imaging of human fresh frozen HCC samples. We applied co-detection by indexing (CODEX) technology to simultaneously profile in situ expression of 37 proteins at sub-cellular resolution in 15 HCC patient samples using whole slide scanning. Initial image analysis was performed using HALO quantitative image analysis software. Finally, we established an image analysis pipeline to quantify the MAIT cell interaction network at the HCC invasive front.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Profiling of human and murine HCC using flow cytometry and highly multiplexed CODEX imaging revealed substantial dysregulation\/aberrant activation of MAITs in liver cancer. <i>In situ<\/i> phenotyping of 4,500,000 single cells (including 1,500,000 CD45<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells) allowed for the quantification of 20 distinct immune cell phenotype clusters, differential analysis of activation markers and spatial features of each individual cell. CODEX imaging revealed detailed composition of the MAIT cell niche in human liver cancer tissue allowing for further distinct spatial analysis including infiltration and nearest-neighbor analysis. Importantly, flow cytometry data of paired samples correlated well with image-based immune phenotyping. Beyond that, whole slide imaging revealed spatial relationships and interactions within the MAIT cell hub localized in distinct tissue regions.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Here, we demonstrate that spatially resolved, single-cell analysis of human liver cancer tissue allows for in-depth characterization of interacting immune cellular programs underlying MAIT cell dysfunction in HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad2beab2-a52f-4a31-8ae8-2083df3c61c5\/@u03B8ZGX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,CODEX,Tumor microenvironment,Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13924"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin Ruf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noemi Kedei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Bruhns<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sepideh Babaei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernd Heinrich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Varun Subramanyam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chi Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Wabitsch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Green<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kylynda C.

However, tumors often acquire resistance programs to escape NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance. Identifying targetable vulnerabilities that reinvigorate NK cell-driven antitumor immunity can enable new therapeutic strategies to improve NK cell-mediated anti-tumor activity. Previous studies from our group used a whole genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen that identified CHMP2A as a gene that mediates tumor-intrinsic resistance to NK cell cytotoxicity. CHMP2A is a member of the ESCRTIII complex and regulates secretion of tumor-derived chemokines and extracellular vehicles (EVs) that express NK cell-activating ligands MICA\/B and TRAIL, which induce NK apoptosis. Previously, we demonstrated that the deletion of CHMP2A in glioblastoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) increases allogeneic NK cell-mediated killing both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we extend these studies to explore whether CHMP2A may serve as a targetable regulator of NK cell-mediated immunity. Employing our recently characterized syngeneic, tobacco-signature murine HNSCC model, 4MOSC (PMID: 31804466), we deleted CHMP2A in both the immune-responsive 4MOSC1 and immune-insensitive 4MOSC2 cell line. In vitro NK cell cytotoxicity assays reveal that 4MOSC1-CHMP2A-KO cells were more potently killed by NK cells compared to 4MOSC1-WT cells (53% increased cytotoxicity, p&#60;0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference in NK cell-mediated killing of 4MOSC2-WT versus CHMP2A-KO cells. Following orthotopic transplantation into immunocompetent hosts, we find that 4MOSC1-KO, but not 4MOSC2-WT, tumors spontaneously regress in vivo compared to wild type tumors (4MOSC1 KO with 80% regression, p=0.0476). Moreover, we find that NK cell depletion, achieved with systemic delivery of the blocking antibody PK136, was sufficient to reverse the complete response of 4MOSC1 tumors to anti CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibition (p&#60;0.01), implying promise for combination therapeutic strategies in immunotherapy insensitive tumors. Ongoing studies are using IHC and mass cytometry (Cytof) to characterize the immune infiltrates to better define immune cell populations regulated by CHMP2A-mediated resistance of tumor cells to NK cell and possibly T-cell-mediated responses. Together, these studies demonstrate that CHMP2A provides a targetable, tumor-derived inhibitor of NK cell-driven antitumor immunity. Moreover, our preclinical model features HNSCC cell lines with variable sensitivity to CHMP2A-deletion to enable future studies to target key pathways to overcome resistance programs and mediate improved anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d0e09c7-e097-4799-884b-dab2a61883b3\/@u03B8ZGX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,CRISPR\/Cas9,CHMP2A,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13937"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiyoung Yun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Saddawi-Konefka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Goldenson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riyam Al-msari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>J Silvio Gutkind<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan S.

Invariant natural killer cells (iNKT) are innate-like T cells that are important regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses in cancer and is the largest subset of lymphocytes within liver. However, the role of iNKT cells in pancreatic tumor liver metastasis (PTLM) is still not clear. Hypothesis: activated liver iNKT cells could play a role in PTLM.<br \/>Method: We established a PTLM mouse model by hemi-spleen murine pancreatic tumor cells (CF1242) injection. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry analysis, and imaging mass cytometry analysis to landscape the immune profile of tumor microenvironment during PTLM with or without iNKT cell activator &#945;-galactosylceramide (&#945;GC) treatment.<br \/>Results: &#945;GC treatment significantly blocked PTLM development based on liver weight compared to control group(P&#60;0.001). We sequenced total 6,728 CD45<sup>+<\/sup> infiltrating immune cells in PTLM with\/without &#945;GC treatment and identified total 12 immune subpopulations that were present in both samples at different frequencies. Post &#945;GC treatment, activated iNKT cells in liver appeared robust population expansion and enriched in cytotoxic signaling pathway. Alternatively, activated iNKT cells promoted infiltrating CD4 T cells to a Th1 profile shift, and promoted infiltrating CD8 T cells toward an effector\/memory phenotype (upregulation of the CD44, T-bet, and IFN-&#947;; P&#60;0.001), and increased NK cell cytotoxic activity (P&#60;0.001). In addition, we observed that aGC treatment blocked infiltrating CD8 T cell exhaustion by downregulating the immune checkpoint TIGIT, Lag3, and PD-1 (P&#60;0.001). Analysis of tumor-infiltrating myeloid clusters revealed that macrophage skewed to M1 phenotype compared to the control group(P&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: &#945;GC treatment can expand and activate liver iNKT cells, which may directly increase tumor cell killing ability, recruit immune cells to tumor sites, and orchestrate the anti-tumor function through boost both innate and adaptive tumor immunity to inhibit PTLM. Our results indicate that iNKT cells may serve as a new immunotherapeutic target for PTLM.

Resection of hepatic metastases improves overall disease-free survival. Unfortunately, not all patients have a successful surgical outcome. Pre-operative exercise therapy (PEx) have been demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of post-operative complications. Trained immunity in myeloid cells leads to an aggravated long-term inflammatory phenotype upon a secondary stimulation, a process that results from orchestrated metabolic-epigenetic changes. We hypothesize that PEx initially reverts pro-tumorigenic inflammatory responses following surgical stress and maintains an anti-tumor immune microenvironment through modulating Kupffer cells (KCs) with anti-tumor immunity.<br \/>Methods: 8-week C57BL\/6 mice were randomly divided into PEx and sedentary (Sed) groups, mice with PEx run on a motorized treadmill at a speed of 12.5 m\/min for 60 min\/day, 5 days\/week for 4 weeks. 10<sup>5<\/sup> MC38 cells were injected directly through portal vein and surgical stress was subjected to a model of partial hepatic ischemia and reperfusion. The tumor progression was determined by bioluminescent imaging weekly. Both hepatic and tumor CD45+ cells from PEx or Sed mice 3 weeks after IR were submitted for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).<br \/>Results: 4 weeks of PEx significantly reduces metastasis in the liver along 3 weeks after IR, compared with Sed controls. For the scRNA-seq, 11 cell lineages (KCs, monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, TAMs, TANs, B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells) were identified and annotated according to the transcriptomic profile of feature genes expression. Surprisingly, discontinued 4-week-PEx still led to a significant transcriptomic shift in the KCs. 3 clusters from the entire KCs population were unique in PEx mice. In contrast, 2 Clusters were derived from Sed mice. PEx-relevant KCs are enriched in gene expression related to the anti-tumor phenotype, whereas Sed-relevant KCs are enriched in gene expression related to pro-tumor or immunosuppressive phenotype, which suggests that PEx modulates transcriptomic changes in KCs towards an anti-tumor phenotype. Furthermore, with our established ex vivo trained immunity assay, we observe a clear induction of trained immunity in PEx-KCs when co-cultured with MC38 tumor cells, with noticeably higher levels of anti-tumor cytokines interferon (IFN)-&#947; and TNF-&#945; compared to Sed-KCs.<br \/>Summary: Our study is one of the first to show that PEx alters the hepatic immune microenvironment by shifting KC to a tumoricidal phenotype. This work offers a rationale for PEx for cancer patients undergoing liver surgery thereby decreasing post-operative metastases and morbidity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Metastatic tumors,Single cell,Exercise,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14022"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hongji Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chengli Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meihong Deng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allan Tsung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hai Huang<\/i><\/presenter>.

As NK cells also possess a natural capacity to eliminate tumor cells, we set out to define the role of NK cell memory in anti-cancer immune responses using NK cell-targeted cancer immunotherapy through immunization.<br \/>Methods: <i>Rag1<\/i><sup>-\/- <\/sup>mice (n=15) were immunized with the E7<sub>49-57<\/sub> RAHNIVYTIF (R9F) peptide from Human Papillomavirus 16, using the proprietary DepoVax (DPX) vaccine formulation, (IMV, Inc., NS Canada). Age-matched <i>Rag1<\/i><sup>-\/- <\/sup>mice (n=15) treated with the DPX vehicle alone served as controls. Sixteen days after immunization, all mice were flank-injected with C3 tumor cells, which express the R9F antigen. Tumor appearance and tumor growth rates were recorded.

Additionally, the tumor growth rate in DPX-R9F immunized mice was significantly slower than in the control cohort. Perforin has a key role in mediating the observed anti-tumor responses as <i>Rag1<\/i><sup>\/<\/sup><i>Prf1<\/i><sup>\/- <\/sup>mice vaccinated with DPX-R9F had less tumor protection compared to the <i>Rag1<\/i><sup>-\/- <\/sup>mice, of which only 20% remained tumor-free.

These immunizations appear to induce memory NK cells to mount antigen-specific antitumor responses that rely on Perforin as an effector molecule. By demonstrating that memory NK cells have a role in protection against tumor development, future cancer immunotherapies could be improved by priming not only T cells but also NK cells, proposing a therapeutic approach with better patient outcomes and improving, at the same time, the safety profile of these immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b452df57-97de-4383-8850-a63b8ca56dde\/@u03B8ZGX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Innate immunity,Immune response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14039"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Medina-Luna<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gayani Gamage<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michal Scur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haggah Zein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brendon Parsons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew P.

We previously developed human CAR-M and demonstrated that adoptive cell transfer of CAR-M into xenograft models of human cancer controls tumor progression and improves overall survival<sup>1<\/sup>. Given that CAR-M are M1-polarized macrophages with the potential to remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME) and act as professional antigen presenting cells, we developed an immunocompetent animal model to evaluate the interaction of CAR-M with the endogenous immune system and to study the combinatorial approach of CAR-M with blockade of the PD1\/PDL1 T cell checkpoint axis. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were engineered to express an anti-HER2 CAR using the chimeric adenoviral vector Ad5f35. In addition to efficient gene delivery, Ad5f35 transduction promoted a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype in murine macrophages. Anti-HER2 CAR-M, but not control macrophages, phagocytosed and killed HER2-overexpressing tumor cell lines. CAR-M induced MHC-I expression on tumor cells and enhanced the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-M therapy, immunocompetent mice were engrafted with HER2+ tumors and treated with syngeneic HER2-CAR or untransduced (UTD) macrophages. CAR-M treated mice showed significant tumor control and improved survival compared to control groups. Analysis of the TME showed increased intratumoral immune infiltration - as well as an increase in T cell responsiveness to tumor-associated antigens, indicating enhanced epitope spreading. Given the impact of CAR-M on the endogenous adaptive immune system, we evaluated the combination of CAR-M with anti-PD1 in tumors resistant to anti-PD1 monotherapy and found that the combination further reprogrammed the TME, significantly enhanced tumor control, and improved overall survival compared to monotherapy with either agent. Mice that achieved complete responses (CRs) after CAR-M therapy were protected against antigen-negative relapse in a HER2-negative rechallenge model, indicating long-term anti-tumor immunity. Finally, the combination of CAR-M with anti-PD1 did not trigger sustained elevations of serum analytes associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and was well tolerated across numerous safety assessments. These results demonstrate that CAR-M reprogram the TME, induce epitope spreading, and orchestrate a systemic immune response against solid tumors. Moreover, our findings provide rationale for the combination of CAR-M with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The anti-HER2 CAR-M, CT-0508, is under evaluation in a phase I clinical trial for patients with HER2 overexpressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fa55ca32-ed47-4b34-b27a-eb8dad4c801e\/@u03B8ZGX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Macrophages,Adoptive cell therapy,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14040"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stefano Pierini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rashid Gabbasov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alison Worth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilyssa Ramos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Blumenthal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yumi Ohtani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linara Gabitova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Ball<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sascha Abramson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Condamine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Klichinsky<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recent reports have provided clinical evidence that mutations in<i> STK11<\/i>\/LKB1 and <i>KEAP1<\/i> are strongly associated with immune checkpoint blockade resistance in LUAD, particularly those harboring <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms by which loss of KEAP1 impacts anti-tumor immunity in <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant tumors remains to be determined.<br \/>Methods: <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant (K) and LKB1 (KL), and\/or KEAP1-deficient (KK and KLK) murine tumor models were profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multiplex staining, and response to anti-PD1 treatment was assessed. Clinical samples from the MD Anderson ICON study (a cohort of 148 resected tumors from early-stage lung cancer patients) and TCGA lung cohorts were used to validate pre-clinical findings.<br \/>Results: While K tumors were sensitive to anti-PD1 treatment, KEAP1-deficient isogenic tumors (KK; KLK) were refractory. KEAP1-deficient tumors were found to exhibit low immune cell infiltration and an enrichment of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and endothelial cells. scRNA-seq analysis indicated that KEAP1-deficient tumors had reduced T cell infiltration, in particular, CD8 and NK T cells, decreased B cell populations, and a marked change in M2 macrophage polarization as compared to KEAP1-proficient tumors. Multiplex analysis of CD3 and F4\/80 markers confirmed these findings. In the TCGA lung cancer cohort, CD8B expression was dramatically decreased while MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) was upregulated in KK tumors as compared to K LUAD tumors, and expression of KEAP1 inversely correlated with CD163, ARG2 and IL10, which are mainly secreted by macrophages. KEAP1-deficient pre-clinical tumor models showed a significant upregulation of MIF expression and secretion. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of MIF dramatically impaired <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth, and enhanced T cell cytotoxic effects, anti-tumor immune response and anti-PD1 treatment in KK and KLK tumor models.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings indicate that loss of KEAP1, alone or in combination with <i>STK11<\/i>\/LKB1 alterations, contributes to an immunosuppressed tumor immune microenvironment. These changes appear to be mediated at least in part through MIF upregulation, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming KEAP1-dependent resistance to immunotherapy.<b><u><\/u><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/67f5ec3c-d27d-4891-a875-ac27b643be51\/@v03B8ZGY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,KEAP1,LKB1,MIF,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14045"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ana Galan-Cobo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fuduan Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel James McGrail<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonia Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fahao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ferdinandos Skoulidis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edwin Parra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minghao Dang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saxon Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Reuben<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignacio Wistuba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linghua Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Victor Heymach<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have previously shown that tumor cell-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) carrying a novel STING agonist induce anti-tumor activity without causing substantial elevations in systemic cytokine levels, thus suggesting a therapeutic advantage of STING agonist ADCs relative to unconjugated agonists. ADCs constitute a proven therapeutic modality that is ideally suited to enable systemic administration and delivery of the conjugated drug to desired cell types within the tumor microenvironment. In addition to delivering STING agonist into the antigen-expressing tumor cells, antigen-bound ADCs deliver STING agonist to tumor-resident myeloid cells through Fc&#947; receptor (Fc&#947;R)-mediated internalization. In this study we investigated the mechanism of Fc&#947;R-mediated internalization of the tumor cell-targeted STING-agonist ADCs into myeloid cells and the nature of the subsequent STING pathway activation. We developed flow cytometry-based assays to determine the changes in Fc&#947;RI, Fc&#947;RII, and Fc&#947;RIII cell surface detection levels in the presence of ADCs specifically designed to be either proficient or deficient in Fc&#947;R-binding. Combined with functional assays based on co-culture of cancer cells and Fc&#947;RI knock out myeloid cells, we identified Fc&#947;RI as the major Fc&#947; receptor that mediates target-bound ADC internalization into myeloid cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Even though Fc&#947;RI is expressed only by a subset of CD11b+ myeloid cells, tumor cell-targeted ADCs induce greater production of interferons and other cytokines and more potent cancer cell killing than CD11b-targeted-ADCs, which deliver STING agonist into Fc&#947;RI- (non-productive) as well as Fc&#947;RI+ (productive) myeloid cells. Finally, we demonstrate that myeloid cells within dissociated primary human tumors from multiple donors express Fc&#947;RI and are capable of tumor cell killing in response to tumor cell-targeted STING agonist ADCs <i>in vitro<\/i>. In summary, our data indicate that the ADC-mediated delivery of a STING agonist specifically into Fc&#947;RI-expressing myeloid cells efficiently activates innate immune responses in the most relevant immune cell types within the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4cbbe9fb-50fd-4564-9349-9dcfecf928f4\/@v03B8ZGY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),STING,Tumor Immunity,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14046"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Naniye Malli Cetinbas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kalli C.

Previously, we reported increased infiltration of immunosuppressive CD206-positive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) with disease progression in prostate adenocarcinoma.[1] Glutamine metabolism has been implicated in immunosuppressive TAMs as well as metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)[2] and radioresistant urothelial carcinoma.[3] As such, we hypothesize that rational metabolic interventions could be a promising strategy to simultaneously target both TAMs and cancer cells, resulting in anti-tumor immunity.<br \/>Methods: We utilized a novel pro-drug (JHU083) derived from 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) which has significantly lowered toxicity to treat two urological syngeneic immunogenic mouse tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i>; B6CaP (prostate cancer) and MB49 (bladder cancer). We studied the direct effect on tumor cells, as well as the required immune compartment for drug efficacy <i>in vivo <\/i>using antibody targeted depletions or adoptively transferred TAMs. Moreover, we used RNA-sequencing and multi-parameter flow cytometry to characterize the effect of JHU083 on TAMs transcriptional programming and proteomic expression profiles <i>in vivo<\/i>. Lastly, we assessed the phagocytotic capacity of macrophages after treatment with JHU083 with flow cytometry and immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy.<br \/>Results: JHU083 treatment showed significant tumor regression in both urologic cancer models. Using <i>in vivo<\/i> depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells, or adoptively transferring previously <i>in-vivo<\/i> JHU083 treated TAMs we established a direct anti-tumor role of TAMs. These TAMs were more inflammatory as shown by the increased TNF-positivity. Strikingly, in the TME we also observed an increase of Glut1 and Hexokinase II indicating metabolic reprogramming of these TAMs towards glycolytic phenotype. Importantly, JHU083-treated TAMs showed significantly increased phagocytic activity of cancer cells, providing direct evidence of functional reprogramming.<br \/>Conclusion: We found that JHU083 has two distinct functions <i>in vivo;<\/i> first, it directly impairs cancer cells which are glutamine dependent and second, it reprograms TAMs from an immunosuppressive to an inflammatory state via antagonism of glutamine metabolism <i>in vivo<\/i>. These macrophages convert to a highly glycolytic state, have increased TNF production, and have improved phagocytic activity against tumor cells<i>. <\/i>As urologic cancers are heavily infiltrated with immunosuppressive TAMs, JHU083 is an excellent preclinical candidate for these diseases. It remains to be seen if JHU083 treatment can be effectively combined with checkpoint therapy to elicit durable anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44d19c08-eecf-4311-a5f9-737047f99587\/@v03B8ZGY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Glutamine metabolism,Tumor associated macrophages,Genitourinary cancers: prostate,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14048"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monali Praharaj<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fan Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas R.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that autophagy inhibition enhances anti-tumor immunity by tumor cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Recently, we reported that pharmacological inhibition of VPS34 (PIK3C3), a lipid kinase regulating autophagy initiation, decreases tumor growth and improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 therapy in melanoma and colorectal cancer mouse models. This effect was dependent on increasing T and NK cell infiltration as well as the expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 chemokines in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we explored the signaling mechanisms underlying the chemokine release following treatment with VPS34 inhibitor SB02024. We found that both pharmacological and RNAi-mediated inhibition of VPS34 activated a cGAS-STING-dependent type I interferon response in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, combination treatment of VPS34 inhibitor SB02024 with STING agonist ADU-S100 or cGAMP increased the mRNA expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines in human and murine RCC and melanoma cancer cell lines. Oral administration of SB02024 in combination with intratumoral injections of ADU-S100 significantly decreased tumor growth and weight and improved mice survival of B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice.<b> <\/b>Taken together, our data demonstrates that<b> <\/b>targeting of VPS34 results in a cGAS\/STING-mediated increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and synergizes with a STING agonist. We believe that systemic VPS34 inhibition using SB02024 would be of major interest in combination or as an alternative to STING agonists to improve anti-tumor immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c657293-4c24-4a0c-9d6c-de60cd49a4b7\/@v03B8ZGY\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cancer immunotherapy,Autophagy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14050"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yasmin Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Muhammad Z.

Interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) signaling pathway is one of the key regulators of the tumor microenvironment in numerous cancer settings and its possible key role in myeloid cells is suggested. Here we investigated the IFN-y signaling in myeloid cells during PDAC development, progression, and metastasis using mice with conditional ablation of IFNgR2 in myeloid cells (IFNgR2-Delta-Mye). We performed an orthotopical injection of cells derived from conditional murine pancreatic model (Pdx1Cre-Kras-P53, or &#8220;KPC&#8221; cells) into IFNgR2-LysMCre (IFNgR2-Delta-Mye) mice. Ablation of IFN-&#947; signaling in myeloid cells led to a higher tumor burden compared to controls. Subsequent RNA sequence analysis demonstrated that IFN-&#947;R2 deficiency in myeloid cells resulted in increased TGF&#946;1 gene expression as well as changes in metabolic and growth factor pathways in macrophages isolated from tumor tissue. Immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated that IFN-&#947;R2 deletion in myeloid cells led to changes in cancer cell differentiation, resulting in a loss of characteristic epithelial histological pattern and shifting it towards more aggressive phenotype, possible via TGF&#946;1 dependent mechanism. Using murine model of liver metastasis, we found that loss of IFN-&#947;R2 in myeloid cells leads to increased metastatic outgrowth of PDAC KPC cells. This effect was partially dependent on the gut microbiota, as shown by &#8220;separated and co-housed mice&#8221; experiments. Deficiency of IFN-&#947;R2 in myeloid cells resulted in increased recruitment and infiltration of monocytes in normal and tumor\/metastatic liver tissues. Our data identifies myeloid cell type specific IFN-&#947; signaling pathway as an important regulator of pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis, that can be potentially exploited as a novel immunooncology target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/90a3b448-9725-4900-8fe8-aabe4cddbe65\/@v03B8ZGY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,IFN-&#947; ,tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14053"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elena Ivleva<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalia Andreeva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergei Grivennikov<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is fourth largest cause of cancer related death and is projected to become the second deadliest cancer by 2030. PDAC patients generally present with advanced stage, metastatic disease that is mostly resistant to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy. A significant finding is that mutant Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> (Kras*) is the primary oncogenic driver of PDAC development, and therefore efforts have been devoted to target KRAS. Here, we show in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), oncogenic Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> (Kras*) increases the expression of IL33, a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule, member of IL1 cytokine family protein and localized in the PDAC cell nucleus, which upon secretion, chemoattracts the type 2 immunocytes. Type 2 immune cells&#8212;T<sub>H<\/sub>2, eosinophils and innate lymphoid cells (ILC)2, stimulate tumor growth by secreting pro-tumorigenic cytokines such as IL4, IL5 and IL13. However, the mechanisms by which type 2 immune cells traffic to the tumor microenvironment (TME) are unknown. Cancer cell-specific deletion of IL33 leads to a significant reduction in T<sub>H<\/sub>2 and ILC2 recruitment and lead to tumor regression. Further, we discovered that the release of IL33 requires interactions between cancer cells and the intratumoral mycobiome. PDA tumors harbors a ~3000-fold higher fungal load compared to normal pancreas in both mouse and humans. However, the mechanism of fungal mediated cytokine release is still unknown and represents a target for limiting IL33 release, and lessening PDAC tumor burden. Genetic deletion of IL33 alone or fungal depletion leads to a decrease in T<sub>H<\/sub>2 and ILC2 infiltration along with robust tumor regression. Moreover, repopulation of the PDAC TME with fungal species such as <i>Alternaria<\/i> and <i>Malassezia<\/i> lead to a re-infiltration of type 2 immunocytes that reinvigorates tumor growth. Notably, transplantation of tumor-derived ILC2s into mice accelerates PDAC growth. Mechanistically fungus activates dectin-1 pathway in PDAC cancer cells, mediating the release of IL33. Consistent with the murine data, IL33 expression is upregulated in approximately 20% of human PDAC, which is mainly restricted to cancer cells. Collectively, our work shows that the intratumoral mycobiome stimulates PDAC to secrete IL33, which plays a leading role in facilitating the recruitment of type 2 immunocytes that promote tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a4afddf-7155-4325-ba12-2c91151a6aeb\/@v03B8ZGY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,ILC2,IL33,Fungal microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14090"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aftab Alam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Levanduski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maulasri Bhatta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharon Senchanthisai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheila Jani Sait<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianmin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott I.

A deepening understanding of the TME has followed in the ability to see beyond current immune checkpoint strategies. It becomes clear that players like Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAM) and Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) play a significant role by downregulating anti-tumor responses. Their presence and roles in the TME open novel possibilities for modulation of the TME. To study these mechanisms, bioassays mimicking the suppressive activity of these cells on lymphocytes were developed. With regulatory functions in both innate and adaptive immune responses and different phenotypic profiles that classically are divided into M1-like and M2-like, macrophages undeniably represent important players in the TME. Where classically activated M1-like macrophages comprise immune effector cells with an inflammatory phenotype, alternatively activated M2-like macrophages display suppressive activities. Correspondingly, a variety of solid tumors are found to be enriched with these M2-like macrophages, suppressing anti-tumor immunity. The diverse roles of macrophage subtypes are still being explored and their phenotypic classification is likely more complex than the classical M1-like and M2-like. However, <i>in vitro<\/i> assays based on these 2 subtypes can be a first step to screen for the impact of test molecules on the phenotype and function of macrophages and their subsequent effect on lymphocytes. Using <i>in vitro<\/i> polarization and functional assays, the impact of test molecules on M1-like and M2-like macrophage generation and polarization can be assessed. The impact of test molecules on macrophage functionality can be further evaluated using a macrophage suppressive assay. Here the ability of test molecules to enhance the stimulating effect of M1-like macrophages or to reverse the suppressive effect of M2-like macrophages on lymphocytes can be evaluated by assessing their proliferation and cytokine production. Moreover, the potential stimulatory effect of test compounds on macrophages to perform Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of tumor cells in co-culture assays could be another strategy to review therapeutic potential. Collectively, the development of novel bioassays contributes to a better understanding of the TME and thereby illuminates the steps required to elicit anti-tumor immune responses. It further aids the functional assessment of potential of new drugs, the design of clinical trials and the discovery of relevant biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d2cb5e0-a14d-49ef-bab7-d3023f362135\/@v03B8ZGY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,In vitro,Innate immunity,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14512"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Thibaut J.

One of the mechanisms explaining the increased cancer incidence in obese patients is associated with the chronic low-grade inflammatory condition. Myeloid cells including macrophages and Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are increased in advanced adiposity. Previous studies in mouse models have shown that obesity-induced MDSC play a protective role on metabolic control; however, in the presence of malignant cells, MDSC facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. Our data show that compared to non-obese individuals, patients with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#62; 40) have a significant increase of circulating granulocytic cells displaying a gene signature resembling tumor-MDSC. Intriguingly, obesity-induced MDSC lacked the potent immunosuppressive function; and therefore, we called them obesity-induced G-MDSC-like cells (Ob-MDSC). The mechanisms underlying the regulation of MDSC phenotype in obesity and obesity-related cancer are unclear. We found that LDL, one altered obesity-related factor, and LPS differentially impact the expression of several genes including the immunosuppressive MDSC markers, arginase-1 and iNOS, when comparing mouse bone marrow-derived MDSC from high-fat fed mice with low-fat fed mice. This finding indicates that the responsiveness of MDSC may be regulated by their long-lasting exposure to the obese microenvironment. Therefore, we propose that long-term adaptation of MDSC is induced by dysfunctional metabolic factors in obesity that modulate their response to subsequent triggers, such as signals derived by the tumor microenvironment (TMA) in the context of obesity-associated cancer. Our data from obese mice with Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma and genetically altered hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism show an increased infiltration of G-MDSC associated with enhanced tissue chemokine signaling pathway, ECM remodeling\/metastasis, inflammation, and epigenetic and transcriptional regulation. Together our data suggest that chronic exposure to an obesity-related environment establishes a phenotype prone to become pro-tumor MDSC. The identification of key regulators of the gene expression driving the immunosuppressive phenotype of MDSC in obesity is critical for the discovery of therapeutical targets to reduce the risk of obesity-associated cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/746ff506-df16-43cf-bffb-94c5ef77e564\/@v03B8ZGY\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDSC,Obesity,Transcriptional regulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14515"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria D.

The kinase activity of HPK-1 provides an inhibitory signal that dampens immune responses<sup>1<\/sup>. Upon activation of T-cell and\/or B-cell receptors, activated HPK-1 phosphorylates the adaptor protein SLP76 at Ser376 in T cells or BLNK at Thr152 in B-cells to trigger proteasomal degradation of the adaptors and disrupt downstream T-cell or B-cell activating signalosome complexes. Blocking HPK-1 extends immune action and since HPK-1 expression is primarily restricted to immune cells, it is a compelling drug target for immune modulation. Anti-tumor efficacy has been demonstrated in HPK-1 kinase dead knock-in mice, HPK-1 knockout mice or using small molecule pharmacological inhibitors of HPK-1 either as monotherapy or in combination regimens<sup>2<\/sup>.<br \/>Methods: Curadev used a pharmacophore based approach to discover novel small molecule HPK-1 inhibitors. SAR studies were carried out using a screening funnel that included efficacy assessment by monitoring in vitro enzymatic and cellular activity, anti-target cross-kinase specificity by assessing cytotoxicity in fresh murine splenocytes and effector mobilization by monitoring IL2 production and human T-cell proliferation under anti-CD3\/CD28 stimulation.<br \/>Results: Curadev&#8217;s medicinal chemistry campaign yielded several highly potent HPK-1 inhibitors with sub-nanomolar to nanomolar potency in <i>in vitro<\/i> human HPK-1 enzyme assays which were active in the cellular SLP76 assay. A single dose of the lead compound CRD1600 to mice treated with an anti-CD3 antibody caused systemic enhancement of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL2 and reduced pSLP76 levels in the spleen. These pharmacodynamic effects correlated with plasma levels of CRD1600.<br \/>Conclusions: Inhibition of HPK-1 is a promising therapeutic modality that could augment the effects of existing anti-cancer treatments including immunotherapy. CRD1600 is a potent, selective HPK-1 inhibitor that has been selected from a rich portfolio of active compounds and shows in vivo activity against the target.

Tumor cells have evolved to shape an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) where the antitumor immune response is dampened in several ways. For instance, local release of cytokines such as TNF-&#945;, leads to the up-regulation of PD-L1 expression in tumor, myeloid and T cells, thereby triggering local immune suppression through the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis. Strategies aimed at downregulating the suppressor activity of myeloid cells and at reinvigorating T cell effector functions are a promising approach to drive an effective innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune response. HDAC6 is a member of the Zn-dependent histone deacetylase family of enzymes with peculiar structure and functions, that orchestrates key processes in both innate and adaptive immune cells. Inhibition of HDAC6 enzymatic activity inhibits cytokine-dependent expression of PD-L1 and upregulates the expression of surface molecules involved in T cell activation. Thus, HDAC6 inhibition represents a new approach to enhance antitumor immune response. Here we report the in vitro activity of one of our potent and selective HDAC6 inhibitors, ITF3756, on human monocytes, dendritic cells and T cells. Through the upregulation of co-stimulatory and the downregulation of inhibitory molecules, ITF3756 increased allogenic T cell proliferation induced by monocytes stimulated with TNF-&#945; in a way comparable to an anti PD-L1 antibody. Dendritic cells differentiated from peripheral blood monocytes in the presence of ITF3756 were also more efficient in stimulating allogeneic T cell proliferation. ITF3756 decreased the expression of PD-L1 both in TNF-&#945; activated monocytes and in immature DCs. The effect of ITF3756 on PD-L1 expression was dose dependent and required the continuous presence of ITF3756 for at least 12 hours to achieve the best effect, as determined by washout experiments. CD8 T cell differentiation and exhaustion phenotypes were also modulated by ITF3756. In an in vitro model mimicking the exhaustion process, ITF3756 drove the differentiation of CD8 T cells towards a central memory phenotype and reduced the expression of effector memory markers and the exhaustion markers PD-1 and LAG3. These results were corroborated by qPCR and RNAseq analyses. ITF3756-exposed CD8 T cells had also a higher expression of IFN-&#947; and Granzyme b. Taken together, these results indicate that ITF3756 can modulate the activity of both myeloid and lymphoid cells and stimulate immune recognition and function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dac9a379-8a3b-4d35-947a-dcb3cc5dbfd4\/@w03B8ZGZ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,Immune cells,Immune checkpoint,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13997"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chiara Ripamonti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Stevenazzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Vergani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Sandrone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mattia Marchini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Steinkuhler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianluca Fossati<\/i><\/presenter>.

While treatment options have improved with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), many patients do not respond to immunotherapy or develop resistance following initial response. A significant subset of patients harbor somatic mutations in both <i>Kirsten rat sarcoma virus<\/i><b> <\/b><i>(KRAS) <\/i>and<i> Liver kinase 1 [LKB1, <\/i>also known as <i>serine\/threonine kinase 11 (STK11<\/i>)] genes. LKB1 loss has been identified as a driver of primary resistance to ICI therapy. Tumors from patients that possess these mutations are characterized by an increase in the population of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs are thought to play a critical role in promoting tumor progression by blocking the tumor killing function of cytotoxic T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our studies revealed <i>all-trans<\/i> retinoic acid (ATRA), a metabolite derived from vitamin A, sensitized murine models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with <i>LKB1<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i> co-mutations to PD-1 blockade. Combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and ATRA improved local and systemic T cell proliferation and generated systemic tumor-specific immunity. We observed that ATRA augmented anti-PD-1 efficacy in additional murine NSCLC models. We demonstrated that ATRA suppresses tumor growth through the inhibition of immunosuppressive MDSCs in the TME, and preliminary data indicates that ATRA increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IFN signaling in MDSC. Our findings implicate MDSCs as a potential mediator of immunosuppression in <i>Lkb1<\/i>-deficient NSCLC and provide a rationale for utilizing ATRA in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with <i>Lkb1<\/i>-deficient NSCLC refractory to ICIs.<br \/>* B.
