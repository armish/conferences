[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Common mutations (exon 19 deletion; ex19del or L858R point mutation; L858R) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are sensitive to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including osimertinib, a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI. Although osimertinib is widely utilized as the standard of care in first-line therapy of NSCLC, resistance inevitably occurs during the treatment. Among EGFR-dependent\/on-target resistant mechanisms of osimertinib, the C797S mutation is reported to emerge as the most frequent alteration. The cysteine residue at position 797 of EGFR is covalently bound with osimertinib, and its alteration to serine causes an inability to form a covalent bond, making osimertinib resistant to NSCLC with a C797S mutation. While first-generation, reversible EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) might be effective for patients with C797S mutation, the T790M mutation is reported to emerge in almost half of patients with EGFR common mutations during treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs. Here, we report TAS3351 as a novel, next-generation EGFR-TKI designed to overcome C797S and T790M-mediated resistance in NSCLC patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The inhibitory potency of TAS3351 on cellular phospho-EGFR was analyzed by In-cell western assay. In addition, inhibition of cell viability in Ba\/F3 cells transformed by human wild type or mutated EGFR, as well as in human NSCLC cell lines whose EGFR harbors common mutations, was tested. Anti-tumor activity of TAS3351 was evaluated in NIH\/3T3-EGFR allograft models and human NSCLC xenograft models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> TAS3351 exhibited almost comparable inhibitory potency against cellular phosphorylation of EGFR harboring ex19del or L858R with or without C797S and\/or T790M while sparing wild type EGFR activity. TAS3351 also showed similar trends in the cell viability assay for Ba\/F3-EGFR cells and human NSCLC cell lines. Finally, TAS3351 demonstrated favorable anti-tumor activity in NIH\/3T3 allografts transformed by human EGFR harboring ex19del\/C797S\/T790M.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> TAS3351 is a fourth-generation EGFR-TKI overcoming T790M and C797S-mediated resistance in NSCLC with common mutations. The present results support the clinical development of TAS3351 as monotherapy in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations harboring C797S and\/or T790M EGFR-TKI resistance mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8c32ccb1-d04f-4335-978b-2815c0fe40d8\/@B03B8ZDc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,Osimertinib,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14996"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hidefumi Kasuga<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Kataoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fuyuki Yamamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Mizutani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shingo Tsuji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sakiho Tanaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shinji Mizuarai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Resistance mechanisms are diverse, and mechanisms beyond receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway mutations are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the use of osimertinib as first-line therapy is increasing the prevalence of RTK-independent resistance mechanisms, and that RTK-independent resistant tumors undergo enhanced tumor cell lineage plasticity as an escape mechanism to EGFR TKI therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We identified patients who developed osimertinib resistance (OR) after first line (1L, n=54) and second line (2L, n=42) treatments and determined the resistance mechanisms based on clinical sequencing and histopathology. We also performed single-cell RNA-seq of 24 samples from 13 patients with EGFRm NSCLC at TKI treatment-na&#239;ve (TN, n=2), residual disease (RD, n=4), and progression disease (PD, n=7) stages.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Compared to 2L OR tumors, 1L OR tumors had increased RTK-independent mechanisms of resistance (76% vs. 46%, p=0.002), including 8% with small cell transformation (n=4), 2% with squamous transformation (n=1) and 66% with unknown mechanisms (n=34). To understand inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, we analyzed transcriptomic profiles of 76,266 single cells. Lung developmental lineages were assigned to 10,250 EpCAM+ cells, including 4,735 cells classified as malignant cells by inferCNV and RTK signaling analysis. In the two EGFRm TN tumors, the malignant cells demonstrated bronchoalveolar lineage and moderate EGFR expression. In the TKI resistant cases (PD, n=7), both RTK-dependent and RTK-independent resistance were observed. The RTK-dependent tumors (EGFR T790M n=1; ERBB2 amplification n=1) demonstrated preserved bronchoalveolar lineage identity. In the RTK-independent resistant tumors (n=5), one had complete lineage switch from epithelial to small cell neuroendocrine and very low expression level of EGFR. The remaining 4 PD tumors displayed varying expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) features. One tumor had sarcomatoid histology and a high proportion of cells having positive <i>VIM<\/i> expression (84%) and 92% of cells having complete loss of <i>NAPSA<\/i> expression; 3 tumors had partial EMT demonstrated by heterogeneous proportion of cells having <i>VIM<\/i> expression (18-56%) and loss of <i>NAPSA<\/i> (26-67%). Interestingly, some of the cells with EMT and partial-EMT had moderate levels of <i>EGFR<\/i> expression, similar to the levels in the TN tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>With osimertinib use at 1L, the incidence of RTK-independent resistance has increased to become the dominant mechanism, whereas RTK-dependent resistance has decreased. Increased lineage plasticity (small cell neuroendocrine, squamous and EMT) potentially serves as an RTK-independent TKI-resistance mechanism in EGFRm NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/040e14b6-967a-4919-99dd-7e1b27cbf132\/@B03B8ZDc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Single cell,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14997"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiuning Le<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruiping Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Vokes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasir Elamin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neda Kalhor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel McGrail<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuanxin Xi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santiago Treviño III<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingzhi Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robyn Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Blumenschein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carl Gay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcelo Negrao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mehmet Altan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hai Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Limei Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Heeke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monique Nilsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqulyne Robichaux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minghao Dang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangchun Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Byers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Tsao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Sepesi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chantale Bernatchez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianjun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linghua Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Heymach<\/i><\/presenter>.

SMARCA2 (BRM) and SMARCA4 (BRG1) are the core catalytic subunits of the SWI\/SNF complexes, containing an ATPase domain and a DNA binding bromodomain. SMARCA4 protein expression is lost in some cancers due to nonsense mutations, and SMARCA4-deleted cancer cells are highly dependent on its paralog gene SMARCA2 for their survival. Therefore, targeting SMARCA2 in SMARCA4-deleted cancers using selective SMARCA2 degraders induces synthetic lethality while sparing SMARCA4 wild type (WT) normal cells. We have identified PRT3789, a potent and selective SMARCA2 targeted degrader, that selectively inhibits proliferation of SMARCA4-deleted cancer cells. Here, we describe the potential mechanism of action for PRT3789 at the molecular level and the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in SMARCA4-deleted cancer cells. To further elucidate the SMARCA2 degradation selectivity of PRT3789, we performed mass spectrometry to identify the selective SMARCA2 lysine residues ubiquitinated following treatment with PRT3789. This data, in combination with site-directed mutagenesis against these SMARCA2-specific ubiquitinated residues, has revealed important insights into the mechanism of action of PRT3789. In addition, to further understand the specific vulnerability of SMARCA2 in SMARCA4-deleted cells, we investigated whether PRT3789 affected the integrity of the residual SWI\/SNF complex. Coimmunoprecipitation of SMARCC1 revealed that PRT3789 disrupts specific SWI\/SNF complex subunits, including ACTL6A (BAF53). Functional genome-wide experiments are ongoing to evaluate the impact of this finding and the residual activity of the SWI\/SNF complex. Furthermore, treatment with PRT3789 demonstrated robust inhibition of cell proliferation of SMARCA4-deleted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and NSCLC PDX tumors ex vivo, but not SMARCA4 WT cancer cells, in a concentration-dependent manner. Lastly, PRT3789 shows favorable pharmacokinetic properties in vivo, which correlate to its pharmacodynamics effects as evidenced by reduced SMARCA2 protein and KRT80 mRNA levels in tumor tissues. In subcutaneous cell-line derived xenograft (CDX) models of NSCLC, administration of PRT3789 demonstrated significant dose-related inhibition of SMARCA4-deleted NSCLC growth at tolerated doses, but no effect on the growth of SMARCA4 WT cancers. In summary, consistent with our previous validation studies and genomic perturbation analyses, our potent and selective SMARCA2 targeted degrader PRT3789 induces strong synthetic lethality in SMARCA4-deleted cancers in vitro and in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c270195f-f956-4cca-9e6c-7d935c01912d\/@B03B8ZDc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Epigenetics,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15027"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Hulse<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anjana Agarwal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Carter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monisha Sivakumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Vidal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Moore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Grego<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neha Bhagwat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Rager<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corey Basch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klare Bersch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chaofeng Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Pitis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Combs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce Ruggeri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kris Vaddi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peggy Scherle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koichi Ito<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, the role of EZH2 in establishing a chemo-resistant state has been described in small cell lung cancer with a potential mechanism thought to involve the silencing of <i>SLFN11<\/i><sup>1<\/sup>. Preclinical studies showed that EZH2 inhibition results in re-expression of SLFN11 protein and restores sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. A study in ovarian cancer<sup>2<\/sup> emphasized the need to investigate the effect further. Here we describe<b> <\/b>the response of platinum-resistant HGSOC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors to CPI-0209, an investigational new drug that is currently being explored for its potential as a reversible second generation EZH2 inhibitor as monotherapy and in combination with carboplatin or PARP inhibition. Four luciferized PDXs (DF101, DF149, DF181, and DF216) were selected based on known platinum sensitivity and<i> BRCA<\/i> mutation status. PDX tumor ascites were harvested from mice at the IVIS signal intensity of 10<sup>11<\/sup>. Xenograft-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (xDOTS<sup>3<\/sup>) were loaded into 3D devices (AIM Biotech), treated with either CPI-0209, carboplatin, or olaparib alone, or with CPI-0209 for 7 days prior to adding carboplatin or olaparib for an additional 5-11 days. H3K27me3 was assessed by immunofluorescence. Expression of SLFN11 following treatment was assessed by western blot. Activity was measured at endpoint by dual-labeling fluorescence microscopy. EZH2-dependent target engagement via demethylation of H3K27me3 was seen in all models. While DF181 (<i>BRIP1<\/i>m) showed resistance to all treatments, DF216 (<i>BRCA<\/i>wt) showed a consistent trend in reduction in live area in the combination of carboplatin or olaparib with CPI-0209 vs single agent, and significant reduction (&#62;20%; P&#60;0.05) vs control. DF101 (<i>BRCA<\/i>m) and DF149 (<i>BRCA<\/i>wt), which showed no evidence of sensitivity to carboplatin and CPI-0209 monotherapy, showed sensitivity to olaparib which was not enhanced by the addition of CPI-0209. Further assessment of DF216 via western blot analysis showed elevated expression of SLFN11 after 7 days of EZH2i treatment. Since PDX in vivo studies are time-consuming and costly, it is impractical to use them for large drug screens. Here we show that our short-term and efficient xDOTS platform allows for rapid evaluation of multiple targeted therapies or therapeutic combinations. The results suggested that CPI-0209 directed combination therapy could enhance activity over standard chemotherapy alone in a platinum-resistant model of ovarian cancer ex vivo. Increased SLFN11 protein level supported the importance of EZH2-SLFN11 axis.

Reversal of DNA methylation by hypomethylating agents, such as the cytidine analogs decitabine or azacytidine, has demonstrated clinical benefit in hematologic malignancies. These nucleoside analogs are incorporated into replicating DNA where they inhibit DNA cytosine methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B through irreversible covalent interactions. These agents induce significant toxicity to normal blood cells thus limiting their clinical doses. We report the discovery of a series of potent first-in-class DNMT1-selective inhibitors that compete with the active-site loop of DNMT1 for penetration into hemi-methylated DNA. These compounds induce robust loss of DNA methylation, transcriptional activation, and cancer cell growth inhibition <i>in vitro<\/i> leading to superior tumor regression and survival in mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia due to improved <i>in vivo<\/i> tolerability compared with decitabine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce2ede15-3063-46a0-9846-1d42eba774ce\/@B03B8ZDc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Drug discovery,Acute myeloid leukemia,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15029"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melissa B.

However, recent studies suggest at least three family members (KDM5A, KDM5B and KDM5C) promote prostate cancer growth and progression and may serve as effective therapeutic targets for this disease. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that 2-4(4-methylphenyl)-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (PBIT), a compound that inhibits the enzymatic activity of multiple KDM5 isoforms, reduces the viability of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. The goal of this study was to further characterize the anti-tumor effects of PBIT within human prostate cancers. Two models of human castration-resistant prostate cancer were used to define the effects of PBIT: the androgen receptor (AR) positive C4-2B cells and the PC3 cells, which express little to no AR. Our group initially demonstrated via quantitative RT-PCR analysis that PC3 and C4-2B cells express varying amounts of KDM5A, KDM5B, and KDM5C, the therapeutic targets of PBIT. Presto Blue assays were next performed to determine the extent to which PBIT alters cell proliferation. Micromolar concentrations of PBIT significantly reduced prostate cancer cell proliferation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Data from Cell Death ELISAs suggest that PBIT at a concentration of 10 &#956;M did not significantly induce apoptosis within C4-2B or PC3 cells. However, PBIT does appear to induce cellular senescence within the PC3 cell line. The level of senescence associated beta-galactosidase staining was increased in PC3 cells following treatment with 10 &#956;M PBIT. Furthermore, PBIT increased protein levels of a second senescence marker, lamin B1. Together, these data suggest that the induction of senescence contributes to the anti-proliferative effect of PBIT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/164b674e-a78a-4ceb-984d-e53e12fd2fc6\/@B03B8ZDc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone methylation,Senescence,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15030"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tunde M.

A major contributor of resistance is epigenetic adaptation to kinase inhibitor therapy. We present evidence that inhibition of the epigenetic regulator lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) augments the response to inhibitors of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) in FLT3-mutant AML. We demonstrate that combined FLT3 and LSD1 inhibition results in synergistic cell death of FLT3-mutant AML cell lines and primary patient samples. High-resolution epigenetic sequencing revealed that the combination therapy synergistically suppresses pro-proliferative MYC-bound promoters and activates pro-differentiative PU.1-bound enhancers. Regulon enrichment analysis in primary AML samples nominated STAT5 (a downstream target of activated FLT3 signaling) as a putative regulator of <i>MYC<\/i> gene expression. STAT5 is highly bound to the MYC blood super-enhancer and FLT3 inhibition results in a loss of both STAT5 binding and MYC blood super-enhancer chromatin accessibility. In contrast, LSD1 inhibition suppresses MYC target genes by accumulation of repressive H3K9me1 marks. We validated these findings in 72 primary AML samples, including 19 FLT3-ITD positive AML samples. The combination improved responses in the vast majority of patient samples, and high MYC regulon activity was a predictor of response. Gene expression profiling in treated primary AML samples confirmed that dual FLT3 and LSD1 inhibition activates PU.1 target genes and suppresses MYC target genes. Finally, single cell ATAC-seq on primary AML blasts treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with combined FLT3 and LSD1 shifted cells from a MYC super-enhancer high to MYC super-enhancer low state. Collectively, these data provide preclinical rationale for the investigation of dual FLT3 and LSD1 inhibition in clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6cbf396-c369-451e-9148-33b0e84153bb\/@B03B8ZDc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Kinase inhibitors,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15035"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William M.

Here, we initially tested AZD5153 in combination with acalabrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, in a panel of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines. The ABC type DLBCL cells responded to the AZD5153 and acalabrutinib combination at lower drug concentrations compared to other DLBCL cell lines. Many of these lower concentrations were below the clinical equivalent dose for each drug. Similar results were achieved in DLBCL patient-derived xenografts, with most ABC-DLBCL tumors having more growth inhibition than the other B-cell lymphoma tumors after combination dosing at fixed concentrations. To delineate the mechanism of ABC-subtype preference for combination therapy, we performed RNA sequencing on ABC-DLBCL tumor samples treated with AZD5153, acalabrutinib, and the combination of AZD5153 and acalabrutinib. Pathway meta-analyses identified significant alterations of PAX5 signaling and interferon pathways in combination-treated tumors compared to monotherapy-treated samples. PAX5 is a key gene for B-cell activation and is associated with lymphoma pathogenesis. Protein levels of PAX5 and corresponding downstream transcription targets were also decreased by the combination of AZD5153 and acalabrutinib in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. In addition, STAT proteins related to PAX5 activation, the alternative RelB-NF&#954;B pathway, and toll-like receptors in the interferon type I pathway were also modulated at the protein level by this drug combination in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. We hypothesized the AZD5153 and acalabrutinib combination induces changes to interferon signaling that impacts PAX5 activation. This mechanism is supported by evidence of AZD5153 and acalabrutinib combination-induced downregulation of interferons alpha and beta, as well as interferon gamma and IP-10 <i>in vivo<\/i>. In summary, our results demonstrate AZD5153 enhances the efficacy of acalabrutinib, and our <i>in vitro<\/i> data suggest adding AZD5153 to acalabrutinib concentrations much lower than the clinical equivalent dose results in a similar biomarker response. We show that this drug combination attenuates interferon signaling, which supports the mechanism of AZD5153 and acalabrutinib inhibiting PAX5 signaling in ABC-DLBCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/633545ef-814d-4a1f-998a-24b64d5f7f96\/@B03B8ZDc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BET inhibitor,BTK,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15038"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Derek B.

The pan-HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat is an approved anticancer drug for patients with multiple myeloma. It has been shown that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), as compared to other breast cancer (BC) subtypes, is more sensitive to panobinostat. Despite the positive data observed in experimental models, to date this HDACi (panobinostat) has not yielded promising results in clinical trials for most solid tumors, including BC. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of panobinostat is required to design effective therapeutic strategies against TNBC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Cell growth MTS assays and LIVE\/DEAD cell viability assays were used to determine cell viability. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Western blot were performed to assess the expression, interaction and activation of proteins. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were carried out to measure the expression levels of mRNAs. Lentiviral vectors containing cDNA or specific shRNAs were used to overexpress or knockdown gene expression. Tumor xenograft models via subcutaneous inoculation of MDA-MB-231 cells into nude mice were established to test the <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity of panobinostat alone or its combination with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Elevated expression of HDAC1\/2\/3 was observed in BC and significantly associated with poor prognosis in BC patients. In general, all TNBC cells were sensitive to panobinostat-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. However, in the TNBC cells with HER3-low\/undetectable expression, treatment with panobinostat induced upregulation of HER3, and increased the levels of phosphorylated HER3 (p-HER3) and Akt (p-Akt). Specific knockdown of HER3 via shRNAs or inhibition of HER3 by our monoclonal antibody (4A7) sensitized TNBC cells to panobinostat-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Further studies revealed an enhanced interaction between HER3 and EGFR due to panobinostat-induced upregulation of HER3 . Combinations of panobinostat and the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib exhibited a synergistic effect inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis in TNBC cells. Moreover<i>,<\/i> in the tumor xenograft models established with MDA-MB-231 cells, panobinostat in combination with gefitinib significantly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> While panobinostat exhibits potent anti-proliferative\/anti-survival activity in TNBC cells, upregulating HER3 may be an adaptive response compromising the therapeutic potential of panobinostat. Simultaneous targeting of HER3 and its oncogenic dimerization partner, such as EGFR holds promise to combat the compensatory signaling-initiated by HER3. This new therapeutic strategy potentially improves the outcomes of TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/84578166-1db2-4116-9b4a-78d072e2da2e\/@C03B8ZDd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,ErbB3,Gefitinib,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15039"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hui Lyu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanbao Ruan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Congcong Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bolin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

NSD1 and NSD3 are two members of this family which share greater than 80 percent sequence similarity in the catalytic SET domain. NSD1 is found as a fusion with NUP98 in aggressive cases of pediatric leukemia, and the lysine methyltransferase (KMTase) activity of NUP98-NSD1 drives bone marrow progenitor proliferation. Similarly, high levels of enzymatically active NSD3 mRNA are correlated with reduced disease-free survival in breast cancer and catalytic NSD3 expression is sufficient to rescue tumor growth in a xenograft model of triple negative breast cancer. Selective and potent inhibitors of NSD1 and NSD3 KMTase activity are needed to further investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting this function in leukemia and\/or solid cancers. Here, we report the development of irreversible small molecule inhibitors of the NSD1 and NSD3 SET domains. We utilized a NMR-based fragment screen of the NSD1 SET domain to identify the hit BT1, which binds reversibly to the SET domain of NSD1. BT1 was extensively optimized into a series of potent irreversible ligands. Mass spectrometry and structural studies revealed that these compounds react with a cysteine near the autoinhibitory loop, providing a rational for the strong inhibition of KMTase activity we observe in biochemical assays. These inhibitors also bind to the NSD1 and NSD3 SET domains in cells and exhibit potent anti-proliferative effects against leukemia cells containing NUP98-NSD1 and breast cancer cells with high levels of NSD3 expression. In summary, we present novel irreversible inhibitors of NSD1 and NSD3 KMTase activity which represent important chemical probes that can be used to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting NSD family member catalytic activity in cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a675c75-c565-43b6-ae43-b1f922b1c9ff\/@C03B8ZDd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Epigenetics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15041"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christina Howard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergei Zari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuangjiang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huang Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>EunGi Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Se Ra Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trupta Purohit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongzhi Miao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaotian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Nikolaidis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliano Ndoj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>HyoJe Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jolanta Grembecka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomasz Cierpicki<\/i><\/presenter>.

Interestingly, BRAFV600E CRC has been identified as a subgroup highly epigenetically regulated in its tumorigenesis and maintenance. Our preliminary data demonstrated loss of BET family genes sensitizes BRAFV600E CRC cells to targeted therapies. However, the activity of BET inhibition is unknown in the context of BRAF mutation. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of BETi combined with standard treatments in BRAFV600E CRC.<br \/>Methods: CRISPR-based synthetic lethality screen was conducted using RKO, BRAFV600E CRC cell line. Library containing 355 epigenetic genes was introduced and cells were treated with either DMSO, BRAFi (vemurafenib), or BRAFi\/EGFRi (cetuximab). Clonal dropouts under control versus BRAFi or BRAFi\/EGFRi lead to identifying top candidate genes potentially synthetic lethal with standard treatments. We further compared the response to targeted therapies between individual BET family (BRD2\/3\/4) knockout and control BRAFV600E CRC cell lines by XTT or clonogenic assays. Furthermore, BRAFV600E CRC PDX models were treated with vehicle, BETi (iBET151), MEKi (binimetinib), or BETi\/MEKi doublet. The efficacy of BETi (zen3694) and BRAFi\/EGFRi triplet combination is under investigation. Also, we tested a combination of BETi\/MEKi or BETi\/BRAFi\/EGFRi in the BRAFV600E CRC model with acquired resistance to BRAFi\/EGFRi. We assessed treatment response by measuring tumors volume changes for 21 days. For BETi\/MEKi combination, RNA-seq and RPPA were performed at 7 days to understand the pharmacodynamics of the combination.<br \/>Results: Our negative selection screen confirmed loss of BRD2, one of the BET family members, sensitizes cells to both targeted treatments (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.05). BRD2 or BRD4 KO CRC cell lines have shown growth inhibition with BRAFi or BRAFi\/EGFRi treatments compared to control (<i>p<\/i> &#60;0.05). Intriguingly, the efficacy study showed selective tumor regression under the combination of BETi\/MEKi (-39% volume change<sub> <\/sub>in best responding model) while the effect of individual treatment was limited. We also identified potential adaptive resistance mechanisms to BETi treatment, associated with upregulation of key oncogenic signaling and cell cycle regulators, such as MAPK signaling, MYC, or E2F targets; which were significantly inhibited when combined with MEKi. Lastly, we found stabilized tumor growth induced by both combinations of BETi\/MEKi and BETi\/BRAFi\/EGFRi in the resistant PDX model compared to targeted treatment alone (<i>p<\/i> &#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Our data showed combination of BET inhibition improved sensitivity or overcame resistance to standard targeted therapy in BRAFV600E CRC. Overall, our data suggest that combining BETi with MAPK inhibition could be a novel therapeutic solution for BRAFV600E CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2119f773-b72a-4755-9ad9-e514a32e9b28\/@C03B8ZDd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,BET bromodomain,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15042"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hey Min Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefania Napolitano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexy Sorokin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie N.

And KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in NSCLC. However, KRAS mutation is not a significantly associated with survival benefit of ICBs. Mutations in LKB1 (aka STK11) and frequently co-occurring KRAS mutations are accompanied with poor survival in metastatic NSCLC immuno-oncology trials. Even tumor mutational burden is a proposed-potential biomarker for response to ICBs, there are therapeutic unmet needs in NSCLC patient with KRAS\/LKB1 (KL) mutation. Epigenetic regulation lead to enhanced anti-tumor immunity of innate immune responses via inducing type I interferons. Also it drives to enhance adaptive immune responses by targeting T cell recognition factors as well as recruitment immune cells to tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Thus, we demonstrated the pharmacological inhibition of Enhancer of zeste homolog (EZH)1\/2 enhance the efficacy of clinically available immunotherapies in KRAS\/LKB1 mutated NSCLC. Previously, we reported that a novel EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor, HM97662, has showed potently decreased global H3K27me3 and strong anti-proliferative activities against various hematological cancer cell lines with EZH2 activating mutations as well as solid tumor cell lines with negatively mutated components of regulatory protein complexes. In this study, we evaluated that HM97662 could induce of STING expression and STING-dependent cytokine production in KL mutant NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, we explored anticancer effect by inducing immune modulation by EZH2 inhibitors in combination with an anti-PD-(L)1 agent was evaluated. As a result, HM97662 potently restored STING expression in KL mutated cell lines such as A549 and H460, but did not KRAS\/p53 (KP) mutated H358 cells. HM97662 also dose-dependently increased the mRNA expression of CXCL10, IFN-&#945; and IFN-&#946; and secretion of CXCL10, IFN-&#945;, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 at nanomolar concentrations in H460 cells. In accordance with this, HM97662 showed potent growth inhibition against H460 cells under co-culture condition with activated T cells. Moreover, HM97662 had superior anti-proliferation efficacy among the tested compounds in H460 cells with activated T cells, when it combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody avelumab. In our exploratory study, HM97662 increments the sensitivity of immune checkpoint inhibitor by restoration of STING expression and STING pathway related chemo\/cytokine production in KRAS\/LKB1 mutated NSCLC cell lines. These results demonstrate that HM97662 drives anti-cancer effect by immune modulation in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 agent, suggesting therapeutic potency to combination with ICBs by turning non-inflamed to inflamed TME. Clinical trials to prove the effectiveness of HM97662 identified in preclinical studies need to be carried out immediately.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e74b4721-9423-415f-a5a9-aef69c522cc2\/@C03B8ZDd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor,KRAS\/LKB1,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15043"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jooyun Byun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>DongJin Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miyoung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soonho Kweon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Hyun Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Yon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunjin Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junghwa Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Gil Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Hoon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kwee Hyun Suh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the genetic inactivation of the tumor suppressor <i>SMARCA4 <\/i>is frequently found in cancer, there are no therapies that effectively target SMARCA4-deficient tumors. In our previous work, we reported that unlike the cells with activated MYC oncogene, cells with SMARCA4 inactivation are refractory to the histone deacetylase inhibitor, SAHA, leading to the aberrant accumulation of H3K27me3. In this context,<i> SMARCA4<\/i> deficient cells showed an impaired transactivation and significantly reduced levels of the histone H3K27me3 specific demethylases, <i>KDM6A<\/i>\/UTX and <i>KDM6B<\/i>\/JMJD3, and their inhibition compromises cell viability specifically in <i>SMARCA4<\/i> mutant cells. Furthermore, the <i>in vivo<\/i> administration of KDM6s inhibitor (GSK-J4) to mice orthotopically implanted with <i>SMARCA4 <\/i>mutant lung cancer cell lines or primary tumors of small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), showed a strong anti-tumor effect, highlighting the vulnerability of the SMARCA4 deficient tumors to KDM6s inhibition as a biomarker that could be exploited for treating SMARCA4-mutant cancer patients<sup> <\/sup>(Romero OA, Vilarrubi A, et al. SMARCA4 deficient tumors are vulnerable to KDM6A\/UTX and KDM6B\/JMJD3 blockade. Nat Comm 12, 4319, 2021).<br \/>Considering our previous observations, and due to the biological role of <i>SMARCA4<\/i> as a core component of the SWI\/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, whose members are genetically inactivated in approximately 20% of all human cancers, we wanted to determine the potential response to KDM6s inhibitors in a context of genetic alterations in genes encoding for the other subunits of this remodeling complex. For this propose, we have integrated state of the art technology like genome-wide chromatin modification analysis (ChIP-seq) and transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), using human cancer cell lines and preclinical models of different cancer types with genetic inactivation at different SWI\/SNF-complex members, including mouse models such as orthoxenografts, to design a personalized epigenetic treatment based on the genetic background. Our results showed that, like <i>SMARCA4<\/i> deficient cells, specific mutations at some, but not all, SWI\/SNF components induce refractoriness to SAHA, aberrant increase of H3K27me3 mark and sensitizes cancer cells to KDM6 inhibitor accompanied with significantly reduced levels of <i>KDM6A<\/i> and <i>KDM6B <\/i>expression. These results suggest a strong functional relationship between KDM6A\/6B activity and the SWI\/SNF-complex, in the control of gene expression and cancer development. These results will be of great value for the stratification of tumors according to their genetic background for tailored treatments, opening the possibility to use SWI\/SNF mutations as potential biomarkers for personalized epigenetic-based therapeutics in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63acd88a-c934-4ce7-b6dc-be67e9449d88\/@C03B8ZDd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Biomarkers,Cancer,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15049"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrea Vilarrubi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fernando Setien<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Pros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pedro P.

Immunoediting results when cancer cells evade immune recognition via positive selection for cells that do not present immunogenic antigens recognized by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. An epigenetic therapy-based approach has been developed in our lab to enhance expression of tumor antigens using combinatorial DNA methyltransferase inhibition (DNMTi) paired with histone deacetylase inhibition (HDACi). However, durable responses from the application of epigenetic therapy alone or in combination with other therapies have remained elusive in NSCLC. This may be because enhanced proliferation and infiltration of tumor-associated antigen specific CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells are necessary to recognize epigenetically induced antigens to halt disease progression. In the current study, we identified epigenetic therapy inducible self-antigens that can potentially be used to activate and guide the differentiation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells specific to NSCLC tumor antigens. The identification of these candidates was derived from analyses of paired RNAseq data from NSCLC patients treated with combination epigenetic therapy. From these analyses, differentially expressed transcripts selected from total transcriptome data were filtered to remove non-protein coding genes and genes with detectable expression in normal tissues as indicated by GTEx. HLA binding affinity (HLA-A*0201) of selected targets was defined by NetMHC 4.0 artificial neural network-based prediction to identify strong binding peptide candidates. The combined results of these data filtering facilitated the identification of 34 epigenetic therapy induced genes and associated peptides (9mers) with predicted high binding affinity for HLA-A*0201. The predicted peptides of target genes were selected for single peptide pulsing in allogenic dendritic cells to generate antigen specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells for TCR sequencing (TCRseq). TCRseq libraries derived from peptide stimulation experiments revealed distinct V and J gene frequencies and emergence of antigen specific clonotypes, which suggest clonal expansion. To validate whether epigenetic therapy could induce target genes expression in an independent experimental model, <i>in vitro <\/i>human NSCLC cell lines were treated with DNMTi and HDACi to mimic the clinical drug paradigm and transcriptional augmentation was assessed by qRT-PCR. In this orthogonal system, we validated eight target genes that were induced by epigenetic therapy <i>in vitro.<\/i> Altogether, these data suggest that a conserved subset of genes, whose derived proteins are predicted to be presented in class I MHC and act as T cell epitopes, is induced by combination epigenetic treatment. Our studies provide a basis for the development of novel and personalized strategies to improve outcomes and quality of life for more patients with NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e12e8115-8fa2-46a8-9d2f-13c1d82fcd8a\/@C03B8ZDd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methyltransferase,HDAC inhibitor,Lung cancer: non-small cell,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15051"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia An<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valsamo Anagnostou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen A.

Gain of function mutations in EZH2 histone methyltransferase and inactivating mutations in CREBBP acetyltransferase occur in up to 30% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Half of DLBCLs with mutated <i>EZH2<\/i> have also mutated <i>CREBBP<\/i>. In vitro, mutated EZH2 DLBCLs have a lower sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors, HDACi (Mensah et al, 2021). Here, we explored the dual pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 and HDAC for an improved anti-lymphoma activity.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Biochemical evaluation and characterization of target engagement were done using fluorescence polarization, thermal shift, surface plasmon resonance, isothermal titration calorimetry and microscale thermophoresis. Computer modelling was performed using available EZH2 and HDACs crystal structures. Anti-proliferative activity was assessed after 7 days (d) using MTT and live imaging in DLBCL cells (n = 5). For cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry, cells were treated, fixed then stained with 7-AAD.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We designed and synthesized 2 dual EZH2\/HDAC inhibitors, MC4343 and MC4355, starting from the structures of EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (taz) and HDACi vorinostat. In biochemical assays, MC4343 and MC4355 had equal potencies towards EZH2 (0.032 nM) but different specificities towards class I and class II HDACs: MC4355 showed 7.5-fold greater inhibition of HDAC3 compared to MC4343 (0.38 &#181;M and 2.85 &#181;M, respectively) and more potently inhibited HDACs 6 and 8 (0.016, 0.17 &#181;M and no activity, respectively). Computational modelling showed that the coordinative functional group of MC4343, but not of MC4355, caused steric clashes with several HDACs in increasing order: HDAC1 = HDAC3 &#62; HDAC8 &#62;&#62; HDAC4 = HDAC6. These results closely mirrored those obtained from the biochemical analysis. Both compounds inhibited proliferation in DLBCL cell lines irrespective of EZH2 or CREBBP mutational status but EZH2 and\/or CREBBP mutants were more sensitive. MC4355 (IC50 range = 0.17 - 1.68 &#181;M; median = 0.2 &#181;M) was more potent than MC4343 (IC50 range = 0.17-2.72 &#181;M; median = 1.78 &#181;M). This was confirmed by live imaging analyses. SUDHL4, with EZH2 Y666N, showed poorer sensitivity to both inhibitors compared to DLBCLs with EZH2 Y646N\/S. MC4343 and MC4355 induced cell death and G1 arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Pfeiffer, KARPAS422, WSUDLCL2, most sensitive to taz alone (IC50 = 4, 16, 77 nM), were most sensitive to MC4355 (IC50 = 200, 174, 171 nM).

Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a promising therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, only a subset of patients responds to this treatment regimen. Therefore, combinatorial therapeutic strategies to enhance anti-tumor immunity and efficacy of immunotherapy are in urgent need. Our group and others have demonstrated the potential of MYC inhibition in NSCLC to render the tumor microenvironment (TME) more immune permissive by upregulating antigen presentation machinery and chemokines that recruit effector lymphocytes. We performed a dedicated reanalysis of published transcriptome data from two distinct cancer types, prostate and lung, which were treated with novel MYC inhibiting agents, MYCi975 and Omomyc, respectively. These data revealed augmentation of two class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDAC5 and HDAC9, upon MYC inhibition. In addition to the suggested interaction between MYC and Class IIa HDACs derived from our transcriptional analyses, class IIa HDACs have an established role in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and poor prognosis of cancer patients, thus implying that therapeutic benefits could be derived from dual inhibition of MYC and class IIa HDAC. Elucidation of the basal relationship between Class IIa HDACs and the immune microenvironment of NSCLC was derived through correlative analyses of TCGA Lung adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma RNA-seq data. These data revealed a conserved positive correlation across non-small cell lung cancer between class IIa HDAC RNA levels, Treg score, and Treg\/CD8 ratio by immune deconvolution analysis. Evaluation of combinatorial treatment efficacy of MYCi plus Class IIa HDACi was undertaken using 19 NSCLC cell lines, which recapitulate the mutational and histological landscape of NSCLC. These data identified a genotype-driven drug synergy, wherein EGFR mutant cell lines presented as resistant, and Ras mutant cell lines presented as sensitive to our combination drug paradigm. In summary, we defined a positive association between Class IIa HDAC expression and Treg score in TCGA NSCLC samples, suggesting a possibility of immune-modulation via class IIa HDAC inhibition. Furthermore, we identified transcriptional augmentation of class IIa HDAC induced by MYC repression, which indicates a potential novel therapeutic opportunity. Finally, we determined that inhibition of class IIa HDACs potentiates MYC inhibitor-driven anti-tumor efficacy across a diverse set of NSCLC cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e7178b76-7201-44c8-92ce-c57e1fe62763\/@C03B8ZDd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Myc,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15294"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jina Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Vaz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ray-Whay C.

Innovative strategies targeting novel pathways alone or in combination are needed for sustainable therapeutic improvements. The MAPK pathway has been implicated in many cancers. MAPK interacting kinases (MNK1 and MNK2) are downstream of MAPKs and phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a protein involved in translation of oncogenic mRNAs. We have previously established pharmacological MNK inhibition as a promising strategy for GBM. However, most currently available MNK inhibitors lack specificity and exhibit off-target effects. We developed novel selective MNK inhibitors that show MNK inhibition specificity in GBM established cell lines as well as patient-derived cell lines propagated under stem cell permissive conditions as 3-D neurospheres. MNK inhibitors reduced cell viability and neurosphere growth. Our previous work with MNK inhibitors showed involvement in negative feedback loops activated with treatment of other pharmacological agents, so we conducted a high-throughput screening to identify potential targets for combination treatment. One of the top hits was a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor that enhanced MNK inhibitor antineoplastic effects in GBM cells. Dual MNK and DNMT inhibition synergistically reduced neurosphere growth in 3-D glioma stem-like cells. The combination promoted apoptosis in the mesenchymal glioma stem-like cells as shown through flow cytometry and increased expression of cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3, and Bax. Also, DNMT targeting enhanced the viability reduction effects of siRNA mediated MNK1 knockdown in GBM cells. This combination of our novel MNK inhibitor with DNMT inhibition elicited antineoplastic benefits in both 2-D cultures and 3-D glioma stem cell-like populations, demonstrating a potential novel therapeutic strategy in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bc0f5bcd-47c1-4bf9-ba06-5fb22eab184e\/@D03B8ZDe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Cancer stem cells,DNA methyltransferase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15296"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Candice Mazewski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Eckerdt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aneta Baran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariafausta Fischietti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Purav P.
