[{"Abstract":"Background: Development of primary or secondary resistance to anticancer treatments has been a critical challenge since implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments across multiple cancer subtypes. Preclinical studies have indicated that a mechanism of resistance to ICIs, including PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors, is activation of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway. E7386 is a novel compound that has been shown to modulate this pathway <i>in vivo<\/i>, by inhibiting the interactions between CREB-binding protein and &#946;-catenin. Preclinical models have also shown that E7386 may be able to eliminate drug-resistant cancer stem cells and resensitize resistant tumors to conventional treatment or therapy with an ICI, such as the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. There are no expected overlapping clearance, metabolic pathways, nor any known overlapping toxicities between E7386 and pembrolizumab monotherapies. Therefore, this combination may provide a novel anticancer treatment in patients with ICI-resistant tumors. This study aims to determine tolerability and efficacy of E7386 in combination with pembrolizumab in previously treated patients with selected solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b\/2 study (NCT05091346) will assess E7386 + pembrolizumab in patients with certain pretreated advanced solid tumors. Patients with melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are eligible. Patients should be &#8805; 18 years of age with measurable lesions as assessed by an investigator by RECIST v1.1. In the phase 1b dose escalation, patients (n=6 per dose level; up to n=18 in total) are treated with E7386 orally + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W (fixed dose). If the initial starting dose of E7386 100 mg BID is considered tolerable (&#8804;1 patient with a dose-limiting toxicity), E7386 may be escalated to 120 mg BID; if not tolerable, E7386 may be reduced to 80 mg BID. Primary objectives for phase 1b are to assess safety and tolerability, as well as to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), of E7386 + pembrolizumab. Upon determination of the RP2D, additional patients will be enrolled (approximately 30 patients in each tumor cohort) at this dose to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy. The primary objective of phase 2 is to assess objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1. Secondary objectives for phases 1b and 2 include efficacy assessments (duration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate) in each tumor cohort, and pharmacokinetics of E7386 when administered in combination with pembrolizumab. Exploratory objectives include assessment of biomarkers, PFS, and OS. Tumors will be assessed by an investigator based on RECIST v1.1, every 6 weeks, and all adverse events (as graded by CTCAE v5.0) will be monitored and recorded. As of January 6, 2022, 2 patients have been enrolled in phase 1b.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/28171ae2-e54b-4160-9400-fb49278a9f7c\/@u03B8ZYM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,Immune checkpoint,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20334"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Takayuki Yoshino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masafumi Ikeda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard S.

Eradication of MRD may improve outcomes for patients with AML; however, to date, therapeutic strategies that target MRD in AML are limited. V&#948;1<sup>+<\/sup> &#947;&#948; T cells are a subset of &#947;&#948; T cells, that recognize malignant cells through expression of a diverse repertoire of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) that interact with cognate stress ligands specifically upregulated on diseased cells. Upon target cell recognition, V&#948;1<sup>+<\/sup> &#947;&#948; T cells mediate anti-tumor activity through the direct lysis of transformed cells. The therapeutic potential of human V&#948;1<sup>+<\/sup> &#947;&#948; T cells for the treatment of AML is supported by published preclinical data that show strong and broad antileukemic activity of V&#948;1<sup>+<\/sup> &#947;&#948; T cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> (Almeida et al 2016; Di Lorenzo et al 2019). GammaDelta Therapeutics has developed GDX012, a novel allogeneic cell therapy that is enriched for V&#948;1<sup>+<\/sup> &#947;&#948; T cells for the treatment of AML. The cryopreserved drug product is manufactured from a healthy donor leukapheresis that has undergone &#945;&#946; T cell depletion prior to expansion. GDX012 is a viable (&#62;70% live), pure (CD45 &#62;90%) suspension for IV infusion consisting mainly of V&#948;1<sup>+ <\/sup>&#947;&#948; T cells (&#62;60%) expressing a variety of cellular markers that contribute to their function, recognition and targeting of malignant cells. Analysis of the biodistribution of GDX012 in therapeutic murine xenograft models further supports the clinical application of GDX012. When administered systemically, GDX012 shows homing to the bone marrow and is detected for at least 28 days. This suggests that, in addition to high cytotoxic activity against AML blasts, GDX012 also has the capacity to home to and persist in the specific niche where MRD is detected.<br \/>Study design: This phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study is comprised of two parts 1) Dose Escalation using 3 + 3 design to sequentially evaluate 4 doses of GDX012; 2) Dose Expansion including at least 10 additional patients at the MTD. The primary objective is to determine safety, tolerability, and the MTD of GDX012. The secondary objective is to evaluate the preliminary antileukemic activity of GDX012 based on detection of MRD in bone marrow. Exploratory objectives will evaluate the kinetics of GDX012 and infiltration in bone marrow and assessment of cytokines in blood and bone marrow. Key eligibility criteria include patients aged &#8805;18 years of age with histologically confirmed AML who are MRD positive by flow cytometry. Patients must be in first or subsequent CR or CR with incomplete hematological recovery. Eligible patients will undergo lymphodepletion with fludarabine for 4 days and cyclophosphamide for 3 days followed by infusion of GDX012. Patients will be followed for safety for at least 100 days post GDX012 infusion. Antileukemic activity will be evaluated from the bone marrow biopsy at Day 30. Up to 34 patients will be enrolled across 6 US sites. Recruitment to Cohort 1 is ongoing.

Phase 1\/2a study, ZX-101A-101 (NCT04504708) is ongoing to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, recent preclinical studies of ZX-101A showed that dual inhibition of PI3K&#948; and PI3K&#947; restored the immune surveillance to inhibit solid tumor growth. ZX-101A-201 is a phase 1\/2a open-label, multiple-dose ascending study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of once daily oral ZX-101A in 28-day cycles in patients with advanced solid tumors.ZX-101A had minimal effects on solid tumor-derived CT26, 4T1 and A20 cells in <i>in vitro<\/i> cell proliferation assay. In contrast, ZX-101A inhibited tumor growth when CT26 cells were grafted to wild-type syngeneic mice, while only showed a limited tumor growth inhibition when CT26 tumors grew on T-cell deficient nude mice. Thus, <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth inhibition in wild-type mice was attributed to the enhanced anti-tumor immunity by ZX-101A treatment. Flow cytometry analysis on <i>ex vivo<\/i> tumor tissues from syngeneic mouse demonstrated that ZX-101A decreased regulatory T cells and increased M1\/M2 macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment. In A20 syngeneic model, ZX-101A in combination of anti-PD1 antibody achieved 99.7% TGI after 18 days of treatment, while anti-PD1 antibody alone only had TGI at 11.7%. Synergistic inhibitory effect of ZX-101A and anti-PD1 antibody was also observed in LLC, CT26 and humanized MC38 syngeneic mouse models. Safety assessment on the mouse spleen, thymus and colon organs indicated minimal side effects by the treatment of the ZX-101A alone and in combination with anti-PD1. These results suggested ZX-101A as a potential immunotherapeutic agent to treat appropriate solid tumor types. ZX-101A-201 study consists of 2 parts, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. Part 1 dose escalation is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ZX-101A monotherapy in patient with advanced solid tumors. Part 2 dose expansion will evaluate ZX-101A activity in up to three disease-specific cohorts. Inclusion of combination therapy is planned after obtaining the initial clinical assessment of ZX-101A on its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5b5b2179-1166-40cb-9dd2-8c6dd632a929\/@v03B8ZYN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,Phase I,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20337"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaoli Qin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lori Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying-ying Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuaijun Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolin Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinfu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>.

The anti-tumor activity of FH-2001 has been confirmed in preclinical studies. Apart from exerting potent anti-proliferative effect on FGFR-driven tumors, FH-2001 may be able to overcome primary and secondary resistance of conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors or increase the response rate through PD-L1 regulation. This first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of FH-2001 in patients with advanced solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter phase I study has two parts. The first part comprised a dose escalation and a dose expansion phase to evaluate the safety, tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD)and phase II recommended dose (RP2D) of FH-2001. The dose escalation phase enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors with planned dose levels for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 or 16 mg. The accelerated titration design was used in the dose escalation phase for 1 and 2 mg dose, and if grade 2 or higher drug-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred during the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period between cycle 0 and 1 with 25 days, dose escalation would subsequently follow the 3+3 design. All other doses utilized the 3+3 design. Patients first received a single dose of FH-2001, and if no DLT or other unacceptable occurred, patients subsequently receive FH-2001 once daily in 21-day cycles. FH-2001 at a dose where objective efficacy was observed or reached effective exposure were selected for dose expansion. In the dose expansion phase, patients with advanced solid tumors harboring <i>FGFR<\/i> gene aberrations were enrolled, with 6-12 patients at each dose level, and they received FH-2001 once-a-day continuously in 21-day cycles. RP2D was determined based on the safety, pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic and preliminary efficacy data that were available in the first part of the study. The second part of the study commenced after RP2D was confirmed, which is a two-cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FH-2001. The first cohort comprised patients with advanced solid tumors who had progressed on prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The second cohort included patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with <i>FGFR<\/i> gene aberrations. Approximately 30 patients were enrolled in each cohort. Safety was assessed throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose. Tumor response was assessed by the investigators according to RECIST v1.1.

Results from recent neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) studies signal pCR rates between 31&#8208;42%. However, there was a clear dichotomy in response between patients with high vs. low pre&#8208;treatment lymphocytic infiltration. In tumors exhibiting immune excluded or immune desert phenotypes, therapeutic strategies to attract CD8+ T cells infiltration prior to ICB may be beneficial. CG0070 is an oncolytic adenovirus designed to preferentially replicate through a transcriptionally regulated promoter that is up&#8208;regulated in RB&#8208;pathway&#8208;defective cells (&#62;70% of MIBC). In addition, CG0070 expresses GM&#8208;CSF to attract antigen presenting cells to the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that combination therapy using intravesical CG0070 and systemic Nivolumab is 1) safe and 2) can enhance local and systemic treatment response in the neoadjuvant setting against MIBC.<br \/>Methods: This is a phase Ib trial evaluating 2 doses of nivolumab (4 weeks apart) with 6 weekly intravesical CG0070 followed by cystectomy. Dose&#8208;limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed in 6 DLT&#8208;evaluable patients in a safety lead&#8208;in phase. The combination would be declared tolerable if the incidence of DLTs is &#60;33%, and the study expanded to 30 patients. Key eligibility: cT2-T4aN0-1M0 stage, no autoimmume disease within 2 years, and no concurrent invasive upper tract carcinoma or other active cancer. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of combination therapy according to CTCAE v5.0. The secondary objective is to assess the changes in the lymphocytic infiltration following combination therapy and to assess the antitumor efficacy of combination therapy. Exploratory endpoints include assessing the predictive value of E2F expression, tumor mutational burden, immune infiltration, and various peripheral blood for treatment response. Study Progress: Study is actively accruing. Clinical trial information: NCT04610671. An update on the study will be provided at the time of presentation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0da91cb0-22cd-4967-9c94-6e3e3b527f87\/@v03B8ZYN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Genitourinary cancers: bladder,E2F,Retinoblastoma protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20371"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Roger Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wade Sexton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phillipe Spiess<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Gilbert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julio Pow-Sang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingsong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gustavo Borjas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paola Grandi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Burke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rohit Jain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Conejo-Garcia<\/i><\/presenter>.

In studies of NSCLC and lung cancer overall, the prevalence of HER2 overexpression has been reported to be anywhere from &#60;5% to 35% (Cox et al. <i>Int J Cancer<\/i>. 2001;92:480-483; Hirsch et al. <i>Lancet<\/i>. 2017;389:299-311). T-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. Interim results from the DESTINY-Lung01 trial showed encouraging efficacy in extensively pretreated patients (pts) with unresectable\/metastatic, HER2-overexpressing, nonsquamous NSCLC, with a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 24.5% and median overall survival (OS) of 11.3 months (Nakagawa et al. WCLC 2020. Abstract OA04.05). Preclinically, the combination of T-DXd and an anti-programmed cell death 1 antibody was more effective than either therapy alone. The DESTINY-Lung03 trial is evaluating the safety and tolerability of T-DXd in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy in pts with unresectable\/metastatic, HER2-overexpressing, nonsquamous NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: DESTINY-Lung03 (NCT04686305)<b> <\/b>is a phase 1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation (part 1) and dose-expansion (part 2) study in pts with HER2-overexpressing (&#8805;25% immunohistochemistry 2+\/3+ tumor cells), unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, nonsquamous NSCLC. In part 1, pts with progression after 1 or 2 lines of systemic therapy in the recurrent\/metastatic setting are enrolled to receive T-DXd and durvalumab in combination with cisplatin (arm 1A), carboplatin (arm 1B), or pemetrexed (arm 1C), or T-DXd monotherapy (arm 1D). In part 2, pts who have not received prior curative treatment in the locally advanced setting or systemic treatment in the metastatic setting are enrolled to receive T-DXd and durvalumab in combination with cisplatin (arm 2A), carboplatin (arm 2B), or pemetrexed (arm 2C), or T-DXd plus durvalumab (arm 2D); pts in part 2 must not have activating EGFR mutations, an EML4-ALK fusion, or other targetable alterations. The primary endpoint is the frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) with T-DXd plus durvalumab plus chemotherapy combinations to assess safety and tolerability and determine the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints include confirmed ORR, duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, OS, frequency of AEs and SAEs with T-DXd monotherapy (part 1) and T-DXd plus durvalumab (part 2), pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/650d2e96-1784-4260-9355-1acb0a525298\/@v03B8ZYN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21508"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Planchard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie R.

MEDI9253 is a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that incorporates a human transgene encoding the immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-12, which leads to tumor cell lysis and localized IL-12 expression. Preclinical studies show that MEDI9253 induces PD-L1 expression and recruits innate and adaptive immune cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and indicate that its antitumor activity is enhanced by concurrent PD-L1 blockade. This clinical study is evaluating intravenous (IV) MEDI9253 in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab in patients with selected advanced solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: This is a phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion trial (NCT04613492) enrolling patients with microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or<b> m<\/b>elanoma. Eligibility criteria include progressed\/refractory disease or intolerance to all prior lines of therapy with proven survival benefit for recurrent\/metastatic disease. Patients must have life expectancy &#8805;12 weeks by GRIm score; histologically documented disease; adequate performance status (ECOG 0-1); adequate organ function; and presence of RECIST v1.1 measurable disease amenable to repeated biopsy. Exclusion criteria include untreated\/uncontrolled metastatic CNS involvement. Patients must take precautions to prevent the theoretical risk of NDV transmission to humans and birds. The trial will enroll up to ~192 patients across 30 centers globally. The dose escalation phase will evaluate a single dose of IV MEDI9253 with sequential IV durvalumab, then multiple-dose cohorts of up to 4 ascending dose levels of MEDI9253 with sequential or concurrent durvalumab. The dose expansion phase will include 3 cohorts of ~20 patients, each enrolling a single tumor type. In both phases, durvalumab will be dosed for up to 2 years or until disease progression, clinical deterioration, withdrawal of consent or unacceptable toxicity. Pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies are required for patients in multiple-dose cohorts. The primary objectives are evaluating the safety, tolerability and incidence of dose-limiting toxicities of MEDI9253 and identifying the optimal dose\/schedule in combination with durvalumab. Secondary objectives include assessing initial efficacy (response and progression-free survival by RECIST v1.1, and overall survival), pharmacodynamics in the TME, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics (viremia and IL-12).
