[{"Abstract":"Cancer has a higher incidence in the elderly and immunotherapy is widely applied to this population. However, the majority of preclinical studies assessing drug toxicity and efficacy have been done in young healthy mice. Immunosenescence is a state of aging-related gradual deterioration of the immune system in the elderly. Here, we established tumor models in aged mice that show immunosenescence for a better representation of cancer patients, and to examine the effects of aging and immunosenescence on cancer drug efficacy and toxicity. Young (7 weeks), mid-aged (54-58 weeks), and aged (76-78 weeks) C57BL\/6J female mice were used for this study. Syngeneic tumor models were established using three different mouse cancer cell lines, B16-F10 melanoma, MC38 colon adenocarcinoma, and E0771 breast cancer. Age-related tumor growth kinetics varied based on tumor models. Specifically, aging did not affect tumor growth kinetics of B16-F10 tumors, while aged mice showed slowed growth of MC38 tumors and faster growth of E0771 tumors. To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose, young and aged mice were dosed with the standard of care cancer drugs (docetaxel, cisplatin, and doxorubicin) and body weight was monitored three times a week. Aged mice showed higher toxicity against standard care cancer drugs compared to young counterparts. Next, we performed efficacy study using checkpoint inhibitor. Young, mid-aged, and aged mice bearing MC-38 tumor were treated with isotype control or Anti-PD1 (8 mg\/kg), intravenously, twice weekly for 3 weeks. Whole blood and tumor samples were collected for immune cell profiling. Comparisons of PD-1 response in the various age groups showed that anti-PD1 treatment showed significant suppression of tumor growth in all age groups with the MC38 tumors, with the greatest effect in aged mice. We also found that anti-PD1 treatment increased T cell infiltration into the tumor, and that regulatory T cells in the tumor are decreased in aged mice. In conclusion, we established syngeneic tumor models using aged mice, and found aged mice exhibit higher toxicity against drugs. The effect of aging on tumor growth kinetics varies depending on the models. Differences in immune cell infiltration in the tumor might be an underlying event that causes age-related differences in response to anti-PD1 treatment. The integration of aging in cancer research could potentially bridge the gap between preclinical studies and clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2d6d04a5-497a-4f55-a17e-f27b4261d800\/@x03B8ZKk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-04 Senescence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Mouse models,Immune cells,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14946"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jiwon Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Schile<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingshan Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>James G.

TNBC constitutes 10-15% of all breast cancers but has a worse prognosis due to limited treatment options and high rates of metastatic recurrence. Doxorubicin (dox) remains one of the most active chemotherapy agents for the treatment of TNBC, although de novo and acquired resistance to chemotherapy remains a major challenge. The purpose of this work was to characterize dox resistant cell phenotypes and investigate treatment-induced senescence in p53-mutated (Mut) and wildtype (WT) TNBC cell lines.<br \/>Methods: A panel of 12 TNBC cell lines (p53 WT and p53 Mut) were exposed to dox (0-5 uM) for 72 hours and cellular proliferation was determined using the Cell Titer Glo assay. A subset of sensitive and resistant cell lines were treated with dox (0.1, 0.25 uM) or vehicle control and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry (Annexin-V) at 24 and 48 hrs. Cells were treated with dox or control for 24 hrs and western blotting was performed for mediators of apoptosis. Senescence was analyzed by &#223;-galactosidase staining following treatment with dox for 3-14 days. shRNA knockdown (KD) of p53 was performed in the CAL-51 (p53 WT cell line) and cells were subject to investigations above.<br \/>Results: Doxorubicin treatment resulted in decreased cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis as assessed by Annexin-V expression in a subset of p53 WT and p53 Mut cell lines. Treatment with dox resulted in an increase in the pro-apoptotic proteins BID and p21, as well as a decrease in VAMP in sensitive cell lines. In a subset of cell lines resistant to dox treatment, we observed an increase in cells demonstrating phenotypic features of senescence and &#223; -galactosidase staining. We observed a decrease in p16 with dox treatment in the CAL-51 (p53 WT cell line) compared to an increase following treatment in p53 Mut cell lines. KD of p53 resulted in an increase in senescent cells following treatment with low dose dox.<br \/>Conclusions: Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in different terminal cell phenotypes in TNBC cell lines with apoptosis observed in p53 WT and Mut cell lines. Senescence was observed in resistant cells and KD of p53 increased dox-induced senescence, confirming a role for p53 in mediating terminal cell fate. Efforts are ongoing to understand the role of mutant p53 in mediating terminal cell fate in response to dox and rational combinations to overcome dox-induced senescence may be clinically active in metastatic TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d14fd6d-c8df-4980-89fe-de22721d14c9\/@x03B8ZKk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-04 Senescence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,p53 mutations,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14935"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen G.

Therefore, it is critical that we understand the mechanisms that drive these toxicities and develop approaches to mitigate their severity. Recently we demonstrated that chemotherapy-induced senescence drives bone loss by both limiting mineralization of new bone and increasing bone resorption. To establish whether senescent bone resident cells or systemic responses to chemotherapy drove therapy-induced bone loss, we used a vossicle model in which neonatal vertebral bones (L4 and L5) were transplanted from 4-day old wildtype or <i>INKATTAC<\/i> pups (allow to selectively kill senescent cells) into wildtype or <i>INKATTAC<\/i> adult mice. Using this approach, we found that the elimination of senescent cells in donor vossicles protects from chemotherapy-induced bone loss, indicating that senescent bone resident cells are responsible for therapy-induced bone loss. To understand the mechanism(s) that contributed to therapy-induced bone loss, we used scRNA-seq to determine which bone resident cells underwent senescence in response to chemotherapy and how their gene expression was impacted. Using this approach, we found that adipocytes, fibroblast, chondrocytes and osteoblasts underwent senescence as evidenced by expression of p16, p21 and loss of Mki67 and displayed evidence of a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which we postulate contributes to therapy-induced bone loss. Collectively, our data indicated that chemotherapy causes bone loss via senescence and can be protected by eliminating senescent cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95e76fa5-fd1a-45ad-97a8-362dd35a19d5\/@x03B8ZKk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-04 Senescence,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone,Senescence,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Osteoclast,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14944"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ganesh Kumar Raut<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhangting Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Cole<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xainmin Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qihao Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheila A.

We compared the labeling efficiency of these probes in vitro and in cells and the results shows that by modulating the leaving group, we can improve the labeling efficiency of the probes and enhance their retention at the site of activation.

However, there is still a good deal to learn regarding how Akt can promote survival when cancer cells are faced by the multitude of challenges they need to overcome during the process of malignant transformation. While investigating the role of Dock7, a Cdc42 and Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor of the Dock180 family, in tumorigenesis, we discovered an unexpected connection between Dock7, Akt and cell survival. Specifically, we found that Dock7 is necessary for cancer cells to survive under the stressful conditions that arise due to the loss of a substratum or serum deprivation, through its ability to stabilize a low, basal level of Akt kinase activity. Dock7 binds to Akt, as well as associates with the known Akt substrate, TSC2, promoting its phosphorylation. Since the phosphorylation of TSC2 eliminates its ability to work with its partner TSC1 to deactivate the Rheb GTPase, a direct activator of mTORC1, we probed whether mTORC1 function is also necessary for Dock7-dependent cancer cell survival. Indeed, we determined that Dock7, as well as its signaling partner Cdc42, is required to maintain a functional level of S6 kinase activity, a downstream target of mTORC1, which was prevented by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. We further show an association between mTOR, Rheb and Dock7, but not Raptor, the defining component of mTORC1. Additionally, Raptor is dispensable for the Dock7-dependent S6 kinase activity, despite its rapamycin sensitivity. Together, these findings elucidate a novel Dock7-Akt-mTOR signaling node which promotes cancer cell survival in the absence of classical mTORC1 function to allow cells to overcome stresses faced during the development of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ef2dd469-3a4d-4d59-b24c-ca41a918c65b\/@x03B8ZKk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Akt,mTOR,Stress response,GTPase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14940"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Oriana Y.

A thorough understanding of the factors contributing to PCa recurrence following development of therapy resistance is acutely needed in order to develop efficacious treatments and disease-management strategies.Our group and others have identified a unique minority population of physically enlarged cancer cells with polyaneuploid genomes, termed polyaneuploid cancer cells (PACCs), in the tumors of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and in other tumor types. PACCs are the result of a polyaneuploid transition that occurs when aneuploid cancer cells experience environmental or therapeutic stress. These aneuploid cancer cells then pause their cell cycle after whole genome doubling to survive the environmental insult. Cancer cells in the PACC state appear to be quiescent and have an increased capacity for invasion\/motility, an ability to endure in stressful or novel environments, and a propensity to undergo depolyploidization to re-establish the cancer cell population. We hypothesize that PACCs are critical players in prostate cancer therapy resistance and recurrence. We seek to better understand the life cycle of the PACC state in PCa in order to inform the design of new therapeutic strategies that prevent disease recurrence.One important part of understanding how cells enter and exit that PACC state is to characterize the features of the PACC nuclei compared to &#8220;typical&#8221; PCa cells. Examining the distribution of DNA content and the size of individual nuclei allows us to infer the underlying mechanisms PCa cells use to enter the PACC state, such as cell fusion, endomitosis, endocycling, or mitotic slippage. Nuclear structure can further indicate what types of depolyploidization are possible, including neosis, polyploid mitosis, or uneven cell division. Thus, we developed a robust method to isolate nuclei from PACCs and used flow cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging to ascertain the nuclear content and size from whole PACC cells as well as the isolated nuclei. Analysis of nuclear features from both whole cells and isolated nuclei is necessary to resolve truly multinucleated cells from those that contain a single polylobulated nucleus.Our preliminary data suggests that PCa cells in the PACC state tend to have a large polyploid single nucleus more frequently than multiple smaller, single nuclei, though both were observed. This is in contrast with the opinion of many in the field, who believe that PACCs (and other variations of giant polyploid cancer cells) only exist in a multinucleated state. Continuation of these studies in various cancer cell lines and at sequential timepoints in the PACC state will deepen our understanding of how cancer cells evade systemic treatment and cause disease recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e1a6710-6fed-4ec8-9d05-651c396b2828\/@x03B8ZKk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aneuploidy,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14936"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Gonye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chi-Ju Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Pienta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Amend<\/i><\/presenter>.

The solely pathogenic mechanism in AL is deposition of immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) organized in fibrils in target organs. Surprisingly, therapeutic strategies directly targeting FLC secretion are not available. SNARE proteins, which are the specific target of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), are involved in the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles. We hypothesized that certain BoNT serotypes may block FLC secretion and trigger cytotoxicity triggering a terminal UPR.<br \/>Gene expression profiling in a cohort of 170 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients (IFM170) was used to interrogate SNAREs expression in malignant plasma cells. We developed tetracycline inducible, bicistronic vectors expressing distinct BoNT serotypes (BoNT\/A-F), T2A and GFP. Lentivirally transduced cells would express BoNT in a 1:1 stochiometric ratio with GFP, upon doxycycline (dox) administration. We transduced AL cell lines stably expressing rRTA with Tet-On lentivirus expressing 7 distinct BoNTs and performed two sets of experiments. First, we performed time-course viability assays on polyclonally transduced cells and compared relative proportion of GFP+ cells over time. Then, we single-cell sorted transduced cells, triggered BoNT expression and assessed GFP kinetic and apoptosis at 24, 48 and 72 hours post dox. SNAREs cleavage following induction of BoNT expression was evaluated via WB in GFP+ clones. To assess if BoNT cytotoxicity correlated with cessation of FLC secretion, we performed a secretion assay in monoclones expressing distinct BoNTs.<br \/>IFM170 GEP and AL\/MM cell lines analysis showed VAMP2, VAMP3 and SNAP23 as the top expressed SNAREs. By using polyclonally transduced cells, we show that GFP+ (transduced) cells are rapidly depleted over time after dox, across all serotypes, except BoNT\/B, consistent with cytotoxic effect. We noted an association between SNAP23 and VAMP3 cleavage and BoNT toxicity, suggesting that dual targeting of SNAP23\/VAMP3 may be necessary to mediate BoNT cytotoxicity. We next show that only BoNTs causing early cytotoxicity (A, D, E and F) significantly inhibited FLC secretion and induced UPR activation, presumably through FLC retention. Indeed, cytotoxic BoNTs, activated PERK pathway with eIF2a phosphorylation (p-eIF2a); ATF4, CHOP and GADD34 upregulation. Importantly preliminary data in CHOP KO AL cells show rescue of BoNT_induced death, confirming that a terminal UPR is the mechanism of cytotoxicity of BoNT in AL.<br \/>We show that in all seven BoNT serotypes examined, except for BoNT\/B , simultaneous cleavage of SNAP23 and VAMP3 predicts BoNT cytotoxicity and correlates with cessation of FLC secretion and terminal UPR. Overall, our preliminary data provide proof of concept that targeting FLC secretion is feasible and of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical AL models, suggesting potential clinical translatability of this innovative approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc2be5b4-460b-47ec-9a62-b2caf1271329\/@x03B8ZKk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Unfolded protein response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Unfolded protein response (UPR),Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Multiple myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14943"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Moscvin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Gregor Czarnecki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tianzeng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annamaria Gullá<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Carl Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giada Bianchi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Higher AID expression in patients has been correlated with a worse prognosis, but patients with mutated immunoglobulin (IgHV) genes, which requires AID activity, have a better prognosis. To elucidate the role of AID in leukemic progression, we generated an AID-deficient mouse model of CLL, AID<sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/E&#956;-TCL1, and found that these mice die significantly earlier than their AID-proficient counterparts. AID<sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/E&#956;-TCL1 mice have higher percentages of germinal center B cells and increased infiltration of CLL cells into the lungs, liver, and peritoneal cavity. Both AID-deficient B cells and CLL cells downregulated the tumor suppressive Smad1\/S1PR2 signaling pathway, which normally restrains expansion of the germinal center, potentially leading to altered proliferation and homing of leukemia cells. Furthermore, AID<sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/E&#956;-TCL1 CLL cells exhibited higher levels of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, supporting their growth and survival. Upregulated BCR signaling led us to investigate the IRE1&#945;\/XBP1s pathway in these cells, which is necessary to support proper BCR signaling and is upregulated in CLL cells. IRE1&#945; is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor that cleaves XBP1 mRNA to produce the functional transcription factor XBP1s. XBP1s promotes synthesis of lipids and chaperones necessary for BCR signaling, and inhibition of this pathway compromises BCR signaling and CLL survival. Compared to E&#956;-TCL1 controls, AID<sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/E&#956;-TCL1 CLL cells indeed respond to various ER stressors with a higher ER stress response, particularly through the IRE1&#945;\/XBP1s pathway, resulting in cells that are more resistant to the stressed conditions within the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, this upregulation in the ER stress response cannot be solely attributed to an accelerated leukemic progression, as B cells from AID<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice also express increased levels of XBP1s and are more responsive to treatment with pharmacological ER stressors. These studies are translatable to human CLL, as shRNA knockdown of AID in the CLL cell line WaC3 resulted in an increased ER stress response, and CLL cells from patients with IgHV-unmutated disease express higher levels of XBP1 mRNA than those from patients with mutated CLL. Additionally, treatment of both mouse and human CLL cells with a combination of the S1PR2 agonist CYM-5520 and the IRE1 inhibitor B-I09 led to improved induction of apoptosis, revealing a novel way to treat CLL. Overall, these results demonstrate multiple pathways through which the loss of AID leads to worsened CLL and may explain why IgHV-unmutated CLL has such a high proliferative rate that requires therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bfa74f60-cecb-4f3c-9a39-fc003e64d2d4\/@x03B8ZKk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Unfolded protein response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Unfolded protein response (UPR),B cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14945"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Avery C.

Heat shock protein 40 (HSP40), also known as J-domain proteins (JDPs), has been implicated in stabilization of misfolded mutp53. Specifically, knockdown of DNAJA1, a member of HSP40\/JDPs, results in degradation of mainly misfolded mutp53, leading to inhibition of tumor progression. Since no DNAJA1 inhibitors are currently available in clinics, these findings prompted us to identify potential DNAJA1 inhibitors which can induce mutp53 degradation.<br \/><b>Methods\/Design:<\/b> An in-silico docking study was performed for binding of the DNAJA1 J-domain to compounds in zinc data base, which identified compound Number7-3. Further analysis suggests three critical amino acids in DNAJA1 for the binding, including Y7, K44, and Q47.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Eighteen commercially available analogs of Number7-3 were further examined. Of these, a compound, namely A11, had the strongest activity to deplete both DNAJA1 and misfolded mutp53. A11 reduced protein levels of misfolded mutp53 in concentration- and time-dependent manners without affecting mRNA levels of DNAJA1 and mutp53. Importantly, A11 showed minimal effects on the levels of wild-type p53 and DNA contact mutp53. Treatment of cells expressing misfolded mutp53 with A11 resulted in reduced filopodia formation and cell migration, which was not observed in cells lacking DNAJA1. Moreover, protein levels of a triple mutant DNAJA1 (Y7A\/K44A\/Q47A) were not altered by A11. Intriguingly, A11 reduced protein levels of several other HSP40\/JDPs.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our study, for the first time, has identified a small compound that depletes DNAJA1, leading to reduced levels of misfolded mutp53 and inhibited malignant properties of cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Heat shock proteins,Inhibitors,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14942"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tomoo Iwakuma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shigeto Nishikawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atsushi Kaida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atul Ranjan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro Parrales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed A.

A proliferating tumor encounters several stresses from the microenvironment like hypoxia, lack of nutrients and acidosis. To cope with these conditions, cancer cells can co-opt existing cytoprotective mechanisms, such as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR involves transcriptional and translational activation of signaling pathways designed to relieve cellular stress and attenuate cell death; although, in the case of unresolved or chronic ER stress UPR can promote cell death. However, the mechanisms by which the UPR influences cell fate in the presence of ER stress are poorly understood. To address this, we have used a functional CRISPR-based genetic knockout screen, to determine novel regulators of UPR and the mechanisms involved to control cellular fate following chronic ER stress. We delivered a lentiviral genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library to two cell lines and identified sgRNAs which are over-represented (pro-apoptotic genes), or underrepresented (pro-survival genes) following ER stress induced by thapsigargin and tunicamycin. One of the highest-ranking gene candidates was Survivin\/<i>BIRC5<\/i>, a protein which is overexpressed in tumor cells compared to normal tissues. Survivin was first identified as an inhibitor of apoptosis but also participates in the regulation of the cell cycle. Survivin held a high position in the negative ranking scale of all screens suggesting a possible prosurvival role in response to ER stress. In agreement, our results show that genetic knock down or chemical inhibition of Survivin led to sensitization of cells to ER stress. Moreover, both <i>in vitro<\/i> an <i>in vivo<\/i> data support that PERK (a key sensor of the third arm of the UPR cascade) is responsible for this sensitization. Interestingly, we observed that ER stress in turn leads to downregulation of Survivin in a dose and time dependent fashion, both in the level of protein but also RNA, employing a variety of mechanisms like protein translation, degradation and RNA synthesis. Foreseeably, PERK knock down reverses the aforementioned effect supporting its role as a key participant in the interplay between Survivin and ER stress. Though the balance between those two is still to be understood our results demonstrate that Survivin holds a novel function as an ER stress regulator but also targeting of PERK and Survivin in a clinical setting could reveal new windows in therapeutic intervention in malignancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/736619cb-107b-4235-90f0-cdd048b85977\/@y03B8ZKm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Unfolded protein response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survivin,Unfolded protein response (UPR),Endoplasmic reticulum stress,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14937"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nektaria Maria Leli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Souvik Dey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Brady<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlo Salas Salinas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jerome Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgos Skoufos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ioannis Verginadis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Artemis Chatzigeorgiou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Constantinos Koumenis<\/i><\/presenter>.
