[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> The purpose of our study is to aid the development of adoptive T-cell receptor (TCR) -based cancer therapies with an AI platform that models binding between peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) complexes and TCRs. One of the main challenges in the field is finding the right pHLA target and the TCR that binds it. The development of <i>in silico<\/i> methods that can reduce the cost and time of laboratory research is the &#8216;holy grail&#8217; of novel TCR therapies design. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is a computational method allowing to gain a direct insight into the movements of protein complexes and giving the possibility to study the dynamics of the pHLA:TCR interaction. The combination of the MD and AI models helps us to increase the accuracy of the pHLA:TCR binding prediction.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We conducted large-scale MD simulations of the crystal structures of 130 pHLA:TCR complexes available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Next, we analyzed the obtained trajectories in terms of formed bonds and other physico-chemical properties. This led us to postulate an MD model of interaction further used as an inductive bias for the AI binding prediction model, in which we applied deep learning on public single-cell pHLA:TCR datasets to estimate the probability of binding.In order to validate and improve our platform, we are building a pHLA:TCR interaction database with paired alpha and beta chain TCR sequences from a cohort of 100 colorectal cancer patients (NCT04994093).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We established the agretopicity and epitopicity of peptide residues within the pHLA:TCR systems based on the characteristics of the bonds formed between peptides and HLAs or TCRs in MD simulations. Additionally, the incorporation of other molecular properties, e.g. solvent accessible surface area, improved our AI pHLA:TCR model. In order to refine our results, we also account for the HLA type and physico-chemical properties of peptides. The introduction of the detailed TCR-peptide interaction matrix allowed the model to generalize to previously unseen pHLA targets.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Rational design of effective TCR therapies can benefit from novel pHLA:TCR models for which the predictive accuracy is driven by the synergistic AI-MD approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f75a1ec6-b446-4613-ba06-87bbc8d45a41\/@v03B8ZFJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Machine learning,Molecular Dynamics simulations,T-cell receptor TCR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16725"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander Myronov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>S&#322;awomir Stachura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Sanecka-Duin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oskar Gniewek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>&#321;ukasz Grochowalski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maciej Jasi&#324;ski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulina Król<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanna Marczy&#324;ska-Grzelak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Piotr Skoczylas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Wojciechowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Mazzocco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miko&#322;aj Mizera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Kaczmarczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Agnieszka Blum<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, 30%-60% of patients with B-ALL who initially responded to anti-CD19 CAR-T therapies relapsed either due to poor CAR-T persistence or CD19 antigen escape, and preliminary data also indicated CD19 antigen loss in patients with B-NHL relapsed after anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy. In addition, the immunogenicity of murine origin CAR construct is another cause of limited <i>in vivo <\/i>CAR-T persistence.<br \/><b>Design: <\/b>To overcome these problems, a novel fully human anti-CD19&#215;anti-CD22 dual targeted CAR-T cell product - CT120, has been developed. The CT120 CAR molecule contains tandem fusion of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 scFv, which can effectively recognize CD19 and CD22 antigen independently, to avoid antigen escape. The intracellular CAR domain contains CD3&#950; and 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, which can improve<i> in vivo<\/i> persistence.

The latter abnormality plays a major role in clinical resistance to Checkpoint Inhibitors (CI). CSPG4 was selected as the target because of its high expression on melanoma and its restricted distribution in normal tissues. Our approach is based on CAR.CIK redirected against CSPG4. CIK, <i>ex vivo<\/i> expanded T-NK lymphocytes endowed with intrinsic HLA-independent antitumor activity, were used as effectors.<br \/><b><u>Experimental procedure.<\/u><\/b> CAR.CIK were generated by retroviral transduction of patient derived PBMC with a vector encoding a 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation CSPG4-CAR with 4-1BB co-stimulation. Surface HLA-I expression was evaluated by flow cytometry on melanoma cell lines (Mel), derived by surgical biopsies. These cells also served as targets for CSPG4 CAR.CIK. The activity of CSPG4 CAR.CIK was analyzed <i>in vitro <\/i>and in immunodeficient mice grafted with a patient-derived HLA-defective melanoma. Mice were treated intravenously with 3x10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR.CIK (5 cells infusions in total).<br \/><b><u>Results.<\/u><\/b><b> <\/b> CAR.CIK were efficiently generated from 4 melanoma patients.

Membrane HLA-I molecules were detected in 23\/24 Mel samples, with a variable membrane density per cell (median 21232, range 787-49871). Sample Mel17 did not express HLA-I because of a start lost mutation (p.Met1Ile) in &#946;2microglobulin. CSPG4 was intensely expressed by all Mel (78&#177;5%), with no correlation to HLA-I levels. CSPG4 CAR.CIK efficiently killed 10 Mel samples <i>in vitro<\/i>, including Mel17 (HLA-I negative) and 2 Mel with the lowest HLA-I density (Mel71, Mel72). Mean Mel-specific killing by CSPG4 CAR.CIK was significantly higher compared with unmodified CIK especially at low effector\/target (E\/T) ratios (85% vs 40% at E\/T=1:1; 46% vs 9% at E\/T=1:8, p&#60;0.0001). <i>In vivo<\/i>, CSPG4 CAR.CIK caused a significant inhibition of the HLA-negative Mel17 tumor growth (p&#60;0.0001) as compared to controls.

However, on-target\/off-tumor toxicity is a major concern. This issue highlights the clinical need for better targets to improve the safety profile of immunotherapies. On-target\/off-tumor toxicity is mainly based on the expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) in healthy tissues under physiological conditions. Thus, new approaches have to be developed to restrict specificity of targeted immunotherapy selectively towards cancerous cells. One way to improve target specificity is multi-targeting of cancer cells, i.e. targeting more than one TAA per cancer cell. We developed a workflow to identify new tumor markers employing an unbiased high throughput flow cytometry-based screen on primary ovarian cancer samples. Co-expression of THY1, a marker of fibroblasts and hematopoietic stem cells, was revealed on cancer cells characterized by EPCAM expression, a marker of epithelial cells. We confirmed our findings by high content imaging analyzing several ovarian carcinoma samples. Next we assessed the safety profile of the target combination THY1-EPCAM by analyzing the expression across a multitude of healthy human tissue samples using again high content imaging. Cluster analysis showed correlation patterns within the datasets confirming our previous findings. In order to investigate the functionality of THY1-EPCAM as therapeutic t we combined this target pair with the adaptor CAR technology, a modular system composed of a CAR recognizing biotin and biotinylated antibodies which are specific for a certain antigen. This technology combines the flexibility and controllability of antibodies with the efficacy of CAR T cell-dependent killing of target cells. The functional <i>in vitro<\/i> characterization of adaptor CAR T cells targeting the THY1-EPCAM pair shows high specificity and efficacy. Moreover, we are going to conduct <i>in vivo<\/i> studies with adaptor CAR T cells to investigate the efficacy and safety of targeting THY1-EPCAM in a solid tumor model. In conclusion, we successfully identified a novel target combination in ovarian cancer utilizing flow cytometry-based screening complemented by high content imaging. The new target pair combination shows promising results <i>in vitro<\/i> in combination with adaptor CAR T cells indicating its potential use as future immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4607fef2-6ea3-4722-9fef-f2d13c3b2702\/@v03B8ZFJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,CAR T cells,Target discovery,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16731"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christoph Herbel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vera Dittmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuel Martinez-Osuna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandy Reiß<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Mallmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominik Ratiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Mallmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paurush Praveen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Werner Müller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dominik Eckardt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Bosio<\/i><\/presenter>.

To date, there are five CAR-T products approved by FDA, four CD19 targeted CAR-T cells, and one targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). However, this success has not yet been transferred to solid tumors. A major challenge is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Development of immunotherapies has traditionally been hampered by discrepancies observed between <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies and actual clinical trial outcomes. The lack of clinically relevant mouse models for human immunotherapy testing is often seen as the primary cause. Existing clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)<i> in vivo<\/i> models poorly recapitulate the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we report a ccRCC orthotopic humanized NSG-SGM3 mouse model (ccRCC-hNSG-SGM3) with reconstituted human lymphocytes and bearing human ccRCC skrc-59 cells under the kidney capsule. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched CD34+ human stem cells were used for the humanization to reduce T cell alloreactivity against skrc-59 human ccRCC cells. Tumors were harvested, sorted for CD45+ tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed to profile the TME in ccRCC-hNSG-SGM3. By comparing to patient data from prospective clinical trials of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) nivolumab in advanced ccRCC, the results demonstrated that CD45+ TILs from ccRCC-hNSG-SGM3 reconstitute most CD45+ cell types, including dendritic cells, exhausted CD8 T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), that are observed in advanced ccRCC patient TME. Furthermore, we generated HLA matched Immune Restoring (IR) CAR-T cells which can secrete anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) locally to restore active antitumor immunity, and we assessed the efficacy and safety of IR CAR-T cells in this model. Anti-CAIX CAR-T cells armored with anti-PD-L1 mAb showed superior efficacy in tumor regression and significantly decreased TIL exhaustion compared to irrelevant CAR or irrelevant payload in this model. In addition, <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization (ISH) results showed CAR-T cells infiltration in tumor but no CAR-T cells were observed in normal tissues. In summary, the ccRCC-hNSG-SGM3 system is able to model the advanced ccRCC TME and provides a powerful tool for ccRCC TME study and immunotherapy assessment. IR CAR-T cells exhibited superior tumor regression and reversed immunosuppressive TME in humanized mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4c64b2a8-c803-4723-9b90-34a95c3939bc\/@v03B8ZFJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,ccRCC,Immune checkpoint blockade,Humanized mouse model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16732"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yufei Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alicia Buck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marion Grimaud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aedin Culhane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Braun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sreekumar Kodangattil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cecile Razimbaud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atef Fayed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Apollon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriella Kastrunes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luann Zerefa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon Piel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Ivanova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis Bonal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quang-De Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhu Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Hayden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madison O'Donnell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Jenning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miriam Ficial<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maura Aliezah Sticco-Ivins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabina Signoretti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toni Choueiri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon Wee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cloud Paweletz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David A.

However, less than half of patients on CAR T cell therapy experience long-term disease control, with better outcomes observed in pediatric compared to adult populations. Senescent T cells have been shown to manifest defective killing abilities and the development of negative regulatory functions, with evidence suggesting that senescence may play a role in decreasing CAR T cell efficacy and persistence. Moreover, levels of telomerase have been shown to control the lifespan of human T cells, with increased levels delaying senescence. It has been shown that T cell exhaustion limits CAR T cell efficacy in the context of solid tumors, where CAR T cells have yet to demonstrate sustained responses. Using a model of CAR T cell exhaustion developed in our lab, and CAR T cells manufactured from younger and older donors, we have developed a comprehensive method to profile T cell functionality, phenotype, and proliferation. We are able to characterize features of senescence via cell surface markers, intracellular activity, telomere length, and telomerase activity as well as features of exhaustion. Using CRISPR\/Cas9, we have inactivated TERT in primary human T cells and CAR T cells and interrogated the effects of hTERT knockout as well as of hTERT overexpression on key markers of T cell identity, exhaustion, senescence, and cytotoxic activity. Understanding telomerase in the context of CAR T cell therapy will provide mechanistic insights into senescence and exhaustion cellular programs and has the potential to inform increasingly effective CAR T cell cancer treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/795aa070-ea05-4753-90c6-702f8c4cf15a\/@v03B8ZFJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Senescence,Telomerase,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16734"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tara Murty<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria C.

Several CAR T-cell therapies produced highly efficacious responses from patients with hematologic malignancies. However, wider adoption of CAR T-cell therapy is challenged due to the potential development of life-threatening toxicities including cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS symptoms can range from mild fever to life-threatening events, including death. Preclinical animal models to assess the efficacy and toxicity of CAR T-cell therapies have been lacking. Here, we developed a novel mouse model to assess the efficacy and toxicity of CAR T-cell therapy simultaneously. Two different PBMC humanized NSG&#8482; variants were used. NSG-MHC Class I\/II double knock-out strain is known to have a delayed onset of GvHD, and NSG-SGM3xIL15 strain shows a higher engraftment level of human NK and myeloid cells, in addition to human T cells. Mice were humanized using PBMCs and treated with autologous or allogeneic CAR T cells, and efficacy and toxicity were assessed. Compared to the control treatment, CD19 CAR T-cells caused a decrease in the human CD19+ cell population in the blood and spleen, and induced cytokine release. Both T-cell and myeloid cytokine releases, including IFNgamma, IL-10, RANTES, and MIP-1alpha, were induced in our animal models. The in vivo platform can also be used to determine individual PBMC\/CAR T donor differences and show the extent of efficacy and toxicity of each PBMC donor treated with autologous and allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy. We further confirmed anticancer efficacy using luciferase-tagged human B-cell lymphoma Raji tumor cells, which express a high level of CD19. In summary, we have developed a novel in vivo model to test the efficacy and toxicity of both autologous and allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy simultaneously.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a53ae7e3-c070-408a-9eaf-3381e9d32b48\/@v03B8ZFJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cytokines,Mouse models,Toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16736"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jiwon Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Won Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Jiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danying Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather Gustafson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Gardner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingshan Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>James G.

Gadeta leverages the natural HLA-independent tumor recognition capabilities of &#947;&#948;TCRs combined with the proliferative capacity and robust tumor killing of &#945;&#946;T cells to develop tumor-specific cell therapies. &#947;&#948;T cells expressing V&#947;9V&#948;2 TCRs are the most common subtype found in peripheral blood. They sense the presence of phosphoantigens (pAgs) upregulated in malignant cells due to a dysregulated mevalonate pathway. The V&#947;9V&#948;2 TCR expressed by GDT002 was isolated from a PBMC-derived &#947;&#948;T cell of a healthy donor and was selected for its broad and strong tumor reactivity. GDT002 is currently being evaluated in a multicenter first-in-human phase 1\/2 study for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (NCT04688853). Here we describe studies carried out to identify potential solid tumor indications which could be effectively targeted by GDT002. Tumor reactivity was tested against cell lines from different cancer types in the presence of pamidronate, a clinically approved N-bisphosphonate that boosts pAgs levels. Significant GDT002 reactivity, in terms of cytotoxicity and cytokine release, was observed against most tumor targets. In a more complex ex vivo 3D co-culture system, GDT002 reactivity was also observed towards a broad panel of patient-derived tumor organoids. In contrast, there was no or very limited GDT002 reactivity against primary healthy cells. From our broad screening of solid tumor types, we identified ovarian cancer as a promising indication for GDT002. GDT002 displayed significant reactivity towards 4\/5 ovarian cell lines and 9\/10 patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids in the presence of pamidronate. To study GDT002 in vivo, we investigated the biodistribution of i.v. administered pamidronate. In tumor-bearing mice, intra-tumor pamidronate concentrations were detected during the 7-day observation period, allowing targeting by GDT002. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GDT002 has a potent anti-tumor activity across a broad spectrum of solid and liquid tumor types. We have identified ovarian cancer as a potential indication to explore the clinical effect of GDT002 against solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55119c91-a87e-4e5f-b81f-905375c2efc4\/@v03B8ZFJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Ovarian cancer,T cell,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16738"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Esther Drent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Andrea Bisso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sjoerd Baardman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dagmar Verweij<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Estefania Salcedo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Coomans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Braem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sander Van de Weg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Melief<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haakan Norell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marleen Van Loenen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefania Gobessi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Throsby<\/i><\/presenter>.

One mechanism employed by tumor cells to evade immunosurveillance is through induction of the surface expression of unconventional HLA ligands that agonize inhibitory receptors on immune cells. Specifically on some tumors, HLA-E is either expressed or its expression is known to be induced by IFN&#947; and is indicative of resistance to immunotherapy. HLA-E agonizes the CD94\/NKG2A inhibitory complex on NK cells and some T cells to lessen their cytotoxicity, potentially decreasing the efficacy of cellular therapy with these immune cells. The CD94\/NKG2A inhibitory complex is in balance with CD94\/NKG2C stimulatory complex. HLA-E binds both of these complexes and the cytolytic activity of NK cells is influenced by the relative ratios of CD94 complexed to NKG2A or NKG2C. Thus, altering the ratio to increase NKG2C will increase NK cell cytotoxicity. In this study we show that NK cells <i>ex vivo<\/i> expanded with PM21-particle technology are highly cytotoxic and have elevated expression of NKG2A. These expanded NK cells also secrete high levels of IFN&#947;, inducing expression of HLA-E in tumor cells. To increase the cytotoxic potential of these <i>ex vivo<\/i> expanded NK cells, the potential to form CD94\/NKG2A inhibitory complex was suppressed by either antibody blockade of NKG2A or deletion of the NKG2A gene by CRISPR\/Cas9 editing. Cytotoxicity of NK cells against a lung cancer cell line stably expressing HLA-E were determined by kinetic live-cell imaging. Multiple NK cell:target (NK:T) ratios were used to show an increase in cytotoxicity over control NK cell conditions (alone or with isotype control) in the presence of NKG2A blocking antibodies with 39% increase observed at 1:10 NK:T ratio at 96h with anti-NKG2A and 56% increase with NKG2A knockout NK cells. These data suggest that blockade of CD94\/NKG2A complex can improve cytotoxic activity of <i>ex vivo<\/i> expanded NK cells and could provide a promising effector population with the potential for enhanced therapeutic efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/99ed2882-4b7e-4fa9-a97f-5ef45979921f\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Immune cells,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16739"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tayler J.

Currently approved therapies are still limited to patient-autologous &#945;&#946; T cells. Although successful in some settings, this approach comes with challenges including associated toxicities, high production costs and the requirement to gene edit cells to avoid graft vs host disease in an allogeneic setting. In contrast to &#945;&#946; T cells, innate immune cells such as Natural Killer (NK) cells and gamma delta (&#947;&#948;) T cells offer opportunities to develop MHC unrestricted, fully allogeneic, off-the-shelf immunotherapies without the need for gene editing. Whilst NK cells offer great cytotoxic potential, control of MHC dysregulation and stress sensing receptors, &#947;&#948; T cells on the other hand combine the power of a TCR with a variety of natural cytotoxicity receptors and the capability to orchestrate adaptive immune responses even in an HLA-mismatched context. Lately, V&#948;1 T-cells have gained significant attention in the field of cancer immunotherapy based on their evolutionary conserved role in cancer immunosurveillance. Multiple groups are developing protocols to grow clinical grade innate immune cells at scale for the treatment of cancer. Each protocol is designed to grow one specific effector cell type of adequate quality. Despite their unique potential, each cell type faces its own challenges for clinical use. A treatment combining a variety of innate cells could be desirable to mitigate for these limitations. We have developed a first in class, scalable expansion process to simultaneously grow NK cells, V&#948;1 and V&#948;2 T-cells from a healthy donor leukapheresis in a single culture vessel. This 12-day process induces proliferation of all three cell types, resulting in a viable and cryo-preservable drug product where all cells express markers associated with great cytotoxicity, such as CD56 and NKp30. Named after the high expression of CD56, GDX056 shows great efficacy against haematological and solid tumor cells <i>in-vitro<\/i>. Integrating a viral transduction step into the expansion process allows us to generate a CAR modified tri-cellular product which shows unprecedented cytotoxicity against target cells at E:T ratios as low as 1:100. In an <i>in vivo <\/i>NALM-6 leukemia model all cell types show engraftment but different body distribution and persistence over time. Whilst efficacious, GDX056 also serves as a great research tool to study each cell type side-by-side. In summary, we have developed an easily manufacturable, first of its kind cellular product combining all major MHC unrestricted cell types. Whilst V&#948;1 T cells and NK cells demonstrate anti-cancer activities, V&#948;2 T cells are strong mediators of anti-bacterial biology, hence GDX056 potentially offers a unique combinatorial immunotherapy to be considered in scenarios where patients are prone to infections.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f029bc1-2e34-4717-86dd-aefc28b52bb0\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16740"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>André Simoes<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mihil Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy Lane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Illingworth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Edwards<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Istvan Kovacs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Koslowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Nussbaumer<\/i><\/presenter>.

While allogeneic CAR-T can reduce delays in patient treatment, they require extensive manipulation of donor cells, severe lymphodepletion and demonstrate short persistence limiting their therapeutic window.<br \/>The UltraCAR-T<b>&#174;<\/b> platform is designed to overcome these limitations by utilizing non-viral multigene delivery and a rapid, decentralized manufacturing process without <i>ex vivo<\/i> activation or expansion of T cells. Patient&#8217;s own T cells are collected and manufactured at the medical center and re-infused one day after gene transfer.<br \/>Here we describe the next generation UltraCAR-T platform that addresses the inhibitory tumor microenvironment by incorporating a novel mechanism for intrinsic downregulation of one or more checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) genes. Our design achieves intrinsic CPI blockade without gene editing and is aimed at avoiding systemic toxicity and the high cost of combining CPI antibodies. Next generation UltraCAR-T cells simultaneously express CAR, membrane bound IL-15 (mbIL15), kill switch, and incorporate intrinsic CPI blockade.<br \/>To illustrate the ability of this platform, we designed exemplary non-viral transposons to generate UltraCAR-T cells against multiple tumor targets incorporating intrinsic blockade of either one (PD-1) or two (PD-1 and TIGIT) CPI genes. Healthy donor T cells were transfected using the UltraPorator&#8482; electroporation system to manufacture UltraCAR-T cells without <i>ex vivo<\/i> activation or expansion. The co-expression of CAR, mbIL15 and kill switch was confirmed by flow cytometry and western blot. Activated UltraCAR-T showed significant reduction in CPI gene expression compared to control CAR-T cells lacking the CPI blockade and did not show unintended off-target activity. Downregulation of CPI gene(s) on UltraCAR-T enhanced cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine production, especially at low effector to target (E:T) cell ratios, when co-cultured with PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD155<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells.

The top hits were components of the CDK8 kinase module of the Mediator complex, an evolutionarily conserved regulator of gene transcription. CDK8 kinase module deficient CAR-T cells manifest increased expansion, cytokine production, metabolic fitness, effector function, anti-tumor activity and reduced terminal effector differentiation. CDK8 kinase module deficient CAR-T cells showed widespread but selective increases in chromatin accessibility, MED1 chromatin occupancy, and H3K27 acetylation most notably involving transcription factors that play a critical role in T cell fate, including several STAT and AP1 family members. The most pronounced enhancement was observed for STAT5 which manifested as increased sensitivity to IL-2 in CDK8 kinase module deficient CAR-T cells. These results link Mediator induced transcriptional coactivation with T cell effector programming and identify the CDK8 kinase module as a target for enhancing the potency of anti-tumor T cell responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e86c722f-b795-4b4d-831e-c567ce4ee489\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CDK8,CRISPR,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16742"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katherine A.

However, prominent barriers including poor T cell effector function, lack of proliferation, and limited CAR T cell persistence have prevented CAR T cell therapies from reaching their full curative potential, especially in solid tumors. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent stimulator of T cell proliferation, survival, and cytotoxic function, thereby making it an attractive cytokine to support CAR T cell therapy. However, therapeutic use of IL-2 is limited by systemic toxicity due its promiscuous activation of undesired immune cell populations, including non-tumor reactive T cells and NK cells.<br \/>To facilitate selective ex vivo and in vivo expansion of engineered T cells we have developed a human orthogonal (ortho) ligand\/receptor system consisting of a IL-2 mutein (STK-009) that does not significantly stimulate cells expressing wild type IL-2 receptor and a mutated IL-2 Receptor Beta (orthoIL-2R&#946;) that responds to STK-009 but not wild type IL-2. This system enables <i>in vivo<\/i> IL-2 signaling in engineered cells that express the orthoIL-2R&#946; while avoiding stimulation of native T cells and NK cells. Previously, we demonstrated the ability of the STK-009\/orthoIL-2R&#946; receptor pair to selectively enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of orthoIL-2R&#946; (hoRb) expressing CD19 CAR T cells (SYNCAR-001) in preclinical lymphoma mouse models. We also demonstrated that STK-009 is selective for the orthoIL-2R&#946; expressing cells and therefore in a non-human primate model does not stimulate native T or NK cells.<br \/>Here, we demonstrate the ability of the STK-009\/hoRb system to enhance the anti-tumor activity and persistence of anti-glypican 3 (GPC3) CAR T cells. GPC3 overexpression is associated with various malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pediatric sarcomas, and non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Clinical trials of GPC3 CAR T therapy are ongoing, but early data suggests a need to boost CAR T cell function and persistence to achieve significant clinical responses. We incorporated the hoRb downstream of an anti-GPC3_28z CAR via a T2A cleavage peptide (SYNCAR-002). In vivo, STK-009 administration enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of SYNCAR-002 in highly aggressive subcutaneous and intraperitoneal HCC models. STK-009 treatment resulted in significant expansion of SYNCAR-002 and drove infiltration of SYNCAR-002 into tumors. STK-009 treatment also induced intratumoral granzyme B<sup>+<\/sup> and IFN-&#947;<sup>+<\/sup> production by SYNCAR-002 indicating activation of effector T cell function.<br \/>These findings validate that the orthogonal IL-2 platform has the potential to improve the efficacy and durability of CAR T therapy for solid tumor targets such as GPC3 by selectively expanding CAR-T cells in vivo, driving CAR-T cells into the tumor, and activating CAR-T cells in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c02c86f-50ea-4d6c-93af-e409edca82c2\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Solid tumors,Adoptive cell therapy,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16745"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul-Joseph Aspuria<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Semana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandro Vivona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahalaksmi Ramadass<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Navneet Ratti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Romina Riener<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Bauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammed Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepti Rokkam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rob A.

While advances in therapy have improved patient outcomes, the majority of patients relapse. Clinical trials have shown that BCMA targeted CAR-T therapy induces MM remission in most patients with heavily pretreated relapsed refractory MM; however, the duration of the response has been disappointing. CAR-T cells induce target cell death through two primary mechanisms, granzyme B and FASL. To define the role of FAS-induced cell death in CAR-T therapy in MM, we first evaluated if FAS-induced cell death was important for CAR-T activity in MM. We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 to generate FAS KOs in three MM cell lines: RPMI8226, KMS18, and OCIMY5. These lines were utilized in vitro in cytotoxic CAR-T assays where MM cells were cultured with BMCA CAR-T cells at five effector to target (E:T) ratios (range: 0:1 to 1:1). The loss of FAS protected KMS18 and OCIMY5 from CAR-T induced cell death, changing the E:T ratio needed to induce 50% MM cell death 3.2 and 3.4 fold respectively, but did not protect RPMI8226. We determined the expression of FAS negatively correlated with the EC50 of rFASL, suggesting that FAS expression levels are important for this response. To determine the role of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in FASL-induced death, we knocked out BAK and BAX in KMS12 PE and OCIMY5. This did not protect KMS12 PE or OCIMY5 from rFASL-induced cell death, suggesting that FAS uses the type I mitochondria-independent pathway in these cell lines. The BMM supports MM progression and promotes drug resistance in part by altering the apoptotic threshold. Therefore, we examined the impact of the BMM on FASL-induced cell death. Coculture of MM cells with the HS5 stromal cell line protected KSM12 PE and KMS18 from rFASL, with the EC50 of rFASL changing 2.72 and 3.1 fold respectively, but did not protect OCIMY5. To determine if the protection observed was cell contact dependent, or only required soluble factors, we utilized HS5 conditioned media (CM). HS5 CM protected KMS12 PE, KMS18, and surprisingly OCIMY5 from rFASL, causing a change in EC50 from control of 1.65 - 2.23 fold. CM lacking IL6 did not protect MM cells from rFASL. Therefore, we tested the effects of IL6 addition IL6(10 ng\/ml) and observed protection from rFASL in KMS12 PE and KMS18 cells with a change in EC50 of 2.03 and 3.84 fold respectively; however, we did not see protection in OCIMY5. To identify the mechanism of IL6-induced resistance to rFASL, we cultured BAK\/BAX KO cells in HS5 CM and observed protection of these apoptosis-deficient KMS12 PE and OCIMY5 cells from rFASL. This suggests that soluble factors in the BMM can convert cells from type I to type II (mitochondrial-dependent) death receptor signaling and that inhibiting BMM signals such as IL6 may enhance FASL-induced cell death in MM. However, the data also demonstrate that the role of FAS in CAR-T killing is cell context dependent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d3954a07-c363-4a83-a8f0-b1d669977b27\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Fas,Interleukin-6,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16746"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James C.

We have developed an inhibitory CAR platform (iCAR) that imposes self-regulation in CAR T-cells to restrict inappropriate activation against normal cells without compromising tumor efficacy. The system consists of an iCAR that is co-expressed with a conventional activating CAR (aCAR) designed to activate T-cells. The iCAR and aCAR scFvs bind distinct cell-surface antigens that are ubiquitously expressed across all solid tumor histologies and normal tissues. The iCAR is allele-specific whereas the aCAR is pan-allelic. The iCAR technology was validated in functional assays and NSG models with cancer cell lines that mimic loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) which is common in most human cancers due to increased chromosomal instability. In this context, loss of iCAR target expression due to LOH generates irreversible target specificity. Tumor-specific overexpression of aCAR and iCAR targets, a common barrier to the clinical translation of potent agents targeting the cell-surface proteins is not required. We have shown using in vitro and in vivo models that CAR T-cell activation and target killing are fully inhibited by dual iCAR + aCAR antigen engagement. This outcome validates the concept of iCAR-mediated protection of normal cells in vital organs. In contrast, tumors that mimic iCAR target LOH through CRISPR editing were fully eradicated with aCAR engagement alone. T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic activity after exposure to target cells lacking iCAR target antigen was found to be quantitatively indistinguishable from the results obtained with single input aCAR CAR T-cells. These results suggest that iCAR technology can enable treatment of cancer patients with solid tumors using CAR T-cells that maximize potency and efficacy by mitigating on-target CRS, neurotoxicity, and inevitable organ damage. The restriction of CAR T activation to the local tumor environment by iCAR-mediated self-regulation directly addresses a fundamental technology gap that cannot be solved by CAR T dosing or aCAR modification alone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/800df46b-b68b-435f-b715-204fbbcb6bfe\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Loss of heterozygosity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16747"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael R.

For this, we insert and express a neoepitope-specific T cell receptor (neoTCR) from the endogenous locus while simultaneously abolishing the expression of endogenous TCR. This results in neoTCR-specific T cells in which neoTCR expression is naturally regulated and not impeded by competition for CD3 by the endogenous TCR.<br \/>We furthermore designed a system to additionally express CD8 coreceptor along with the neoTCR on the same RNA transcript from the native TCR promoter. Both methods, currently in clinical testing, allow for the timely generation of several billion T cells expressing neoTCRs using our GMP cell manufacturing procedure. Nevertheless, the suppressive nature of some tumor microenvironments may require cells engineered with further modifications for long lasting therapeutic outcomes in certain patients. Here we describe how the flexibility of a non-viral system allows for additional complex modifications in a single step.<br \/>First, we demonstrate an additional gene knock-out in the TGFBR2 gene with simultaneous TCR replacement, making the engineered cells resistant to the immunosuppressive effects of TGF-&#946; while still maintaining neoepitope-specific recognition of the tumor.<br \/>Second, we demonstrate knock-down in addition to TCR replacement. For some targets, reduction of gene expression may be favored over complete knock-out. Accordingly, we have designed an shRNA expression construct that can efficiently knock-down transcript levels of a given gene in cells expressing the neoTCR without the generation of additional double-stranded breaks, allowing for enhanced T cell function in the absence of additional genomic breaks.<br \/>Third, we demonstrate a non-viral knock-in strategy to express transgenes with transcriptional regulation independent from the neoTCR. This strategy generates a product from which two genes, the neoTCR plus an additional transgene regulated by its own promoter, can be precision genome engineered into the same cell using homology directed templates that far exceed the size limitations of AAV. This technology can be successfully applied for the expression of intracellular, secreted, and membrane-bound proteins as well as proteins expressed only during the activated T cell state.<br \/>In conclusion, our single-step non-viral precision genome engineering technology is highly versatile with the ability to knock-out, knock-down, knock-in, and precisely regulate additional genes in a single step. These modifications have the potential to expand the applicability of T cell drug products and are broadly applicable to a variety of other cellular therapies and research models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8367c8b1-ace1-4aef-a68c-8946f8f94858\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Homologous recombination,shRNA,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16748"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>William Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Byers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles W.

However, logistical complexities associated with patient-specific CAR T-cell therapies often limit broad accessibility. Many of these challenges can be overcome with an allogeneic cellular product, but immune cell-mediated rejection of allogeneic cellular therapies remains a significant concern. Both allogeneic and autologous cell therapies currently rely on lymphodepleting conditioning to modulate the immune system and create greater access to homeostatic cytokines. However, protracted lympho-conditioning has been associated with poor immune reconstitution and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Therefore, an ideal allogeneic cell therapy would be able to avoid immune rejection while reducing or eliminating the need for chemotherapeutic conditioning to deplete host lymphocytes.<br \/>To address many of these challenges, we engineered our novel alloimmune defense receptor (ADR) that targets 41BB+ alloreactive immune cells while providing a CD3z signaling boost into our off-the-shelf iPSC derived NK cells expressing anti-CD19 CAR (CAR iNK). The ability of ADR+ CAR iNK cells to resist alloimmune rejection was tested by co-culturing ADR+ CAR iNK cells with allogeneic PBMCs from ten donors in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. Notably, ADR+ CAR iNK cells co-cultured with allogeneic PBMCs persisted to similar levels as the PBMC-free culture while ADR negative CAR iNK cells were eliminated when co-cultured with allogeneic PBMCs. Furthermore, all PBMC donors screened in ADR+ CAR iNK cell co-cultures showed ablation of reactive 41BB+ NK and T cells, with non-activated T cells remaining intact.<br \/>CAR iNK cells +\/- ADR were then compared in a Nalm6 disseminated in vivo model for anti-tumor efficacy. ADR+ CAR iNK cells and their ADR negative counterparts were found to equivalently control tumor. Building on this tumor model, we co-infused allogeneic T cells to mimic an immuno-competent setting. The data demonstrated that ADR negative CAR iNK cells were depleted and were unable to control tumor growth while significant levels of allogeneic T cells persisted. In contrast, ADR+ CAR iNK cells were able to resist allogeneic T cell attack, control tumor, and persist when compared to the ADR negative control.<br \/>Collectively, our preliminary data suggest that ADR-armed CAR iNK cells withstand immune cell-mediated rejection with uncompromised effector function. We are actively developing models to confirm our initial finding that ADR+ effector cells also benefit from their engagement with alloreactive cells in immuno-competent settings to promote enhanced anti-tumor responses, proliferation, and persistence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6abc1f7-6227-4852-ac53-0f7bbe883127\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: chronic lymphocytic,Stealth,immuno-evasion,allorejection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16749"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alan M.

Using the ultra-sensitive imPACT Isolation Technology&#174;, antigen-experienced, neoE-specific CD8 T cells are captured from the blood of patients with solid cancers followed by cloning of the cognate, neoE-specific, MHC class I-restricted T cell receptors (neoTCRs). DNA-mediated (non-viral) precision genome engineering technology is then used to engineer autologous CD8 and CD4 T cells to express the neoTCR. We have further built upon this platform to modify neoTCR-T cells to address potential sources for tumor immune evasion.<br \/>The versatility of this single-step gene editing platform is demonstrated here by the presentation of a neoTCR T cell product with knockout of endogenous TCR&#945; and TCR&#946; and the simultaneous expression of a neoTCR with CD8 co-receptor (CD8coR) from the same expression cassette along with knockout of TGF&#946; receptor 2 (TGFBR2). We have previously shown that CD8coR expression augments the activity of CD4 T cells engineered to express MHC class I restricted neoTCRs, by increasing CD4 neoTCR T cell helper and effector function. TGF&#946; is known to promote tumor growth, metastasis, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and to inhibit effector immune responses while promoting fibrosis and the differentiation of inhibitory cell types such as regulatory T cells. TGF&#946; is expressed by many tumor types and high TGF&#946; expression is associated with worse prognosis for several cancer subtypes including colorectal, lung and glioblastoma. TGFBR2 is a critical mediator of TGF&#946; signaling, resulting in potent, inhibitory effects on T cell function.<br \/>Our data show that simultaneous ablation of TGFBR2 signaling and expression of CD8coR was achieved with high efficiency, resulting in fully functional CD8 and CD4 neoTCR-T cells. Deletion of TGFBR2 with or without CD8coR expression, together with the expression of a neoE-targeted TCR preserved T cell effector function in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of TGF&#946;. Importantly, the combination of TGFBR2 knockout and CD8coR expression resulted in additive benefits, providing proof-of-concept for modifying two orthogonal features to improve neoTCR T cell function. Altogether, these results demonstrate the applicability of this versatile, precision genome engineering platform technology to yield enhanced, next-generation neoTCR-T cell therapies to expand the potential for clinical benefit in persons with solid cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55881b57-91b5-45ea-b9ba-187d334e48be\/@w03B8ZFK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,T cell,TGF-&#946;,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16750"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Charles W.

To overcome these hurdles, we screened a library of 171 pair-wise gene knockouts using CRISPR-Cas9 to identify gene pairs that confer greater proliferation and persistence with repetitive stimulation. Combined KO of FAS and PTPN2 led to a significant improvement in T cell effector function and proliferative capacity. FAS, the receptor for FASLG, is highly expressed on patient-derived T cells and has been shown to induce T cell apoptosis and limit T cell persistence in the TME. PTPN2 is a phosphatase, in which deletion increases T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. To develop this clinically, we generated CAR T cells with a shRNA module capable of multiplexed knockdown of both FAS and PTPN2. The FAS\/PTPN2 shRNA module protected T cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and resulted in a marked increase in T cell expansion over the course of a repetitive stimulation assay. Consistent with these observations, RNAseq analysis revealed enhanced transcriptome-wide signatures of cell cycle and T cell effector function. Finally, in a tumor xenograft model, CAR T cells containing FAS\/PTPN2 shRNA module demonstrated significantly improved tumor control in addition to increased cell numbers in circulation compared with CAR T cells expressing an irrelevant shRNA module.<br \/>The use of a multiplexed shRNA module is a powerful approach to improve T cell intrinsic functionality in cellular therapies, enabling: 1) tailored levels of inhibition of multiple key regulators of T cell biology with constitutive or antigen-gated expression, and 2) a method for genetic perturbations in T cells with reduced risk of toxicity or transformation compared with multiple DNA edits. The FAS\/PTPN2 shRNA module described here will be tested as a component of AB-1015, an integrated circuit T cell therapy for solid tumors expressing ALPG and mesothelin.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6da49e5-1145-4d79-88b6-36d860ec3b5d\/@x03B8ZFL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Preclinical,Fas,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16751"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Gagnon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam J.

We developed a mouse model to determine how to optimally implement anti-miHA T cell therapy, focusing on the key characteristics of anti-miHA TCRs that correlate with in vivo efficacy. We immunized B6 mice to the K<sup>b<\/sup>-restricted miHA H60 and used a high throughput approach to amplify TCR &#945;\/&#946; chains from single CD8<sup>+<\/sup> MHC Multimer-H60<sup>+<\/sup> (Tet<sup>H60+<\/sup>) cells. Based on &#946; chain sequencing of 472 single T cells, a broad repertoire was engaged by H60-vaccination, without a clear &#946; chain preference. We randomly chose 178 unique TCRs, cloned them into retroviral backbones and expressed them in a TCR<sup>-<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> NFAT-reporter reporter cell lines and screened for H60-reactivity by NFAT-induction after stimulation with H60-pulsed antigen presenting cells (APCs). We chose 22 unique TCRs that had clear H60-specific NFAT-induction for deeper characterization. In similarly-transduced 4G4 reporter cells, these TCRs spanned a range of surface expression levels, affinities for H60 as measured by Tet<sup>H60<\/sup> binding, and EC50s in response to H60-pulsed APCs (between 1 and 12 &#956;M peptide concentration). We focused initial functional studies on 2 high avidity TCRs (TCR 61 and TCR 167) with EC50s of 1.25 and 2.5 &#181;M, respectively. These were cloned into an optimized retroviral vector and transduced into B6 CD8 cells concomitant with efficient CRISPR-knock out of the endogenous TCR&#945;\/&#946; genes. Engineered T cells bound H60 loaded MHC multimers and killed H60<sup>+<\/sup> targets in vitro. The mean TCR expression of transduced cells was 16-30% of that in unmanipulated T cells, though some had TCR expression similar to or greater than that in unmanipulated T cells. We used TCR 61 and 167 transduced T cell products to treat H60<sup>+<\/sup> blast crisis leukemia cells (BC-CML). TCR 61 and 167 T cell products expanded and were equally effective at reducing BC-CML numbers in spleen and bone marrow (BM). Despite having a greater EC50 and equivalent surface expression in reporter cells, when recovered post-transplant, TCR167 cells had higher Tet<sup>H60 <\/sup>binding, and produced more IFN-&#947;. Ongoing studies are testing these and additional TCRs alone and in competition to better elucidate TCR properties that predict for in vivo efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb6501b3-ed30-44b3-8ef2-483d1269c9e1\/@x03B8ZFL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Retrovirus,Adoptive cell therapy,Leukemias,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16752"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander M.

GBM is categorized into IDH-mutant subtype and IDH-wildtype subtype, which is subcategorized into proneural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes, yet few personalized treatment options are available. The use of genetically modified chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), such as CD19 CAR-T, has shown significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of hematological malignancies due to specific antitumor response; however, CAR-T response in GBM has been poor. Single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) technology offers high-resolution profiling of different cell populations and their specific differential patterns. Accordingly, we developed a robust genomic analysis pipeline that can be applied to external datasets, tumor, and healthy samples. This was followed by unbiased systematic analysis of GBM tumor-specific cell surface markers using 18 single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) samples to identify GBM specific CAR-T targets allowing efficient tumor cells targeting and minimum off-target effects by CAR-T (1). We identified key potential targetable cell surface-specific markers and we also identified subtype-specific targets. Our findings provide insights into tumor-specific cell surface proteins that may be potential targets for engineered immunotherapy. References:(1) Wang, Liang-Bo, Alla Karpova, Marina A.
