[{"Abstract":"In higher eukaryotes, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, which is accomplished by an ensemble of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), is critical for cellular homeostasis. Unkempt (UNK) is an evolutionarily conserved Zinc Finger\/RING domain RNA-binding protein that was originally identified as a developmental regulator in <i>Drosophila<\/i><i>.<\/i><i> <\/i>Recent studies suggest that UNK targets specific mRNAs through its two compact zinc finger clusters and regulates their translation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which UNK represses translation remain unclear. To examine UNK interactions, we purified Flag-tagged UNK and subjected the preparations to Mass spectrometry (MS) and identified an enriched protein Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein(PABPC1) , a key component of the translation machinery that binds to the poly(A) tail of mRNAs to promote translation and mRNA turnover. GST Pull down assay and reciprocal immunoprecipitations in HEK293 cells further confirmed the strong interaction between UNK and PABPC1 and showed that the interaction is RNA-dependent. Notably, the structural analysis, along with mutational studies proved that the interaction is mediated by the C-terminal MLLE domain of PABPC1 and the C-terminal Domain of UNK both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Further MS2 tethering assay indicated that UNK inhibits PABPC1-stimulated translation activity. Our studies identified Unkempt as a novel partner of PABPC1 that functions to represses PABPC1-stimulated translation. The findings provide novel insight into the molecular function of Unkempt and PABPC1-mediated translational machinery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f730e5e2-7276-460c-b661-30821dc3af1f\/@v03B8ZJF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Post-transcriptional regulation,PABPC1,Unkempt,MLLE Domain,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16207"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Naren Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qinfang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yulan Xiong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianzhong Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, we found that SLFN12 is an RNase and PDE3A binding dramatically activates SLFN12 RNase activity, resulting in velcrin-mediated apoptosis. However, the mechanism of cancer cell death by the PDE3A-SLFN12 complex is poorly understood. In this study, we found that SLFN12 specifically recognizes tRNA-Leu-TAA and induces its cleavage in velcrin-sensitive cell lines. According to tRNA-sequencing, tRNA-Leu-TAA isodecoders decreases by 2-fold to 5-fold in Hela cells treated with DNMDP compared to DMSO control, while other tRNAs are not differentially expressed. Down-regulation of tRNA-Leu-TAA by velcrin treatment is observed only in velcrin-sensitive cell lines but not insensitive cell lines. Furthermore, we tested whether SLFN12 digests tRNA-Leu-TAA in vitro. Purified wild-type SLFN12 cleaves tRNA-Leu-TAA but not heat-denatured or catalytically inactive SLFN12. Even though tRNA-Leu-TAA is weakly digested by low concentrations of SLFN12, co-incubation with purified PDE3A increases SLFN12 RNase activity, which is even further upregulated by velcrin treatment. To verify specificity for tRNA-Leu-TAA, we assessed activity of SLFN12 against a panel of in vitro transcribed tRNAs. We found that purified SLFN12 is significantly more efficient at degrading tRNA-Leu-TAA when compared with tRNA-Leu-TAG or tRNAs for other amino acids. Digestion of tRNA-leu-TAA by SLFN12 could inhibit mRNA translation due to the delivery of leucine amino acid to elongating ribosomes. To test this hypothesis, we designed the mutant tRNA-Leu-[CAG:TAA] in which the anticodon of tRNA-Leu-CAG was replaced by TAA anticodon. Ectopic expression of wild-type tRNA-Leu-TAA or tRNA-Leu-CAG has no effect on viability of DNMDP-treated cells, whereas expression of tRNA-Leu-[CAG:TAA] genes partially rescues the cells from DNMDP-induced cytotoxicity. These data confirm that impaired leucine delivery is responsible at least in part for the observed effects of DNMDP treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f505a763-3069-4d62-b36c-d76caa7526e4\/@v03B8ZJF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,Apoptosis,Cancer cell,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16208"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sooncheol Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Hoyt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyun Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colin Garvie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph McGaunn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew D.

However, in Prostate Cancer (PCa), these cellular events are dysregulated upon significant changes in AR, such as AR overexpression, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which AR expression and function are controlled, we have explored the post-transcriptional regulatory RNA elements of AR, particularly the 3&#8217; untranslated region (UTR). The AR 3&#8217;UTR is 6.8 Kilobases (Kb) long, which indicates that this region is likely a site for multitudinous levels of post-transcriptional regulation. We found that the length of AR 3&#8217;UTR negatively correlates with AR expression, with the full length 3&#8217;UTR leading to the most downregulation of expression.

Recently, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) on both endothelial and tumor cells was demonstrated as one of the key mechanisms contributing to growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common subtype of lung cancer. VEGFR2 dependent signaling is critical both for tumor autocrine functions related to NSCLC migration, and in paracrine control of tumor angiogenesis through action on tumor-proximal endothelial cells, suggesting a potential mechanism for growth control. Several drugs targeting VEGFR2 signaling pathway demonstrated their clinical efficacy in NSCLC setting, including VEGFR2 and VEGF-A inhibitors, VEGF-A\/PIGF trap. Recently our group demonstrated that RNA-binding protein Musashi-2 (MSI2) is driving progression and metastasis of NSCLC. MSI2 regulates mRNA translation of multiple targets, its expression is upregulated in the metastasis-competent murine and human lung cancer cell lines and is progressively elevated in lung cancer samples. The goal of this study is to define the role of MSI2 in sustaining VEGFR2 signaling during NSCLC progression. Using reverse RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) qPCR analysis, we demonstrate that MSI2 directly binds VEGFR2 mRNA. Reverse protein phase array (RPPA) of several NSCLC cell line models with expression or knockdown of MSI2 and subsequent direct validation showed that MSI2 strongly and positively regulates expression of VEGFR2. Subsequent mechanistical analysis revealed that MSI2 knockdown leads to decreased VEGFR2 protein and mRNA levels expression in several NSCLC cell lines in vitro, resulting in increased apoptosis via inhibition of VEGFR2 signaling pathway. To better characterize MSI2 biology, we&#8217;ve crossed the B6\/129S4<i>-Msi2<sup>tm1.1Cjl<\/sup>\/J <\/i>(M2) mice with B6\/129S\/Sv-<i>Kras<sup>tm3Tyj<\/sup><\/i>\/J;<i>Trp53<sup>t<\/sup><\/i><sup>m1Brn<\/sup>\/J (KP) mice and generated novel B6\/129S\/Sv-<i>KP<\/i>;<i>Msi2<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>(KPM2) mouse model. Induction of tumorigenesis in KP mice using Cre adenovirus leads to development of lung adenocarcinoma. Induction of lung-specific Cre resulted in tumorigenesis in both KP and KPM2 mice. Interestingly, we observed significant decrease in both total lung tumor number and total lung tumor burden in KPM2 compared to KP mice. Next, we established three novel KP and KPM2 derived cell lines from mouse lung tumors and found that KPM2 cell lines demonstrate reduced proliferation capacity and VEGFR2 mRNA level relative to KP cell lines. Additional studies to understand an impact of MSI2 deletion in KP cell lines are ongoing. Taken together, MSI2 is a promising target for NSCLC treatment, as this protein regulates VEGFR2 signaling and apoptosis in cell models and contributes to KP tumorigenesis in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ec9ca92-de03-4767-a186-bc47df8b47fd\/@w03B8ZJG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Mouse models,Cell lines,Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16217"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Igor Bychkov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Deneka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iuliia Topchu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petr Makhov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Kudinov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Nikonova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Karanicolas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erica Golemis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Lengner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hossein Borghaei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jyoti Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanis Boumber<\/i><\/presenter>.

Through its A-to-I editing activity the p150 isoform of ADAR suppresses activation of dsRNA sensors involved in the innate immune response and translational repression. Recently, our laboratory has shown that p150-ADAR is required for the viability of a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, thus making p150-ADAR a strong therapeutic target for a disease that lacks targeted therapies. Unlike the p150 isoform, which is interferon inducible, the p110 isoform of ADAR is ubiquitously expressed and has not been shown to suppress dsRNA sensing. To date there is much less known about the role of p110-ADAR in cancer, though it is known to be highly expressed in breast cancer. To begin to explore the role of p110-ADAR in breast cancer, we turned to proximity labeling by APEX2 to identify proteins that may interact with p110-ADAR. Mass-spectrometry of proximity labeled proteins revealed numerous nuclear and nucleolar proteins with roles in multiple aspects of RNA biology, including processing of rRNA and ribosome biogenesis. Among the list of enriched proteins were eight members of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, including the nucleolar localized DDX54. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that p110-ADAR and DDX54 interact, furthermore both localize to nucleoli. Knockdown of DDX54 in non-TNBC cell lines (SK-BR-3 and MCF-7) caused apoptosis and reduced proliferation. Additionally, knockdown of DDX54 caused accumulation of dsRNA within the nucleolus and activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR. Knockdown of ADAR, which alone did not affect proliferation or phosphorylation of PKR in the above cell lines, synergized with DDX54 knockdown to cause increased cell death and further activation of PKR. ADAR knockdown did not synergize with knockdown of another ADAR-interacting DEAD-box helicase, DDX17, suggesting that the observed phenotype is not common to combined knockdown of ADAR and any RNA helicase. These findings suggest that combined inhibition\/depletion of ADAR and DDX54 may serve as therapeutic strategy for breast tumors, including those that are refractory to ADAR inhibition\/depletion alone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9e9782f4-7976-4909-88fa-82fdcd45e522\/@w03B8ZJG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,Translation,Innate immunity,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16219"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyle A.

The exact molecular effects of 4EBP1 activation in cancer are still unknown. Surprisingly, 4EBP1 is a target of genomic copy number gains (Chr. 8p11) in breast and lung cancer. We notice that 4EBP1 gains are genetically linked to gains in neighboring genes including WHSC1L1 and FGFR1. Our results show that FGFR1 gains act to attenuate the function of 4EBP1 via PI3K mediated phosphorylation at Thr37\/46, Ser65, and Thr70 sites. This implies that not 4EBP1 but instead FGFR1 is the genetic target of Chr. 8p11 gains in breast and lung cancer. Accordingly, these tumors show increased sensitivity to FGFR1 and PI3K inhibition and this is a therapeutic vulnerability through restoring the tumor-suppressive function of 4EBP1. Ribosome profiling reveals genes involved in insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and inositol pathway to be the relevant translational targets of 4EBP1. These mRNAs are among the top 200 translation targets and are highly enriched for structure and sequence motifs in their 5&#8217;UTR that depends on the 4EBP1-EIF4E activity. In summary, we identify the translational targets of 4EBP1-EIF4E that facilitate the tumor suppressor function of 4EBP1 in cancer. @font-face \u0009{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \u0009panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \u0009mso-font-charset:0; \u0009mso-generic-font-family:roman; \u0009mso-font-pitch:variable; \u0009mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \u0009{font-family:Calibri; \u0009panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \u0009mso-font-charset:0; \u0009mso-generic-font-family:swiss; \u0009mso-font-pitch:variable; \u0009mso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \u0009{mso-style-unhide:no; \u0009mso-style-qformat:yes; \u0009mso-style-parent:\"\"; \u0009margin:0in; \u0009mso-pagination:widow-orphan; \u0009font-size:12.0pt; \u0009font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \u0009mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \u0009mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \u0009mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \u0009mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \u0009mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \u0009mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \u0009mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \u0009mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault \u0009{mso-style-type:export-only; \u0009mso-default-props:yes; \u0009font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \u0009mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \u0009mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \u0009mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \u0009mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \u0009mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \u0009mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \u0009mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \u0009mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \u0009{page:WordSection1;}","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10b17c87-8967-48c0-947d-c571e181280e\/@w03B8ZJG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,EIF4E,Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16221"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kamini Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prathibha Mohan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viraj R.

We previously determined that SLFN12 is an RNase, that PDE3A binding upregulates SLFN12 RNase activity, and that SLFN12 RNase activity is required for velcrin response.<br \/>Here, we report that the depletion of tRNA-Leu-TAA by velcrin treatment induces ribosome pausing at Leu-TTA codons and global inhibition of protein synthesis. We performed ribosome profiling in HeLa cells treated with DMSO or DNMDP and found that ribosome footprints containing Leu-TTA codons at the A-site of the ribosome were significantly more abundant in DNMDP-treated cells than in cells treated with DMSO, indicating a pausing or stalling of ribosomes at Leu-TTA upon velcrin treatment. Although the overall number of ribosome pausing sites across the transcriptome was doubled by DNMDP treatment, ribosome pausing at Leu-TTA was increased &#38;gt 1000-fold, also resulting in an increased number of genes with TTA pause sites.<br \/>Even though Leu-TTA is a rare codon, over 70% of all transcripts contain at least one TTA codon, implying that ribosome pausing at TTA codons could directly impact many genes. Genes with TTA pause sites most enriched upon velcrin treatment prominently include those involved in control of mRNA translation and protein homeostasis. These results imply that, in addition to direct effects on mRNA translation due to ribosome pausing, indirect effects could occur due to decreased availability of particular components of the translation machinery, resulting in a widespread impact on protein synthesis. To test our hypothesis, we measured the effects of velcrin treatment on nascent protein abundance. Treatment of HeLa cells with DNMDP resulted in downregulation of newly synthesized proteins, whereas no significant changes in total protein content were observed. Downregulation of protein translation was observed only in velcrin-sensitive cell lines, indicating that inhibition of protein translation could be the mechanism of action of cancer cell killing by PDE3A-SLFN12 complex formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c0c72b0-a482-414e-853c-04e8a5cf0b59\/@w03B8ZJG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Translation,Apoptosis,RNA,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16222"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephanie Hoyt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sooncheol Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph McGaunn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Cherniack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Meyerson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heidi Greulich<\/i><\/presenter>.

Standard of care treatment for PDAC consists of a cocktail of harsh chemotherapies, which have improved overall survival by only a few percentage points - to a 5-year survival rate of 10%. One commonly deregulated pathway in PDAC is c-MYC (MYC), a potent transcription factor. MYC plays an important role in tumor progression and its deregulation has been correlated with tumor aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance in PDAC and other cancers. Recently, oncogenic MYC expression has been shown to regulate elements of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in mouse models of multiple cancers. In PDAC, MYC&#8217;s expression has been linked to a desmoplastic immune suppressive TME, yet the specific mechanism has yet to be described. Here, in order to better model the disease and to interrogate questions of <i>how <\/i>MYC regulates the tumor immune and stromal microenvironment, we have generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC. Our model (KMC<sup>ERT2<\/sup>) has inducible Cre-driven expression of both mutant Kras and low deregulated Myc in the pancreas. We have found that deregulated MYC cooperates with KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> in the adult pancreas to drive PDAC in our inducible KMC<sup>ERT2<\/sup> mouse model and that our model recapitulates inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity seen within clinical PDAC populations as well as consistent metastasis to liver in both spontaneous and orthotopic transplant settings. Currently, a majority of murine studies of PDAC are performed using an embryonic Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>- and p53 loss\/mutant-driven PDAC model (KPC). In contrast to the KPC model, our inducible KMC<sup>ERT2<\/sup>&#173; model of PDAC displays genetic changes, such as CDKN2A and SMAD4 loss, comparable to human disease. Interestingly, multiplexed immunohistochemistry analysis of immune cell composition of spontaneous KMC<sup>ERT2<\/sup> tumors compared to the commonly used KPC shows an increased density of antigen presenting cells (APCs) within MYC-driven tumors. Human PDAC is often resistant to standard of care therapies such as gemcitabine and FOLFIRINOX. Orthotopic therapeutic studies using our KMC<sup>ERT2<\/sup> cell lines demonstrate a similar resistance to these therapies. To further understand the mechanisms underlying our observed phenotypes, we have conducted RNAseq and DNA sequencing on both microdissected autochthonous tumor specimens and KMC<sup>ERT2<\/sup> tumor-derived cell lines. Together, this work investigates the role of deregulated MYC expression in metastatic behavior, immune phenotypes, and therapeutic response in murine PDAC. It also provides both spontaneous and orthotopic mouse models of PDAC that recapitulate the heterogeneous and highly metastatic nature of the human disease, allowing for important therapeutic testing opportunities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/33d687fe-4d1e-41dc-a908-e42e163a7641\/@w03B8ZJG\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Metastasis,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16223"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isabel A.

Even within the era of novel therapeutics and improved diagnostic screening, mortality rates remain stable, with an estimated 43,600 deaths occurring in 2021 alone. Malignant transformation of breast cancer to advanced disease is the mainstay driver of mortality and is largely attributed to treatment resistance. Fortunately, identification of therapeutic resistance mechanisms has rapidly transformed our understanding of cancer evasion and is enabling personalized treatment guidance and regimens. Notably, mutations and amplifications of the estrogen receptor (ER, <i>ESR1<\/i>) remain a prominent source of endocrine therapy resistance. Two-thirds of all breast cancer are positive for ER, making it an attractive druggable target that has revolutionized patient care. Unfortunately, however, 30% of tumors exposed to endocrine therapy subsequently develop resistance. Recently identified ER fusion proteins, discovered in metastatic endocrine resistant disease, result in substitution of the C-terminal ER ligand binding domain with a variety of fused in-frame gene partners due to genomic translocations occurring at <i>ESR1 <\/i>intron 6. Our lab has demonstrated that ER fusion proteins drive robust ER hyperactivation and metastatic potential independent of ER ligand estradiol and in the presence of endocrine therapies such as Fulvestrant. Overexpression of ER fusion proteins, particularly <i>ESR1-SOX9<\/i> and <i>ESR1-YAP1<\/i>, in invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinoma models with endogenous ER knockdown, resulted in enhanced 3D growth, increased migration by wound scratch assay, enhanced colony formation as a proxy of survival and ER pathway hyperactivation. Targeted endogenous ER knockdown utilizing short hairpin RNA enhances fusion driven phenotypes that are unique to fusion partner proteins and cellular context. ER fusion prevalence in advanced breast cancer remains a challenge due to the promiscuous fusion partners disrupting traditional sequencing techniques. Our group has developed a novel method of <i>ESR1 <\/i>fusion detection, <i>EnRich<\/i>, which exploits the <i>ESR1 <\/i>fusion breakpoints. Importantly, we have assessed <i>EnRich <\/i>fusion discovery with the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from non-invasive liquid biopsies. Our pilot study of 15 blood ctDNA samples detected three different ESR1 fusion gene products which have been further validated by PCR. <i>EnRich<\/i> will help us identify and monitor treatment resistance of known and novel <i>ESR1 <\/i>fusions in patient samples irrespective of treatment regime as well as in longitudinal samples collected from patients undergoing endocrine therapy. The <i>in vitro <\/i>resistant properties of fusion proteins emphasize the necessity to better detect these mutations in patients with advanced disease and determine more appropriate treatment measures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f9432a38-b04c-475a-b9e6-2a9c819b5cd5\/@w03B8ZJG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,Metastatic tumors,Fusion proteins,Endocrine resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16243"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Megan E.

Alternative RNA splicing at the 3` end gives rise to multiple C-terminal isoforms, but their function is largely unknown. To address this, CRISPR was used to knock out exon 12 (<i>E12<\/i>) in several cell lines and mice, leading to isoform switching from p73&#945; to p73&#945;1. p73&#945;1 is a novel isoform whose expression we detected in multiple cancer cell lines. We found that knockout of<i> E12<\/i> inhibits the cell proliferation and migration abilities of H1299 and MIA PaCa-2 cancer cells and <i>E12<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> MEFs exhibit increased cellular senescence. Similarly, ectopic expression of p73&#945;1 in H1299 cells suppresses cell proliferation and knockdown of p73&#945;1 restores the cell proliferative and migratory capacities of H1299 <i>E12<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells. Consistently, we found that <i>E12<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice are not prone to spontaneous tumors, unlike <i>Trp73<\/i><sup>+\/- <\/sup>mice, but instead are prone to chronic systemic inflammation and show elevated IL-1&#946; and IL-6 expression in inflamed tissues. We then identified Notch1, a master regulator of the inflammatory response, as a mediator of p73&#945;1-induced inflammation and tumor suppression, and found it to be elevated in inflamed <i>E12<sup>+\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mouse tissues. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of Notch1 enhances cell proliferation and migration in H1299 <i>E12<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells. Together, these data suggest that p73&#945;1 plays a role in the inflammatory response and tumor suppression via Notch1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a2321a01-9bd2-4244-81c8-b69fce15154f\/@w03B8ZJG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p73,Inflammation,Tumor suppressor gene,Notch-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16244"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyra Laubach<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenshen Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangmudong Kong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingyi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinbin Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

SF3B1 is a protein component of the spliceosome responsible for recognizing intronic splice sites and stabilizing the interaction between the spliceosome and pre-mRNA transcripts. Hotspot mutations in <i>SF3B1 <\/i>result in a neomorphic protein that causes aberrant splicing of hundreds of transcripts. These transcriptional alterations have several proposed impacts on known cancer pathways; however, the mechanisms by which <i>SF3B1<\/i> mutations contribute to tumorigenesis are incompletely understood. Interestingly, systematic analysis of online cancer databases shows <i>SF3B1 <\/i>mutations and <i>TP53 <\/i>alterations are mutually exclusive in cancers with predominant <i>SF3B1<\/i> hotspots, suggesting either synthetic lethality or overlapping roles in promoting tumorigenesis. To address this question, <i>TP53<\/i> was knocked-out using CRISPR-Cas9 in AAV-generated <i>SF3B1<\/i> K700E mutant knock-in and wild type MCF-10A breast epithelial cells. Successful generation of <i>TP53<\/i> knock-outs in both the <i>SF3B1<\/i> mutant and wild type groups suggests the mutations are unlikely to be synthetic lethal. Instead, this finding may direct us to novel mechanisms by which <i>SF3B1<\/i> mutations contribute to cancer development and progression. Two overarching areas of interest based on preliminary data include changes in mitochondrial metabolism and metabolic reprogramming and alterations in DNA damage, repair, and genomic stability. Further defining the relationship between mutant <i>SF3B1 <\/i>and <i>TP53 <\/i>may reveal new mechanisms of tumorigenesis and reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities that can be additionally leveraged against the large subset of cancers with <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/10f4ad58-225f-4cdf-89e2-f08f01b243c0\/@x03B8ZJH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,TP53,CRISPR\/Cas9,SF3B1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16245"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Riley Bergman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ben Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Croessmann<\/i><\/presenter>.

Given estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) and beta (ER&#946;) exert opposing actions, it is unclear how estrogen actions control PCa growth. The OSU Drug Development Institute developed a novel, highly selective, ER&#946; ligand (OSU-ERB-12 (ERB12)) which has excellent <i>in vivo<\/i> PK\/PD properties.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A combination robotic high-throughput drug viability screen was undertaken in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-sensitive and resistant PCa cell models that combined multiple concentrations of ERB12 with 30 compounds including Enzalutamide (ENZA), and epigenomic regulators; potent combinations were examined by clonogenic assays. The ERB12 and ENZA combination was examined in 22RV1 by RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq and CRISPR-editing undertaken to delete ER&#945; or ERb.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> All cell lines (LNCaP, 22RV1, PC-3, and DU145) were sensitive to high doses of ERB12 alone (1-10&#956;M) whereas each cell line displayed unique responses to ERB12 drug interactions. 22RV1 cells responded with the greatest additive effects to combinations with ENZA and HDAC or DNMT inhibitors. Clonogenic assays also demonstrated significant suppression of colony formation by ERB12 combined with all three classes of drug. Also, 22RV1 cells with CRISPR-deleted ER&#945; grew slower whereas faster with ER&#946; deletion. ATAC-Seq in 22RV1 cells revealed that the combination of ENZA (1&#956;M) with ERB12 (100nM), but not 17b-estradiol (E2) + ENZA), led to unique gain of nucleosome free (NF) regions enriched for nuclear receptor motifs (e.g. AR, RARa, PPARa) and loss of CTCF motifs. These regions also significantly overlapped with ChromHMM-defined Active and Poised Enhancers. Parallel RNA-Seq also identified a unique ERB12\/ENZA-dependent transcriptome significantly associated with repression of androgen and MYC signaling. MYC repression was confirmed at the protein level. Integration of ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq data revealed antagonism between ERB12 and E2 treatments notably with ERB12\/ENZA leading to gain of NF regions and increased expression of coregulators (e.g. <i>RUNX1<\/i> and <i>NCOA3<\/i>) that were repressed by E2\/ENZA. Finally, transcript-aware analyses identified unique and common ERB12\/ENZA driven splice variation including coregulators <i>NCOR2<\/i> and <i>PRAME.<\/i><br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data suggest that there is a cooperative action between ERB12 and ENZA in limiting cell proliferation and altering nucleosome positioning and leading to a unique transcriptome. ERB12, is an orally-available and well-tolerated drug that appears to antagonize the AR driven signaling pathways that lead to lethal prostate cancer. We propose that ERB12 could allow patients to take a lower, and more well-tolerated dose of ADT drugs, which at high dose can be very harsh on patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/256549ca-4f5f-4b8e-a134-e351ced96315\/@x03B8ZJH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor &#946;,Enzalutamide,Advanced cancer,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16246"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jaimie S.
