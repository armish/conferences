Almost 70% of patients succumb to their disease within five years of diagnosis. This is due to the fact that most HGSCs are diagnosed at late stage, and because there are few effective therapies beyond standard chemotherapy. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibody-based therapies, which have had success in other solid tumor types, have had little to no effect in HGSC despite the tumors harboring a sometimes significant immune infiltrate. Data from other tumor types suggests that regardless of the number or type of immune cells present in the tumor, it is actually the cellular state of the T and natural killer (NK) cells present that matters. Solid tumors are known to induce a state of dysfunction in T cells called exhaustion which is stably maintained in the cells by specific epigenetic changes in the genome. NK cells have also been demonstrated to be dysfunctional in solid tumors. It is not clear if this type of dysfunction is present in T and NK cells in HGSC and if this prevents ICB response in these tumors. Much work in immune therapy has focused on reversing T cell exhaustion to enhance response to ICB agents. However, besides T cells, HGSCs also have a significant NK cell infiltrate. NK cells are innate immune cells which can directly kill tumor cells without the receptor specificity of T cells, making them critical to engage in any anti-tumor immune response. Little is known about NK cell biology in HGSC, making these immune cells an unexplored immune therapy target. A better understanding of NK cell biology and the role of NK cell dysfunction in the HGSC response to immune therapies is needed. Organoid co-cultures containing matched tumor and immune cells from the same tumor represent a human model that can be studied over time upon immune therapy treatment to ask questions about immune therapy efficacy and mechanism of action and have been used for this purpose in other tumor types. My lab has generated culture conditions and functional assays to study the anti-tumor immune response in novel HGSC organoid\/immune cell co-cultures and has recently published this work in<i> Cancer Research<\/i> (Wan et al, Cancer Research 2021, PMID: 33158814) in a paper on which I am last and corresponding author. These co-cultures are generated by obtaining solid tumors directly from the operating room, mechanically dissociating them, and plating the tumor organoids and matched immune cells in media containing an ICB agent or other immune therapy to study its effects on every immune cell in the culture in a physiologic environment. As a quality control when initially setting up these co-cultures, the parent tumor and organoid co-cultures were compared by multiple modalities to ensure that the co-cultures were faithful models of the tumors from which they were derived. Flow cytometry analysis comparing immune composition of parent tumors vs. untreated organoid co-cultures from ten patients<b> <\/b>demonstrates that the organoid co-cultures contain all immune cell types present in the parent tumor with a slight decrease in macrophages. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of viable CD45+ cells from a single parent tumor and matched organoid co-culture was also performed. The single cell sequencing demonstrates similar annotation of all immune cell types in the organoid co-culture. Knowing that the co-cultures were accurate models of their parent tumors, we then performed a battery of functional and sequencing based analyses on these co-cultures to assess mechanisms of ICB function in the physiologic tumor microenvironment. We tested these co-cultures for immune upregulation after treatment with multiple ICB antibody therapies. We found that the ICB antibodies inducing the strongest immune activation in the cultures caused an increase in interferon gamma and cytotoxicity markers in CD8 and NK cells. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the most effective ICB antibodies were causing 1) a state change in CD8 T cells from na&#239;ve to progenitor exhausted and 2) a significant downregulation of a protein called BRD1 most strongly in NK cells. BRD1, together with HBO1, forms a histone acetyltransferase complex known to regulate the total acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 14 in CD8 T cell and hematopoietic cell development. Its role in NK cell function was not previously known. Given our findings showing that BRD1 downregulation correlated with increased immune activity, we hypothesized that BRD1 inhibition may be a way to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in HGSC, in particular by engaging NK cells. To test this hypothesis, we obtained a BRD1 inhibitor, BAY299, and tested it in HGSC organoid co-cultures looking for immune activation. Previously this agent had not been considered as an immune therapy, and bromodomain containing proteins had largely been viewed as tumor intrinsic targets. <i>In vitro<\/i>, BAY299 either alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 antibody leads to increased immune activation, as indicated by increased interferon gamma production induced by BAY299 alone or the BAY299-ICB combinations over controls. Flow cytometry analysis indicates that this increased activity is in both T and NK cells. TIM3 and PD-1 are both markers of immune cell dysfunction, and TIM3\/PD-1 co-expressing cells are thought to be exhausted and non-functional. In HGSC organoid co-cultures treated with either DMSO or BAY299, we observed that the BAY299 treatment led to a decrease in the number of TIM3 and PD-1 single positive and TIM3\/PD-1 double positive CD8 and NK cells, indicating that BAY299 may cause a cell state change from an exhausted to an active phenotype and supporting our hypothesis that BRD1 inhibition may lead to enhanced anti-tumor immune function in HGSC. To discern the mechanism of this increased immune activation in particular in engaging NK cells, we treated an NK cell line, KHYG1, with either vehicle or the BRD1 inhibitor and performed both bulk RNA and ATAC sequencing on the treated cells. The ATAC sequencing revealed that the BRD1 inhibitor was causing the chromatin in the NK cells to open or close at binding sites of major immune regulatory transcription factors and that these chromatin changes corresponded to downregulation of genes associated with NK cell immaturity, thus suggesting a reason for the state change in NK cells to a mature, active, and cytotoxic phenotype. These post-BRD1 inhibitor chromatin changes corresponded to a post-BRD1 inhibitor increase in interferon production, an increase in cytotoxic surface marker expression, and an increase in tumor cell killing by KHYG1 cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. To validate BRD1 inhibitors as a possible small molecule immune therapy for ovarian cancer, we performed <i>in vivo <\/i>studies in a syngeneic HGSC mouse model and demonstrated <i>in<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i> BAY299 anti-tumor immune efficacy. We also performed flow cytometry on immune cells from vehicle and BAY299 treated tumors and found that the CD8 T and NK cells from both ascites and solid tumors from BAY299 treated animals demonstrated decreased exhaustion marker expression compared to vehicle treated controls, thereby validating our <i>in vitro<\/i> findings. Our work highlights the fact that NK cells are critical but under-targeted players in the HGSC anti-tumor immune response and that organoid\/immune cell co-cultures are an ideal system in which to gain a better understanding of NK cell function in HGSC. We have now moved forward utilizing these organoid co-cultures along with donor NK cells to better understand NK cell biology within the HGSC tumor microenvironment through functional and transcriptomic assays. We hope to begin to develop new NK cell targeting therapies with paired biomarkers, including BRD1 inhibitors, for ovarian cancer which is a notoriously difficult to treat tumor type that has not previously benefited from immune therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Organoids,Natural killer cells,BET bromodomain,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah J.
