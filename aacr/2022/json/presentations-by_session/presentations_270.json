KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitors have provided clinical proof of concept for targeting mutant KRAS. Preclinical data suggests inhibition of RAS(ON) may be a superior therapeutic strategy. In addition, KRAS<sup>G12<\/sup> mutations such as KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> remain unserved.RMC-6236 is a first-in-class, potent, oral tri-complex RAS<sup>MULTI<\/sup>(ON) small molecule inhibitor designed to treat cancers driven by a variety of RAS mutations. RMC-6236 non-covalently binds to an abundant intracellular chaperone protein, cyclophilin A (CypA), resulting in a binary complex that engages RAS(ON) to form a high-affinity, RAS-selective tri-complex that sterically inhibits RAS binding to effectors. Exposure to RMC-6236 suppressed ERK phosphorylation and cell growth, and induced apoptosis in multiple human RAS-addicted cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>.RMC-6236 induced dose-dependent, deep, and durable suppression of RAS pathway activation up to 48 hours in preclinical xenograft models in vivo. Prolonged exposure in tumors was observed relative to blood and various healthy tissues, likely mediated by high affinity binding of RMC-6236 to tumor CypA.RMC-6236 at tolerable doses induced profound and durable tumor regressions in multiple cell line-derived (CDX) and patient-derived (PDX) RAS<sup>MUT<\/sup> xenograft models, including NSCLC, CRC and PDAC. Anti-tumor activity was particularly notable in KRAS position 12 (G12X) mutant tumors, particularly KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>, and KRAS<sup>G12R<\/sup>, with significant tumor regressions observed. Tumor growth inhibition was durable even in tumors that did not regress. Intermittent scheduling of RMC-6236 was active and permitted a higher dose intensity than daily dosing.RMC-6236 promoted anti-tumor immunity <i>in vivo<\/i> and was additive with anti-PD1 antibodies, driving durable complete responses and immunologic memory in a KRAS mutant CRC model. Furthermore, RMC-6236 treatment reversed oncogenic RAS-driven immune evasion mechanisms in a checkpoint blockade refractory KRAS mutant model, significantly transforming the tumor microenvironment in favor of anti-tumor immunity.These preclinical results support the inclusion of NSCLC, PDAC, and CRC patients in our planned clinical trial of RMC-6236 in patients with KRAS<sup>G12X<\/sup> advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Small molecule inhibitor,KRAS,K-ras,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Elena S.

The resulting increased levels of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) in turn increase signaling output to initiate and support the oncogenic state. In recent years, a class of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitors has transformed the treatment landscape for patients with cancers bearing KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>. These inhibitors work via sequestration of the GDP-bound, inactive state, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF), starving cancer cells of their oncogenic driver, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON). Recent reports on the nature of resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitors suggest this class of drugs can be overcome through reactivation of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> to the ON form. Direct inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) with a first in class, potent, orally bioavailable, selective, tri-complex inhibitor RMC-6291, represents a more robust approach and presents the possibility that RMC-6291 will be a &#8216;best-in-class&#8217; inhibitor of tumors harboring KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>.<br \/>RMC-6291 is a potent covalent inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) that forms a tri-complex within tumor cells between KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) and cyclophilin A (CypA), a highly abundant immunophilin. The assembled tri-complex prevents KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) from signaling via steric blockade of RAS effector binding. In cells, kinetic analyses demonstrate near-immediate disruption of RAS effector binding and extinction of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) signaling.<br \/>Oral administration of RMC-6291 produces deep and durable suppression of RAS pathway activity in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumor models and drives profound tumor regressions <i>in vivo<\/i> at well-tolerated doses. In a mouse clinical trial consisting of multiple patient- and cell line-derived xenograft models of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> NSCLC, RMC-6291 outperformed adagrasib, a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitor, by increasing the number of responses, the depth of tumor regressions, and the durability of responses.<br \/>Combination treatment with RMC-6291 and SHP2 or SOS1 inhibitors was well tolerated in preclinical models and further increased anti-tumor activity, likely by preventing reactivation of wild-type RAS proteins that cooperate with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> to fuel cancer growth. RMC-6291 also combined well with immune checkpoint inhibitors, sensitizing KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-bearing cancer models to anti-tumor immunity.<br \/>RMC-6291 is a next-generation, mutant-selective inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) that overcomes limitations of first-generation KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitors in preclinical models by directly targeting the active form of this important oncogenic driver.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Drug discovery,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robert J.

The KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutation occurs commonly in multiple tumor histotypes, including about 20%, 29% and 17% of KRAS mutant colorectal, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancers, respectively. However, there are no directly targeted inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> in clinical development. Mutant RAS proteins exist predominantly in the GTP-bound RAS(ON) state, leading to excessive downstream signaling via interaction with effectors such as RAF kinases. Highly selective inhibitors that covalently target the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) state and inhibit conversion to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) have been shown to be active and well tolerated in the clinic, and we have described a novel, covalent tri-complex KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor that has robust anti-tumor activity and is well tolerated in preclinical studies. Developing a covalent inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> presents several challenges. The Asp residue in KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> is significantly less reactive toward electrophiles than is Cys. And most reported covalent chemical warheads capable of reacting with Asp exhibit high nonspecific reactivity. The intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> is about 2.6-fold lower than that of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, further biasing the cellular KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> pool to the RAS(ON) state and emphasizing the importance of targeting the KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>(ON) state for maximal suppression of this oncogenic driver. Based on these considerations we designed RM-036, a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, covalent KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor with attractive drug-like properties. It forms a tri-complex between the abundant intracellular chaperone cyclophilin A (CypA) and the active state of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, positioning the warhead relative to KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and enabling selective covalent engagement of Asp. In cellular models, RM-036 exhibited efficient and selective covalent binding to KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, with no detectable reactivity toward the adjacent Asp residue in cells with the KRAS<sup>G13D<\/sup> mutation. RM-036 showed low off-target reactivity in cell-based proteomic screens. RM-036 potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutant cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> but not in BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>-dependent cells. RM-036, as a single agent, produced deep, durable, and dose-dependent suppression of tumor RAS pathway activation with covalent target engagement <i>in vivo<\/i> following repeat oral administration. Profound tumor regressions, including complete regressions, were observed in various KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutant xenograft models upon treatment with RM-036. All treatments regimens tested with RM-036 were well <i>tolerated in vivo<\/i>.<i> <\/i> <i> <\/i> These preclinical findings provide a strong foundation for advancing RM-036 toward clinical evaluation in patients with tumors bearing the KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutation. <i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John E.

A second oncogenic RAS cysteine mutation, KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>, is found predominantly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with &#62; 2,700 new cases reported in the USA in 2020 but relatively little is known about the biochemical and cellular properties of KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>. KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-selective inhibitors are not active against KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup> and currently there are no direct, targeted inhibitors available for patients with KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>-driven cancers. We report the development of a potent, selective, orally bioavailable tri-complex inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>. Using chemical and genetic approaches, we describe unique properties of KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup> and their influence on oncogenic signaling and the co-mutational landscape of KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup> mutant tumors. These insights provide the basis for targeting KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup> NSCLC in the clinic and shape future combination strategies.<br \/>RM-041 is a potent and selective covalent inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>(ON) with attractive drug-like properties. RM-041 forms a tri-complex between KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>(ON) and cyclophilin A (CypA), a highly abundant intracellular chaperone protein. The assembled non-covalent tri-complex rapidly prevents KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>(ON) signaling <i>via<\/i> steric blockade of RAS effector binding, and covalent engagement with Cys-13 converts the inactive assembly into an irreversibly inhibited complex. In cells, RM-041 covalently modifies KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>(ON), drives deep suppression of RAS pathway signaling, and inhibits cell proliferation in KRAS<sup>G13C <\/sup>mutant<sup> <\/sup>cancer cell lines. In KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup> xenograft tumor models, oral administration of RM-041 produces deep and durable suppression of RAS pathway activity and induces tumor regressions <i>in vivo<\/i> at well-tolerated doses.<br \/>Compared to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G13C&nbsp;<\/sup>exhibits a higher rate of spontaneous nucleotide exchange, reducing its dependence on GEF reloading and sensitivity to upstream inhibitors (e.g., SHP2 and SOS1) and underscoring the need for direct KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup> inhibition. In addition, KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>&nbsp;is uniquely sensitive to select GAPs, including NF1. In line with this observation, an analysis of the co-mutational landscape of KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>&nbsp;patient tumor samples revealed a high prevalence of NF1<sup>LOF<\/sup>&nbsp;mutation, likely resulting in&nbsp;enhanced wild-type RAS signaling. Our&nbsp;preclinical combination data support a&nbsp;therapeutic&nbsp;strategy of mutant selective KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>&nbsp;inhibition with RM-041 and co-targeting an upstream node, such as SHP2, to attenuate cooperative&nbsp;wild-type RAS signaling. &nbsp;In summary,&nbsp;RM-041&nbsp;is a first-in-class, mutant-selective,&nbsp;oral,&nbsp;tricomplex&nbsp;inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>(ON) with the potential to address an unmet need in patients with&nbsp;KRAS<sup>G13C<\/sup>&nbsp;mutant cancer, supporting the advancement of RM-041 towards clinical evaluation.<b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Drug discovery,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher J.

Low grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) is a slow-growing but generally chemo-resistant cancer with few effective treatments for recurrent disease. More than 90% of PDAC and up to 40% of LGSOC express mutationally activated KRAS that drives persistent cell division, anti-apoptosis, cell migration and metastasis. Preventing signaling from the KRAS oncoprotein has been challenging. While recent studies have shown promising results by targeting the binding pocket in Switch II for development of KRAS mutant-specific inhibitors for the G12C mutant and G12D mutant, targeting other mutations remains a work in progress. We have discovered that DIRAS3, a novel endogenous physiological RAS inhibitor, blocks KRAS activity by directly binding KRAS with high affinity, inhibiting KRAS dimerization\/nanoclustering and blocking effector activation.<br \/>In this study we have developed drug-like, helical 10-mer stapled peptides derived from DIRAS3 &#945;5 domain. Preliminary studies show that these lead compounds associate with KRAS with low nanomolar affinity, are largely resistant to serum proteases, and rapidly cross the cellular membrane. Functionally, DIRAS3 peptides&#8212;but not control peptides&#8212;block KRAS homodimers in ReBiL split luciferase assays of KRAS dimerization and disrupt nanoclustering by TEM analysis of GFP-KRAS(G12V)-labeled gold nanoparticles on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of cells. Moreover, DIRAS3 peptides significantly inhibit phospho-ERK, decrease cell viability and induce apoptosis in pancreatic and low-grade ovarian cancer cells with KRAS mutations. Finally, daily treatment with stapled DIRAS3-derived peptides inhibited growth of ASPC-1 (KRAS G12D) PDAC xenografts and improved survival. Thus, our study suggests that development of DIRAS3 stapled peptides may provide a novel therapeutic approach to target mutant KRAS-driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Pancreatic cancer,Peptides,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joshua P.

Recently, the FDA approved sotorasib, a covalent inhibitor of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although sotorasib demonstrated clear clinical benefits, the emergence of drug resistance has led to drug combination approaches with the goal of deepening and sustaining the durability of patient responses. One potential mechanism of drug resistance is the induction of autophagy, which cancer cells use to survive during periods of stress such as treatment with pathway-targeted therapies. Indeed, <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutated cancer cells have been shown to exhibit constitutive autophagy for survival. Additionally, such cells further increase autophagy when treated with pathway-targeted inhibitors of RAS&#62;RAF&#62;MEK&#62;ERK MAP kinase signaling as a resistance mechanism. Hence, the combination of a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor with a specific and potent autophagy inhibitor could lead to deeper and more sustained clinical responses. DCC-3116 is an investigational, potent and selective pharmacological inhibitor of the protein kinases ULK1 and ULK2, which are critical initiating components of the autophagy pathway. Treatment of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with sotorasib induced autophagy by ~2-fold via activation of ULK kinases as measured by an increase in ULK-mediated phosphorylation of ATG13. Sotorasib-mediated ULK kinase activation, and resulting autophagic flux, was inhibited by DCC-3116 in a dose-dependent manner with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 81-160 nM in NSCLC cell lines. These effects translated to <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy<i>. <\/i>In the Calu-1 and H358 KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>NSCLC xenograft models, the combination of DCC-3116 and sotorasib resulted in tumor regression whereas single treatment arms afforded only inhibition of tumor growth. A NSCLC KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> patient derived xenograft (PDX) model further supported the DCC-3116 and sotorasib combination with increased tumor growth inhibition compared to sotorasib alone. These data demonstrate a compelling rationale to study DCC-3116 in combination with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors such as sotorasib in NSCLC patients. DCC-3116 is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors with documented <i>KRAS, NRAS<\/i> or <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations (NCT04892017).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Autophagy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martin McMahon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madhumita Bogdan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary J.

Recent advances have led to the discovery and development of inhibitors that bind the inactive (GDP-bound) form of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>. The most advanced of these first-generation molecules demonstrated clinical response rates of 30-45% and approximately 6-month progression-free survival in lung cancer patients. While significant, a majority of patients failed to achieve a clinical response and acquired resistance can be rapid. One hypothesis to explain tumor resistance is the failure of existing inhibitors to recognize the activated (GTP-bound) form of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> that can be upregulated in response to these first-generation inhibitors. Here we report the discovery of a series of novel inhibitors that effectively inhibit both the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>. These &#8220;dual-acting&#8221; inhibitors bind in the switch II pocket of both GTP-bound and GDP-bound KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>and rapidly form a covalent bond with cysteine 12. This results in significantly increased inhibition of RAF1 and PI3K&#945; effector interactions (IC50 &#60; 5 nM at 2 hrs.) in comparison to inactive state inhibitors. Dual targeting of both GTP- and GDP-bound KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> results in potent cellular activity in models that are both sensitive (NCI-H358 and MIA PaCa-2) and resistant (NCI-H2122) to adagrasib and sotorasib. In contrast to adagrasib and sotorasib which are less effective in the NCI-H2122 cell line model, dual-acting inhibitors of GTP- and GDP-bound KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> elicit rapid inhibition of pERK in &#60; 1 hour with sustained inhibition of MAPK signaling through 48 hours. To model resistance to first generation inhibitors, an A59G mutation was introduced into KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, abrogating GTPase activity. This decreases the activity of both adagrasib and sotorasib in tumor cell viability assays by more than an order of magnitude whereas dual-acting inhibitors of GTP- and GDP-bound KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>are equally effective in the G12C\/A59G and parental G12C cell lines. Evaluation of dual-acting inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> <i>in vivo<\/i> demonstrated rapid and &#62; 90% KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>target occupancy, resulting in regression of MIA PaCa-2 tumors.
