[{"Abstract":"Pancreatic cancer has a poor five-year survival rate of less than 8% and is projected to be the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the US by the year 2030. Polyamine metabolism is an underexplored therapeutic target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The current investigation profiled RNA expression of genes associated with polyamine metabolism, transport and homeostasis in clinical pancreatic cancer samples to reveal evidence for dysregulation of polyamine-based pathways in PDAC. Increased expression of select pro-polyamine genes was associated with poorer patient prognosis in data obtained from the TCGA dataset. Preclinical experimental data supported the use of polyamine blockade therapy (PBT) in pancreatic tumor bearing mice, and revealed that PBT increased survival and decreased tumor weights in comparison to control treatment. PBT therapeutic effects were associated with increased expression of CD86 T cell co-stimulatory marker present on antigen presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment. Collectively, polyamine dysregulation in human pancreatic cancer is associated with poorer patient prognosis, whereas PBT treatment resulted in improved <i>in vivo<\/i> therapeutic outcomes in part through immune modulation in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2211adc5-0bac-4a6d-aea3-5562fdfeb4a7\/@F03B8ZLf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polyamines,Tumor microenvironment,Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11503"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sai Preethi Nakkina<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah B.

The orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1) is overexpressed in several cancers and is a negative prognostic factor for cancer patient survival. Previous reports indicate a potential role for overexpression of NR4A1 in T-cell exhaustion and in this study, we aim to investigate the antitumorigenic activity of two bis-indole derived ligands (DIMs) that act as receptor antagonists. Immune competent C57BL\/6 mice and mouse MC-38 colon cancer cells were used and tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) were isolated from mice either untreated or treated with CDIM\/NR4A1 antagonists. FACS analysis and Real -Time PCR were performed to determine expression of exhaustion markers in these tumor T-cell population. 1,1-Bis(3&#900;-indolyl)-1-(3-bromo-5-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)methane (DIM-3-Br-5-OCF<sub>3<\/sub>) and the 3,5-dichlorophenyl analog (DIM-3,5-Cl<sub>2<\/sub>) at doses of 2.5 and 7.5 mg\/kg\/d inhibited tumor growth and downregulated expression of PD-L1, an NR4A1-regulated gene in MC-38 - derived tumors and cells. The mouse MC-38 colon cancer cell line was used in a syngeneic mouse model of colon cancer and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from MC-38 cell-derived colon tumors exhibited multiple markers of T-cell exhaustion in both CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells. Lymphocytes from an enlarged spleen in these tumor-bearing animals also exhibited markers of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell exhaustion. Analysis of CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>cells from TILs showed that treatment with the NR4A1 antagonists modulated expression of several genes associated with T-cell exhaustion namely a decrease in TOX, TOX2 and NFAT mRNAs, activation of T-Bet. The percentage of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells from tumors and spleen expressing PD-1, 2B4 and TIGIT was decreased in the treated vs control mice and TIM3 expression was also decreased in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> (tumors and spleen) and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> (tumors) T-cells. These findings suggest that NR4A1 antagonists are highly effective as anticancer agents in this mouse syngeneic colon tumor model by inactivating the pro-oncogenic activities of NR4A1 in tumors and by remediating NR4A1-regulated T-cell exhaustion in tumor and splenic lymphocytes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f768580-9a93-4842-9475-83b97c53ab66\/@F03B8ZLf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,T cell,Immunostimulation,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11504"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kumaravel Mohankumar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gus Wright<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhashree Kumaravel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rupesh Shrestha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maen Abdelrahim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert S.

MM is the second most common hematologic cancer with approximately 25,000-30,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States. A challenge associated with MM therapy is unwanted drug uptake by normal healthy cells. Nanoparticles provide a promising outlook to mitigate these issues, offering more selective drug uptake, while minimizing toxicity associated with treatment. The objective of this study was to develop, optimize and evaluate physicochemical and In vitro properties of MM-CLENs in comparison to conventional liposomes and relevant cell controls.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b> RPMI-8226 MM cell line was selected cellular model for MM disease. RPMI-8226 cells were cultured and expanded In vitro for cellular extraction purposes. Lipid extraction (LE) procedures were performed to generate the RPMI-8226 LE ingredient. Other lipid ingredients used in preparation of RPMI-8226 CLENs included DOPC, cholesterol, and DPPE-Rhodamine (fluorescence indicator). Phase I included physicochemical characterization and cellular uptake studies of CLENs preparations with varying concentration of RPMI-8226-LE (0 to 40 mol%) content. Phase II began with the optimized concentration of LE determined in Phase I, along with varying concentrations of cholesterol (0 to 40 mol %) content for the nano-targeting studies <i>in vitro<\/i>. The control cell lines represent other hematological diseases, K-562-GFP (chronic myeloid leukemia), CCRF-CEM (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and U937 (lymphoma).<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Phase I and II physicochemical characterization and In vitro studies, revealed that the optimized preparation of RPMI-8226-CLENs consisted of 5% LE, and 5% cholesterol content. Optimal preparation consisted of DOPC: Cholesterol: LE (90:5:5) with an average values for particle size and zeta potential of 178&#177;38 nm (n=4), and -14&#177;4 mV (n=4), respectively. The inclusion of LE in conventional DOPC:cholesterol liposomes resulted in significantly improved uptake of the CLENs by RPMI-8226 cells <i>in vitro<\/i> (P&#60; 0.001). However, preliminary selectivity studies suggest no significant difference in the uptake of RPMI-8226-CLENs by RPMI-8226 when compared to control cells (K-562-GFP, CCRF-CEM and U937).<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>Studies involving<b> <\/b>RPMI-8226 CLENs are currently underway.

Entinostat plays a role in neutralizing myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to improve anti-tumor immune response. Entinostat is currently being tested in later-stage clinical trials in various types of cancer. Using a novel 3D <i>ex-vivo<\/i> platform with fresh patient tumor samples we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of Entinostat with intact stromal components and tumor immune microenvironment.<br \/>Methods: All tumor samples were obtained with patient consent and relevant IRB approval. Unpropagated 3D tumoroids with intact TME measuring 150 &#181;m in size were prepared from fresh tumor samples from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients using a proprietary technology developed at Nilogen Oncosystems. Tumoroids prepared from each patient&#8217;s tumor sample were pooled to represent the tumor heterogeneity and treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with Entinostat for 48h to detect treatment-mediated changes in tumor immune cell composition including lymphoid and myeloid markers and their activation status.<br \/>Results: Tumoroids treated with Entinostat increased NK, NKT, CD4 and CD8+T cells compared to untreated control. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> treatment with Entinostat led to an increase in CD69 and Granzyme B expression in tumor resident CD4+ T cells. Immune checkpoint receptors, 41BB and PD-1 expression was increased in CD8+T cells followed by Entinostat treatment. Decreased monocytic MDSC was seen in Entinostat treated tumoroids compared to untreated control and this was associated with decreased GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-6 cytokine levels and increased IFN-&#947; and IL-2, quantified by multiplex cytokine assay. Interestingly, the tumor cell killing study revealed a higher percentage of death in early stage MDSC (eMDSC) indicating a direct effect of Entinostat on MDSC survival.<br \/>Conclusions: These results demonstrate that Entinostat treatment leads to a broad range of immune cell activation and MDSC inhibition in RCC. These data provide a mechanistic rationale utilizing our 3D tumoroid platform for discovery of potential biomarkers of drug sensitivity and to identify novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Clinical applications of 3D-EXplore may help to identify RCC patients who may likely benefit from Entinostat treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Immune cells,Tumor heterogeneity,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11508"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Krithika Nandakumar Kodumudi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brittany Bunch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jared Ehrhart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matt Weitzman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia MacIntosh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Sussman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soner Altiok<\/i><\/presenter>.

In previous studies, inhibition of MERTK decreased PD-1 checkpoint proteins in the leukemia microenvironment and prolonged survival in a syngeneic BCR-ABL<sup>+<\/sup>\/<i>Arf<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> B-cell acute leukemia model, implicating MERTK as a promising immune-oncology target in leukemia. Strikingly, <i>Mertk<\/i><i><sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice were largely protected from leukemia. In our current studies, <i>Tyro3<\/i><i><sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> almost completely prevented development of leukemia, comparable to <i>Mertk<\/i><i><sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>, while <i>Axl<\/i><i><sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice died with similar timing to wild type (WT) mice (20-40 days). These data demonstrate differential roles for TAM kinases in the anti-leukemia immune response. Depletion studies were conducted to evaluate potential roles for T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) in anti-leukemia immunity in <i>Mertk<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice. Selective depletion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells abrogated protection from leukemia in <i>Mertk<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice, but survival was still prolonged relative to WT. Thus, while CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were required for complete protection from leukemia, the anti-leukemia response remained partially intact even in the absence of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, implicating an innate immune mechanism. Indeed, combined depletion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell and CD8&#945;<sup>+ <\/sup>DC subsets completely abrogated the anti-leukemic effects in <i>Mertk<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice, revealing a critical immunosuppressive role for MERTK in DCs in the leukemia microenvironment. In contrast to <i>Mertk<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice, selective depletion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells completely abrogated protection from leukemia in <i>Tyro3<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice, indicating a mechanism less dependent on DCs. Similarly, single cell RNA sequencing revealed CD8<sup>+<\/sup> DCs with a more mature and antigen-presenting phenotype in <i>Mertk<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice compared to WT, while antigen-presenting DCs were not increased in <i>Tyro3<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>mice. Single cell sequencing data also suggest induction of an anti-leukemic DC - T cell axis in WT leukemic mice treated with the MERTK-selective inhibitor MRX-2843. DCs were nearly absent in leukemic bone marrow from saline-treated mice and were dramatically increased in response to treatment with MRX-2843. Treatment with MRX-2843 also decreased the incidence of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing high levels of <i>Tox<\/i>, which has been associated with T cell exhaustion. These changes coincided with decreased leukemic blasts, even in the context of established disease.Together, our findings support a model whereby MERTK inhibition promotes DC function and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activity, leading to anti-leukemia immunity. In contrast, anti-leukemia immunity in response to TYRO3 inhibition is less dependent on DCs. Differential roles for the TAM kinases in the leukemia microenvironment provide rationale for development of MERTK and\/or TYRO3 targeted immunotherapies to treat acute leukemia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2b1b56d4-fe0f-40f8-9a1e-3335f23b55a4\/@G03B8ZLg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Dendritic cells,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11509"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justus M.

The accumulation of MDSCs in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) makes immunosuppressive TIME and progressive tumor. In fact, despite notable clinical outcomes in cancer immunotherapy, many patients are refractory or relapsed to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, wherein obstacles imposed by TIME contribute to a great extent. Here, we show that translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) released by dying tumor cells is an immunomodulator crucial to full-blown MDSC accumulation in the TIME in mouse models. We provide evidence that extracellular TCTP mediates recruitment of the polymorphonuclear MDSC (PMN-MDSC) population in the TIME, which is Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) dependent. For human translation, we confirmed that human TCTP binds directly to human TLR2 extracellular domain and stimulates human PBMC to produce multiple cytokines. To explore therapeutic applicability, we generated anti-TCTP antibodies for TCTP inhibition. The antibodies successfully neutralized TCTP in molecular and cellular level. The antibodies also suppressed PMN-MDSC accumulation and tumor growth. The combination of anti-TCTP antibody and immune checkpoint inhibitor showed synergistic effect on tumor growth inhibition. In conclusion, extracellular TCTP is an immunomodulator recruiting PMN-MDSCs to TIME. When TCTP is removed or neutralized, PMN-MDSC counts in TIME decreased. Anti-TCTP therapy may offer a new immunotherapy strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/faf3f22e-292c-489f-9df8-de273ee3646a\/@G03B8ZLg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDSC,Tumor microenvironment,Anticancer therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11511"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeong-Hyun Ryou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gwanghee Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tadatsugu Taniguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideyuki Yanai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sho Hangai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Among metastatic sites, bone is the most frequent destination of breast cancer metastasis and once the disease is found in the bone, it is often refractory to standard therapy. In addition, bone metastasis is associated with significant skeletal related events that greatly impact quality of life. Thus, there is a significant need to develop novel therapies that extend survival and improve quality of life. Previously we found that MK2 inhibition (MK2i) limits metastatic growth by targeting the tumor stromal compartment. To determine which stromal cells are targeted by MK2i we isolated stromal cells from within a metastatic bone lesion and carried out single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Using this approach, we found numerous gene expression changes in both the immune (CD45+) and non-immune (CD45-) populations upon MK2i. Indeed, we found significant numbers of p16+ senescent fibroblasts were present inside the metastatic lesion. We also found vascular cancer-associated fibroblasts (vCAF) and matrix CAFs (mCAF) inside the metastatic lesion suggesting that CAFs are not limited to primary disease. Numerous changes in gene expression in CD45+ cells were also observed, and these changes are being used to identify viable immunotherapies to deploy in our model. Finally, we are using conditional MK2 mice to establish the cell type targeted by MK2i. Our data demonstrate that MK2i is as effective as chemotherapy at limiting metastatic progression and our approach to leverage the scRNA-Seq data may allow us to optimize MK2i therapy to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea304e84-07c0-4f11-9d47-021dddeb1a90\/@G03B8ZLg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stroma,Microenvironment,Metastatic tumors,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11514"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Renata Ramalho Oliveira<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Douglas V.

Sunitinib has shown therapeutic activity in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and currently represents a frontline therapy for this disease. The immune modulatory effect of Sunitinib on immune cells within the tumor microenvironment has been well documented. Here, we developed a novel 3D <i>ex-vivo<\/i> platform (3D-EXplore) using fresh patient tumor samples with intact stromal components and tumor immune microenvironment to assess the therapeutic efficacy of Sunitinib.<br \/>Methods: All tumor samples were obtained with patient consent and relevant IRB approval. Unpropagated 3D tumoroids with intact TME measuring 150 &#181;m in size were prepared from fresh tumor samples of renal cell carcinoma using a proprietary technology developed at Nilogen Oncosystems. Tumoroids prepared from each patient&#8217;s tumor sample were pooled to represent the tumor heterogeneity and treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with Sunitinib for 48h to detect treatment-mediated changes in tumor immune cell composition including CD4 and CD8 T-cells, NK cells, and macrophages. Additionally, we analyzed treatment-mediated changes in T-cell activation and phagocytic activity of myeloid cells.<br \/>Results: Multiparameter flow analysis revealed that Sunitinib treatment led to an increase in CD8+CD25+ central memory-like phenotype and increased granzyme B expression in CD4 and CD8+ T cells indicating T cell activation. Furthermore, multiparameter flow cytometry analysis showed increased EdU uptake by CD8 and NK cells with sunitinib treatment, while cytokine release assays demonstrated increased IFN-&#947; and IL-2 production accompanied by downregulation of IL-10 and IL-6 cytokines. We observed Sunitinib mediated phagocytotic activity by tumor resident myeloid macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells using a quantitative phagocytosis assay.<br \/>Conclusions: These results demonstrate that 3D-EXplore using fresh tumor samples provides a clinically relevant platform to assess drug response and serves as a critical tool for reflecting the true intact tumor microenvironment for novel immune-oncology drug development. <b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor heterogeneity,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Immune cells,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11516"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brittany Bunch<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krithika N.

Inhibition of Notch1 or its ligand, Dll4, can induce tumor vessel hypersprouting, which interferes with perfusion and reduces tumor development. Unfortunately, blocking Notch1 in endothelial cells of normal tissue can lead to tissue hypoxia and vascular neoplasms. Notch4, another member of the Notch family, is upregulated and increased in the endothelium of certain tumor types compared to normal vasculature. Reducing Notch4, unlike Notch1, causes reduction in developmental and tumor angiogenesis. Using a newly developed anti-Notch4 antibody, E7011, we assessed the effects on Notch4 inhibition on developmental retinal angiogenesis. E7011 treatment did not alter capillary density within the vascular plexus or endothelial tip cell number, but did decrease radial outgrowth and vein diameter, supporting the hypothesis that Notch4 functions as a pro-angiogenic signal. These findings suggest that the targeting of Notch4 could interfere with tumor angiogenesis and offer a novel therapeutic avenue. To establish the role of Notch4 within the tumor microenvironment, we analyzed its expression in both human and murine tumor samples. Immunofluorescent staining revealed a range of Notch4 expression in both tumor cells and endothelium in human triple negative breast cancers. Several murine syngeneic tumors examined expressed Notch4 primarily in the endothelium with only rare tumor expression. We treated orthotopically implanted Py8119 murine breast carcinomas and B16F10 melanomas with E7011, which significantly reduced tumor size compared to IgG treated controls, indicating that suppression of Notch4 is anti-tumorigenic. To determine mechanistically how E7011 delays tumor growth, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on E7011 and control treated Py8119 tumors. Surprisingly, we found that while Notch4 transcripts were present only in endothelial cells, E7011 administration dramatically altered macrophage and monocyte populations within the tumor. Taken together, these findings indicate that inhibition of tumor endothelial Notch4 by E7011 can regulate the presence of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment and improve tumor control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e6b5cd3c-cc3f-463d-af50-cf6edde05f6a\/@G03B8ZLg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Novel anticancer agents,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11518"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason Eng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>L.A.

We examined whether p53 activity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) influences antitumor immunity and show that p53 signaling induced pharmacologically with APR-246 (eprenetapopt) can augment the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical models, a strategy that is also being tested in patients (NCT04383938). We first investigated the effects of combining APR-246 with ICB in wildtype C57BL6 (B6) mice bearing syngeneic p53 wildtype MC38 colon cancer and B16 melanoma tumors. The combination of an anti-PD-1 antibody (RMP1-14) with APR-246 in mice significantly delayed tumor growth (p &#60; 0.001) and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice, compared to monotherapies (p &#60; 0.01). To further dissect the effects of APR-246 on myeloid and T cells in the TME, we used a conditional knockout of p53 in CSF1R<sup>+<\/sup>myeloid cells (CSF1R<sup>cre<\/sup>\/p53<sup>fl<\/sup> mice), or T cells (CD8<sup>cre<\/sup>\/p53<sup>fl<\/sup> mice). CSF1R<sup>cre<\/sup>\/p53<sup>fl <\/sup>had loss of tumor control and worse survival with APR-246+anti-PD-1. CD8<sup>cre<\/sup>\/p53<sup>fl <\/sup>had intact tumor control. To study enhanced p53 activity in the TME, we performed flow cytometry, cytokine multiplex and global transcriptional profiling by RNA seq. We found enhanced p53-activity led to increased infiltration of T cells, increased MHC-II expression in TAMs and downregulation of M2-associated cytokines. This was associated with cellular senescence in TAMs and induction of canonical p53-induced senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Our preclinical findings informed the development of a phase I\/II clinical trial using APR-246 with pembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT04383938). We studied peripheral blood samples from two of the patients with tumor regression and two patients in whom tumors progressed on therapy. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum prior to therapy, and at the beginning of cycle 2 and 5 for the patients with tumor control, and at the end of therapy for patients who had progression. Single cell RNA-seq of PBMCs demonstrated a signature consistent with T cell activation and proliferation, and SASP-associated changes in the myeloid compartment as seen in mice. T cell profiling of PBMCs by flow cytometry demonstrated strong proliferation of T cells in patients with tumor control. Serum cytokine analysis demonstrated robust in IL-12, IFN-gamma and Eotaxin-1 in the two responders, which was not seen in the patients whose tumors progressed. Our study illustrates p53-induced SASP in TAMs as a mechanism to reprogram the TME and augment responses to ICB. Ongoing studies will help determine biomarkers that are predictive of response to APR-246+ICB therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/997c46aa-c2d8-4a35-8c9a-5baac2853955\/@G03B8ZLg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor associated macrophages,p53,Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11521"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arnab Ghosh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Michel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Divya Venkatesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riccardo Mezzadra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fadi Samaan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ricardo Gomez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathan Suek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aliya Holland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Jui Ho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohsen Abu-Akeel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Felipe Campesato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Levi Mark Bala Mangarin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cailian Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadna Budhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Chow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberta Zappasodi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcus Ruscetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott W.

Among breast metastatic sites, bone is the most prevalent site that can also seed secondary metastases. Moreover, once tumor cells reach the bone, the disease is considered incurable and treatments are only palliative. For this reason, new therapies that limit metastatic growth are desperately needed. We previously showed that pharmacological inhibition of p38MAPK&#945; (p38i) limited visceral and bone metastases in several clinically relevant models of breast cancer metastasis. Indeed, we found that this approach had no impact on tumor cells but instead limited the supporting nature of the stromal compartment. These findings led us to ask how p38i impacted the stromal compartment. Using a novel strategy to segregate tumor-infiltrating from non-tumor-infiltrating stromal cells in the bone metastatic site, we carried out single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to investigate how p38i altered immune and non-immune tumor stroma. Our analyses revealed that p38i treatment shifts tumor-associated macrophages in the bone towards a tumor-suppressive phenotype with increased signatures for IFN&#947; signaling and adaptive immunity. Importantly, the gene signature we identified in bone macrophages under p38i treatment correlated with better survival among patients with luminal B breast tumors. Given the importance of the p38i gene signature in patient samples, we next depleted macrophages and also blocked IFN&#947; and found both approaches reversed the p38i anti-tumor effect. Because T cells are an important source of IFN&#947; <i>in vivo<\/i>, we next assessed whether T cells were required by p38i to limit tumor growth. Depletion of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, but not CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, blunted the p38i anti-tumor effect. Although p38i did not increase CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration, p38i increased the percentage of activated CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells infiltrating bone metastases. The requirement for CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in our model and the lack of evident OX40 ligand in our scRNA-Seq data led us to ask if p38i could be used in combination with immunotherapy to further limit metastases. Indeed, combination of p38i and agonist anti-OX40 (agOX-40) immunotherapy synergistically reduced metastatic growth and increased overall survival in our mouse models. Finally, because our work revealed no obvious role for CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in this model, we next asked if introduction of a CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell antigen could further increase the anti-tumor effects of p38i. We thus modified PyMT-BO1 cells to express ovalbumin, which contains a strong CD8 antigen and combined it with p38i and agOX40. This combination led to a greater than 90% cure rate of mice with metastatic lesions. Although the mechanisms by which inhibition of p38MAPK&#945; shapes the metastatic tumor microenvironment are still under investigation, our findings indicate that metastatic breast cancer patients may benefit from immunotherapy when carried out in combination with p38i.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Tumor metastases,Tumor immunity,Bone metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11522"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Douglas Vendas Faget<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xianmin Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qihao Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiayu Ye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Cole<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhangting Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bhavna Murali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinming Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yalin Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph B.

Therefore, Stat3 inhibitors are being developed and tested pre-clinically and in clinical trials for multiple solid cancers. Importantly, STAT3 signaling also occurs in the non-tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The effect of Stat3 signaling within the TME on primary gastric cancers (GC), metastasis formation and therapy responses is unknown.<br \/>Here, we describe a novel genetically defined, tumor organoid-driven, transplantable, orthotopic gastric cancer model that represents gastric carcinomas with associated metastasis formation in immune competent recipient mice. Utilizing our murine GC organoid model in subcutaneous allograft experiments, we showed that established GC tumors respond to pharmacological Stat3 inhibition. This anti-tumor effect is primarily driven by inhibition of the Stat3 signaling in the TME as tumor growth was increased in Stat3 high TME recipients, while tumor growth was inhibited in Stat3-signaling reduced Stat3+\/- mice. Furthermore, Crisp-Cas9 -mediated Stat3 knockout in the GC organoids did not alter their in vitro growth potential. Stat3KO GC allograft tumor growth was not changed compared to Stat3WT GC tumors grown in wildtype host mice. Collectively, this suggests that inhibition of Stat3 signaling within the TME but not the tumor cell intrinsic Stat3 reduction confer anti-tumor responses. Through gastric serosa transplantation of the murine GC organoids into Stat3-elevated gp130FF mutant mice, we confirmed that high Stat3 signaling within the TME promotes distal metastasis formation to the liver.<br \/>Taken together, we show that Stat3 signaling represents a therapy target, that predominantly acts through the TME. Better understanding of the signaling within the TME in primary and metastatic GC lesions will allow identification of novel tumor cell and TME-centric therapy targets. Combination of therapies targeting tumor cell intrinsic vulnerabilities with novel pro-tumorigenic TME -targeting agents could help to improve responses against primary and metastatic disease and therefore improve outcome for the worst prognosis patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec11da8b-ea1e-4ce9-8d61-fc4e21d24ffa\/@H03B8ZLh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21642"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Moritz Eissmann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Huber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amr Allam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Dijkstra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Ernst<\/i><\/presenter>.

Due to high neoantigen loads derived from tumor-specific mutations, evidence of tumor-infiltrating T cells and high response rates to checkpoint blockade (30-60%), MSI-H cancers can be leveraged to study the features of neoantigen-induced anti-tumor immunity in response to therapy and disease outcome. Previously we identified a set of recurrent frameshift (fs) mutations in MSI-H cancers that yielded immunogenic polyepitope neoantigens (neoAgs) eliciting CD8+ T cell responses. Here we investigate whether these shared fs-neoAgs engendered spontaneous T cell responses in MSI-H colorectal and endometrial cancer patients. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we evaluated the frequency of the fs-neoAg-specific T cells by <i>ex vivo<\/i> IFN-&#947; ELISPOT upon fs-peptide stimulation. Additionally, we isolated na&#239;ve and memory T cells from MSI-H patient PBMCs and expanded fs-neoAg-specific T cells within each subset. Fs-neoAg-induced effector cytokine (IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945;) production was measured by flow cytometry and was detected only in the memory subset, supporting the hypothesis that shared fs-neoAgs prime CD8+ T cells <i>in vivo<\/i> to generate clonally-expanded memory T cells in MSI-H patients. To further evaluate the clonal expansion of fs-neoAg-specific T cells in MSI-H cancer patients, we identified fs-neoAg-specific T cell receptors (TCRs). T cell lines enriched for fs-neoAg-specific T cells were generated from patient PBMCs and sequenced for variable &#946; chains of TCRs. These fs-neoAg-specific TCRs were monitored in the blood and tumor tissues, including those from primary and recurrent sites. Finally, to determine the spatial relationships between the infiltrating immune cells and the malignant cells at single cell resolution, we performed multiplexed immunohistochemistry using CODEX technology. A panel of 35 markers was used to evaluate the myeloid (HLA-DR, CD11c, CD14, CD68, CD206) and T (CD4, CD8, Foxp3) cell subsets, the activation (CD107a, CD69, Ki67) and exhaustion (PD-1, TIM3, LAG3) status of T cells, T cell states (TCF-1, TOX, PD-1) and the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures\/antigen presenting cell niches (CD19, CD20, HLA-DR) in the tumor microenvironment of primary or recurrent MS-stable and MSI-H tumors from endometrial cancer patients. We also investigated potential immune escape mechanisms in MSI-H tumors, such as the loss of B2M and MHC-I expression. This study will provide insights into the quality and quantity of shared anti-tumor T cells within the periphery and tumor tissues and will help identify the immune correlates of response or resistance to therapy in MSI-H cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f87194f8-48f8-4a26-964f-8034bfa9ea02\/@H03B8ZLh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Neoantigen-specific T cells,Microsatellite instability,Gynecological cancers: other,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11648"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cansu Cimen Bozkus<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mona Saleh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Brody<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie V.

ECM stabilization influences the speed of tissue recovery. Here, we used a mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to study the function of peroxidasin (PXDN), a peroxidase that uses H2O2 to cross-link collagen IV, during liver fibrosis progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).<br \/>Method: <i>Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> and <i>Pxdn<sup>+\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice were fed with a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for 16 weeks to create a NAFLD-HCC preclinical model. Liver histology, collagen content, flow cytometry, immunostaining of immune cells, RNA-seq, and liver function tests were analyzed. <i>In vivo<\/i> imaging of liver reactive oxygen species (ROS) was performed using a redox-active iron complex, Fe-PyC3A.<br \/>Results: Using Fe-PyC3A as an MRI contrast agent, we detected a higher content of ROS in <i>Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> livers (healthy) that was not necessarily directly toxic but could activate hypoxia-related molecular pathways. Genome-wide expression analysis of liver tissue and differential gene expression (DGE) combined with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis identified significant upregulation of genes associated with hypoxia and TNF&#945; signaling pathways already in <i>Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> sham livers (without injury). In addition, we observed an upregulation of genes involved in the innate immune response, leukocyte activation, and chemotaxis. After 16 weeks of CDAHFD, gross analysis of collected liver showed no HCC nodule formation in <i>Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice while 60% of the WT mice had HCC tumors. Collagen deposition showed less collagen accumulation in <i>Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. Flow cytometry of macrophages showed <i>Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice had increased pro-healing M2 macrophages recruitment in early- and mid-stage NAFLD (4 weeks and 8 weeks on CDAHFD) compared to WT controls. In addition, we observed a significant decrease in the number of CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T cells in the late-stage of NAFLD in <i>Pxdn KO <\/i>mice. DGE analysis revealed that IL-12 is highly expressed in <i>Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> injured livers. Additionally, multiple other T cell-related molecules such as IL-10, IL-6, CCL2, IL-7, and CD4 were elevated in<i> Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> injured liver. Elevation of these cytokines is an indicator for higher recruitment of pro-healing and anti-HCC macrophage to the site of injury.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that PXDN deficiency is associated with the induction of the hypoxia and TNF&#945; signaling pathways and the recruitment of pro-healing and anti-HCC macrophages to the liver. This results in significantly decreased collagen stabilization during liver fibrosis and accelerates fibrosis reversal. In addition, recruited macrophages-controlled T cell response and inhibited HCC formation in <i>Pxdn<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/72934f92-fea6-43bf-8eac-f745a6ae3101\/@H03B8ZLh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Hypoxia,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11683"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mozhdeh Sojoodi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Stephen C.

High levels of extracellular adenosine generated in the tumor microenvironment engage A<sub>2a<\/sub> and A<sub>2b<\/sub> adenosine receptors on immune cells, resulting in immunosuppression. Expression of A<sub>2a<\/sub>R and A<sub>2b<\/sub>R can vary by cell type, with T cells predominantly expressing A<sub>2a<\/sub>R while myeloid cells express both A<sub>2a<\/sub>R and A<sub>2b<\/sub>R. We have previously shown that etrumadenant, a dual A<sub>2a<\/sub>R\/A<sub>2b<\/sub>R antagonist, blocks the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine in immune cells and enhances anti-tumor immune responses in mouse syngeneic tumors. Using dual and selective adenosine receptor antagonists, we assessed the contribution of these receptors to adenosine-mediated phenotypes in immune and cancer cells.<br \/>METHODS: Human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were isolated from healthy human blood and activated using CD3\/CD28\/CD2 stimulation and cytokines were analyzed by cytokine bead array at 72 hours. Primary human dendritic cells (DC) were isolated from healthy blood and matured with LPS\/IFN-&#947; for 24 hours. Cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC. The adenosine analogue NECA was used to stimulate A<sub>2a<\/sub>R\/A<sub>2b<\/sub>R-mediated signaling.<br \/>RESULTS: Activated human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells stimulated in the presence of NECA showed suppression of activation markers (CD69) and cytokine production (IFN-&#947;, IL-2 and granzyme B). As expected, we observed similar rescue of this phenotype with both etrumadenant and an A<sub>2a<\/sub>R-specific antagonist owing to the sole expression of A<sub>2a<\/sub>R on T cells. In contrast, primary DC have comparable expression of A<sub>2a<\/sub>R and A<sub>2b<\/sub>R, suggesting that dual blockade may provide greater resistance to adenosine-mediated suppression than A<sub>2a<\/sub>R antagonism. Indeed, etrumadenant was able to attenuate the adenosine-mediated upregulation of IL-10 and enhance IL-12p70 production, whereas a comparable A<sub>2a<\/sub>R-specific antagonist showed no significant rescue versus NECA-stimulated controls. These observations may be extended to suppressive myeloid populations as well as tumor-resident macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells isolated from mouse syngeneic tumors, which have very high expression of both A<sub>2a<\/sub>R and A<sub>2b<\/sub>R. RNA-sequencing identified a cassette of genes regulated by adenosine-signaling in these cells, which were largely reversed by etrumadenant. Finally, cultured human cancer cell lines have high expression of A<sub>2b<\/sub>R, which has been implicated in driving their tumorigenesis. Etrumadenant reversed adenosine-stimulated gene expression changes in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, restoring enriched pathways driven by adenosine signaling.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results show an important role for A<sub>2a<\/sub>R\/A<sub>2b<\/sub>R in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression and provide a mechanistic rationale for stimulation of anti-tumor immune responses with the dual adenosine receptor antagonist etrumadenant.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/90845b28-be68-49eb-9fbf-5eae0e5f742b\/@H03B8ZLh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11684"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sachie Marubayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bindi Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Livia Yamashiro<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dana Piovesan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sean Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenna Jeffrey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manmohan Leleti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Powers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matt Walters<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel DiRenzo<\/i><\/presenter>.

The tumor stroma is composed of extracellular matrix proteins, myofibroblasts, stellate cells, and immune cells, and comprises up to 80% of the tumor mass. The stroma promotes the progression and metastasis of tumors and the development of chemoresistance. However, the strategies of completed depletion of the stroma resulted in a more aggressive tumor and a poor survival rate in clinical trials. We discovered that silencing the RNA binding protein &#945;CP2, which is encoded by the poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) gene, could destabilize the type I collagen mRNA in human pancreatic stellate cells and mouse NIH\/3T3 fibroblasts, leading to the normalization of the tumor stroma. We recently discovered an anti-PD-L1 peptide that effectively blocks the PD1\/PD-L1 pathway. We hypothesize that silencing &#945;CP2 modulates the PDAC stroma, thus improving the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a combination therapy strategy to treat PDAC with PCBP2 siRNA nanoparticles and the anti-PD-L1 peptide. A mixture of 1&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> PANC02 tumor cells and NIH\/313 fibroblast cells was subcutaneously implanted into C57BL\/6 mice to establish the desmoplastic PDAC model. The mice were treated with saline, PCBP2 siRNA nanoparticles, the anti-PD-L1 peptide, and PCBP2 siRNA nanoparticles plus the anti-PD-L1 peptide. The results showed that the combination of PCBP2 siRNA nanoparticles with the anti-PD-L1 peptide reduced tumor growth. PCBP2 siRNA decreased type I collagen expression in the tumor. The normalized stroma showed increased infiltration of effective immune cells. This approach provides a new strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy in PDAC by normalizing the tumor stroma with the PCBP2 siRNA nanoparticle.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f22076f6-2610-46b1-9776-c8647db2fe6a\/@H03B8ZLh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stroma,PD-L1,Pancreatic cancer,PCBP2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20623"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chien-Yu Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kun Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Emerging clinical trial data (NCT04274738; ongoing) suggest that mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, in combination with ibrutinib results in clinically meaningful changes in levels of IgM and hemoglobin in patients with <i>MYD88<\/i><sup>L265P<\/sup> <i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>WHIM<\/sup> WM. However, the effects of mavorixafor with ibrutinib and other Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors on WM cells harboring only the single mutation (<i>MYD88<\/i><sup>L265P<\/sup> without <i>CXCR4<\/i> mutation) have not been evaluated. This study was designed to test the ability of mavorixafor to sensitize WM cells carrying <i>MYD88<\/i><sup>L265P<\/sup> <i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup> to BTK inhibitors in a WM\/BM stromal cell (BMSC) co-culture model. The effects of mavorixafor on Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> mobilization, cell migration, and adhesion to BMSC were also measured. WM cells (MWCL-1 cell line, <i>MYD88<\/i><sup>L265P<\/sup><i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup>) pretreated with mavorixafor and BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, zanubrutinib, evobrutinib, LOXO-305, ARQ 531) were co-cultured with established BMSCs (HS27a cells).<b> <\/b>Cell viability, apoptosis, and IgM release were measured after 72 hours. BTK inhibitors, but not mavorixafor, decreased tumor cell viability and increased apoptosis of WM cells in the absence of BMSCs. Co-culture with BMSCs enhanced CXCR4 expression and protected WM cells from the effects of BTK inhibitors. BMSCs also significantly increased IgM secretion 2- to 5-fold compared with WM cells grown in the absence of BMSCs. Mavorixafor alone inhibited CXCL12-stimulated Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> mobilization and migration of WM cells and disrupted the adhesion of WM cells to BMSCs. Combination of mavorixafor with BTK inhibitors overcame the protective effect of BMSCs on tumor cells, decreasing cell viability and\/or increasing apoptosis compared with BTK inhibitors alone. Mavorixafor also reduced IgM secretion, which was further decreased when combined with BTK inhibitors.This study is the first to show <i>in vitro <\/i>that the protection of WM cells against BTK inhibitors conferred by BMSCs can be overcome by inhibition of the CXCR4\/CXCL12 axis. The observations and responses to mavorixafor suggest a contribution of <i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup> to the pathogenicity of WM cells carrying only the <i>MYD88<\/i><sup>L265P<\/sup> mutation. Mavorixafor addition enhanced the efficacy of not only ibrutinib but the other BTK inhibitors tested, supporting the greater potential of this combination therapeutic strategy in WM patients with or without <i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>WHIM<\/sup> mutations. Further studies using additional WM cell lines and\/or primary patient cells are warranted to support these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8db6bb02-ca06-49a1-81f8-cea08046df39\/@H03B8ZLh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone marrow,Mavorixafor,BTK inhibitor,Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21568"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"1a48e21d-a2f2-4ab7-a20c-1156aa450634","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1a48e21d-a2f2-4ab7-a20c-1156aa450634\/@H03B8ZLh\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chi Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Halenya Monticelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Kruitwagen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Tardelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barbara Maierhofer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thalia Martins Rebelo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Maier-Munsa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katarina Zmajkovicova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukas Dillinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adriana Badarau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Arthur G.
