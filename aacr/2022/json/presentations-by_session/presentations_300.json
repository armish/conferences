[{"Abstract":"Background: Racial disparities in breast cancer incidence and clinical outcome have been well characterized. In particular, African American (AA) patients have higher mortality rates than other racial groups. Research into these racial disparities has primarily focused on socioeconomic determinants, with some studies exploring potential molecular determinants and limited biological differences found between AA and Caucasian patient tumors. Tumor intrinsic and extrinsic factors that promote racial differences in breast cancer development and patient outcome are not fully understood and strategies to address this are scarce. As a result, we have developed a platform that combines patient-specific imaging and multi-omics data to elucidate how biological differences integrate to promote racial disparities in tumor behavior and patient outcome.<br \/>Methods: Imaging and transcriptomic data from over 500 patients were integrated within the SimBioSys TumoScope biophysical modeling software to understand racial differences in tumor biology and coordinated tumor behavior.<br \/>Results: AA patients have tumors that display higher growth rates, characteristically have higher adipose tissue around the tumor, higher spatial variation in drug secretion, lower spatial variation in blood flow\/ and increased tumor stiffness.<br \/>Conclusion: Using a transdisciplinary approach, our results show that metabolic and structural tumor features are associated with the disproportionately poor survival rates observed in AA breast cancer patients. By characterizing racial-specific tumor intrinsic and extrinsic biological factors and their potential interactions, strategies may emerge to personalize clinical management based on racial differences. In this way, precision oncology approaches can be applied to increase life-expectancy for racial minorities with breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aec553e5-41f7-4f4e-ac3c-18d234b3662e\/@y03B8ZAE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Breast cancer,Metabolism,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14772"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nicole Liadis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tyler Earnest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eduardo Braun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anu Antony<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lance Munn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hallock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Daniel Cook<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>The SimBioSys Team<\/i><\/presenter>.

We aimed to extend this framework to incorporate serially acquired multi-omic data to further improve response predictions and model tumor biology as it is perturbed by treatment.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Breast tumor core biopsies were acquired at diagnosis from 168 women that went on to receive pre-operative chemotherapy (or chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 targeted therapy). Serial tumor core biopsies were obtained midway (n=78) and on completion (n=69) of neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Response was assessed at surgery using the Residual Cancer Burden score. Core biopsies were molecularly profiled by shallow whole genome, exome and RNA sequencing and their histological architecture characterized using digital pathology. Baseline clinical, molecular, and digital pathology imaging features associated with response were identified and their dynamics modelled throughout therapy.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>At baseline, a total of 34 features derived from multi-omic data were associated with response to neoadjuvant therapy. These included: tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, subclonal diversity, HRD and chromosomal instability. A suppressed immune response, typified by the presence of T-cell dysfunction and immune exclusion, was associated with extensive chemoresistance. The changes in abundance of these features across the serially sampled on-therapy tumors were then mapped to response outcomes. An early increase in adaptive and innate immune infiltration and activation was associated with a linear decrease in expressed neoantigens, tumor proliferation and loss of subclonal mutational and copy number diversity, indicating early response to therapy. Conversely, a stable tumor and microenvironment transcriptional landscape throughout treatment, corresponding to a minimal change in tumor clonal architecture and microenvironment composition, was associated with a poor response to therapy. Notably, tumors with LOH HLA failed to engage a productive immune response during treatment and this was associated with resistance. A dynamic framework that models the change of these on-therapy features and extends the functionality of the published static machine learning model is being developed.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Response to neoadjuvant therapy<b> <\/b>is determined by the baseline characteristics of the tumor ecosystem. During therapy, both the tumor and its microenvironment follow distinct evolutionary trajectories that can be mapped to outcome. The change in enrichment of features derived from the tumor and its microenvironment can be integrated within machine learning frameworks that leverage dynamic data from the entire therapy time course for more accurate response prediction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1684502f-c0b9-4a90-a4da-70aa5cf53909\/@y03B8ZAE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Biomarkers,Therapy resistance,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14776"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen-John Sammut<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mireia Crispin-Ortuzar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suet-Feung Chin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Provenzano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Cope<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Dariush<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah-Jane Dawson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul D.

Bulk and single-cell technologies have recently been leveraged to better understand its genomic underpinnings. The PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) has also been explored, revealing an immunosuppressive milieu. However, efforts to utilize TME features to facilitate more effective treatments have largely failed.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on a cohort of treatment-naive PDAC biopsy samples (n=22) and surgical samples (n=6), integrated with 3 public datasets (n=49), resulting in ~150,000 individual cells from 77 patients. Based on expression markers assessed by Seurat v3 and differentiation status assessed by CytoTRACE, we divided the resulting tumor cellular clusters into 5 molecular subtypes: Basal, Mixed Basal\/Classical, Less differentiated Classical, More differentiated Classical, and ADEX. We then queried these 5 tumor cell profiles along with 15 scRNA-seq-derived tumor microenvironmental cellular profiles in 391 bulk RNA-seq samples from 4 published datasets of localized PDAC with associated clinical metadata using CIBERSORTx. Through unsupervised clustering analysis of these 20 cell state fractions representing tumor, leukocyte and stromal cells, we identified 7 unique clustering patterns representing combinations of tumor cellular and microenvironmental cell states present in PDAC tumors, which we termed communities, and correlated these with survival, tumor ecotypes, and tumor cellular differentiation status.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified 7 distinct cellular communities in bulk RNA sequencing data after CIBERSORTx and unsupervised clustering. The community associated with worst overall survival contained basal tumor cells, exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells, and was enriched for fibroblasts. In contrast, highest overall survival was associated with tumors enriched for differentiated classical tumor cells, NK cells and endothelial cells. The differentiation state of tumor cells (assessed by CytoTRACE) also correlated with survival in a dose-dependent fashion. We corroborated the community structures we identified with our unsupervised clustering approach with ecotypes obtained using Ecotyper and observed a significant correlation. We further identified a subset of PDAC samples that were significantly enriched for activated CD8 T cells that achieved a 3-year overall survival rate of 40%, suggesting we can identify PDAC patients with improved prognoses and with potentially higher sensitivity to immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Discovered cellular communities from tumor bulk RNA-seq shed new insight into the composition of PDAC and could pave the way towards better upfront risk stratification and more personalized tumor biology-driven clinical decision-making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d018519a-d720-4ee1-91d1-ea0768fcf978\/@y03B8ZAE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Tumor markers,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14777"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Erik P.

Focusing on diffusion coefficients as the translational biomarkers to quantify the nucleation and growth of tumors and cancers has potential advantages. Because, diffusion coefficients act as guiding tools in preventing or treating the cancers and associated adversities. Collectively the biological, pharmacological and toxicological indicators during and prior to the course of cancer are taken as measures for the data over specific distances of the molecules to determine diffusion coefficients. Because, multiple mechanisms are simultaneously responsible in altering the compositions. In this work, the mass transportation in both healthy individuals and cancer patients are taken into account to compare and contrast the initiation and spread of cancers in the light of immunology and immunotherapy. Measurements through incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) and echo planar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are applied in determining the diffusion parameters. Diffusion coefficients were within the ranges of 0.1 to 5 X 10-3 mm2\/sec. Perfusion played important role in quantifications. Magnitudes of diffusion coefficients are used to forecast biological prevalence and to develop prevention and treatment therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2cab351f-5caa-4b81-9fee-5897c459ea75\/@y03B8ZAE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14780"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"f6042d51-6e76-4b62-a071-d5e53aa4b32c","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6042d51-6e76-4b62-a071-d5e53aa4b32c\/@y03B8ZAE\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Narayana Garimella<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Presently, efforts to model angiogenic pattern formation fail to accurately predict spatial characteristics often observed.<br \/>Biological allometries, such as the scaling of metabolism to mass or cell number, have been hypothesized to result from natural selection to maximize how vascular networks fill space yet minimize internal transport distances and resistance to motion. Metabolic scaling theory argues that two guiding principles&#8212;optimization of motion and space-filling fractal distributions&#8212;describe a diversity of biological networks and predict how the geometry of these networks influences organismal metabolism. Recently, metabolic scaling theory has been applied to study tumor growth rates, offering a mechanistic link between tumor growth and vascular patterning.<br \/>Remarkably, there exists two classes of spatial-temporal mathematical models where equivalent angiogenic pattern formation occurs. These two classes are determined primarily by either cellular interactions as proposed by Hillen and Painter, or biomechanical forces as proposed by Manoussaki and Murray. Examples of underlying mechanisms are chemotactic quorum-sensing and resource competition for the former, and advection-diffusion driven stresses and strains in the extra-cellular matrix for the latter. We compare these models by examining theoretical predictions for pattern forming criteria with numerical simulations. Furthermore, we identify experimentally testable predictions for angiogenic pattern formation related to the spatial configuration of the extra-cellular matrix. We test these predictions against <i>in vitro<\/i> confocal microscopy imaging data for bone marrow endothelial networks with experimental control over adhesion molecules and the resulting network structure. Specifically, we measure time-dependent geometric features in the highly reticulated endothelial networks related to steady-state equilibration, connectivity and space-filling. Example metrics are the scaling of network edge lengths and enclosed areas within the extra-cellular matrix that indicate changes to network morphology as adhesion molecules are present or absent.

By conducting metric and model selection, this work identifies data-driven mechanisms for angiogenic pattern formation and quantifies normality in bone-marrow endothelial networks.

With breast cancer diagnoses trending younger, there is a critical need for accurate non-invasive methods for assessing early cardiac degradation for mitigating cardiotoxicity due to cancer therapies.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We developed a biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging method (BEIM) for assessing direct, functional mechanical stiffness of the left ventricle (LV) to indicate early cardiac degradation<sup>1<\/sup>. In this study, we examined the use of BEIM in a cohort of 5 African Green monkeys (AGM) receiving human equivalent doses of doxorubicin (cumulative dose: 240mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) over 10 weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was acquired before and 15 weeks after final doxorubicin dose. Mechanical elasticity was estimated throughout the mid-plane of the LV utilizing BEIM. After necropsy, histopathology with picrosirius red of the matching LV mid-plane was conducted at 15 weeks after the final doxorubicin dose to calculate collagen volume fraction (CVF) indicative of anthracycline-associated cardiac fibrosis. Archival, age-and gender-matched LVs from healthy, chemotherapy na&#239;ve AGM were used as histopathological controls.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Two-dimensional circumferential, radial, and shear elasticity maps of the mid-plane of the LV indicate substantial changes in mechanical elasticity between baseline and 15 weeks post-doxorubicin CMR acquisitions. Average global change between baseline and post-doxorubicin image acquisitions in circumferential, radial, and shear modulus were 4.8, 5.7, and 5.2-fold increases respectively, with an average 1.9-fold change of CVF. Global circumferential, radial, and shear modulus values at baseline and 15 weeks post-doxorubicin were compared to CVF values for each subject and indicate a very strong correlation between circumferential, radial, and shear modulus with CVF, represented by Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficients of 0.91, 0.92, and 0.89, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We developed BEIM to assess changes in LV mechanical elasticity utilizing routine CMR imaging data with a goal of non-invasively identifying cardiac stiffening associated with cardiotoxicity. To validate our methodology, we utilized CMR data from an AGM model of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity to estimate changes in LV elasticity and compare to CVF values from histopathology. Our results show an increase in both CVFs and mechanical elasticity between baseline and 15 weeks following the last doxorubicin dose. Elasticity measures exhibit a very strong correlation with histopathological assessment of cardiac fibrosis. Results demonstrate the ability of our BEIM to identify changes in elasticity related to increased collagen deposition from anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d1077126-e59b-49d1-925c-1eb40c100d03\/@z03B8ZAF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Physical sciences in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cardiotoxicity,Magnetic resonance imaging,Collagen,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14783"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caroline Miller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer H.

Its analysis requires cumbersome manual quantification of Ki67 immunostaining in at least 200 tumor cells. To enable automated Ki67-LI assessment in routine clinical practice, we have developed and validated a framework for automated Ki67-LI quantification, which comprises three different artificial intelligence analysis steps and an algorithm for cell-distance analysis of multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry staining. The prognostic impact of the Ki67-LI was tested on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing one sample each of 12475 prostate cancers. A &#8220;heterogeneity TMA&#8221; containing 3 to 6 samples from different tumor areas was used to model Ki67 analysis of multiple different biopsies.<b> <\/b>The Ki67-LI provided strong and independent prognostic information in 11845 successfully analyzed prostate cancers (p&#60;0.001 each). The analysis of the heterogeneity TMA revealed that the Ki67-LI of the sample with the highest Gleason score (AUC:0.68) was similarly prognostic as the mean Ki67-LI of all six foci (AUC:0.71 [p=0.24]). The combined analysis of the Ki67-LI and Gleason grades obtained on identical tissue spots showed that the Ki67-LI added significant additional prognostic information in case of classical ISUP grades (AUC:0.82 [p=0.002]) and quantitative Gleason grades (AUC:0.83 [p=0.018]). The Ki67-LI is a powerful prognostic parameter in prostate cancer, which can be efficiently analyzed in multiplex fluorescence IHC. In case of multiple cancer positive biopsies, the sole analysis of the worst biopsy can be sufficient.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/faa45c84-006e-434e-8694-a9db77b38802\/@z03B8ZAF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Multiplex automation,Molecular imaging,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14818"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Niclas C.

Recent studies have found that early-onset CRC exhibits an increased proportion of tumors lacking an <i>APC<\/i> mutation. We set out to identify regulatory mechanisms underlying <i>APC<\/i> mutation-negative (<i>APC<sup>mut-<\/sup><\/i>) CRCs.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to compare clinical phenotypes, somatic mutations, copy number variations, gene fusions, RNA expression, and DNA methylation profiles between <i>APC<sup>mut- <\/sup><\/i>and <i>APC<\/i> mutation-positive (<i>APC<sup>mut+<\/sup><\/i>) microsatellite stable CRCs. We also constructed and compared regulatory networks between <i>APC<sup>mut- <\/sup><\/i>and <i>APC<sup>mut+<\/sup><\/i> CRCs by integrating transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, protein-protein interactions, and gene co-expression using the algorithms PANDA and LIONESS. Single sample networks were used to identify each tumor&#8217;s contribution to the differences in transcriptional regulation observed between the <i>APC<sup>mut- <\/sup><\/i>and <i>APC<sup>mut+<\/sup><\/i> groups.<br \/>Results: <i>APC<sup>mut-<\/sup><\/i> CRC expression profiles clustered into two approximately equal groups. Cluster One was associated with enhanced mitochondrial activation. Cluster Two was strikingly associated with genetic inactivation or decreased RNA expression of the WNT antagonist <i>RNF43<\/i>, increased expression of the WNT agonist <i>RSPO3<\/i>, activating mutation of <i>BRAF<\/i>, or increased methylation and decreased expression of <i>AXIN2<\/i>. <i>APC<sup>mut-<\/sup><\/i> CRCs exhibited evidence of increased immune cell infiltration, with significant correlation between M2 macrophages and <i>RSPO3<\/i>. Consistent with this, <i>APC<sup>mut-<\/sup><\/i>CRC regulatory networks showed strong activation of immune pathways relative to <i>APC<sup>mut+<\/sup><\/i> CRCs. The second most prominently targeted pathway was RAS signaling, with the TFs <i>TCF15<\/i> and <i>RUNX2 <\/i>regulating key pathway members including <i>RAF1<\/i>, GEFs, and GAPs. Single sample networks revealed that tumors with the strongest transcriptional regulation of RAS genes tend to lack a <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation and exhibit a slight skew towards earlier onset.<br \/>Conclusions: <i>APC<sup>mut-<\/sup><\/i> CRCs comprise two groups of tumors characterized by enhanced mitochondrial activation or increased sensitivity to extracellular WNT, suggesting that they could be respectively susceptible to inhibition of these pathways. <i>APC<sup>mut- <\/sup><\/i>tumors exhibit increased regulation of RAS pathway genes compared to <i>APC<sup>mut+ <\/sup><\/i>tumors. The samples contributing most to this regulatory signature tend to lack a KRAS mutation, suggesting that <i>APC<sup>mut- <\/sup><\/i>tumors have developed ways to modulate RAS pathway activity through non-mutational mechanisms. Focal emphasis on the <i>RAF1 <\/i>gene suggests these tumors may be more vulnerable to inhibition of the downstream MAPK pathway. Network analysis implicates <i>TCF15<\/i> and <i>RUNX2<\/i> as regulators of RAS pathway genes, suggesting a possible WNT-RAS crosstalk occurring in <i>APC<sup>mut-<\/sup><\/i> CRC that warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f8305f8-512e-43ba-b154-65c2ed67fe37\/@z03B8ZAF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Network biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Bioinformatics,Systems biology,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14822"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Megha Padi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dante Bellomo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Grant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosa M.

To address this challenge, we leveraged network-based methodologies to dissect the heterogeneity of DMG tumors and to discover Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing pharmacologically accessible, mechanistic determinants of molecularly distinct DMG cell states. The study has produced the first DMG-specific regulatory network, reverse-engineered from 122 publicly available pediatric DMG RNA-seq profiles with ARACNe (Basso et al. Nat Genet 2005). Using this network, we measured protein activity for each sample via VIPER (Alvarez et al., Nat Genet 2016). Activity-based clustering identified 2 clusters, characterized by significant overall survival difference (&#62;1 year, p-val=0.02 by &#967;<sup>2<\/sup><sub> <\/sub>analysis). Protein activity signatures were not significantly associated with tumor location and Histone3 mutation status. The most aberrantly activated MR proteins across all DMG patients (i.e., TOP2A, CENPF, BUB1B, FOXM1, GTSE1, MKI67, and E2F8), relative to normal caudate tissue from GTEx, were highly enriched in cell cycle regulation members, with samples in the worst outcome cluster showing significantly higher activity. Pharmacologically accessible MRs found to be significantly activated in subsets of patients (p-val&#60;10E-5) include TOP2A, CHEK1, CDK2, and EZH2.<br \/>To dissect DMG intra-tumor heterogeneity, we measured protein activity from published single-cell RNA-seq profiles of 6 DMG patients, using single-cell based regulatory networks. Activity-based analysis of tumor cells identified 8 clusters representing distinct differentiation and proliferation stages&#8212;i.e. astrocyte-like, oligodendrocyte-like, and multiple oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-like subpopulations. Consistent with bulk-based findings, these included an OPC-like-cycling population presenting highly aberrant activity of proliferative MRs (<i>i.e. <\/i>TOP2A, CENPF, FOXM1, E2F8, ZWINT, and CCNA2), suggesting this as a key DMG regulatory module (Tumor Checkpoint). We are working to define targetable MRs in these subpopulations, and generating RNA-seq profiles of SU-DIPG-VI and SF8628, two DMG cell lines showing protein activity similarity to &#62;95% of patient samples by enrichment analysis (p-val &#60; 10E-5), following perturbation with ~400 oncology drugs. This will allow us to identify drugs capable of inducing tumor demise by inverting the activity of the MRs of each tumor subpopulation, using the NY Dept. of Health approved OncoTreat algorithm (Alvarez et al., Nat Genet 2018). We are currently finalizing and validating both MR and drug predictions to nominate novel, much-needed therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30881529-c5f7-45e2-8be7-59d873a0a69c\/@z03B8ZAF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Network biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA-seq,Brain tumors,Systems biology,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14824"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ester Calvo Fernández<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junqiang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron T.

RNAseq profiles were generated in four sarcoma cell lines following perturbation with ~400 oncology drugs, and used to identify drugs capable of inverting MR activity profiles with the OncoTreat algorithm. Unsupervised, protein activity-based clustering of the samples identified two clusters, characterized by a significant overall survival difference (76% vs 38%, log-rank p-val 0.0041). Patients in the high-risk cluster presented aberrant activity of proteins involved in cell cycle (FOXM1, CENPF, TOP2A) and epigenetic remodeling (EZH2, KDM1A), while those in the low-risk cluster had aberrant activity of proteins involved in immune response (VAV1, CD86, CEBPE), interferon gama signaling (IRF5, MNDA), and senescence control (CREG1, TFEC). We further identified patients with metastatic disease and particularly poor outcome (&#60;15% survival) showing high activity in stem cell-related proteins NANOG, ZSCAN4, and LIN28A. To address intra-tumor heterogeneity and immune infiltration (40-60% in the samples) in bulk RNAseq data, we inferred protein activity in previously published single-cell RNAseq profiles from 11 OS patients, using regulatory networks also produced by single-cell analysis. We identified three tumor subpopulations, co-existing in all the samples, with lineage similarity to osteoblasts, chondroblasts, and fibroblasts. The most active MR proteins (p-val &#60; 10E-30) were highly distinct across these subpopulations: NANOG, REL, IGF2, TOP2A (osteoblasts), SSTR3, WNT1, KDM6B, EZH2 (chondroblasts), and NOD1, ERBB3, PRKDC, INSR (fibroblasts). Pharmacologically accessible MRs significantly active across the three subpopulations and in subsets of bulk RNAseq samples included EZH2, CDK2, TOP2A, HDAC5, and PRKDC. OncoTreat analysis predicted sensitivity to camptothecin, seliciclib, galunisertib, and rigosertib in both fibroblast- and chondroblast-like subpopulations. In conclusion, using network-based systems biology approaches in OS, we identified pharmacologically accessible MR subtypes differentiating survival at the bulk tissue level, and defining three distinct tumor subpopulations at the single-cell level with unique predicted drug sensitivities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/31c7d6eb-9df8-40dd-9f70-788363a4f307\/@z03B8ZAF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Network biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Systems biology,Cancer,Pediatric cancers,Osteosarcoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14826"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Somnath Tagore<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jovana Pavisic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron T.

To fill the gap, we propose a novel computational pipeline which collects potent disease gene cooperative pathways to envision individualized disease etiology and therapies. Our algorithm constructs individualized disease modules <i>de novo<\/i> which enable us to elucidate the importance of mutated genes in specific patients and to understand the synthetic penetrance of these genes across patients. We reveal that importance of notorious cancer drivers TP53 and PIK3CA fluctuate widely across breast cancers and peak in tumors with distinct numbers of mutations, and that rarely mutated genes such as XPO1 and PLEKHA1 have high disease module importance in specific individuals. Furthermore, individualized module disruption enables us to devise customized singular and combinatorial target therapies which were highly varied across patients demonstrating the need for precision therapeutics pipelines. As the first analysis of <i>de novo<\/i> individualized disease modules, we illustrate the power of individualized disease modules for precision medicine by providing deep novel insights on the activity of diseased genes in individuals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/90f512f7-5f32-476d-8e6e-0bd29b70bf31\/@z03B8ZAF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Network biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Systems biology,Biomarkers,Pharmacogenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14829"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Taylor Weiskittel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Correia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Choong Ung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hu Li<\/i><\/presenter>.
