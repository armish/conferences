[{"Abstract":"Under physiological conditions, the extracellular concentrations of adenosine are low, however, levels dramatically increase under metabolically stressful conditions, including inflammation and cancer. The regulatory functions of adenosine are mediated through four members of the adenosine receptor family: A<sub>1<\/sub>, A<sub>2A<\/sub>, A<sub>2B<\/sub>, and A<sub>3<\/sub>. While A<sub>2A<\/sub> was considered the major contributor to adenosine-mediated suppression of T cell, natural killer cell, and myeloid cell functions, A<sub>2B<\/sub> has also recently emerged as a potential modulator of these processes. Both A<sub>2A<\/sub> and A<sub>2B<\/sub> signal through the same Gs-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase, which can allow the lower affinity A<sub>2B<\/sub> receptor to compensate for the inhibition of A<sub>2A<\/sub> in an adenosine-rich tumor microenvironment (TME). A<sub>2B<\/sub> receptors are also reported to support tumor growth independent of A<sub>2A<\/sub> through the Gq subunit of G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by myeloid and tumor cells. Therefore, simultaneous targeting of both the A<sub>2A<\/sub> and A<sub>2B<\/sub> receptors may provide a higher potential for cancer immunotherapy in an adenosine-rich TME, where A<sub>2B<\/sub> can act in compensatory or complementary means to A<sub>2A<\/sub>. M1069 is a small-molecule, dual antagonist of the A<sub>2A<\/sub> and A<sub>2B<\/sub> adenosine receptors with a selectivity of &#62;100 fold against the A<sub>1<\/sub> and A<sub>3<\/sub> receptors. In assays with primary human T cells, M1069 caused a dose-dependent suppression of 5&#8242;-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (stable analog of adenosine)-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and phosphorylated cAMP- response element binding protein (pCREB) induction and rescue of interleukin (IL)-2 production (A<sub>2A <\/sub>readout). M1069 also suppressed VEGF production from human macrophages (A<sub>2B <\/sub>readout) in adenosine-rich settings. M1069 exhibited superior suppression of protumorigenic cytokine secretion, including CXCL1, CXCL5 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and the rescue of IL12 secretion from adenosine-differentiated dendritic cells, as compared to an A<sub>2A<\/sub>selective antagonist. In addition, in a one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, adenosine-differentiated dendritic cells treated with M1069 demonstrated superior T cell activation compared to adenosine-differentiated dendritic cells treated with an A<sub>2A<\/sub>-selective antagonist. These findings were further corroborated with the results from <i>in vivo<\/i> studies in a murine CD73<sup>hi<\/sup>\/adenosine-rich 4T1 syngeneic breast tumor model, in which M1069, but not an A<sub>2A<\/sub>-selective antagonist, reduced tumor growth as a monotherapy and enhanced anti-tumor activity with chemotherapeutic agents. In summary, M1069 is a potent, dual A<sub>2A<\/sub>\/A<sub>2B<\/sub> adenosine receptor antagonist, which is expected to counteract immune-suppressive mechanisms in the presence of high concentrations of adenosine and enhance the anti-tumor activity of chemotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a349e1ac-91b6-4712-977d-7c0f8bc8a8f3\/@G03B8ZGG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17069"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rinat Zaynagetdinov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kai Schiemann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kalyan Nallaparaju<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalya Belousova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Armine Matevossian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhouxiang Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgio Kradjian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meghana Pandya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nemisha Dawra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva-Maria Krauel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elissaveta Petrova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Poeschke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Fischer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Lecomte<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andree Blaukat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bayard Huck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacques Moisan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Targeting CD47-SIRP&#945; axis is emerging as one of the promising new immunotherapy approaches that targets innate immune response. Number of clinical trials are in progress to evaluate CD47\/SIRP&#945; blocking therapies. Most of these molecules are either anti-CD47 antibodies or SIRP&#945;-Fc recombinant proteins. We have developed a novel small molecule CD47 antagonist, AUR103 as a therapeutic agent for solid and hematological cancers. AUR103 is efficacious as a single agent in tumors with high expression of &#8220;eat-me&#8221; signals and synergizes well in combination with tumor-targeting antibodies. We hypothesized that agents capable of inducing &#8220;eat-me&#8221; signals such as calreticulin (CRT) a pro-phagocytic signal, will synergize with AUR103 to enhance phagocytosis and antitumor activity. Here, we report the anti-tumor efficacy of AUR103 in combination with azacytidine and bortezomib in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma model of cancer, respectively.In the phagocytosis assay, HL-60 human myeloid leukemia or NCI-H929 human multiple myeloma cells were treated with azacytidine or bortezomib for 48 hours. Cells were stained with CFSE and were further treated with AUR103. Cells were then added to human macrophages and allowed to undergo phagocytosis. Phagocytosis of target cells was measured by detecting cells that were double positive for APC and CFSE by FACS. HL-60 cells were orthotopically implanted in NOD SCID mice while NCI-H929 multiple myeloma cells were sub-cutaneously implanted in NOD SCID mice. Tumor bearing mice were treated with AUR103 (10 and 30 mg\/kg, b.i.d, and po) as a single agent or in combination with azacytidine (5 mg\/kg i.p., twice weekly) or bortezomib (0.4 mg\/kg i.v., twice weekly). AUR103 in combination with azacytidine and bortezomib significantly enhanced phagocytosis of HL-60 and NCI-H929 tumor cells, respectively when compared to individual treatments. In the combination efficacy studies, AUR103 combination treatments with azacytidine and bortezomib were well tolerated without any signs of toxicity. In the HL-60 orthotopic model, AUR103 combination with azacytidine significantly reduced the engraftment of HL-60 tumor cells. AUR103 combination with bortezomib resulted in enhanced tumor growth inhibition in NCI-H929 tumor model when compared to individual treatments. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of AUR103 in combination with agents that are capable of inducing &#8220;eat-me&#8221; or pro-phagocytic signals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/28e56292-2216-4080-a1eb-c8f0276eb89a\/@G03B8ZGG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Immuno-oncology,Small molecule drugs,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17070"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Girish C.

Immunostimulatory gene therapy using oncolytic viruses (OVs) has been developed as a new promising cancer therapy for its capacity to induce an anti-tumor immune response and sensitize the non-responding patients to checkpoint blockade therapy. Lokon adenoviruses (LOAds) are serotype 5\/35 oncolytic adenoviruses that in addition to their oncolytic capacity encode for immunostimulatory molecules. Here we have evaluated the anti-tumor effects of trimerized membrane-bound (TMZ)-CD40L-armed LOAd700 and TMZ-CD40L\/4-1BBL-armed LOAd703 in a variety of solid tumors to understand the underlying tumor modulating mechanisms. A panel of eight different human solid cancer cell lines (T24, PEA2, Mel526, H727, Skov3, MiaPaca2, H29 and A549) was infected with LOAd(-), a virus without transgenes, LOAd700 or LOAd703 and assessed for their response in different assays. MTS assay was used to measure the cell viability, flow cytometry for evaluating the cell surface markers and luminescent assay for measuring apoptosis (caspase 3\/7 activity). LOAd viruses efficiently killed all tested cell lines. However, the oncolytic capacity of CD40L-armed LOAd700 and LOAd703 was significantly higher than LOAd(-) in two cell lines, T24 and PEA2, which were found to express the CD40 receptor. Death receptor TRAIL-R1 was significantly upregulated in T24 infected with LOAd703 and PEA2 infected with either LOAd700 or LOAd703. TRAIL-R2 was upregulated post LOAd infection in 7\/8 cell lines where the upregulation was significant in T24, PEA2 and H29. Interestingly, the immunogenic cell death marker calreticulin, a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) known as an &#8220;eat-me&#8221; signal to dendritic cells, was upregulated post LOAd infection in all cell lines. The increase in calreticulin level was statistically significant in 4\/8 cell lines (T24, PEA2, Mel526 and H29) post LOAd700 and\/or LOAd703 infection. Furthermore, LOAd700 and LOAd703 increased the effector caspase 3\/7 activity in 5\/8 cell lines (T24, PEA2, Mel526, Skov3 and MiaPaCa2) indicating an augmented apoptosis level. In conclusion, CD40L-armed LOAd viruses were, in addition to their high oncolytic capacity, demonstrated to induce apoptosis. Upregulation of cell surface calreticulin as well as the death receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2 indicated generation of a more immunogenic phenotype of cancer cells. Thus, our findings suggest that CD40L-armed LOAd viruses could be inducers of apoptosis and immunogenic cell death in a variety of cancer types with an augmented effect in cancer cells expressing the CD40 receptor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e5cb75b0-69f2-46e4-b917-70f61f710d5e\/@G03B8ZGG\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Immunotherapy,Immunogenic cell death,CD40,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17071"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sedigheh Naseri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariela Mejia Cordova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Wenthe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ann-Charlotte Hellström<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanja Lövgren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelica Loskog<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Eriksson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gustav Ullenhag<\/i><\/presenter>.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of targets that mediate the initial cellular response to external pathogens or endogenous alarmins, activating downstream pro-inflammatory cascades and leading to the activation and recruitment of key innate subsets. TLR2 is a cell surface receptor, expressed predominantly on macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), neutrophils and subsets of NK and T cells. TLR2 signaling plays important role in NK and T cell cytolytic cell functions, as well as DC and macrophage activation. AXA-042 is a novel synthetic TLR2\/6 agonist designed for systemic delivery to re-engage the innate immune response to help overcome tumour immune escape.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: <i>In vitro<\/i> potency and selectivity of AXA-042 was assessed across a panel of human and mouse HEK-blue TLR reporter assays.

By leveraging an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) strategy, systemic administration of a STING agonist with tumor-targeted delivery can be achieved, potentially overcoming limitations of either intratumoral or intravenous administrations of unconjugated, small molecule STING agonists. XMT-2056 was generated through conjugation of Immunosynthen, a platform that employs a novel STING agonist payload specifically designed for ADCs, to HT-19, a HER2-targeting antibody which binds to a novel epitope and does not compete for binding with either trastuzumab or pertuzumab. Initial results showed XMT-2056 has target-dependent anti-tumor activity in vivo and is well tolerated in non-human primates at significantly higher exposure levels than those required for anti-tumor activity. To evaluate the impact of HER2 expression level on the activity of XMT-2056, in vivo studies in gastric and breast cancer models with varying HER2 expression levels were conducted, and XMT-2056 showed potent anti-tumor activity in a dose dependent and target dependent manner including in models with very low expression of HER2. Because the antibody employed in XMT-2056 does not compete for binding with trastuzumab or pertuzumab, we hypothesized that there could be benefit in combining with such approved HER2-targeted therapies. This advantage was demonstrated in vivo as the combination of XMT-2056 and trastuzumab or pertuzumab showed greater anti-tumor activity compared to the administration of either agent alone. Further efforts to elucidate the mechanism(s) of the observed benefit of these combinations will be discussed. Given the innate immune activation by XMT-2056, there is also a strong rationale for combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. To this end, administration of an XMT-2056 surrogate ADC in combination with an anti-PD1 agent improved anti-tumor activity in a ratHER2-engineered EMT-6 syngeneic mouse model. Together these data support the potential of XMT-2056 both as a monotherapy and in combination with other HER2 targeted agents as well as checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ab4af8b4-3e36-417f-aa71-5ac1e044dc46\/@H03B8ZGH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Immuno-oncology,Innate immunity,STING,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17073"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeremy R.

However, free cytokines have short half-life and the lack of tumor targeting often results in systemic toxicity. IL-15 is a stimulatory cytokine that shares the common beta and gamma receptors with IL-2. In contrast to IL-2, IL-15 is more selective for NK and effector memory T cells, with less proliferative effect on Tregs, making it a more preferred therapeutic candidate for cancer. QL415 is an anti-PD-L1 x IL-15 fusion protein designed to enhance tumor accumulation and prolong blood circulation, thereby widening the therapeutic window. IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha sushi domain are covalently linked to the C-terminus of our proprietary PD-L1 antibody. Fc-mediated effector functions were ablated using mutations in the CH2 domain, to prevent depletion of effector immune cells. In vitro studies showed QL415 to be highly potent in promoting proliferation and pSTAT5 signaling of IL-15 -responding NK92 and M07e cells. QL415 selectively induced proliferation of NK and CD8+ T cells from human PBMC in vitro and mouse CD8+ and NK1.1 cells in vivo. In a MC38 mouse colon cancer model expressing human PD-L1, QL401 was highly effective in suppressing tumor growth, in contrast to PD-L1 monoclonal antibody or a non-targeted IL-15 control. Follow up tumor rechallenge study showed protective memory against cognate MC38 but not B16F10. In a separate MC38 tumor model using a mouse surrogate molecule of QL415, immunophenotyping of antigen presenting cells offered preliminary evidence of enrichment of conventional dendritic cells 1 in the tumor draining lymph nodes. Therefore, QL415 not only directly stimulates effector immune cells, but also indirectly through antigen presenting cells, promotes robust anti-tumor response. In non-human primates, Q415 was tolerated up to 1.5 mg\/kg, well above the effective therapeutic dose. In light of these favorable preclinical efficacy and safety results, a phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study has been initiated to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and early efficacy of QL415.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f8cd339-608f-45b5-a603-0afb6300f0ac\/@H03B8ZGH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,IL-15,PD-L1,Fusion proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17074"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Irene Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Schwimmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenda Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wei Prior<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arianne Capacio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hieu V.

Moreover, anti-tumor immunity is typically driven through multiple cytokines acting in concert in a local tumor microenvironment (TME) via autocrine or paracrine signaling. Yet most cytokine therapies focus on systemic delivery of individual cytokines causing adverse events without achieving therapeutic doses at the tumor site. Recently, intratumoral (IT) delivery of cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-12 anchored to collagen in the TME has resulted in promising anti-tumor efficacy with minimal toxicity in multiple murine tumor models, and remarkably also in spontaneously occurring large canine tumors (unpublished data). Cullinan Amber is developing CLN-617, a fusion protein that uniquely combines IL-2 and IL-12 with albumin and a collagen-binding domain in a single polypeptide. CLN-617 aims to increase cytokine persistence and retention in the TME upon IT administration and thus improve tolerability. Data presented in this abstract is generated using a murine surrogate, mCLN-617.<br \/>mCLN-617 retains bioactivity of both IL-2 and IL-12 in the presence of collagen binding. Upon IT injection into B16F10 tumor-bearing mice, systemic drug levels of mCLN-617 were &#38;lt 5% compared to mice dosed via intravenous (IV) administration. When IL-2\/IL-12 fusion proteins lacking a collagen-binding domain were injected IT in B16F10-bearing mice, 60% of mice were euthanized due to severe body weight loss, whereas mCLN-617-treated mice maintained their body weight. In checkpoint-refractory B16F10 and MC38 models, mCLN-617 demonstrated 95% tumor growth inhibition and 100% CRs, respectively. All mice cured of their primary MC38 tumors were either protected from re-challenge or showed delayed tumor growth kinetics. Notably, 70% CRs were observed in the MC38 model after a single-dose treatment of mCLN-617. In mice bearing dual-flank MC38 tumors, only one of which was treated IT, 90% of treated tumors and 100% of distal untreated tumors were eliminated when mCLN-617 was combined with an anti-PD1 antibody, demonstrating a curative abscopal response. Of note, mCLN-617 monotherapy in the treated tumor also significantly delayed the growth of distal untreated tumors. Our human lead candidate CLN-617 is produced at high titers in CHO cells and is currently in IND enabling studies.<br \/>We have demonstrated that the use of collagen-binding domains for tumor retention enables safe and effective delivery of a combination of IL-2 and IL-12 in a single multifunctional molecule. The strong anti-tumor efficacy of mCLN-617 as a monotherapy and significant deepening of responses in combination with checkpoint blockade, together with a favorable tolerability profile, supports future clinical development of CLN-617.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cd3bf3cb-d360-4da5-8338-0ac41e846987\/@H03B8ZGH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Interleukin-12,Interleukin-2,Immunostimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17075"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Naveen K.

NK cells express multiple inhibitory and activating surface receptors, including the activating receptor, NKG2D. Engagement of NKG2D by the stress-induced ligands MICA\/MICB stimulates NK cell activation and subsequent target cell lysis. While MICA\/MICB expression is restricted in normal tissues, expression is strongly induced upon viral infection, genotoxic stress or malignant transformation. In cancer patients, the tumor microenvironment (TME) facilitates evasion of immune surveillance by NK cells. One mechanism by which tumor cells can escape NKG2D-mediated lysis is via proteolytic release of MICA\/MICB from the cell surface due to proteases present in the TME. High concentrations of shed MICA have been observed in serum from patients across multiple tumor types and correlate with poor survival. In mouse models, expression of MICA on tumor cells delayed tumor growth, while the absence of NKG2D accelerated tumor growth. Given the established role of the MICA\/MICB-NKG2D axis in the immune surveillance of tumor cells, a therapeutic agent that effectively restores this axis is a compelling approach to harness the immune system for treating cancer. CLN-619 is a humanized anti-MICA\/MICB monoclonal IgG1 antibody being developed for the treatment of multiple cancer indications. The antibody was selected based on its high-affinity binding to MICA\/MICB, potent in vitro activity and robust anti-tumor activity in xenograft models. MICA\/MICB is highly polymorphic, with &#62;150 MICA and 47 MICB alleles in humans, and expression level, binding affinity to NKG2D, and degree of MICA\/MICB shedding is thought to be allele-dependent. CLN-619 demonstrated high affinity binding to all common allelic variants of MICA, including the most prevalent MICA allele, MICA*008, and the canonical allelic variant of MICB. CLN-619 was able to prevent proteolytic cleavage of MICA\/MICB as evidenced by the reduction of shed MICA\/MICB in cell culture supernatants and the corresponding increase in surface MICA\/MICB on cancer cells. In addition to the ability to restore the MICA\/MICB-NKG2D axis, CLN-619 enhanced the binding of MICA to NKG2D on NK cells. This was enabled by both Fc&#947;R engagement on NK cells as well as an intrinsic enhancement of MICA binding to NKG2D. Finally, CLN-619 was shown to elicit potent ADCC of MICA\/MICB expressing tumor cells. Consistent with the multimodal mechanisms of action described above, CLN-619 treatment resulted in robust anti-tumor activity at low doses in mice bearing MICA\/MICB-expressing human tumor xenografts. Given the pan-cancer expression of MICA\/MICB in both solid and hematological malignancies, CLN-619 is expected to have broad anti-tumor activity. CLN-619 is currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b922ea64-e686-4a47-8e8c-38bfa6e5bf53\/@H03B8ZGH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,MICA\/MICB,Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17076"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kerry A.

PDAC often presents at advanced tumor stages, resulting in poor survival rates. Immunotherapies such as inhibition of programmed death 1 (PD1) are effective in many cancers, but not in PDAC. HMB is a leucine metabolite that reduces PDAC progression and cachexia in association with enhanced antitumor immune responses. The purpose of this study was to determine if HMB treatment enhances immunotherapeutic response in PDAC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: C57BL\/6J mice bearing subcutaneously transplanted PANC02 tumors were fed either a control (AIN93G) or HMB (1% w\/w) supplemented diet. Once tumors were palpable, mice were randomized for treatment with vehicle or anti-PD1 immunotherapy (n=12-13\/group). Tumors were harvested and global transcriptomic analysis was performed.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Both HMB and anti-PD1 interventions alone were insufficient to reduce tumor growth. However, the combination of HMB and anti-PD1 resulted in significantly smaller tumors than the anti-PD1 alone group, indicating that HMB was able to stimulate PDAC response to ICI. Transcriptomic analysis revealed limited transcriptional effects attributable to immunosurveillance following treatment with either HMB or anti-PD1 alone; however, the combination produced a robust antitumor immune response. Digital cytometry analysis revealed altered immune cell composition in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: The combination of HMB with anti-PD1 treatment elicited significant antitumor responses in a murine model of PDAC progression. Given that immunotherapy trials in PDAC have not yet proven effective, even when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy, our preclinical findings support clinical evaluation of combined ICI and HMB regimens as a therapeutic strategy against PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2746a1c6-56b8-4361-99e7-afb905f14ce9\/@H03B8ZGH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,PD-1,HMB,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17077"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Suhas K.

Interleukin 10 (IL10) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promote tumor initiation and spread, in part, through TAM polarization and MDSC recruitment. C\/EBP&#946; is a critical transcription factor that regulates the immunosuppressive state of TAMs and MDSCs and is activated by IL10 and PGE2 signaling. We developed a proprietary engineered exosome loaded with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting C\/EBP&#946; (exoASO-C\/EBP&#946;), that selectively delivers ASO to TAMs and MDSCs, thereby inhibiting C\/EBP&#946; expression and inducing reprogramming from an immunosuppressive (M2) to a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype.<br \/>Results: exoASO-C\/EBP&#946;<i> <\/i>demonstrated dose-dependent target gene knockdown (KD) in<i> <\/i>primary human M2 macrophages<i> in vitro<\/i> with a 2-fold higher potency (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) compared to free ASO. C\/EBP&#946; KD resulted in profound changes in gene expression and cytokine secretion profile consistent with reprogramming to a M1 phenotype. exoASO-C\/EBP&#946; induced a significant induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in M2 macrophages generated with IL10 or PGE2, both of which show prominent activation of the C\/EBP&#946; pathway. Biodistribution in tumor-bearing mice (IT and IV) demonstrate selective uptake by MDSCs and TAMs. Intra-tumoral (IT) administration of exoASO-C\/EBP&#946; in CT26 tumors resulted in a significantly higher KD of C\/EBP&#946; in tumor-associated CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> cells, as compared to CD11b<sup>- <\/sup>cells. Additionally, exoASO-C\/EBP&#946; induced changes in <i>Nos2<\/i>, <i>CD206<\/i> and <i>Csf1r<\/i> mRNA expression in CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> cells, demonstrating <i>in vivo<\/i> M2 to M1 reprogramming. Furthermore, IT microinjections of exoASO-C\/EBP&#946; in YUMM1.7 tumor-bearing mice resulted in a significant induction of pro-inflammatory M1 markers TNF&#945; and iNOS, in contrast, free C\/EBP&#946; ASO showed limited increase in M1 markers. exoASO-C\/EBP&#946; administered IT as a single agent demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor models including: the CT26-colorectal cancer (60% complete responses (CRs)), MB49-bladder cancer (70% CRs) and B16F10-melanoma (30% CRs). Combination treatment with anti-PD1 in all these models further increased the anti-tumor efficacy. Finally, we used a myeloid cell specific C\/EBP&#946;\/PGE2\/IL10 gene signature to identify cancer indications where exoASO-C\/EBP&#946; therapy might have the most therapeutic significance.<br \/>Conclusion: exoASO-C\/EBP&#946; is a novel therapeutic candidate that selectively targets and attenuates a critical transcription factor in immunosuppressive myeloid cells, resulting in reprogramming of TAMs and potent anti-tumor activity across multiple TAM-rich mouse models as a monotherapy.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/49d101ef-3452-493a-b152-e7927aed8826\/@H03B8ZGH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Tumor associated macrophages,Antisense oligonucleotides,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17078"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sushrut Kamerkar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charan Leng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Burenkova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>SuChul Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelvin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanyan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Dahlberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyriakos Economides<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Soos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dalia Burzyn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sriram Sathyanarayanan<\/i><\/presenter>.

PDAC is resistant to most chemotherapy mostly due to a high amount of stroma and low vascularity. Additionally, PDAC is resistant to the newer immunotherapies due to the lack of immune cells and\/or the presence of exhausted T-cells. Expression of WNT pathway genes allows cancer to avoid the immune system by affecting immune cell activation and migration into the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we investigate Immune activation and migration by co-culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with PDAC spheroids in the presence of SM04690 (CLK\/WNTi). SM04690 is a potent CLK and downstream WNT signaling inhibitor. The migration of PBMCs into PDAC spheroids were analyzed by FLOW cell cytometry and fluorescence confocal microscopy. The total CD3+ T cell population remained unchanged in the presence of SM04690, however, T cell subpopulations were affected by WNT inhibition. The total CD4+ T cell population in the spheroid co-culture was significantly increased while the CD8+ population was significantly reduced. Among the CD4+ T cell population, there was a significant increase in CCR7+CD45RA- central memory cells and CCR7-CD45RA- effector memory cells, while there was a significant decrease in FoxP3+CD25+ regulatory T cells. Surface expression of PD-L1 and HLA-DR on PDAC cells were also significantly increased compared to the untreated co-culture control. Fluorescent labeled PDAC and PBMCs allow clear quantification of immune infiltration through spheroid and Matrigel organoid systems. Genes associated with b-catenin destruction complex (AXIN1 and 2, APC, GSK3A) and transcription factors associated with gene expression (TCF7 and TCF7L1) were also significantly reduced in the drug treatment. Additional studies are ongoing investigating the role cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) play in the tumor microenvironment in the presence of SM04690 (CLK\/WNTi). WNT inhibition can be a potent immune modulator and influence surface marker expression on the tumor. This can lead to future drug combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors or drug combinations taking advantage of expression changes. Future directions involve utilizing PRO-seq to identify enhancer RNAs and immediate transcriptional effects of WNT inhibition, identify novel targets for combination therapy, and in vivo PDAC humanized animal models studying the effects in the presence of an autologous immune system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ead336a0-9f90-423f-9c9b-9dd4199167ef\/@H03B8ZGH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Organoids,Wnt pathway,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17079"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adrian TA Dominguez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adreanna G.

SOT201 is developed for immunotherapeutic treatment of various types of cancers. The activity of SOT201 is based on spatiotemporal reinvigorating of anti-tumor immune responses by disrupting co-inhibitory T-cell signaling by blocking PD-1 and synergistically activating adaptive as well as innate immunity by IL-15-mediated signaling via the IL-2\/IL-15&#946;&#947; receptor on T cells, NK, NKT, and &#947;&#948; T cells. SOT201 showed a superior potentiation of T cell stimulation over pembrolizumab in mixed lymphocyte reaction <i>in vitro<\/i>. Studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed that decreased affinity of IL-15 mutein in SOT201 for its IL-15R&#946;&#947; is well optimized to ensure favorable pharmacokinetic properties while inducing strong CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cell and NK cell activation and expansion. Synergistic action on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activation of both anti-PD-1 and RLI-15 moieties was confirmed using mouse surrogate SOT201 molecules <i>in vivo<\/i>. Strong anti-tumor efficacy after SOT201 treatment was achieved in a human PD-1 transgenic mouse model implanted with the MC38-hPD-L1 cell line. These data represent a promising therapeutic candidate molecule leveraging the synergistic concerted action of anti-PD-1 blockage and simultaneous immune cell activation directed preferentially to the high PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T cell tumor environment.

However, rapid absorption from IT sites, short terminal half-life and adverse outcomes caused withdrawal of ADU-S100 from clinical trials. We reported development of BCG-STING, a preclinical candidate for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) that overexpresses a bioactive STING agonist (c-di-AMP) and shows enhanced antitumor efficacy over BCG-WT by increasing tumor infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and inflammatory macrophages. The similar mechanism of action prompted us to compare antitumor efficacy of BCG-STING with ADU-S100 in an IT as well as intravesical (IV) dosing regimen.<br \/>Methods: Syngeneic MB49 flank tumors in C57BL\/6 female mice received IT treatment of BCG-WT, BCG-STING (5 x 10<sup>6<\/sup>CFU) or ADU-S100 (100, 50 or 25 mg). Endpoint involved tumor volume measurement and flow-cytometry based tumor immune infiltrate analyses (at 100 &#956;g). MNU carcinogen rat model of NMIBC and the standard IV administration regimen was used for BCG-WT or BCG-STING (5 x 10<sup>6 <\/sup>CFU, 6x weekly) or ADU-S100 (25 &#956;g, 6x weekly). Tumor involvement index (TII) and pathological tumor staging tumor involvement index were determined using histopathological analyses of MNU rat bladders.<br \/>Results: IT administration of ADU-S100 in MB49 tumor remained most-effective immunotherapy as compared to BCG-WT or BCG-STING even at lowest dose (25 &#956;g), consistent with strongest infiltration of TNF-&#945;+MHCII+F4\/80+CD11b+ macrophages and IFN-&#947;+CD8+ T cells as compared to BCG-STING or BCG-WT. Strikingly, we observe a significant increase in immunosuppressive IL-10+ and ARG-1+ Ly6C(hi)Ly6G(-) monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) in MB49 tumors treated with ADU-S100 and BCG-WT, but not BCG-STING. In contrast to MB49 model, IV induction course of BCG-STING in MNU rat model showed the greatest antitumor effects with only 5% residual TII compared to 30% in ADU-S100 or 42% in BCG-WT. Tumor staging displayed residual T1 (50%), CIS (25%) and Ta (25%) tumors in ADU-S100 group, while BCG-WT treated group showed a lower degree of invasion to the lamina propria with CIS (50%), T1 (25%) and Ta (25%) residual tumors. BCG-STING IV therapy resulted in 60% of rat bladders showing complete tumor regression while 40% had minimal residual non-invasive tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: The varying therapeutic outcomes of IT vs IV treatment regimens of ADU-S100 over BCG-STING or BCG-WT in different urothelial carcinoma models suggest the important role of varying tumor microenvironment and dosing regimens on relative antitumor efficacy. Increased percentage of immunosuppressive M-MDSCs specifically in response to ADU-S100 or BCG-WT suggests unique advantages associated with BCG-STING.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Bacterial therapy,Solid tumors,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17081"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alok K.

Here we have applied a long-term treatment with STING agonist and PD-1 inhibitors alone and in combination towards eliciting enhanced host immune response to combat GBM progression. To address these questions we generated mouse models of GBM by intracranial implantation of a murine GBM stem cell line or orthotopic CRISPR induced mutation to astrocytes. Systemic administration of STING agonist crosses the blood-brain barrier and induces a type-1 IFN signature in the brain and this was further enhanced in the tumor milieu. Treatment outcomes were addressed by MRi and treated animals showed a significant reduction in tumor volume and hence improved survival in comparison to the animals in the control group. Histochemical evaluation of tumor samples from the animals that received treatment showed elevated necrosis and aberrant\/leaky vasculature in comparison to the control tumor samples. The presence of cytotoxic T-cells were similar between the groups but activated PD-1 positive T-cells were increased in treated tumors. Ex-vivo analysis of isolated T-cells from tumor baring mice confirms cytotoxic T-cells targeting the GBM cells. In conclusion, application of STING agonist promotes alteration of vasculitis and priming of T-cells in GBM results in increased survival and decreased tumor progression. These results reveal that GBM can be targeted by immune therapy through systemic activation of STING\/IFN pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d6a3f2a6-cad4-4fbe-93e9-ffa60dbf5773\/@z03B8ZGJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,CRISPR\/Cas9,Mouse models,STING,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17082"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Justin V.

Despite promising signs of activity, the clinical utility of IL-2 is limited due to severe treatment-associated toxicities including vascular leak syndrome and the concurrent expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which blunts efficacy. We developed a<b> <\/b>molecular targeted cytokine (MTC) platform that combines an engineered IL-2 variant with reduced affinity for the IL-2 receptor and high affinity single-domain antibodies (sdAb) to restrict IL-2 receptor signaling to cells expressing the target antigen (termed cis-signaling).<br \/>INBRX-121 is an MTC designed to deliver IL-2 to NK cells using an NKp46-specific sdAb as the targeting moiety. In vitro, INBRX-121 induces dose-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation in NK cells with comparable potency to wild-type IL-2, while showing no NKp46-independent activity at concentrations of more than three magnitudes higher than that required for NK cell activity. INBRX-121 enhances NK cell activation and cytotoxic capacity, thereby reducing the NK-to-target cell ratio as well as the target receptor density needed for optimal tumor cell killing. Furthermore, INBRX-121 lowers the threshold for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and increases maximal target cell killing in combination with ADCC-competent antibodies to an extent that may lessen the need for Fc engineering to enhance binding to the low affinity CD16A variant. <i>In vivo<\/i>, INBRX-121 demonstrates potent anti-tumor activity with increased intra-tumoral NK cell accumulation and upregulation of NK cell activation markers. INBRX-121 monotherapy reduces primary tumor growth and the formation of metastasis, while combination with ADCC-competent antibodies further increases NK cell activity to convert tumor growth suppression into complete tumor elimination. INBRX-121 is well tolerated in rodents and non-human primates and no overt signs of toxicity have been observed in cynomolgus monkeys up to the highest administered dose of 30 mg\/kg.<br \/>Our MTC platform provides a novel path to overcoming the limitations of IL-2 therapy through the pinpointed delivery of IL-2 activity to target cells of interest. In the case of INBRX-121 this ensures potent enhancement of the naturally broad anti-tumor activity of NK cells, which have distinct advantages over T cell therapeutics. Unlike T cells, tumor recognition by NK cells is independent of MHC-presented antigens and can elicit immediate cytotoxic activity. Further, many of the toxicities associated with T cell therapeutics have not been observed with NK-centric treatments. INBRX-121 therefore provides a promising safe and efficacious treatment option for a broad array of cancer indications both as a monotherapy and in combination with ADCC-enabled antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6ee67fcc-ba93-4563-86ac-803f4bde93a5\/@z03B8ZGJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Cytokines,Antitumor activity,Immunostimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17083"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Heather Kinkead<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian J.

Recently, a two-step model of &#947;&#948; T cell activation has emerged, wherein one butyrophilin (BTN, i.e., BTN2A1) directly binds the &#947;&#948; TCR but is only activated if certain molecular patterns (e.g., phosphoantigens) facilitate recruitment of a second BTN (i.e., BTN3A1) into a complex to form a BTN2A1\/3A1 heterodimer. The BTN2A1\/3A1 complex specifically activates the V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells found in the peripheral blood in response to phosphoantigen build up in tumor cells. The unique mechanism of action and specificity of &#947;&#948; TCR\/BTN interactions suggests that therapeutic proteins comprising specific BTN heterodimers could be used to target specific &#947;&#948; T cell populations to tumor cells which lack expression of high affinity neoantigens or MHC class I molecules. In this study, we generated bispecific &#947;&#948; T cell engagers (GADLEN) containing heterodimeric BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 extracellular domains (ECD) fused via inert Fc linkers to scFv domains targeting a tumor-antigen (CD19 or CD33) to test their ability to modulate V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells and to promote tumor cell killing in co-culture assays. GADLEN induced proliferation, degranulation and cytokine production including IFN&#947; and TNF&#945; in V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells but requires co-stimulation of a natural cytotoxicity receptor (via anti-NKG2D) or T-cell co-stimulatory receptor (via anti-CD28), highlighting the parallels of signal 1 and signal 2 requirements of TCR activation in &#945;&#946;- and &#947;&#948;- T cells. In V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells and tumor co-culture assays, the addition of GADLEN alone enhanced killing of CD19<sup>+<\/sup> lymphoma cells such as Daudi and Raji, expressing known ligands for CD28 (e.g., CD80 and CD86). Similarly, GADLEN enhanced V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cell-mediated killing of K562 cells engineered to express CD19, which express MICA\/B (ligands for NKG2D) on the cell surface. In addition, the CD33-targeted GADLEN alone was able to specifically kill acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing CD33 and costimulatory ligands (e.g., CD80 and CD86) in a mechanism similar to the CD19-targeted GADLEN construct. These results highlight the ability of GADLENs in promoting targeted killing of tumor cells by providing the &#8220;active&#8221; heterodimeric BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 that is critical to enhance cytotoxic killing by V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells. Furthermore, this study provides mechanistic insights into BTN-mediated activation of V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells and offers proof of concept for using antigen-targeted butyrophilin heterodimeric fusion proteins for the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c7631710-2d15-44a2-ab59-5e089cfb8e48\/@z03B8ZGJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Immunotherapy,Fusion proteins,Lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17084"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anne Lai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arpita Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faraha Brewer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kinsley Evans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kellsey Johannes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louis Gonzalez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyung Jin Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Fromm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keith Wilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor H.

After processing of the inactive precursor within monocytes and macrophages, mature IL18 can promote the expansion, survival, and cytotoxicity of T and NK cells expressing its receptor subunits IL-18R&#945; (<i>IL18R1<\/i>) and IL18R&#946; (<i>IL18RAP<\/i>). Preclinical studies with recombinant IL18 have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in animal models, including impressive synergy with both immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T therapy. However, clinical development exhibited poor pharmacokinetics and an overall lack of efficacy despite heavy dosing. IL18 participates in a negative feedback loop with a very high affinity natural inhibitor, IL18 binding protein (IL18BP), whose expression is induced by IFN&#947;. As IL18BP upregulation was observed in early phase clinical trials, it likely limited the efficacy of recombinant IL18. Here, we have engineered next generation IL18 cytokines that aim to improve on the poor PK of WT and contend with IL18BP induction.<br \/>Prior work at Xencor demonstrated that reduced-potency IL15\/IL15R&#945;-Fc fusion proteins exhibited superior pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety in non-human primates through reduction of receptor-mediated clearance. Following that principle, we generated monovalent IL18-Fc fusions upon our XmAb&#174; heterodimeric Fc platform and introduced substitutions that could modulate IL18 stability, affinity toward the IL18 heterodimeric receptor, and affinity toward IL18BP. Initially, IL18-Fc was difficult to produce but yields improved to typical bispecific antibody levels after stabilization. An engineered disulfide bridge increased the WT thermal denaturation temperature from 45 &#176;C to 65 &#176;C, and demonstrated a significant improvement in serum clearance in mouse PK experiments. Variants at IL18 positions along the receptor and IL18BP interfaces were explored in vitro by measuring PD-L1 induction on KG-1 cells, with and without a high concentration of IL18BP. Recombining a select number of hits generated a potency series with variants exhibiting over a 2,000-fold reduction in PD-L1 induction potency as compared to WT IL18-Fc. Importantly, we identified variants that no longer detectably bound IL18BP, relieving natural inhibition of our engineered IL18-Fc. In vivo immune-mediated inflammation was explored in human PBMC engrafted mouse models of graft versus host disease (GvHD). We observed potency-dependent exacerbation of GvHD, with corresponding dramatic increases in the numbers and activation of T and NK cells as compared to a human PBMC only control. Analysis of serum from the study revealed up to 100-fold increases in IFN&#947; levels. Our engineered, reduced-potency IL18-Fc cytokines demonstrate robust inflammation activity in vivo, improved pharmacokinetics in mice, and insensitivity to IL18BP inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/54790e43-6e06-4273-a9e2-1bbc5a667799\/@z03B8ZGJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Immunostimulation,Immuno-oncology,Fusion proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17085"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alex Nisthal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung-Hyung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Bonzon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruschelle Love<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kendra N.

Reduced expansion of CD8+ T cells and other innate immune effector cells in the cancer draining SLN is associated with progression and resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. Cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are PD-L1+ suppress immune recognition at the level of the SLN. The experimental goal is to remodel the SLN to overcome cancer EV-associated immune suppression and induce immune rejection of the tumor. We developed three methodologies for this project: a) Collection of draining lymph fluid to characterize EVs shed by 4T1 syngeneic breast tumors growing in the mammary fat pad. b) Chromatographic separation and characterization of the repertoire of EVs shed by tumors into the tumor microenvironment interstitial space using western blotting, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy. c) Nanoparticle (NP) delivery of purified populations of EVs to the tumor draining SLN in combination with cytokine chemoattractants for innate immune cells recruitment. We characterized the <i>in vivo<\/i> interstitial fluid (IF) content of a GFP-4T1 syngeneic murine cancer model to study resident IF EVs transit to the draining lymph node. GFP labeling confirmed the IF EV tumor cell origin. Molecular analysis revealed an abundance of IF EV-associated proteins specifically involved in mitophagy and secretory autophagy. A set of proteins required for sequential steps of fission-induced mitophagy preferentially populated the CD81+\/PD-L1+ IF EVs; including PINK1 and ARIH1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (required for Parkin-independent mitophagy), DRP1 and FIS1 (mitochondrial pinching), and VPS35, SEC22b, and Rab33b (vacuolar sorting). SLN immune cell populations could be massively remodeled by introducing hydrogel NPs which have a controlled release of T-cell and dendritic cell chemoattractant to the subcapsular sinus. NPs were successfully used to deliver concentrated packages of EVs subpopulations to the SLN. Introduction of the large CD81-\/VEGF+\/PD-L1- EV subpopulation (amphisome characteristics) to the SLN augmented tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, even when cytokine induction was used to remodel the SLN. In marked contrast, introduction of the CD81+\/PD-L1+ EV subpopulation (containing mitophagy components) to the SLN in combination with NP release of chemoattractants, induced immune rejection of the syngeneic breast cancer, reducing tumor growth, and blocking metastasis. These findings demonstrate that different populations of EVs have opposite effects on cancer immune evasion at the level of the SLN and that EV-mediated immune suppression can be reversed by SLN remodeling to augment dendritic and CD8+ T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68cbae1e-4cde-413b-92b6-68f8ca7705af\/@z03B8ZGJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Mitochondria,Breast cancer,Mass spectrometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17086"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marissa Howard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Erickson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda Haymond<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Luchini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fatah Kashanchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lance Liotta<\/i><\/presenter>.

In T cells, activated HPK1 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by phosphorylating the adaptor protein SLP76 on Ser376, which induces the association of SLP76 with 14-3-3 proteins. This SLP76\/14-3-3 complex leads to its disassociation from the TCR signalosome, resulting in reduced downstream TCR signaling. The kinase activity of HPK1 is necessary for its regulatory function as mice expressing a mutant kinase-inactive HPK1 demonstrate enhanced T cell activity and superior tumor growth control compared to their WT counterparts. Here we describe a highly potent, selective and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of HPK1 which displays sub-nanomolar HPK1 inhibition, good selectivity against MAP4K family members and oral bioavailability in preclinical animal models. Pharmacological inhibition of HPK1 kinase activity with Gilead&#8217;s HPK1 inhibitor compound demonstrates robust inhibition of pSLP76 S376 with concomitant enhancement in T cell activation, proliferation and effector function in in vitro assays. These immune enhancing effects translate into in vivo preclinical tumor models, where treatment with Gilead&#8217;s HPK1 inhibitor compound results in heightened T cell activation and effector function and enhanced tumor growth control both as a single agent and in combination with PD-1 blockade. In summary, our data show that Gilead&#8217;s HPK1 inhibitor compound is expected to be a selective, orally bioavailable HPK1 inhibitor with potential to combine with checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno-oncology agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5710b8c5-b1b1-49f5-aa63-b3520a825537\/@z03B8ZGJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17087"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jacob S.

The liabilities of IL-2 prompted development of second-generation molecules, which signal through the IL-2R&#946;&#947; (&#8220;not-&#945;&#8221; IL-2 and IL-15 variants). Although these molecules avoid vascular leak syndrome, their clinical efficacy appears to be suboptimal compared to high dose IL-2 [1]. Furthermore, not-&#945; IL-2s show biased expansion of NK cells over CD8+ T cells in patients due to their high expression of IL-2R&#946; on NK cells, which can act as a sink and contribute to toxicity, and these molecules do not eliminate IL-2R&#946;&#947;-mediated activation of Tregs [2, 3]. To maximize the therapeutic potential of IL-2, we developed AB248, a cis-targeted IL-2 fusion protein that selectively signals on CD8+ T-cells with limited activity on the highly IL-2\/IL-15-sensitive NK cells and immunosuppressive Tregs. We have previously shown that selective expansion of CD8+ T cells over NK cells and Tregs is achieved in vivo using muAB248, AB248&#8217;s murine surrogate. Furthermore, a single dose of muAB248 elicits strong efficacy in multiple tumor models without body weight loss. Here, we detail the properties of AB248, a fusion of a human CD8-targeting antibody that selectively binds to CD8+ T cells over NK cells, and an IL-2 mutein with reduced affinity to IL-2R&#945; and IL-2R&#946;. In STAT5 assays, AB248 showed approximately 1000-fold preference for the activation of CD8+ T cells over NK cells and Tregs. AB248 mediated a dose-dependent selective expansion of CD8 T cells over NK and Tregs in non-human primates.<i> <\/i>Furthermore, AB248 reproduced the expected in vitro gene signatures of an IL2R&#946;&#947; agonist, demonstrating that AB248 recapitulates native IL-2R&#946;&#947; signaling selectively on CD8+ T cells.We previously demonstrated in mice that while the efficacy of not-&#945; IL-2 was mediated by CD8+ T cells and not NK cells, toxicity as measured by body weight loss was dependent upon NK cells but not CD8+ T cells. Here, we show that human NK cells may also drive IL-2&#946;&#947; agonist-induced toxicities. Both IL-2 and not-&#945; IL-2 induced IFN-&#947; secretion from human PBMCs, whereas AB248 did not. Strikingly, depletion of CD56+ NK cells eliminated IL-2-induced cytokine secretion, demonstrating that human NK cells are capable of spontaneously secreting IFN-&#947; in response to IL-2 signaling. In the context of TCR stimulation, AB248 induced robust secretion of effector cytokines from CD8+ T cells, but no cytokine secretion was seen in absence of TCR activation. Our data suggest that while AB248 can induce antigen-independent expansion of CD8+ T cells, it only induces effector cytokine secretion in the context of an additional activating signal via the TCR. Collectively, these data show that AB248 demonstrates an improved safety and efficacy profile as compared to not-&#945; IL-2 and is a promising immuno-oncology therapeutic. Ref: 1. Overwijk, Ann.

Metastasis is the major barrier to durable clinical responses as many patients appear cured of their disease, yet return to clinic with recurrences from dormant micro-metastases. Immune activating agents, such as Interleukin 12 (IL-12) have attracted attention as anti-cancer adjuvants due to their ability to elicit systemic anti-cancer immunity. Although targeting distributed metastases can be accomplished by intravenous (IV) administration, administration of IL-12 into patient vasculature is highly inefficient due to its short half-life and poor toxicity profile. There is a major unmet need to develop biocompatible carriers that improve targeted delivery of IL-12 by specifically homing to metastatic lesions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered ideal biodelivery vehicles as they display innate tumor-trophism and can deliver biomolecules specifically to systemic metastases. However, major issues need to be addressed before MSCs can be used to deliver IL-12 to patients: MSC tumor homing needs to be improved, and unmodified MSCs can engraft and contribute to tumor growth and metastasis, raising legitimate safety concerns. To address these major limitations, our laboratory developed a MSC-derived biodelivery vehicle with enhanced homing abilities to deliver biomolecules directly to tumors. Our approach involved using scRNA-seq to identify chemoattractant receptor\/ligand pairs (CXCR4\/CXCL12, CCR2\/CCL2) and endothelial adhesion molecules (PSGL-1\/P-E-Selectins) that mediate leukocyte homing and extravasation. We then lentivirally expressed these receptors in MSCs and removed nuclei using Ficoll gradient ultracentrifugation. These bioengineered enucleated MSCs (termed Cargocytes&#8482;) have a defined lifespan (4 days) and robustly home to TNBC. This is an important breakthrough as TNBC-trophic Cargocytes can be scaled for clinical applications and are safe for <i>in vivo<\/i> use as described in our recent publication (Nature Biomedical Engineering, <i>in press). <\/i>By using syngeneic mouse models of metastatic TNBC, we have observed IV-injected Cargocytes robustly extravasate and precisely home to metastatic lung nodules, suggesting Cargocytes act as remarkable biodelivery vehicles. Indeed, the tumor-trophism of Cargocytes includes both integrating into large macro-metastases and homing to broadly distributed micro-metastases. Cargocytes effectively produce and deliver high doses of IL-12 to mouse TNBC, which induces strong immune activation in tumors. This immune activation involved a potent anti-metastatic response, evidencing strong therapeutic efficacy. These findings suggest Cargocyte-delivered IL-12 could constitute a safe, potent, and highly specific anti-metastatic therapy for TNBC and other metastatic cancers sharing similar chemoattractant profiles.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/46150ebc-a229-4c99-8d5f-a2f14153600b\/@z03B8ZGJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Targeted drug delivery,Mesenchymal stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17089"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jeffrey White<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huawei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Flavia Franco Da Cunha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maureen Ruchhoeft<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Richard Klemke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Low response rate, acquired resistance, severe side effects, highly desmoplastic, and immunosuppressive microenvironment have limited the clinical outcomes of immunotherapy in PDAC. To overcome these hurdles, we set to design novel immunotherapy that would be safe, efficacious, and selective to PDAC. The failure of immunotherapies to yield clinical response in PDAC is partially attributed to the inefficient antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DC) which results in insufficient T cells stimulation despite their expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAA). DC have an important role in the initiation and regulation of the innate and adaptive immune system. By efficient presentation of antigens, DC elicit an antigen-specific immune response. Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup> is among the most common TP53 mutations in human PDAC, and is known as one of PDAC TAA. Despite the poor clinical outcomes, longer survival time was observed in PDAC patients with tumors that express high number of TAA combined with an abundant presentation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell. To that end, we designed a DC-targeted nanoparticle (NP) containing PDAC Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup> TAA and immune potentiators, with the DC targeting moiety, mannose, that was covalently conjugated to the NP, to enhance TAA presentation on DC. Thus, promote specific activation of T cells against PDAC&#8217;s TAA. The therapeutic activity of the NP was evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> by our newly established 3D PDAC spheroids model, which composed of freshly isolated murine stromal cells, therefore, better imitates the complex microenvironment found in PDAC<i> in vitro<\/i>. Along with an <i>in vivo <\/i>PDAC model, we evaluated the safety profile and therapeutic effect of our NP. The NP proposed herein successfully activated splenocytes and induced a specific cytotoxic reaction against PDAC cells ex vivo, which may result in an improved survival rate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immunotherapy,Dendritic cells,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17090"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniella Vaskovich-Koubi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ron Kleiner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anat Eldar-Boock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabina Pozzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dikla Dikla Ben-Shushan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helena F.
