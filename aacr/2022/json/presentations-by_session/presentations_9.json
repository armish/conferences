In lung adenocarcinoma, the most common histological type of lung cancer, these alterations are known to occur in multiple pathways including the p53 pathway, the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)\/Ras\/Raf\/MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway and PI3 kinase pathway, the Rb1\/cell cycle pathway, the Swi\/Snf pathway, the Myc pathway, and the telomerase pathway, among others.<br \/>Genome-wide association studies comparing polymorphisms in germline DNA from patients with lung cancer and from unaffected control subjects have led to the identification of multiple germline risk alleles for lung adenocarcinoma, including the <i>HLA <\/i>locus, the telomerase catalytic subunit gene locus, and, notably, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor locus, where polymorphisms appear to modulate individual propensity for smoking.<br \/>The components of inherited lung cancer risk, particularly in nonsmokers, are not fully understood, but there appear to be variations in lung adenocarcinoma mutations in distinct ancestry groups, which may be related to inherited factors. In particular, the frequency of somatic <i>EGFR <\/i>and <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations in lung cancer varies by ethnicity. Somatic <i>EGFR <\/i>mutation rates are higher in lung cancers from patients with East Asian ancestry and lower in lung cancers from patients with European or African ancestry. Somatic <i>KRAS <\/i>and <i>STK11 <\/i>mutation rates show the opposite pattern, higher in lung cancers from patients with European or African ancestry and lower in lung cancers from patients with East Asian ancestry. In patients from Latin America, somatic lung cancer <i>EGFR <\/i>mutation frequencies vary by country, with higher frequencies in Peru, intermediate frequencies in Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica and Brazil, and lower frequencies in Argentina.<br \/>To explore the relationship between the somatic genome in lung cancer and ethnicity related germline risk, we performed cancer gene panel sequencing of DNA from over 1,000 lung cancers from Mexico and Colombia, countries with significant population admixture. We developed methods to infer ancestry from the tumor DNA sequence based on coverage of single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study revealed associations between ancestry and somatic lung cancer genomic alterations, including tumor mutational burden, and specific driver mutations in <i>EGFR, KRAS<\/i>, and <i>STK11<\/i>. A local ancestry score was more strongly correlated with <i>EGFR <\/i>mutation frequency compared with global ancestry correlation, suggesting that germline genetics, rather than environmental exposure, could underlie these disparities.<br \/>Our study suggests that the variation in <i>EGFR <\/i>and <i>KRAS <\/i>somatic mutation frequency in lung cancer is associated with genetic ancestry in patients from Latin America, and suggests further studies to identify germline alleles that underpin this association. If we find a germline locus or loci that could impact the development of lung cancers with <i>EGFR <\/i>and\/or <i>KRAS <\/i>mutation, this might help in improving lung cancer prevention and screening for populations of Latin American origin and others. Furthermore, multiple studies now highlight the importance of <i>EGFR <\/i>mutation screening and EGFR-directed targeted therapy for lung cancer patients in Latin America and with origins in Latin America.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Genetic susceptibility,Cancer genetics,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew L.

JNCI 2017; Sep; 109(9)<\/i>). American Indians and Alaskan Natives (AI\/AN) across the U.S. are impacted by a significantly higher incidence of several cancers when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW): hepatocellular carcinoma; renal cell carcinoma; and cancers of the biliary tree (gall bladder and cholangiocarcinoma). In terms of mortality, AI\/AN have the nation&#8217;s highest rate of death from liver cancer (2.2-fold &#62; NHW) and a 1.9-fold higher rate of death from kidney cancer. The incidence of colorectal cancer in AI\/AN communities has also increased significantly.<br \/>The cause of these significant cancer disparities is undoubtedly multifactorial. In addition to low rates of cancer screening, other contributing factors include differences in access to healthcare and timely interventions; distinct cultural perspectives and beliefs regarding cancer etiology, screening, and treatment; differences in diet, obesity, metabolism, and risk behaviors (including tobacco, alcohol, and intravenous drug use); variable rates of vaccination and treatment for Hepatitis, HPV, and other viruses; ancestry-related biologic and genetic factors; and differences in environmental exposures. In the American Southwest, exposure of Tribal communities to environmental and carcinogenic toxins, including exposure to toxins such as aristolochic acid and aflatoxin, and to mining wastes from abandoned hard rock and uranium mines must also be considered. Experimental and epidemiologic studies have linked exposure to mining wastes that contaminate western watersheds (containing highly toxic metal mixtures of arsenic, uranium, cadmium, and other metals) to increased cancer risk in Tribal and non-Tribal communities (<i>Environ Health Perspect.<\/i><i>&nbsp;2014;<\/i><i>122<\/i><i>(4):363; <\/i><i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomark Prev.<\/i><i>&nbsp;<\/i><i>2013;<\/i><i>22<\/i><i>(11):1944<\/i>.).A virtually unexplored factor which may also contribute to cancer health disparities in AI\/AN communities is whether the cancers that arise in American Indians have a distinct spectrum of somatic and germline genomic mutations (somatic and germline) resulting from these factors. Unfortunately, AI\/AN cancer patients have been strikingly understudied to date, accounting for &#60; 0.5% of all patients studied in national cancer genomic initiatives. Cancer genomic studies previously conducted by our team of investigators in the NCI TARGET Project (<u>https:\/\/ocg.cancer.gov<\/u><u><\/u> &#62; programs &#62; target) focused on high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) discovered that patients with a high degree of indigenous genetic ancestry had a unique<br \/>spectrum of mutations in genes encoding tyrosine kinases or genes regulating tyrosine kinase pathways. All patients with this mutation spectrum had a significantly poorer overall outcome, despite treatment with intensive therapies. Recent studies have found a unique spectrum and frequency of mutations and mutational signatures in kidney cancers arising in indigenous communities (Trent, J. et al; unpublished). Our NCI-funded Participant Engagement-Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Research Center (<i>NCI U2C CA252973: Engagement of American Indians of Southwestern Tribal Nations in Cancer Genomic Sequencing; MPIs: Willman and Jeffrey Trent, PhD<\/i>) is seeking to overcome this knowledge gap through direct participant engagement and collaborative research partnerships with Tribal nations and communities.<br \/>A proper framework for engagement of indigenous Tribal Nations and tribal participants in research includes respect for Tribal sovereignty; engagement of participants and communities in project selection and oversight; assuring that the research is beneficent; the use of culturally-appropriate approaches for informed consent; appropriate data sharing, assurance of data privacy, and data interpretation and communication, including the need to engage AI\/AN participants and communities in the development of culturally appropriate interpretive data narratives; sensitivities regarding collection and approval for use of biospecimens, particularly future use; concerns over genetic privacy, protection of individual identity, and assurance that molecular means of ancestry determination in individual Tribal members will not interfere with Tribal means of cultural identify and their Tribal membership; and joint sharing in intellectual property and the benefits of discoveries. It is our hypothesis that through appropriate participant and community engagement and comprehensive genomic sequencing, we will discover novel somatic and germline mutations, differences in the spectrum and\/or frequency of cancer-promoting mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of behaviors and exposures, that can ultimately be translated to improved cancer screening, precision prevention, and therapeutic intervention in American Indian participants and communities<b>. <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Environmental exposure,Liver cancer,Leukemias,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cheryl L.
