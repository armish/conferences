At least two subpopulations of neuroblastoma cells exist that can transdifferentiate, adrenergic and mesenchymal, the latter being more resistant to chemotherapy. Mechanisms of therapy resistance are largely unknown and the cells responsible for relapse have not been identified.<br \/><b>METHODS <\/b>We used single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to identify and characterize the cells that survive chemotherapy, termed here &#8220;persister cells&#8221;, from a cohort of 20 matched diagnostic and post induction chemotherapyhigh-risk neuroblastoma patients and two patient derived xenograft (PDX) models from diagnostic tumors. Eight representative cell lines derived from neuroblastomas at diagnosis were treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy, and flow cytometry was used to sort for live cells. ML120B and CRISPR-CAS9 were used to modulate NF-kB signaling. An RNA-seq dataset of 153 high-risk neuroblastoma patients was used to determine differentially activated pathways between adrenergic and mesenchymal tumors.<br \/><b><\/b><b> <\/b><b>RESULTS<\/b> Residual malignant cells in the post-chemotherapy tumor samples clustered into three main groups separated by the response to therapy. The most prevalent group of persister cells in responders (N=16\/20) displayed low MYC(N) activity even in the presence of <i>MYCN<\/i> amplification. This group also demonstrated decreased expression of the adrenergic core regulatory circuit genes including <i>PHOX2B, ISL1, HAND2<\/i>, along with marked activation of TNF-alpha via NF-kB signaling. High NF-kB activity was found in a subpopulation of diagnostic cells in two chemo-refractory patients. We validated decreased expression of MYCN (2-fold decrease, p&#60;0.0001) and PHOX2B (3.13-fold decrease, p&#60;0.0001) in PDXs following chemotherapy. MYCN protein levels were decreased and nuclear p65 levels were increased in cell lines treated with chemotherapy. Pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kB signaling and genetic depletion of p65 resulted in increased killing (3.58-fold increase, p=0.0012) of neuroblastoma cell lines in response to chemotherapy. Finally, we classified 153 diagnostic high-risk neuroblastomas as predominantly adrenergic or mesenchymal using RNA-seq, showing that mesenchymal tumors were enriched with NF-kB pathway activation signatures. We then validated high nuclear p65 levels in 3 mesenchymal cell lines. We tested 6 adrenergic lines, 4 of which had no detectable nuclear p65. Notably, the 2 cell lines with detectable nuclear p65 were derived from diagnostic specimens that showed <i>de novo<\/i> chemotherapy resistance.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS<\/b> NF-kB activation is a major mediator of <i>de novo<\/i> and acquired chemotherapy resistance in high-risk neuroblastoma. We postulate that concomitant silencing of this pathway could eliminate persister cells and prevent disease relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Resistance,NF-&#954;B,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liron D.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood and a prototype fusion-oncogene-driven tumor. Fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) is driven by a chromosomal translocation encoding for the pathognomonic chimeric fusion product PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F). Because it is a large inherently disordered transcription factor lacking drug-binding sites, conventional efforts to directly target P3F have thus far proven futile, and 5-yr overall survival rates remain below 50%.<br \/>Objective: We thus sought to identify therapeutically tractable co-activators or co-regulators that represent vulnerabilities to P3F transcriptional programing.<br \/>Methods\/Results: Interrogation of transcriptomic data and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of human tissue microarrays demonstrated the transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and TAZ are highly abundant in FP-RMS tumors. We performed genetic gain- and loss-of-function experiments using RNAi and CRISPR\/Cas9 to determine that YAP1\/TAZ regulate many FP-RMS cancer phenotypes, including proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistic studies using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and co-IP-coupled mass spectrometry revealed a YAP1\/TAZ-P3F physical interaction and that YAP1\/TAZ and P3F share an enrichment for co-immunoprecipitated proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA binding as well as transcriptional regulation. Functional studies using qRT-PCR, immunoblots, and reporter assays demonstrated YAP1\/TAZ are positive regulators of P3F-mediated transcriptional activity. Unbiased approaches using RNA-Seq and quantitative tandem mass tag proteomics also demonstrated that YAP1\/TAZ positively regulate the differential expression of P3F&#8217;s targets and gene signature. Pharmacologically targeting the YAP1\/TAZ-P3F axis using novel NUAK1\/2 kinase inhibitors that lead to YAP1\/TAZ nuclear exclusion cause cell cycle arrest at the G2\/M checkpoint as well as a decrease in FP-RMS cell viability through induction of apoptosis.<br \/>Main Conclusions: Transcriptional co-activators YAP1\/TAZ are highly abundant in FP-RMS tumors and are required for numerous FP-RMS cancer phenotypes. YAP1\/TAZ physically associate with P3F to regulate P3F-mediated transcriptional activity. Therefore, while directly targeting P3F is not currently viable, we have identified YAP1\/TAZ as therapeutically tractable dependencies to P3F transcriptional programing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Fusion genes,Transcriptional regulation,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adam F.

In MPNST, PRC2 loss results in a diverse set of transcriptomic and phenotypic consequences, including gain of acetylated H3K27 (H3K27ac) accompanying the loss of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3), hyperactivated Ras signaling, and tumor escape from immune surveillance. Mechanistic understanding of how PRC2 loss results in these diverse consequences remains unresolved.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: To delineate the oncogenic mechanisms mediated by PRC2 loss, we engineered MPNST cell lines to dynamically reassemble a functional PRC2 and evaluated the transcriptomic and epigenetic consequences of PRC2 restoration. We further extended these finding using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) from human MPNST.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Through integrative analysis of RNAseq and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in PRC2-deficient MPNST cells, we identified 6134 H3K27me3 peaks gained when a functional PRC2 was restored. Of the 876 significantly altered genes, 699 genes were downregulated, and 177 genes were upregulated when a restored PRC2 caused genome-wide redistribution of H3K27me3 peaks. Detailed mechanistic dissection of these PRC2-regulated genes revealed a two-pronged oncogenic process mediated by PRC2 loss and they cooperatively contribute to the tumorigenesis of MPNST. First, PRC2 loss leads to the upregulation of a transcriptional circuit that remodels the enhancer landscape of MPNST cells and establishes an enhancer-driven transcription factor, FOXC1, as a master regulator and thus a core vulnerability of the cell. Second, PRC2 loss reduces type I interferon (IFN) signaling and antigen presentation as a downstream consequence of the upregulated Ras signaling. These data were further integrated with scRNAseq of human MPNST. Importantly, we discovered that the PRC2-deficient tumor cells have a corrupted transcriptional program characteristic of a mesenchymal precursor cell found during the trajectory of normal Schwann cell development. Interestingly, malignant cells expressing high levels of IFN and antigen presentation genes were missing in the metastatic MPNST, potentially allowing the tumor cell to escape the immune surveillance. The transcriptional circuit established by PRC2-regulated FOXC1 and its downstream targets sustains the malignant program in both primary and metastatic MPNST.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: In summary, we discovered the activation of a lineage specific oncogenic transcription program in PRC2-deficient MPNST, which is characteristic of a neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cell. Our findings provide mechanistic understanding of the inherent metastatic potential, chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance, and immune escape that are clinically characteristic of these tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peripheral nerve sheath tumors,Single cell,Transcriptional regulation,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiyuan Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannah E.

EWS-FLI1 is notably toxic, acting as an aberrant transcription factor and leading to growth arrest and apoptosis in all but a few cell types. ES incidence in populations of European ancestry is nearly ten times that found in children with primarily African ancestry. To better understand how EWS-FLI1 transforms the transcriptome and the protective effect of the African genome, we leveraged this disparate genomic context to study ES tumorigenesis by introduction of EWS-FLI1 into cells derived from donors with a range of African ancestry followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with genome wide SNP genotyping data were obtained and local ancestry was assessed using RFMix to establish genetic ancestry. Two lines each of ~100% European and African ancestry and four lines with intermediate European\/African admixture (45% to 90% African) were differentiated into neural crest cells (iNCC, a proposed cell-of-origin for ES) and transduced with a lentivirus expressing either a GFP reporter or a GFP-2A-EWS\/FLI1 cassette. Interestingly, iNCC derived from European lines maintained a higher frequency of cells expressing GFP\/EWS-FLI1 than the pure African lines, with admixed lines showing an intermediate frequency. RNA was extracted at 48- and 96-hour time points and sequenced for gene expression analysis. As expected, we identified pronounced changes to the transcriptional landscape in <i>EWS-FLI1<\/i>-induced cells compared to control with 13,578 differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value &#60; 0.05). More interestingly we identified 3,128 genes with ancestry-associated gene expression differences in response to EWS-FLI1 expression. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using MSigDB 50 hallmark gene sets (v7.4) detected 24 significantly enriched gene sets with an inverse correlation with percent African ancestry, including those sets involved with oxidative phosphorylation, MYC v1 and v2, and MTORC1 signaling. To identify those expression changes that are key to ES tumorigenesis we are comparing the transcriptional profiles of our EWS-FLI1 expressing iNCC to ES tumors and ES cell lines as well as other models of ES derived from mesenchymal stem cells. Ongoing studies will include profiling of chromatin accessibility and EWS-FLI1 occupation for each ancestral iNCC line following <i>EWS-FLI1<\/i> transduction to determine the early, ancestry-linked transitions that are permissive to oncogenic transformation. As EWS-FLI1 itself has proven elusive to direct targeting, studying its immediate downstream effects has the potential for establishing new druggable biologic pathways for treatment of ES.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,EWS-FLI1,Transcriptional regulation,Differential gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachel M.

P3F drives oncogenesis in FP-RMS through transcriptional modulation of downstream target genes. Thus, P3F represents a unique vulnerability in FP-RMS. A screen for inhibitors of P3F action identified novel histone lysine demethylase (KDM) inhibitors characterized in this study.<br \/><b>MATERIALS\/METHODS:<\/b> A specific luciferase assay which monitors P3F activity was utilized to screen 62,643 compounds. The top candidate with unknown mechanism of action, PFI-63, and its analog PFI-90, were characterized. Western blotting was used to detect MYOG, PARP, and PAX3-FOXO1. KDM enzyme inhibition assays were conducted. Ligand-observed NMR analysis was used to determine binding of PFI-90 to KDM3B. KDM knockdown using CRISPRi was carried out. ChIP-seq analysis on H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and PAX3-FOXO1 was performed. Mouse xenograft models of FP-RMS were used to determine in vivo efficacy.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> 64 compounds that inhibited P3F activity without general inhibition of transcription or induction of cell death were further characterized. PFI-63 and a more water-soluble analog, PFI-90, were identified. GSEA of RNA-seq showed activation of apoptosis and myogenesis while P3F targets were repressed. Activation of apoptosis and myogenesis were validated by Western blotting showing PARP cleavage and increased MYOG levels, respectively. RNA-seq suggested that PFI-63 and PFI-90 were KDM inhibitors. In vitro enzymatic inhibition assays confirmed activity against multiple KDMs with most potent inhibition of KDM3B. Western analysis for methylation at H3K4 and H3K9 showed increases after PFI-90 treatment. NMR techniques confirmed biophysical binding of PFI-90 to KDM3B. RNA-seq of KDM knockdowns demonstrated that KDM3B knockdown most closely recapitulated PFI-90&#8217;s downregulation of P3F targets. Knockdown of KDM1A recapitulated PFI-90&#8217;s upregulation of myogenesis and apoptosis. ChIP-seq analysis showed increased levels of H3K9me2 at P3F sites while H3K4me3 was increased in muscle differentiation and apoptosis. In two different in vivo xenograft models of FP-RMS, PFI-90 treatment delayed tumor progression vs DMSO control.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> We identified novel multi-KDM inhibitors with highest potency for KDM3B. Downregulation of P3F by KDM3B inhibition is associated with increased H3K9me2 at P3F sites. PFI-90 also inhibits KDM1A which increases H3K4me3 at myogenesis and apoptosis genes. Thus, PFI-90 is a novel multi-KDM inhibitor whose biological effect on FP-RMS is by inhibition of KDM3B and KDM1A. Pre-clinical validation via FP-RMS xenograft models showed that PFI-90 delayed tumor progression. PFI-90 thus represents a promising novel compound for the treatment of FP-RMS, and potentially, other transcriptionally driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Epigenetics,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yong Yean Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Girma Woldemichael<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Berkley Gryder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Pomella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ranuka Sinniah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josh Kowalczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mehal Churiwal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Barchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Schneekloth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyu Wen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsein-Chao Chou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barry Okeefe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Shern<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Hawley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javed Khan<\/i><\/presenter>.

Given the translational potential of PDXs and limited availability of pediatric cancer models, we established a PDX program to expand the existing collection of pediatric PDXs in the community and enable pre- and post-clinical studies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> PDX generation requests were integrated into clinical workflows to maximize identification of eligible patients for informed consent and tissue collection at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Methodologies for tissue procurement and cryopreservation were optimized to facilitate implantation into host immunodeficient mice and enable multi-institutional tissue exchange for model building. A bioinformatics pipeline was established to allow molecular validation of engrafted PDXs using a next-generation targeted gene panel (MSK-IMPACT) evaluating concordance based on acquired mutations, copy number alterations and clonal structure.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Between November 2016 - October 2021, 379 PDX models were developed (265 distinct models) representing 69 discrete diagnoses. Sarcoma represents the most common model type (50 discrete osteosarcoma, 20 desmoplastic small round cell tumor, 14 Ewing sarcoma, 24 rhabdomyosarcoma, 2 CIC\/DUX4 and 2 BCOR-rearranged sarcoma) followed by neuroblastoma (n=35), leukemia (n=44), and Wilms tumor (n=15). While the majority of PDXs were established from recurrent or metastatic tissue, 7 paired diagnostic\/pre-therapy and post-therapy or relapse models were generated. Genomic characterization of PDXs demonstrate excellent concordance and recapitulation of single nucleotide variants (90%), structural (88%) and copy number variants (94%) between patient tumor and matched PDX. Discrepancies between matched patient\/PDX pairs are due to sub-clonal heterogeneity in source tumors with clonal outgrowth in the PDX. Analysis of serial PDX passages also demonstrate stable recapitulation of the genomic profile. Establishment of a diverse PDX collection allowed preclinical evaluation of 10 targeted agents across a spectrum of pediatric tumors and provided the preclinical rationale for 3 investigator-initiated pediatric clinical trials.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Investment in the development of a phenotypically diverse and biologically faithful collection of pediatric PDX models enables the goals of precision medicine. Optimization of PDX workflows and methods has also enabled the development of a pediatric PDX consortium (PROXC - Pediatric Research in Oncology Xenografting Consortium) to further support the development of pre- and post-clinical studies for pediatric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Preclinical testing,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Filemon S.

H3.3 K27M is thought to promote tumor formation through altered epigenetic gene regulation. However, it is unclear if epigenetic reprogramming alone is sufficient for glioma formation. H3.3 contains a unique Serine at position 31 which is phosphorylated in early mitosis (where it functions in chromosome segregation) and again in late M\/early G1 when a mitotic error has occurred (triggering p53 expression). We found that pHGG cell lines harboring H3.3 K27M have significantly reduced S31 phosphorylation as compared to both pHGG and non-transformed H3.3 WT cells. When compared to WT H3.3 in an in vitro kinase assay, H3.3 K27M exhibits an ~60% reduction in S31 phosphorylation by Chk1, the mitotic S31 kinase. In normal diploid cells, expression of K27M or non-phosphorylatable S31A mutant significantly increased chromosome missegregation. Yet expressing a phosphomimetic double mutant (K27M\/S31E) did not significantly alter the rate of chromosome mis-segregation compared to WT. Furthermore, patient-derived pHGG lines harboring K27M have significantly higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation compared to an H3.3 WT pHGG line or H3.3 WT non-transformed human cells. We used CRISPR gene editing to remove the H3.3 K27M allele or replace it with WT H3.3. In both cases, loss of K27M elevated pS31 levels and reduced chromosome mis-segregations. Yet, when K27M was replaced with S31A, the mis-segregation rate remained similar to the parental K27M cells. In normal cells, chromosome missegregation stimulates p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1 to prevent the proliferation of aneuploid daughters. However, cells expressing H3.3 K27M or S31A failed to arrest following missegregation - despite having WT p53. To determine if the induction of chromosomal instability would alter tumor formation, we expressed H3.3 WT, K27M or S31A in combination with PDGF&#946; in a glioma mouse model. Expression of WT H3.3 failed to generate high-grade tumors. But 66% of mice expressing K27M and 93% of those expressing H3.3 S31A developed diffuse high-grade brain tumors by 100 days. Our results suggest that loss of phospho-S31 alone is oncogenic because H3.3 S31A-expressing cells are WT for K27me3. Our results demonstrate that H3.3 K27M inhibits Ser31 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo, leading to both chromosome missegregation and loss of subsequent G1 arrest - thus creating diffuse midline gliomas with both dynamic, complex karyotypes and epigenetic reprogramming.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Histone modification,Pediatric cancers,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Charles Day<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florina Grigore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alyssa Langfald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David J.
