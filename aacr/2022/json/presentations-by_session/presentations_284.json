METTL3 and METTL14, the well-recognized m<sup>6<\/sup>A methyltransferase complex, contribute to AML. METTL16 is a recently identified m<sup>6<\/sup>A methyltransferase that has been reported to deposit m<sup>6<\/sup>A in a few targets. While, unlike METTL3\/14, the biological functions of METTL16 are largely unknown. Here, we explored the function and mechanism of METTL16 in AML pathogenesis and evaluated its therapeutic potential for AML treatment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to evaluate the dependency of METTL16 in AML cells. We created <i>METTL16<\/i> knockout (KO) cells and conditional <i>KO<\/i> mice to evaluate its role in leukemogenesis and normal hematopoiesis. We employed bone marrow transplantation (BMT), xenograft, and AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to determine its role in AML development and progression. To identify the targets of METTL16, we performed m<sup>6<\/sup>A-seq and RNA-seq, followed m<sup>6<\/sup>A-qPCR, CLIP-qPCR, <i>in vitro<\/i> methyltransferase assays and RNA stability assays. To examine the effect of METTL16 on branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, we performed metabolic profiling with <sup>13<\/sup>C, <sup>15<\/sup>N-leucine.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> CRISPR-Cas9 screen showed METTL16 is one of the most essential genes for the survival of AMLs. The AML cells display more robust dependency on METTL16 than METTL3\/14. We found METTL16 is highly expressed in AML patients compared to healthy controls. <i>METTL16<\/i> KO significantly inhibited AML cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis and myeloid differentiation <i>in vitro<\/i>, which could be totally reversed by forced expression of wild-type METTL16, but not catalytic-dead mutant.<i> METTL16<\/i> depletion dramatically inhibited AML progression and prolonged survival of recipient mice in the BMT, xenograft and PDX models. In addition, METTL16 is highly expressed in LSCs contrast to leukemic bulk cells and <i>METTL16 <\/i>KO significantly attenuates LSC self-renewal <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. By contrast, the role of METLL16 is largely spared in normal hematopoietic cells. Via integrated analysis of m<sup>6<\/sup>A-seq data and RNA-seq data, we identified two bona fide targets of METTL16, <i>BCAT1<\/i> and <i>BCAT2<\/i>, which encode two critical BCAA transaminases in BCAA biosynthesis pathway. METTL16 promotes the expression of <i>BCAT1<\/i> and <i>BCAT2<\/i> via an m<sup>6<\/sup>A dependent manner. Metabolomics with <sup>13<\/sup>C, <sup>15<\/sup>N-leucine tracing showed that <i>METTL16<\/i> KO results in suppressed pools of TCA cycle intermediates, some non-essential amino acids and nucleotides.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We uncover a tumor-promoting role of METTL16 in AML and LSC self-renewal via reprogramming BCAA metabolism, in which METTL16 functions as an m<sup>6<\/sup>A methyltransferase to regulate expression of <i>BCAT1<\/i> and <i>BCAT2<\/i>.

There are genomic differences, for example in the incidence of TMPRSS2 and ERG gene fusions which differ between European American (EA) and African American (AA) PCa. Accumulating epidemiological evidence suggests loss of vitamin D receptor VDR signaling contributes to AA PCa. Therefore, we investigated the VDR signaling in AA and EA prostate models. VDR protein levels were comparable between AA (RC43N, RC43T, RC77N, RC77T) and EA cells (HPr1AR, LNCaP) but RIME analyses identified significant AA-EA differences in VDR binding of coactivators (e.g. NCOA5), corepressors (e.g. HDAC2), and components of SWI\/SNF and circadian rhythm complexes. ATAC-Seq identified 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub>-stimulated gain in nucleosome free (NF) regions was greatest in RC43N (non-malignant AA cells) and enriched for circadian rhythm transcription motifs (e.g. CLOCK). In RC43T AA PCa cells 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> led to a loss of NF free regions. Similarly, VDR ChIP-Seq revealed the cistrome was greater in AA cell models, and was dynamically altered in RC43N cells by 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> and overlapped with the SWI\/SNF component SMARCA4, but 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> led to reduced VDR binding in RC43T cells. The 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub>-regulated transcriptome was largest in RC43N and RC43T but GSEA terms were frequently and oppositely enriched, for example Reactome S phase genes were negatively enriched in RC43N, but positively enriched in RC43T. Cistrome-transcriptome integration identified the most significant relationships between VDR binding and the magnitude of 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub>-regulated genes in RC43N. Global coregulator analyses identified significantly reduced BAZ1A\/SMARCA5 in AA PCa in TCGA and a published cohort of ~1500 AA\/EA tumors. Restoring BAZ1A expression in cells resulted in significantly enhanced 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub>-regulated transcriptome in RC43N and RC43T cells, and hypergeometric tests revealed the significant enrichment of direct VDR target genes. The footprint of altered AA VDR signaling was evident in three previously established clinical cohorts. Serum miRNA that predicted AA progression from HGPIN to PCa were enriched for 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub>-regulated VDR targets; AA tumors from a vitaminD<sub>3<\/sub>-treated chemotherapy trail were enriched for VDR-bound genes; and, tumors from men with low serum 25(OH)D<sub>3<\/sub> levels were significantly enriched for VDR target genes identified in AA but not EA PCa. Together, these data suggest VDR transcriptional control is most potent and dynamic in AA prostate cells, and is primed to govern inflammatory and circadian pathways. Reduced BAZ1A\/SMARCA5 expression and\/or reduced environmental-regulated serum vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> levels most acutely suppress these actions in AA PCa. Therefore, the VDR axis lies at the cross-roads of biopsychosocial processes that contributes to PCa health disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vitamin D receptor,SWI\/SNF,African American,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shahid Hussain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manjunath Siddappa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sajad A.

Not all origins initiate replication at the same time, generating a conserved temporal order of DNA replication (the replication timing program) which is cell and tissue type specific. The extent to which replication timing alters during malignant transformation and the resultant impact on the genomic landscape in cancer remains unclear. Here, we explored the landscape of altered replication timing in lung and breast cancer and the interplay between altered replication timing and genomic cancer evolution.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To characterize replication timing profiles, the Repli-Seq protocol was applied to 4 lung adenocarcinoma, 3 lung squamous cell carcinoma, and 4 breast cancer cell lines, as well as the cell-of-origin of each cancer type. Replication timing was measured as the log2-transformed ratio between early and late replicated reads in 50kb windows. To identify altered replication timing regions the log2-ratio of each cancer cell line was compared to its matched normal. Publicly available WGS and RNA-seq data from patients were used to investigate the relationship between replication timing and genomic alterations.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified a systematic shift in replication timing from normal to cancer cell lines in 6%-17% of the genome, half of which were classified as late-to-early and half early-to-late replicated. We identified an increase in mutation load in early-to-late replicated regions in comparison to non-altered early replicated regions, whereas the opposite was true for late-to-early replicated regions. We observed a more prevalent shift in the mutational landscape in breast compared to lung cancer, suggesting that most mutations in breast cancer were accumulated after the alteration in replication timing. In addition, we identified known and novel mutational processes active in differently replicated parts of the genome. Furthermore, we observed an enrichment of APOBEC3-associated mutation clusters (omikli events) in early and late-to-early replicated regions.

Also, late-to-early replicated genes exhibited an increase in expression in cancer relative to normal, whereas early-to-late replicated genes exhibited a decrease in expression.

Sources of intratumoral heterogeneity may include genomic alterations, such as single-nucleotide and structural variants, and epigenomic alterations, such as changes in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. The relative extent and functional significance of these contributors to intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma have yet to be elucidated. In collaboration with neurosurgeons and neuro-imaging experts, we have established a novel approach towards characterizing intratumoral heterogeneity in three-dimensional (3D) space. For patients undergoing tumor resection, we utilize 3D surgical neuronavigation to safely acquire ~10 samples representing maximal anatomical diversity. Samples are mapped by 3D spatial coordinates<b> <\/b>and integrated with patient MRI scans for 360&#186; visualization of sample location in context of the brain. We have now conducted whole-exome sequencing (Exome-Seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq), and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) for 83 spatially mapped samples obtained from 8 patients with primary IDH-WT glioblastoma. Integrative data analysis provides unprecedented insight into sources of intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma and their 3D spatial patterning. We find that tumor cells show aberrant transcription factor activity, activation of fetal brain programs, and variable chromatin accessibility at CTCF-binding loop anchors indicating plasticity in higher-order chromatin structure. Chromosome conformation capture analysis by Hi-C extends these findings and reveals intratumoral differences in long-range chromatin interactions due to structural variants and enhancer hijacking. Further, we use deconvolution to identify microenvironmental contributors to epigenomic intratumoral heterogeneity including neural, glial, and immune populations. We define chromatin signatures associated with microenvironmental cell types and states, revealing their 3D spatial patterning, and validate these findings by single-cell ATAC-Seq. Our work thus establishes both tumor and microenvironmental sources of intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma, revealing their chromatin programs and 3D spatial patterning. As a resource for further investigation, we have developed an interactive data sharing platform that enables visualization of brain tumor intratumoral heterogeneity in 360 degrees.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Glioblastoma,Intratumoral heterogeneity,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Radhika Mathur<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qixuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Schupp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Nikolic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takafumi Yamaguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Hilz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chibo Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Smirnov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marisa LaFontaine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanna Phillips<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janine Lupo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Boutros<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Gallo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Oldham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Yue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Costello<\/i><\/presenter>.

Since epigenetic alterations in DNA-methylation can impact the binding of factors involved in chromatin folding, such as CTCF as well as transcription factors that bind regulatory elements, the downstream impact on gene regulation could lead to the emergence of treatment resistance. Here, using radiation, we show there are significant and wide-spread alterations in DNA-methylation after treating multiple glioblastoma cultures. However, it is difficult to study these alterations because breaks are introduced at different sites in each cell, resulting in irreproducible DNA methylation alterations between replicates and cell lines. To circumvent this issue, we have developed a &#8220;multi-cut&#8221; CRISPR-Cas9 DNA break system that targets 142 or 483 pre-defined loci. We find that induction of mapped genome-wide cuts reproduces a similar level of toxicity as standard doses of radiation and we characterize the kinetics of overall cellular resolution of DNA damage using immunofluorescence markers and COMET assays. In order to assess repair efficiency (i.e., deletions, translocations, complete repair), we have designed a custom panel of DNA probes that flank the 142 or 483 sites to allow for high coverage sequencing of each cut site. To understand how DNA damage may lead to local epigenetic alterations and 3D chromatin organization changes, we performed HiC (genome-wide chromosome conformation capture), before and after cut induction, and subject cultures to further downstream analysis. Our findings show significant mega-base scale alterations in chromatin contacts centered around cut sites. To understand how these alterations may contribute to treatment resistance after DNA damage, we show these alternating chromatin contacts result in new promoter and enhancer interactions, which may drive gene-expression alterations after DNA damage at nearby loci. These results provide a mechanistic view of the interplay between DNA damage, DNA methylation and genome re-organization in glioblastoma. Importantly, these studies shed light on how these alterations evolve and their effect on local gene expression and ensuing treatment resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,DNA damage,Glioblastoma multiforme,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aram S.
