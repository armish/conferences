[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease of tumors from distinct anatomical and embryological sources. According to GLOBOCAN2020, it is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality<sup>1<\/sup><sup><\/sup>.<br \/><b>Methodology: <\/b>Utilising NIH-GDC<sup>2<\/sup><sup><\/sup> datasets, we applied Bioinformatic algorithms to categorize LCRC and RCRC based on multi-omic variables. Mutational analysis was done using STRING v11.5<sup>3<\/sup><sup><\/sup>. Kaplan-Meier were plotted. Transcriptome data was accessed using Bioconductor<sup>4<\/sup><sup><\/sup> package TCGABiolinks<sup>5<\/sup><sup><\/sup> and annotated as &#8216;Left&#8217; or &#8216;Right&#8217; based on tissue of origin. DE analysis was performed using DESeq<sup>6<\/sup><sup><\/sup>. DEGs were analyzed using Enrichr<sup>7<\/sup><sup><\/sup> for signaling pathways. Further, differential methylation analysis was performed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Tumors from left and right sides represent early Stage IIA non-metastatic cancers largely. Mutational analysis showed dissimilar genes in left vs right-sided tumors. <i>CSMD1, CDH23, PCDH15, DSCAM, CDH9, <\/i>and <i>NRXN1<\/i> formed unique hubs within LCRC network while <i>FLNC, CACNA1H, KMT2B, KMT2D, FAT4 <\/i>and <i>BRAF <\/i>formed hubs in RCRC network. LCRC-specific genes were cadherins and EMT based, while RCRC-specific genes were related to lymphocytic invasion and epigenetic markers. <i>TTN <\/i>(p-value=4.61e-2)<i> <\/i>and <i>ABCA13 <\/i>(p-value=4.78e-2) significantly influenced OS in LCRC while <i>SOX11 <\/i>(p-value=4.12e-2)<i> <\/i>influenced OS in RCRC. For transcriptomic analysis, we obtained 766 DE genes at p-adjusted value &#60;= 0.01, |log2 FC| &#62; 1. Enrichr KEGG pathway analysis highlighted neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (OR=3.11) and complement-coagulation cascade (OR=6.07) activity in LCRC. Platelet interaction with cancer cells have been demonstrated<sup>8<\/sup><sup><\/sup> to have therapeutic potential in CRCs. NK cell mediated cytotoxicity (OR=4.33) and antigen processing-presentation (OR=6.95) were enriched in RCRC. Mean methylation analysis showed higher values in RCRC than LCRC (p-value=1.5e-05). Differential methylation gave 998 hypo- and 45 hyper-methylated genes in RCRC and LCRC respectively. RCRC evidently has an underlying hypermethylated biology when compared to LCRC. RCRCs are dependent on immune-regulated biology explaining rationale of immunotherapy. Right colon develops from midgut and is supplied by SMA. It can be hypothesized that a vast lymphatic drainage system carrying increased T-cells may play a role in creating dissimilarity. On the other hand, angiogenic factors and coagulation cascade rule left colon. This could be the reason for early metastatic potential in LCRCs. Our study unambiguously differentiates LCRC from RCRC by correlating anatomical, physiological, and multi-omic variables.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6eb69fa9-a74a-4c45-b327-872558283e56\/@u03B8ZPj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Bioinformatics,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15429"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anu R I<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aastha Vatsyayan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ambily Sivadas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dileep Damodaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kurt Van der Speeten<\/i><\/presenter>.

A major barrier is that information about variants is fragmented across disparate databases, and aggregating information from these requires building extensive infrastructure. To this end, we have developed Genome Nexus, a one stop shop for variant annotation, equipped with a powerful API for bulk annotation of variants and a user friendly interface for cancer researchers.<br \/>Genome Nexus is available at https:\/\/www.genomenexus.org. It a) aggregates variant information from a large number of sources that are relevant to cancer research and clinical applications; b) allows high-performance programmatic access to the aggregated data via a unified API; c) provides a search interface and a reference page for individual cancer variants; d) provides user-friendly tools for annotating variants in patients; e) is freely available under an open source license and can be installed in a private cloud or local environment.<br \/>Genome Nexus contains annotations from more than a dozen resources, including those that provide variant effect information (VEP), protein sequence annotation (Uniprot, Pfam, dbPTM), functional consequence prediction (Polyphen-2, Mutation Assessor, SIFT), population prevalence (gnomAD, dbSNP, ExAC), cancer population prevalence (Cancer Hotspots, SignalDB) and clinical actionability (OncoKB, CIViC, Clinvar). The annotations can be accessed through the website, the API, and a command line client.<br \/>Genome Nexus is unique in providing a user friendly interface specific to cancer that allows high performance annotation of any variant. It is the main annotation service for the popular cancer genomics tool cBioPortal, which serves thousands of users daily. It is also offered as a standalone tool for annotation, allowing researchers and clinicians as well as genomic infrastructure developers to leverage it directly in their own workflows.

While significant contributions have been made in understanding the components of TNBC tumors, examining the dynamics of interaction between subclones in TNBC is relatively unexplored. By using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, this study aims to focus on understanding changes in gene expression of two TNBC subclones: the cisplatin-resistant subclone (A50) and cisplatin-sensitive subclone (B), when cocultured in 3D organoids in the presence and absence of cisplatin. We hypothesized that there will be significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) due to various concentrations of cisplatin and mixing effect. We found DEGs (<i>ACTB, FOS, EIF5, BRD2, MAFG, SF3B4, ID1, <\/i><i>MGMT, DDIT4 <\/i>and<i> LPP<\/i>) due to treatment with cisplatin in both subclones, with the largest clear effect present at a high concentration of cisplatin. Additionally, the network analysis showed that cisplatin was an upstream regulator for 11 DEGs. Even though, gene expression changes due to mixing are much more subtle than effects due to treatment, we saw some DEGs caused by the mixing effect like <i>MT1X<\/i> which is related to cisplatin resistance. Taken together, the findings of this project will help in future studies when deducing which genes to target in TNBC chemotherapy treatments based on predictive molecular biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6d2d7870-9fac-4b04-b1e0-2cf8f12c2963\/@v03B8ZPk\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Single cell,Gene expression analysis,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15432"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shadae Nicholas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patience Mukashyaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pooja Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Chuang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edison Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Rapidly growing clinical genomic data sets have the potential to identify genomic biomarkers of cancer metastasis, however, manual curation of clinical data is quickly emerging as a bottleneck. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify organs affected by metastasis from radiology reports of patients with cancer. To develop our NLP models, we leveraged the AACR GENIE Biopharma Collaborative lung and colorectal cancer datasets generated in part at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), containing curated labels of ten metastatic disease sites derived from 31,445 corresponding free-text radiology reports (2,310 patients). Using these data, we trained three machine learning models for identifying metastatic events from clinical text, using logistic regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We split patients into a training set (80% of patients) and validation set (20%). The BERT model yielded superior performance across evaluation metrics, with an average per metastatic disease site area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.981, average accuracy of 97.3%, macro-average precision\/recall of 85.1\/85.6, and micro-average precision\/recall of 87.5\/89.6. We applied our method to radiology reports from 52,000 patients with tumors prospectively profiled using the MSK-IMPACT clinical sequencing cohort. A comparison with the MSK-MET cohort, which contains metastatic events derived from billing codes in a subset of 25,000 patients, showed strong concordance (79.7% of metastatic events matched), with the NLP-based method identified an average of 1.4 additional metastatic sites per patient, an expected result given the incomplete nature of the billing code data. Analyzing genomic and clinical data in this cohort, we confirmed that chromosomal instability, as inferred by the fraction of genome altered (FGA), is strongly correlated with metastatic burden (defined as the number of distinct organs affected by metastases) in several tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and HR-positive breast ductal carcinoma, and we identified this trend in 10 additional cancer types not previously identified, including lobular HR-positive breast carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma.We demonstrate that mining of electronic health records can be used to extract rich, structured clinical information. Our models, applied at scale, offer a unique resource for the investigation of the biological basis for metastatic spread. We hope our automated clinical data extractions can enable further large-scale studies of associations between genomic biomarkers and metastatic behavior.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c443e096-c726-4700-9b8d-960dce05e715\/@v03B8ZPk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Bioinformatics,Deep learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15433"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Anisha Luthra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karl Pichotta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brooke Mastrogiacomo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha McCarthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Maron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianjiong Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Jee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Christopher J.

However, predictive drug response models trained using data from cell lines often fail to translate to clinical applications. Here, we focus on two key issues to improve clinical performance: 1) Transferability: the ability of predictive models to quickly adapt to clinical contexts even with a limited number of samples from patients, and 2) Interpretability: the ability to explain how drug-response predictions are being made given an individual patient&#8217;s genotype. Notably, an interpretable AI model can also help to identify biomarkers of treatment response in individual patients. By leveraging new developments in meta-learning and interpretable AI, we have developed an interpretable drug response prediction model that is trained on large amounts of data from experiments using cell lines and then transferred to clinical applications. We assessed our model&#8217;s clinical utility using AACR Project GENIE data, which contains mutational profiles from tumors and the patient&#8217;s therapeutic responses. We have demonstrated the feasibility of applying our AI-driven predictive model to clinical settings and shown how this model can support clinical decision making for tumor boards.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0e134bf3-2a2b-4b27-a7b0-92b18c95fa57\/@v03B8ZPk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Artificial intelligence,Clinical drug response prediction,Interpretable AI,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15434"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sungjoon Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akshat Singhal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erica Silva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason F.

Whole slide images (WSIs) are gigantic, necessitating a tile-based analysis: a WSI is broken into smaller images called tiles, each tile is analyzed separately, and tile level information are then combined to get a slide level prediction. Context aware models integrating tiles of different sizes have been used to combine morphological features present at different scales, and attention-based pipelines have successfully been used to combine tile level information. Pipelines that combine attention-based and context aware learning are less studied. While both methodologies have shown utility when used individually, models that combine both tend to suffer from a large number of parameters to estimate, which frustrates reliable training. Here we show percentiles of deep learning features extracted at different scales serve as a crude multiscale attention mechanism. The proposed model separates TCGA-BRCA invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma FFPE WSIs (AUC=0.85&#177;0.02), which improves upon the performance of the fully tile-based model of [1] (AUC=0.80 &#177;0.04). The proposed approach enjoys higher average AUC and lower standard deviation across multiple random train\/test splits of data.

Since the first identification of inherited mutations in RET as the cause of Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), somatic RET alterations have been identified as actionable drivers in subtypes of lung and thyroid, among other cancer types. This enabled the development of several RET targeted treatments, such as pralsetinib and selpercatinib, showing meaningful clinical benefit. To understand the full scope of RET alteration frequency and heterogeneity we used the AACR-GENIE database. We found that the frequency of RET alterations pan-cancer is 3%, of which two-thirds are missense mutations. The major cancer types with RET alterations are medullary thyroid, papillary thyroid and NSCLC, as expected, but also breast, colorectal and melanoma. An important distinction between NSCLC and thyroid cancer compared to colorectal, breast and melanoma is the fraction of missense vs. fusion events, with 30%-40% of samples in the former group containing RET fusions. This is in contrast with &#62;80% of samples in the latter group containing RET missense mutations. Moreover, the heterogeneity of RET alterations is large, with over 1,000 unique types of missense mutations identified. The vast majority of mutations are classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). To better understand the potential activity of these mutations, we assayed over 200 different missense mutations and fusions using a high-throughput cell-based functional assay. Results were analyzed using a novel machine learning model consisting of a multi-scale deep convolutional neural net, followed by a tree-based regressor. Our results show that the assay correctly predicted the activity of both known activating alterations as well as of loss of function mutations. Interestingly, only ~3% of over 150 VUS tested were found to be activating. Furthermore, we show that the active alterations are sensitive to the FDA-approved targeted agents pralsetinib and selpercatinib, with varying IC50 values. Taken together, these results uncover the full extent of actionable RET alterations, differentiating between active and non-active variants, as well as the effectiveness of RET inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a851ff74-b73d-488a-aef5-18acc72d0fb8\/@v03B8ZPk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RET,High-throughput assay,Molecular profiling,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15437"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shay Rotkopf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>DIkla Haham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Fillipov-Levy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lea Birnbaum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elinor Dehan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilona Kifer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zohar Barbash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gabi Tarcic<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

CA perturbs mitosis by generating nonphysiological pulling forces, leading to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. This condition may be advantageous for tumor outgrowth providing it gets corrected by clustering centrosomes into a pseudo-bipolar conformation for successful cell division. Molecular determinants of CA and therapeutic opportunities in breast cancer (BC) are still poorly understood. Preliminary data from our group show that somatic NF1 loss of function (LOF), common upon metastatic progression, is associated in vitro and in patients with selective sensitivity to maytansinoids such as T-DM1. Here, we explored the molecular basis of this increased sensitivity.<br \/>Methods: Multiple CRISPR\/Cas9-generated NF1KO or WT clones of HER2+ BC cell lines (BT474, SKBR3 and HCC1954) were assessed for sensitivity to T-DM1 or DM1 in BrdU-based and clonogenic assays, with RNAseq being performed. BT474 cells were furthered engineered with the FUCCI(Ca) reporter for live cell cycle imaging. Ploidy was assessed through flow cytometry. Aneuploidy in the GENIE cohort (restricted to BC patients analyzed with NF1-covering panels) was assessed by generating a segmentation score (sum of the absolute ploidy scores in segments covered by NGS panels). Centrosomes, spindle conformation and chromosome abnormalities were studied by confocal microscopy in cells synchronized both with RO3306 or thymidine block.<br \/>Results: All lines showed increased sensitivity to T-DM1 in KO vs WT in BrdU-based and clonogenic assays; similar results were obtained with DM1 only, suggesting independence from HER2 targeting. RNAseq differential analysis showed significant enrichment for gene sets involved in mitotic spindle in KO but not WT cells upon T-DM1 treatment. FUCCI analysis showed significantly longer permanence in G2\/M in NF1KO compared to WT cells (24.8 vs 17.9% in G2\/M, p=1.81E-07). In vehicle-treated synchronized cells, significantly more KO cells showed &#62;2 centrosomes (21.6 vs 4.7%, p&#60;0.00001) and multiple pseudo-bipolar mitotic figures with narrow intercentriolar distances, indicative of efficient clustering. This was associated with more frequent chromosome misalignment (26.7 vs 6.7%, p=0.038). In the GENIE cohort, segmentation score was higher for patients with NF1 LOF mutations vs NF1 WT (median 46.7 vs 41.1, p=0.0023), indicative of more common aneuploidy. Upon T-DM1, KO cells exhibited significantly more non-bipolar spindles with massively wider intercentriolar distances.<br \/>Conclusions: Somatic NF1 loss causes aneuploidy due to CA. This likely favors metastatization and can be exploited therapeutically. CA associated with other common oncogenic events (RAS and BRCA1\/2 mutations, PTEN loss) may represent a general biomarker for drugs inhibiting centrosome clustering in BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c4e470f0-9094-4c7d-85d4-e29c884999c5\/@v03B8ZPk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Centrosome,Mitosis,Breast cancer,GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15438"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bruno Achutti Duso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Gavilan Dorronzoro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giulia Tini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Rosaria De Filippo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marica Rosaria Ippolito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Soriani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simona Rodighiero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefano Santaguida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pier Giuseppe Pelicci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Mazzarella<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, we discovered that some ETS (E-twenty-six) family transcription factors form physical complexes with GR. Two members of the family, FLI1 and ERG exhibited stronger binding with the ligand-activated GR. GR-FLI1 interaction enhance the transcriptional activity of DNA-bound GR. Antagonizing GR or lowering cortisol levels in Ewing sarcoma (ES) animal models, a pediatric bone malignancy driven by EWS-FLI1 fusion, robustly retarded tumor growth, as well as inhibited bone to lung metastasis. These findings prompted us to identify prognostic, GR-regulated gene signature in ES. Because the genomic binding sites of GR in ES are still unknown, using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing in A673 cells we found previously known and new target genes of GR. By utilizing the protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA), we discovered that GR physically interacts with additional ETS factors. Disruption of this complex is enabled by clinically approved GR antagonist RU486 or newly developed selective GR modulators (i.e., SGRMs without AR or PR cross-reactivity). ETS proteins has been strongly associated with tumor progression and metastasis in several cancers. Taken together, we hypothesised that these mechanisms are also relevant for other ETS rearranged cancers. Results of co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirm the interaction of GR and ERG \/ ETV4 in ETS-positive prostate cancer cells. In addition, migration and proliferation were reduced when we knocked-down or antagonized GR. It is important noting that the pharmacology of GR is very well developed and some GR-targeting drugs are among the most prescribed medicines. These discoveries will open the way to clinical tests and eventual application of anti- hormone therapy in the discipline of pediatric sarcomas and ETS-rearranged cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f18826b7-c993-4961-97ca-b1d3dc5db982\/@v03B8ZPk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EWS-FLI1,Ewing sarcoma,Glucocorticoid receptor,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15439"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arunachalam Sekar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nishanth Belugali Nataraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosef Yarden<\/i><\/presenter>.

A lack of knowledge about ancestry-specific alterations is a major barrier to implementing precision medicine, leading to inequities in genetic testing, targeted treatment and clinical trial design for cancer patients from the underserved populations. However, a limited number of cancer cases from non-European populations have been sequenced in research setting, and paired normal samples are often not collected in routine clinical care. Here, we inferred African (AFR), South Asian (SAS), East Asian (EAS), American (AMR) and European (EUR) ancestry from comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of over 200,000 tumors and identified 18717, 8588, 6594 patients with significant proportions of AFR, AMR, EAS ancestry, respectively. Using logistic regressions with age of diagnosis, gender and tumor mutation burden (TMB) as covariates, we identified 165 ancestry-associated genes across 14 common cancer types. We used reported race\/ethnicity data in the AACR project GENIE cohort for validation. We found that endometrial carcinoma patients with AFR ancestry were enriched with <i>TP53<\/i> mutations (OR=2.3, FDR corrected p=5x10<sup>-31<\/sup>) but lacked <i>PTEN<\/i> (OR=0.3, FDR corrected p=2x10<sup>-41<\/sup>) and <i>KRAS<\/i> (OR=0.5, FDR corrected p=8x10<sup>-13<\/sup>) mutations. In colorectal cancer, <i>KRAS<\/i> (OR=1.5, FDR corrected p=4x10<sup>-44<\/sup>) and <i>APC<\/i> (OR=1.4, FDR corrected p=1x10<sup>-16<\/sup>) mutations were enriched in patients with AFR ancestry, whereas <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations were depleted in both AFR (OR=0.5, FDR corrected p=5x10<sup>-24<\/sup>) and EAS (OR=0.6, FDR corrected p=6x10<sup>-5<\/sup>) patients. <i>CDK12<\/i> mutations were enriched in both AFR (OR=1.6, FDR corrected p=2x10<sup>-4<\/sup>) and EAS (OR=3.1, FDR corrected p=2x10<sup>-7<\/sup>) prostate cancer patients. For patients with AMR ancestry, increased mutation frequency was observed in <i>SETD2<\/i> in pancreatic cancer (OR=3.4, FDR corrected p=1x10<sup>-4<\/sup>), and <i>VHL<\/i> in renal clear cell carcinoma (OR=1.9, FDR corrected p=2x10<sup>-4<\/sup>). In GBM, <i>TERT<\/i> alterations were associated with EUR ancestry (OR=1.3, FDR corrected p=0.003). Interestingly, TMB-high status was associated with EUR ancestry in melanoma (OR=5.9, p=6x10<sup>-36<\/sup>) and anti-correlated with AFR ancestry in endometrial carcinoma (OR=0.7, p=1x10<sup>-6<\/sup>). Our large-scale ancestry analysis characterized the somatic landscape of non-European cancer patients. Future directions include quantifying the germline heritability of identified ancestry-associated mutations using a local ancestry risk score (LRS) and investigating ancestral effects on cancer prognosis and outcome using the GENIE cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/84ba4e35-4e8c-40ef-ba85-5c151f2e45fa\/@v03B8ZPk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Genetic ancestry,Somatic profiling,Disparity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15442"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jian Carrot-Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Newberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Garrett Frampton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rameen Beroukhim<\/i><\/presenter>.

AAM diagnose with more aggressive PCa at an earlier age &#38; clinically advanced disease compared to EAM. Studies suggested that tumor biology &#38; cellular heterogeneity\/gene profile, have a potential contribution to racial differences, which remain even when controlled for access to care and stage at presentation. Moreover, men of African ancestry from the Caribbean &#38; South America experience incidence &#38; mortality rates similar to AAM, suggesting a possible ancestral basis for some of these expected outcomes. Additionally, the association of the genomic findings with patient ancestry and with other characteristics such as tumor biology &#38; transcriptomic alterations remains poorly understood. Here we hypothesize that African ancestry drives aggressive prostate cancer and leads to genetic alterations with upregulation of unique Immune-inflammatory signature in AAM of African descent. To assess our hypothesis, we performed genome-wide sequencing (WES &#38; RNA Seq), for a total of (n= 72) patients obtained from treatment-naive PCa who self-reported their race. Out of those 72 samples, 47 samples RNA Seq match with WES. To verify the self-reported race, we used ADMIXTURE to generate a quantitative estimate of each individual ancestral composition. Most of our cohorts who self-reported as AAM, their ancestry assigned to African Ancestry (Ancestry proportion &#62; 70%) with either Bantu subpopulation in Sub-Saharan area and\/or Yoruba (Nigeria) subpopulation. Descriptive statistical analyses of the study population were conducted and stratified by race &#38; pathology stage. Our results showed that AA men are diagnosed with PCa at a younger age and higher pathology stage. We ran differential gene expression (DGEs) using EdgR\/DESeq2 and enriched pathways based on the patient's ancestry\/race using GSEA &#38; EdgR gene ontology function. Our DGEs analyses revealed that gene sets such as activation of the innate immune system and immune-inflammation pathway, as well as interleukin signaling, are positively enriched (p-value 0.05), while gene sets such as RNA Polymerase II transcription and metabolisms signaling are negatively enriched (p-value 0.05) in AAM. Moreover, our WES analysis showed that patients with high African Ancestry associated with AR-related mutation such as FOXA1, PTEN, TP53, EPHB2 with SPOP mutation (18% in AAM vs 8% in EAM) on top of these mutations. Interestingly, when we stratified patients based on PD-L1 expression, AAM with high PD-L1 (Immunogenic) has higher CD8+ T cells\/PD-1+ expression than AAM patients with low PD-L1 (Non-Immunogenic). WES analysis showed that AAM with high PD-L1 express SPOP mutation. Our study's findings could lead to new therapeutic strategies using anti-inflammatory drugs and immune modulators to decrease the disease burden among men at high risk for PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ec66ad0-8231-41c8-a504-681753edbd85\/@v03B8ZPk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"African American,Whole exome sequencing,RNA sequencing,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15444"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isra A.

The enrichment of <i>NF1 <\/i>mutations in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cases that otherwise lack activated oncogene mutations indicates that <i>NF1 <\/i>loss may play a necessary role in the activation of the RAS pathway. However, conditional, biallelic loss of <i>Nf1<\/i> in the mouse lung is insufficient for LUAD initiation over 2 years, indicating additional genetic or epigenetic events cooperate with Nf1 loss in lung tumorigenesis. To better understand <i>NF1 <\/i>mutant lung cancers, we analyzed a lung cancer dataset with 47227 patients&#8217; genomic mutation data from Foundation Medicine (FMI) and found that <i>NF1<\/i> mutations (5270 patients) are associated with a higher mutational burden compared to <i>NF1 <\/i>wild type lung cancer patients in the lung cancer patients&#8217; clinical database. We then analyzed the AACR GENIE non-small cell lung cancer datasets for genes mutated concurrently with <i>NF1<\/i> mutation.
