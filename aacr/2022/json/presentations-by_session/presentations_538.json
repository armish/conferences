[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Chromosomal instability is a hallmark in epithelial ovarian cancer. Polo-like kinases (PLK) play a vital role in cell cycle regulation. In particular, PLK4 is crucial in centriole duplication. PLK4 overexpression causes defect in cytokinesis, which in turn leads to aneuploidy and mitosis catastrophe. Previous studies showed that PLK4 inhibitors are effective against cell growth in different cancers like breast cancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize that the AKT \/ mTOR and p70S6K pathway is involved in this mechanism.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The importance of cell proliferation of PLK4 was assessed by its inhibition in ovarian cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids by CFI-400945. RNA sequencing was performed. The effects of PLK4 inhibition on the AKT \/ mTOR and p70S6K pathway was demonstrated by qPCR and western blot. Correlation of the mRNA expression level with the IC50 of CFI-400945 in ovarian cancer cell lines.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>PLK4 inhibition led to reduced cell proliferation in ovarian cancer cells based on XTT and colony formation assays. The anti-proliferative effect was further confirmed in 12 patient-derived organoids using ATP bioluminescent assay. RNA sequencing showed that PLK4 inhibition led to downregulation of the AKT \/ mTOR \/ p70S6K pathway. It was found that the most sensitive cell line had the highest mRNA expression of mTOR and p70S6K, while those less sensitive had lower mTOR and p70S6K mRNA expression. Treatment with CFI-400945 showed a reduction of total and phosphorylated forms of AKT, mTOR and p70S6K in a dose-dependent level. Combined treatment with metformin, a drug that had mTOR inhibition effect, showed a synergistic effect in one ovarian cancer cell line.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>PLK4 inhibition caused reduced cell proliferation in in vitro and ex vivo assays, and this was accompanied by a downregulation of the AKT \/ mTOR \/ p70S6K pathway. This suggested that this pathway might be one of the downstream effector pathways of PLK4.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0cf1008f-8de7-4a0b-aabc-db9fafad0a9a\/@s03B8ZSe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polo-like kinase,Akt,mTOR,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17787"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ka Yu Tse<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wai Sun Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moxil Xuetang Mo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Horace Hok Yeung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Pun Ching Ip<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tak Wah Mak<\/i><\/presenter>.

HER3 is as essential as HER2 for maintaining cell viability in HER2+ breast cancer cells. It is known that inhibition of HER2 tyrosine kinase activity results in upregulation of HER3 transcription and phosphorylation. We sought to identify HER3 binding partners upon pharmacological inhibition of HER2 using neratinib. We immunoprecipitated HER3 using a HER3 antibody from BT474 cells treated &#177; neratinib. Fmass spectrometry experiments identified non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) increased upon inhibition of HER2 with neratinib and decreased under DMSO control treatment from HER3 immunoprecipitates. To validate the presence of NMIIA, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments in BT474 and MDA-MB-453 cells using a HER3 antibody. Immunoblots showed increased NMIIA levels upon treatment with 200nM neratinib for 24 hours in both cell lines. Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) gene encodes a protein called non-muscle myosin of class II, isoform A (NMIIA). It localizes to actin stress fibers and has been implicated in many cell functions. To confirm the interaction between HER3 and NMIIA we immunoprecipitated NMIIA from BT474 and MDA-MB-453 cells using a NMIIA antibody. Immunoblots indicated that HER3 levels were increased upon inhibition of HER2 with 200 nM neratinib for 24 hours. We next examined overall survival of primary breast cancer patients who have high gene expression for MYH9 from the METABRIC cohort. We observed that patients with high levels of MYH9 have a statistically significant worse overall survival versus patients with low levels of MYH9. Furthermore, we evaluated the overall levels of HER3 and MYH9 mRNA and protein upon treatment with neratinib in BT474 and MDA-MB-453 whole cell lysates. RT-qPCR and immunoblots showed increased HER3 and NM-IIA mRNA and protein levels upon neratinib treatment for 24 hours We examined the affect NMIIA loss has on HER3 signaling. Transduced MDA-MB-453 and BT474 cells with shMYH9 and doxycycline induction demonstrate a reduction in HER3 protein levels compared to cells transduced with a control sequence and doxycycline induction. We observed a concomitant reduction in P-HER3 (Y1289), downstream P-Akt (T308), and P-Erk1\/2. In addition, NM-IIA knockdown suppresses cells growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, there is a bidirectional relationship between NMIIA and HER signaling in HER2+ breast cancer cells. HER2 inhibition increases NMIIA and NMIIA promotes HER3 expression. Loss of NMIIA reduces HER3 protein and concomitant reductions in PI3K\/Akt and MAPK signaling. Loss of NMIIA in combination with HER2 inhibition results in reduction in HER2+ breast cancer cell proliferation, growth on matrigel, migration, and invasion. Studies are ongoing to decipher the mechanisms for the bidirectional relationship between NMIIA and HER signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/83fc372e-cd2a-494b-9a07-d9be6fb6f332\/@s03B8ZSe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neratinib,Breast cancer,HER2,HER2\/neu,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17788"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samar M.

Historically, inhibition of myristoylation was suggested as a therapeutic anti-cancer target since <i>NMTs <\/i>expression were shown to be increased in numerous types of cancers and myristoylation was shown to be essential for proper localization and activity of some important proto-oncogenes such as Src Family Kinases (SFKs). Recently, we showed <i>NMT2<\/i> expression is lost in numerous haematological cancer cell lines (including AML) and that these haematological cancer cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to the pan-NMT inhibitor PCLX-001. PCLX-001 recently entered human clinical trials as once daily oral therapy for relapsed\/refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and advanced solid malignances. Dysregulation and oncogenic activity of SFKs occurs frequently in AML, suggesting NMT inhibition could provide therapeutic benefit in this indication. Data analysis from the TCGA transcriptome database revealed that high <i>NMT1<\/i> and low <i>NMT2<\/i> were associated with reduced overall and event-free survival in adult AML. Moreover, high <i>NMT1<\/i> - but not <i>NMT2<\/i> - expression is associated with proliferative gene sets in AML cell lines. AML cell lines treated with PCLX-001 showed a significant reduction in total protein myristoylation, reduced levels of SFK proteins and SFK phosphorylation as well as significant increases in ER stress marker BIP protein and caspase 3 cleavage. PCLX-001 induced apoptosis in AML cell lines and patient blasts at concentrations that spared a large proportion of peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes from healthy individuals. PCLX-001 monotherapy had dose-dependent anticancer activity in an AML MV-4-11 cell line derived xenograft (CDX) and two AML patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and produced complete remissions in subcutaneous AML CDX. In tail-vein injected PDX models, PCLX-001 treatment resulted in up to 95% reduction of human CD45+ cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. PCLX-001 preferentially targeted AML cells inducing apoptosis and reducing leukemic burden. These findings validate NMT inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for AML and warrant the evaluation of PCLX-001 in clinical trials for adult AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8c498f6c-f745-4f65-b40b-1c3c70728ab5\/@s03B8ZSe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Src kinase inhibition,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17789"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jay Gamma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aishwarya Iyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan Yap<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoulika Zak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krista Vincent<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cassidy Ekstrom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erwan Beauchamp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynne Postovit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John R.

ER stress activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and has been implicated in a variety of cancers. Due to the exposure of chronic stressors, cancer cells learn to adapt to prolonged ER stress by creating pro-survival alterations in the UPR signaling pathway and subsequently drive carcinogenesis. Given the role of the UPR activation in carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that UPR activation could be recognized with pathological progression, mutational accumulation, clinical stage advancement, and survival in breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: A total of 5,316 breast cancer patients from multiple independent cohorts were analyzed. We defined the UPR pathway score by the degree of enrichment by Gene Set Variant Analysis (GSVA) and median was used to divide high vs low score groups in each cohort.<br \/>Results: High UPR breast cancer significantly enriched not only cell proliferation-related gene sets (E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, MYC target v1 and v2, and MITOTIC spindle), but also other pro-cancerous gene sets, including MTORC1 signaling, DNA repair, PI3K\/AKT\/MTOR signaling, and reactive oxygen species pathway, consistently in both METABIC and GSE96058 cohort (all false discovery rate &#60; 0.25). Majority of UPR pathway score high cells in the bulk tumor were tumor cells compared to other cells, including stromal cells, T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). UPR score was significantly associated with advanced stage, high grade, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) consistently in both cohort (all <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). High UPR breast cancer was significantly associated with worse patient survival in both cohort (all <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). Among breast cancer subtype, ER-positive\/HER2-negative breast cancer with high UPR was significantly associated with worse survival, but not in HER-positive nor TNBC. High UPR ER-positive\/HER2-negative breast cancer was significantly infiltrated with high level of Th1 and Th2 cells, M1 macrophage, and plasma cells consistently in both cohorts (all <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). On the other hand, high UPR ER-positive\/HER2-negative breast cancer was significantly infiltrated with high level of stromal cells, including fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells in tumor microenvironment (all <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). Finally, high UPR metastatic breast cancer was also significantly associated with worse patient survival (<i>p<\/i> = 0.041).<br \/>Conclusion: UPR signaling is associated with cancer aggressiveness, and with worse survival in breast cancer, especially ER-positive\/HER2-negative breast cancer subtype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/06fb9e8b-09b2-40e6-ac00-aac01045085a\/@s03B8ZSe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Unfolded protein response (UPR),Cell cycle,Tumor microenvironment,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17790"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Masanori Oshi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shipra Gandhi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rongrong Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akimitsu Yamada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Ishikawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itaru Endo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuaki Takabe<\/i><\/presenter>.

We identified a secreted protein, OASEP1 (oral cancer-associated serum protein 1) as a candidate. Immunohistochemical staining showed that OASEP1 protein expression was observed<sup> <\/sup>in 120 (75.4%) of 159 oral cancers that had undergone curative surgery.

In addition, siRNAs for the receptor of OASEP1 also significantly inhibited the growth of oral cancer cells. Enforced OASEP1 expression significantly enhanced the growth of cancer cells.

LILRB2 (leukocyte immunoglobulinlike receptor B2) is an important immunosuppressive receptor protein, which is mainly expressed in myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. At present, we have found clinically that patients with breast cancer bone and bone marrow metastasis have higher expression of LILRB2. In our research, we used Western blotting, real-time fluorescent quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), flow cytometry, and other experimental methods to explore the expression and function of LILRB2 in breast cancer cells. In our research, we found that LILRB2does increase expression in breast cancer cells, therefore, we want to explore the role of LILRB2 in breast cancer cells. we find that LILRB2 will accelerate the proliferation of tumor cells and increase their migration ability. We tested the related signal pathways and found that LILRB2 can promote the enhancement of the NF-Kb signal pathway. Further, we have done related LILRB2 correlation analysis and found that LILRB2 can reduce human leukocyte antigen-A (HLA-A) Expression. Next, we tested the changes in the level of major histocompatibility complex (MHC-1) related mRNA and found that its mRNA expression increased, which was inconsistent with the decrease in its protein level we observed. Therefore, we used the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for treatment, and the results showed after adding MG132, the decrease in HLA-A expression caused by overexpression of LILRB2 was restored. Next, we knocked down the breast cancer cell line of membrane-associated ring finger (MARCH9). After we knocked down MARCH9, transfection of LILRB2 did not increase the ubiquitination of HLA-A. Therefore we show that LILRB2 can mediate the post-translational modification of HLA-A via MARCH9, which in turn mediates the degradation ofHLA-A. In conclusion, our research shows that LILRB2 maybe a candidate of clinical target for the treatment of breast cancer, preventing possible bone and bone marrow metastasis from breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4afcd2f4-0190-4431-9a32-786333b6d82f\/@s03B8ZSe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immuno-oncology,Antigen presentation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17792"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hui Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyuan Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyu Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yujie Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunyi Ruan<\/i><\/presenter>.

MyD88 controls the expression of several key modifier genes in liver tumorigenesis; however, whether and how MyD88 in myofibroblasts contributes to the development of fibrosis-associated liver cancer remain elusive. Here, we used an established hepatocarcinogenesis mouse model involving apparent liver fibrogenesis, in which MyD88 was selectively depleted in myofibroblasts. Myofibroblast MyD88-deficient (Fib-MyD88 KO) mice developed significantly fewer and smaller liver tumor nodules. MyD88 deficiency in myofibroblasts attenuated liver fibrosis and aerobic glycolysis in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Mechanistically, MyD88 signaling in myofibroblasts increased the secretion of CCL20, which promoted aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. This process was dependent on the CCR6 receptor and ERK\/PKM2 signaling. Furthermore, liver tumor growth was greatly relieved when the mice were treated with a CCR6 inhibitor. Our data revealed a critical role for MyD88 in myofibroblasts in the promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma by affecting aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells and might provide a potential molecular therapeutic target for HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f9afbf4-3359-46f3-874e-bfdbe2877d64\/@t03B8ZSf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblasts,,Hepatocarcinogenesis,Glycolysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17793"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"f1ebe213-2b75-420b-be3a-e03a056e9e56","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f1ebe213-2b75-420b-be3a-e03a056e9e56\/@t03B8ZSf\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Qi Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jinhua Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The most aggressive MB subtype Group 3, is characterized by Myc amplifications. However, targeting Myc has proven unsuccessful, necessitating alternative therapies for MB. The histone methyltransferase, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), is well-known for its role in catalyzing the tri-methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3). Recent studies have demonstrated that EZH2 is overexpressed in Group 3 MB and that Myc and EZH2 regulate the expression of the B7 homolog 3 (B7-H3). As we previously showed the oncogenic functions of B7-H3 in Group 3 MB, this study aims to investigate the efficacy of EZH2 inhibition to reduce B7-H3 levels in an effort to improve treatment options and patient survival. Datamining studies conducted using MB patient datasets showed a positive correlation between EZH2 and B7-H3 transcripts. Additionally, we showed that inhibition of EZH2 using EPZ005687 in Myc-amplified MB cell lines downregulated B7-H3 and Myc expression. Furthermore, targeting EZH2 through shRNA and pharmacological inhibition reduced the viability and augmented apoptosis, as indicated by LDH, MTT, clonogenic, and FACS assays. We additionally tested the consequences of EZH2 inhibition on the C17.2, murine neural stem cells, and C17.2 NSC transformed with EZH2 oncogene (C17.2_EZH2OX). Furthermore, the C17.2_EZH2OXcells were susceptible to EPZ005687 treatment compared to C17.2 control cells, as demonstrated by MTT and FACS. Collectively, our study highlights the therapeutic benefits of targeting EZH2 in Myc-amplified MB cell survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Myc,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17794"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Katherine Shishido<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sujatha Venkataraman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajeev Vibhakar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiran Velpula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Swapna Asuthkar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Thus,understanding the molecular features of metastatic osteosarcoma become increasingly important.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded or fresh tissues and matched blood samples were collected from OS patients for whole exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing at OrigiMed (Shanghai, China), a College of American Pathologists accredited and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certified laboratory. Genomic alterations including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), short and long insertions\/deletions (INDELs), copy number variations (CNVs), and gene rearrangements were assessed. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and the number of tumor neoantigens (NEO) were also measured.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>In total, 38 patients including 29 males and 9 females were recruited with a median age of 19.5 years. Among them, 12 patients had first metastases to bone (group B). The metastatic sites included femur, fibula, pelvis, ribs, sacrum, and spine. The median age of group B was 19.5 years. Twenty-six (26) patients had first metastases to lung (group L). The median age of group L was 14 years.The most frequently mutated genes in OS was <i>TP53 <\/i>(55.3%), followed by <i>MYC <\/i>(36.8%), <i>MUC16 <\/i>(26.3%), <i>PTK2 <\/i>(21.1%), <i>RAD21 <\/i>(21.1%), and <i>CDK4 <\/i>(18.4%).

In contrast, the median percentage of SNVs and short INDELs in group L was 58.8%, and the median percentage of CNVs was 36.7%. The mutations patterns were clearly different between Group B and Group L with a predominant SNV &#38; INDEL in Group B and a mixture feature of SNV &#38; INDEL and CNV in Group L.

We are the first to discover the novel role of TRPM8 as a rapid testosterone receptor. The TRPM8 mRNA is highly expressed in prostate cancer (PC) and is lost during the transition to androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). Although emerging studies have shed light regarding androgen regulation of TRPM8 mRNA expression, we found that the addition of androgen receptor (AR) on the lipid bilayers inhibited testosterone-TRPM8 induced Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> uptake. Additionally, our IHC revealed increased internalization of the TRPM8 protein in high-grade PC and that TRPM8 protein was targeted for proteasomal degradation in PC. We observed that inhibition of AR and UBA1 promoted the stabilization of TRPM8 on the plasma membrane, triggering Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in both androgen dependent and androgen independent PC cells. Furthermore, in line with previous studies, we showed that testosterone-induced TRPM8 activation on the planar lipid bilayers also required phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2<\/sub>). Loss of PTEN is associated with tumor recurrence and the transition to AIPC. Thus, PTEN loss mediated PIP<sub>2<\/sub> deficiency may be an important mechanism of TRPM8 desensitization in PC. Therefore, we propose that the rescue of TRPM8 activity on the plasma membrane combined with AR targeting may be an effective therapy for PC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17797"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kiran Velpula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Shishido<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susovon Bayen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Swapna Asuthkar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We previously reported that osteocytes (Ots), the most abundant bone cells, provide a microenvironment conducive for MM progression and bone destruction. Ots activate Notch signaling, increase Notch3 expression, and stimulate proliferation in MM cells. We detected Notch3 in CD138+ cells from MM patients and human and murine MM cell lines. Yet, the role of Notch3 in MM is unknown. Here, we used a shRNA approach to knockdown Notch3 to study its role in MM cells and their communication with Ots. The protein levels of active Notch3 (NICD3) were decreased by 80% in 5TGM1 MM cells transduced with shRNA against Notch3 compared to control shRNA-control cells. In contrast, Notch1, 2, and 4 NICD protein levels remained unchanged compared to controls. Notch3 knockdown decreased Notch target gene and cyclinD1 expression, reduced proliferation by 35%, and modestly increased apoptosis in MM cells. Additionally, Notch3 knockdown decreased Rankl expression and the ability of MM cells to promote osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro<\/i>. Consistent with these observations, bioinformatic analysis of the transcriptome of CD138+ cells from newly diagnosed patients revealed upregulated processes related to positive regulation of cell proliferation and osteoclastogenesis in MM patients with high vs. low Notch3 expression. Next, we examined the role of Notch3 in MM-Ots communication. Notch3 knockdown in MM cells partially prevented the upregulation of Notch target genes and cyclinD1 expression and proliferation induced by direct contact with Ots. Inhibition of all Notch receptors with GSI fully prevented osteocyte-induced proliferation and Notch activation, suggesting that in addition to Notch3, other Notch receptors mediate MM-osteocyte communication. Remarkably, shRNA-mediated Notch2 inhibition did not alter MM cell proliferation or communication with osteocytes. Lastly, we analyzed the effects of Notch3 knockdown in MM cells in <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>models. Using e<i>x vivo <\/i>bone organ cultures, we found less MM proliferation and lower levels of the resorption marker CTX in conditioned media from bones cultured with shRNA-Notch3 MM cells compared to control bones cultured alone. We injected mice intratibially with shRNA-Notch3 or shRNA-control 5TGM1 MM cells. After 5 weeks, mice bearing shRNA-Notch3 cells had a 50% decrease in tumor burden, 50% reduction in osteolytic lesions, and exhibited 30% more cancellous bone compared to mice bearing control MM cells. Together, these preclinical and clinical findings support that Notch3 signaling is a crucial mediator of homotypic and heterotypic communication in the MM tumor niche. Future studies are needed to evaluate Notch3 in the tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic target for the treatment of MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d364b251-dff8-4ae0-af9c-d5ea93a7ebe2\/@t03B8ZSf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Bone marrow,Bone,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18728"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hayley M.

Previous research showed that tumor cells from different breast cancer subtypes (-HR \/ -HER2) and (-HR \/ + HER2) have a high incidence of crossing the blood-brain barrier and inducing increased expression of glutamate receptors NMDA subunits (NMDAR1 and NMDR2) in the brain. IBC is the most aggressive and rare type of breast cancer. The absence of a solid tumor is replaced by swelling, redness, and skin changes, resulting in many cases in misdiagnosis of an infection in the invasion and migration phase; this type of cancer blocks blood and lymphatic vessels in the breast's skin, causing local inflammation and rapid metastasis. However, little is known of the role that these glutamatergic receptors have in the development and\/or progression of IBC. The present work provides a new understanding of the cellular and molecular effects NMDA receptors (NMDAR) have on oncogenic phenotypes in IBC. The detection and quantification of the NMDAR were evaluated by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence (IF) techniques in deferments breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) and IBC cell lines (SUM149, and SUM190). Also, NMDAR antagonists (memantine and dizocilpine \"MK-801\") were used in 2D and 3D cell cultures to see the pro-oncogenic effects of migration and proliferation in cell models. In addition to this, the autocrine regulation of Glutamate in IBC cell lines is verified. Results showed a significant increase in the expression of NMDARs in IBC cell lines. In the functional cell culture assays with NMDAR antagonists, a decrease in migration and proliferation in IBC cell lines was found. These findings may be related to the high aggressiveness and the high rate of metastasis by IBC within the brain. Our results have high clinical relevance since having extensive knowledge of the role of NMDARs in IBC progression could complement therapeutic approaches for patients with IBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptors,Glutamine,Brain metastasis,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18729"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laura L.

Osteocytes are the most abundant skeletal cells and permanent residents of bone. However, the role of osteocytes in BCa bone metastasis remains understudied. Here, we investigated the crosstalk between metastatic BCa cells and osteocytes. In vitro cultures revealed that conditioned media (CM) derived from metastatic E0771 BCa cells decreased by 50% the number of alive MLO-A5 and MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cell lines. BCa cells modestly increased osteocyte apoptosis (2% vs. 6%, alone vs. exposed to BCa, respectively). Treatment with DEVD, a caspase 3 inhibitor, blocked osteocyte apoptosis but did not prevent the decrease in osteocytes induced by BCa. Thus, we studied osteocyte senescence, a process that causes irreversible cell cycle arrest and profound changes in gene expression. We found that BCa-CM upregulated the expression of markers of senescence markers (p16, p21) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (Mmp13, Mmp9, Vcam-1) in osteocyte-like cell lines. Similarly, BCa-CM increased the expression of senescent markers in <i>ex vivo<\/i> bone organ cultures containing primary osteocytes. Osteocytes increased BCa cell proliferation by increasing cyclin D1 expression Through both cell-to-cell interactions and secretion of soluble factors., osteocytes increased BCa cell proliferation by increasing cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, osteocyte-derived CM stimulated BCa cells migration and invasion capabilities and upregulated the expression of genes involved in migration (Vcam-1 and N-cadherin). Co-culture with stromal cells also stimulated BCa cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. However, the increases induced by stromal cells were four-fold lower than those seen with osteocytes. Overall, our results suggest that BCa cells reprogram osteocytes, which acquire a senescent phenotype, whereas osteocytes produce factors that stimulate tumor growth, migration, and invasion. Together, these findings support the existence of a crosstalk between osteocytes and BCa cells in the metastatic niche that favors the progression of breast cancer in bone. Future studies are warranted to examine the contribution of osteocyte senescence and osteocytes-derived factors in animal models of breast cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2c14e1ca-d757-4f6f-8b7a-16e4e6eee182\/@u03B8ZSg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Bone metastasis,Senescence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18731"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manish Adhikari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hayley Sabol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aric Anloague<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharmin Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesus Delgado-Calle<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, intensive research has revealed the remarkable heterogeneity and complexity of the different components in the pancreatic cancer tumor microenvironment. However, our knowledge regarding active stroma (dominated with activated cancer-associated fibroblasts), infiltrated immune cells and actual tumor cells interactions in the tumor microenvironment, and how these interactions impact patient outcomes, remains limited. Digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology now allows us to quantitatively analyze transcript and protein expression on intact tissue, offering an opportunity to study the intra-tumor cell-to-cell communication. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pancreatic tumors from patients with shorter survival (DFS &#60; 12 months, n=2), and longer survival (DFS &#62; 36 months, n=2) were recruited in this study. Immunofluorescent histochemistry staining of tissue morphology identification uses antibodies to pan-cytokeratin (panCK+) for PDAC cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA+) for cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Six replicated regions of interest (ROI) of tumor, CAFs adjacent and distal to tumor area were annotated from each tissue sample and a panel of 78 transcripts (73 target genes and 5 reference genes) were profiled using GeoMx DSP (Nanostring). Person&#8217;s correlation (R2) was computed for regression of GeoMx DSP data. All statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software. p-values were calculated on two-sided t-tests and p &#60; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.<br \/>As expected, the morphologic selection successfully separates panCK+ PDAC cells from CAFs demonstrated by the correspondent expression of epithelial genes of EpCam and KRT, allowing single cell profiling. Within the panel of 78 genes, 9 genes (approximal 12%) were detected with significantly higher expression levels in PDAC cells than CAFs. Five genes (BATF3, IL12b, ITGB8, CD4 and IFNAR1) were found increased expression levels in CAFs-adj comparing to CAFs-dis, regulating molecular functions of Organismal Death (p value = 3.88E-03), Maturation of Cells (p value = 2.94E-06), and Migration of Cells (p value = 2.37E-03). When comparing the differential transcriptomes in PDAC cells between the longer and shorter survival groups, higher expression of antigen presentation gene HLA-E and integrin alpha- and beta- family genes (ITGAV, ITGAX, ITGB2, and ITGB8) was seen in longer-lived patients. Proliferation genes (CCND1 and MKI67) were also found to be increased in CAFs in patients with longer survival. Our results suggest that further exploration of gene and protein expression and interactions within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment may improve our understanding of tumor and stromal communication and how it impacts on patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27ed3e0b-70f2-411b-80bd-7410be72f6b4\/@u03B8ZSg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Prognostic factors,Stromal-epithelial interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18732"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gerik W Tushoski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dongtao Ann Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingsong Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Herremans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea N Riner,<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher E Forsmark,<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiguang Huo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven J Hughes,<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Song Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

Thus, dysregulation of the cascade frequently leads to the development of diverse diseases, including &#62; 90% of all cancers. However, although signaling mechanisms of ERKs by phosphorylation have well-known, long-term protein amount regulation has not clearly elucidated. In this study, we proved that &#946;TrCP1 is a novel binding protein of ERK2. The interaction between ERK2 and &#946;TrCP1 was occurred via F-box and linker domains spanning aa 192-265. Amino acid alignment of &#946;TrCP1 showed that there are two independent putative sites for ERK docking. The mutations of the putative docking sites from lysine to alanine abrogated the interaction between ERK2 and &#946;TrCP1. Importantly, ERK activation induced by epidermal growth factor induces &#946;TrCP1 phosphorylation, resulting in facilitation of &#946;TrCP1 half-life. Although the phosphorylation sites of &#946;TrCP1 by ERK2 has not been identified, &#946;TrCP1 tumor suppressive activity may be regulated via ERK2 when the cells are stimulated by tumor promoters such as EGF.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/37ff3bed-1fc5-476b-8639-d58565a870bf\/@u03B8ZSg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-08 Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,Ubiquitination,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18733"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ga-Eun Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheol-Jung Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun-Jung An<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weidong Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dohyun Jeung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngwon Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong-Yeon Cho<\/i><\/presenter>.

KRAS protein gain-of-function point mutations play major roles in colorectal tumorigenesis. However, direct inhibition of KRAS is challenging as its protein structure is inadmissible to inhibitor docking. Efforts have been diverted to inhibit downstream RAF\/MEK\/ERK and PI3K\/Akt signaling. Nevertheless, none of these inhibitors has progressed to clinical use in CRC despite extensive trials over the past few decades. We examined levels of phospho-ERK1\/2(T202\/Y204) and phospho-Akt1\/2\/3(S473) in human colorectal tumor and matched mucosa at least 10 cm away with quantitative near infrared western blot and immunofluorescence imaging. Surprisingly, 75.5% (25\/33) of tumors has lower or equivalent phospho-ERK1\/2 and 96.9% (31\/32) of tumors has lower phospho-AKT1\/2\/3 compared to matched mucosa, irrespective of <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation status and tumor stage. In contrast, we discovered <i>KRAS<\/i>-dependent SOX9 upregulation in 28 of the 31 (90.3%) tumors. CPTAC phosphoproteomics data similarly showed significantly lower phospho-ERK1\/2 levels in tumor compared to matched mucosa. Analysis of transcriptome data from TCGA and GEO series GSE95132 also showed no activation of RAF\/MEK\/ERK signaling in CRC tumors. These data indicate that the pursue of targeted therapy inhibiting RAF\/MEK\/ERK and PI3K\/Akt signaling is unlikely to be effective in sporadic CRC and possibly harmful as phospho-ERK1\/2 are highly expressed in the matched mucosa suggesting a role in normal colonic homeostasis. The widespread use of RAF\/MEK\/ERK or PI3K\/Akt signaling downregulation as a biomarker in drug testing on CRC cell lines needs to be re-evaluated. The data suggest further that SOX9 could be an alternative effector and biomarker of KRAS signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c50dae3-73ef-42c0-9316-2d94168fddba\/@u03B8ZSg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,SOX9,CPTAC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19028"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peh Yean Cheah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kuen Kuen Lam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Choong Leong Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emile Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siew Heng Wong<\/i><\/presenter>.

The survival rate for patients is about 70%, but drops dramatically to less than 30% when metastases are present at diagnostic. The current treatment consists of polychemotherapy, followed by a surgical resection of the tumor. ES is characterized by a chromosomic translocation, leading, in 85% of the cases, to the formation of the EWS-Fli1 fusion protein, which acts like an oncogene. In order to improve the current treatments and increase the survival rate, our goal is to better understand the ES biology, by studying the role of ionic channels in this tumor. Indeed, studies are emerging on their role in tumorigenesis, showing an abnormal expression of potassium channels in cancer cells, where their functions have been highjacked to promote the tumor development. Among these channels, there are different subfamilies, including the calcium-activated potassium ones, classified according to their conductance. One of them, SK3, has already been described as highly expressed in bone metastases from breast or prostate cancer. RNA-seq analyses from 117 patients&#8216; biopsies and 6 ES cell lines show a high expression of SK1, an other SK<sub>Ca <\/sub>channel. These data led us to wonder about the role of SK1 in ES development. Thanks to different ES cell lines, and using different molecular approaches and RNA-interference methods, our work aims to study i) SK1 expression in ES cell lines, ii) its regulation by EWS-Fli1, iii) its involvement in one of the key role of tumorigenesis: the cell proliferation. The RNA-Seq results have been confirmed by RT-qPCR on different ES cell lines. We were also able to show a higher expression of SK1 gene in ES cell lines compared to multiple osteosarcoma cell lines. Then, using luciferase assays and ChIP-Seq analyses, we were able to prove that its expression is directly regulated by EWS-Fli1. Moreover, with inducible shRNA and siRNA, we have shown SK1 involvement in proliferation and clonogenicity of different ES cell lines. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms allowing SK1 channel to be part of the regulation of ES cells proliferation, we studied the effects of its extinction on calcium signaling. These experiments indicate a significant reduced Store Operative Calcium Entry (SOCE) and constitutive calcium entry, both linked with the knockdown of SK1 gene. On the other hand and as expected, the drug activation of SK1 channel has an opposite effect on ES cells, promoting these two calcium entries. These results indicate that the regulation of cell proliferation by this SK<sub>Ca<\/sub> depends on the intracellular calcium signaling. Overall, our results indicate that SK1 is highly expressed in ES cells and that it is involved in ES development. All of these results seem to suggest SK1 as a potential therapeutic target.

KRAS interaction with Guanidine Exchange Factors (GEFs) is crucial for its activation, with SOS1 being the predominant GEF. SOS1 inhibition is thus expected to be an effective strategy for targeting the downstream signaling pathway, resulting in anti-proliferative activity in RAS-driven cancers. We have identified multiple potent and selective SOS1 inhibitors, demonstrating significant reduction of GEF activity in a dose-dependent manner. The lead compounds show anti-proliferative activity across a panel of WT and mutant KRAS cell lines, and are synergistic with MAPK pathway inhibitors including KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib. Correspondingly, significant reduction in PD biomarkers, pERK and pAKT is demonstrated in KRAS mutant cell lines. PK-PD correlation is also established in a tumor bearing mice model, with dose-dependent reduction of both pERK and pAKT.

However, patients eventually develop drug resistance via various mechanisms such as secondary EGFR mutations and activation of alternative pathways. The cMET amplification is one of the resistant mechanisms. Amivantamab, a bispecific antibody to EGFR\/c-Met has shown that concurrent inhibition of EGFR and c-Met can overcome resistance of EGFR-TKIs and improve patient outcomes. Thus, amivantamab has been approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR exon20ins mutations in the US. GB263T is a novel EGFR\/cMET\/cMET tri-specific antibody with enhanced ADCC function. The current study has demonstrated GB263T exhibited robust anti-tumor activity by in vitro and in vivo studies.<br \/>Methods: GB263T has been extensively characterized. The binding\/blocking activities were analyzed by SPR and ELISA. The protein levels and phosphorylation of EGFR\/cMET were detected by Western Blot. Internalization ability was evaluated by confocal microscope. ADCC function was tested by Jurkat-CD16A-NFAT-Luc reporter system. Various CDX and PDX models were used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy in tumor inhibition.<br \/>Results: GB263T showed high affinity binding to EGFR and cMET, with robust blocking activity. Moreover, GB263T induced receptor internalization and EGFR\/cMET phosphorylation in NSCLC cell lines. GB263T dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of cells containing EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and C797S mutations. In addition, potent ADCC function against NSCLC cell lines was observed. Significant in vivo anti-tumor efficacy was demonstrated by multiple tumor models of EGFR exon 20 insertion, EGFR C797S mutation, cMET amplification, and cMET exon 14 skipping mutation.<br \/>Conclusions: GB263T is a novel tri-specific antibody that exhibited robust anti-tumor activity. The preclinical data indicate that GB263T has great potential to become an effective therapeutics in the treatment of NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/29a6c981-0df5-4f9d-9a4c-2e8eadd780d5\/@u03B8ZSg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,c-Met,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19229"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qinglin Du<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wengang Zeng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xueyan Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liwen Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xueqin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiqi Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zongjun Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian Ding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuhua Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor-2b (FGFR2b) is overexpressed in approximately 2-30% of GC and associated with worse prognosis. Bemarituzumab is an afucosylated humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits FGFR2b. In the FIGHT trial, bemarituzumab showed beneficial response in GC, but appeared to cause high corneal adverse events. It was hypothesized that FGF10 inhibition may be the mechanism of corneal toxicity by bemarituzumab. We have recently generated a monoclonal antibody against FGFR2b with potent FGF7 blocking activity but weak inhibition activity for FGF10. Thus, GB2102 may represent a differentiated antibody therapeutics that has a potential to decrease the adverse effects in the eyes. <b>Methods:<\/b> GB2102 was generated by immunization of FGFR2b protein in mice followed by hybridoma technique. FGF7 and FGF10 ligand blocking was assessed by ELISA. FGF7-induced FGFR2b phosphorylation and cell proliferation were studied in SNU-16 gastric cancer tumor cell line. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) function was evaluated by IL-2-activated NK cell-induced lysis of target cells. <b>Results:<\/b> GB2102 displayed potent blocking of FGF7-FGFR2b pathway by inhibition of FGF7-induced FGFR2b phosphorylation and tumor cell proliferation. But GB2102 showed weak blocking of FGF10 binding to FGFR2b compared with benchmark, suggesting that GB2102 may have better safety profile in corneal toxicity. In ADCC function assay, GB2102 induced potent ADCC effects by primary human NK cells to kill FGFR2b-expressing tumor cells. <i><\/i> <b>Conclusions:<\/b> In summary, preclinical studies showed that GB2102 is an anti-FGFR2b antibody with potent ADCC effect and strong FGF7 blocking but weak FGF10 inhibition. These results suggest that GB2102 is potentially a safe and effective candidate for the treatment of FGFR2b positive gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b6f3324-967b-48f2-aa9b-09d45a0079bc\/@v03B8ZSh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR-2),Gastric cancer,ADCC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19230"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tiantian Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Qinglin Du<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xueyan Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuhua Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

Understanding the mechanisms of cancer metastasis can allow us to develop methods to detect ovarian cancers sooner. Screening for specific biomarkers present in at-risk patients may facilitate detection at earlier stages and improve prognoses. A hypothesis currently being developed involves tumor spheroids that infiltrate the abdominal cavity to drive metastasis. These spheroids have increased expression of proteins with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (GPI anchor). Increased expression of GPI anchored proteins has been previously linked to cancer cells when compared to non-cancerous cells. Thy-1 (CD90) is a cell surface glycoprotein containing a GPI anchor linkage is thought to have a role in forming and increasing proliferation of these cancer spheroids.<br \/>Methods and Results: In this project, cells were cultured from two ovarian cancer cell lines (A1847 and C30) to determine if the GPI anchor was granting the spheroid proliferation capability as part of the CD90 protein structure. The A1847 and C30 ovarian cancer cell lines were transfected with a lentivirus to express three different versions of the GPI anchor + Thy1 amino acids. Construct I contain truncated Thy-1 protein with the C-terminal 30 amino acids with the GPI anchor, Construct II has truncated Thy-1 (the same C-terminal amino acids as construct I) without the GPI anchor, and Construct III has the full Thy-1 protein and the GPI anchor. The cell lines were grown on non-adherent plates to allow formation of spheroids. Spheroid formation is dependent on the number of cancer stem cells. The size and number of spheroids were measured using microscopy. Spheroids were defined as an aggregate of five or more cells. Spheroid density was calculated using ImageJ from five random fields for each cell line at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours after seeding onto non-adherent plates. Analysis shows that construct I and construct III have a similar number and density of spheroids indicating that the GPI anchor and the 30 amino acids preceding the anchor are sufficient for promoting spheroid formation. This implies that this may be the region of interest of the Thy-1 protein that can be targeted for diagnosis and treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Determining the role of the GPI anchor and the amino acid components of Thy-1 for the self-renewal function of ovarian cancer stem cells is the first step in investigating possible roles for this glycan structure in ovarian cancer metastasis. The results of these studies can lead to future development of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for earlier detection and treatment of ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19c033b9-b3ea-43eb-96ed-7b49b652d663\/@v03B8ZSh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Spheroids,Glycosylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20095"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Veronica Alvarez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen L.

Females have two active DDX3X alleles and males carry a DDX3Y homolog on the Y chromosome. We show here that pan-hematopoietic, homozygous deletion of Ddx3x in female mice perturbs erythropoiesis causing early developmental arrest. However, both hemizygous male and heterozygous female embryos develop normally, suggesting that one Ddx3x allele is sufficient for fetal hematopoietic development in females and that the Ddx3y allele can compensate for the loss of Ddx3x in males. In adult mice, loss of DDX3X affects hematopoietic progenitors, early lymphoid development, marginal zone, and germinal center B-cells as well as lymphomagenesis driven by an E<i>&#956;-Myc<\/i> or &#955;-<i>Myc<\/i> transgene in a sex-dependent manner.

The high TNBC prevalence (&#62;25%) in India as compared to the western population (10-15%) remains to be a challenge in clinical management. The association of germline BRCA1\/2 mutations in TNBCs is well-established as a predisposing factor for hereditary breast cancer risk. However, these studies are predominantly from germline profiling of TNBCs representative of western population. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the germline profiles of breast cancer patients in India using a multi-institutional TNBC cohort based on ACMG consensus multi-gene NGS panel. Of 193 TNBC patients, we identified 57 pathogenic mutations (diagnostic yield = 29.53%) from various genes of which BRCA1 (41\/57, 71.93%) and BRCA2 (8\/57, 14.03%) were most commonly mutated. We observed a high prevalence of BRCA1 mutations (41\/193, 21.24%) and BRCA2 mutations (8\/193, 4.14%) in our cohort as compared to published literature. Additionally, 8 pathogenic mutations were also reported in non-BRCA cancer pre-disposing genes associated with the HR pathway like ATM, CHEK2, PALB2. 10 novel mutations were identified in 3 genes namely BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2. The most common type of mutations was found to be frame-shift which may cause protein truncation and loss of function. Furthermore, we identified 48 variants of unknown significance (24.9%) of which about 7% were in the BRCA1\/2 genes. Data mining from global databases like TCGA, Genome Asia indicated that the novel mutations were unique to the Indian population compared to the germline profiles of different ethnicities. Our study confirms the major contribution of BRCA1\/2 genes in TNBCs as reported in the literature. A high percentage of the women were found to be associated with young age onset which may be attributed to BRCA mutations. We have also assessed the association of clinicopathological parameters such as tumor grade, stage, recurrence to the germline mutational status. Our analysis shows significant association of germline mutational status with family history thus underlin the importance of multi-gene panel testing as recommended by NCCN guidelines. Moreover, our results also emphasize the need for designing\/ implementing guidelines specific to Indian population. In summary our results indicate that Indian TNBCs have a high prevalence of BRCA1\/2 mutations.
