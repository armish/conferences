Although ecDNA was first observed more than 50 years ago, its critical importance has only recently come to light. ecDNA, because of its non-chromosomal inheritance, drives high-copy number oncogene amplification and enables tumors to evolve their genomes rapidly, contributing to treatment resistance and shorter survival for patients. Furthermore, the circular ecDNA architecture fundamentally alters gene regulation and transcription. In this talk, I will discuss recent collaborative discoveries that highlight how the higher order, spatial organization of ecDNA, and its mechanism of inheritance, contributes to aggressive tumorigenesis, accelerated evolution, and treatment resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul S.
