[{"Abstract":"Autologous T-cells engineered with T-cell receptors (TCRs) targeting tumor antigens are promising therapies for metastatic solid cancers.<sup>1<\/sup> Specific peptide enhanced affinity receptor (SPEAR) T-cell therapies are T-cells with engineered HLA-restricted TCRs that precisely target tumor cells with specific antigens, such as MAGE-A4 (a cancer testis antigen), presented on the surface by HLA molecules. In SPEAR T-cell clinical trials targeting MAGE-A4, a 2-step prescreen is done before enrolment. 1) Patients undergo HLA typing via a high-resolution (allelic, 4-digit) sequence-based assay, and those who are positive for the inclusion alleles (HLA-A*02:01P, 02:02P, 02:03P, 02:06P) and not positive for the exclusion allele A*02:05P are eligible. 2) Tumor MAGE-A4 testing is done via an immunohistochemical clinical trial assay (MAGE-A4+ cutoff: &#8805;30% tumor cell staining at &#8805;2+ intensity) in HLA-eligible patients. A screening protocol (NCT02636855) has been used in Phase 1 trials of first- and next-generation SPEAR T-cells targeting MAGE-A4 (NCT03132922, NCT04044859) with responses in multiple MAGE-A4+ tumors. As of November 19, 2021, 6,168 patients with 9 solid tumor types were screened at 32 sites across North America and Europe in this screening protocol; among which, 2,744 were HLA-eligible (eligibility rate: 45%, range per tumor type: 42%-55%). HLA-A*02:01 was the most frequent HLA-A*02 allele. Of these HLA-eligible patients, 1,549 had tumor tissues evaluable for MAGE-A4 expression; among which, 313 were MAGE-A4+ (MAGE-A4+ rate: 20%, range: 8%-54%) (Table). MAGE-A4 showed highest prevalence in synovial sarcoma and myxoid\/round cell liposarcoma but was seen across all tumor types investigated. Our results will be discussed in the context of tumor histopathology, disease status, and demography. HLA and MAGE-A4 biomarker data will inform the therapeutic opportunities for SPEAR T-cells targeting MAGE-A4 in metastatic solid cancers. 1. D&#8217;Angelo et al.

However, 40-50% patients have relapsed post current CD19 monospecific CAR-T treatment within 24 months. It has been shown that the resistance mechanism relates to either lack of persistency of the CAR-T in patients or due to CD19 target escape during treatment. CD19 and CD22 are co-expressed on B cells during B cell maturation and on most B cell malignancies. We have developed a fully human anti-CD19 and CD22 bispecific tandem CAR, aiming to overcome CD19 target escape mechanism and be more persistent with improved production process.<br \/>Methods: Utilizing mRNADis<sup>TM<\/sup> mRNA display and live cell selections, we have discovered a set of human anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 scFvs with a broad affinity range and broad epitope coverage. We have generated EPC-001, an optimal CD19\/CD22 bispecific tandem CAR-T candidate, by precise engineering of multiple pairs of CD19\/CD22 tandem scFvs with monospecific and bispecific target binding properties, linker length and scFv orientation.<br \/>Results: EPC-001 demonstrated both mono-specific and bivalent CD19 and CD22 target cell engagement, which led to CAR-T cell mediated cytotoxic cancer cell killing, cytokine release and CAR-T proliferation. EPC-001 showed improved Tscm and Tcm early phenotype and demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in Raji-luciferase disseminated animal model, as well as persistent CAR-T activity when mice re-challenged with additional tumor cells. Furthermore, we have developed CD19 and CD22 knockout Raji animal models and demonstrated the <i>in vivo<\/i> mechanism of EPC-001 in overcoming CD19 or CD22 target escape resistance mechanism.<br \/>Conclusion: EPC-001 is a promising candidate that potentially prevents target escape by bivalent targeting of CD19 and CD22 simultaneously and overcome target escape with mono-specific engagement and CAR activation. EPC-001 has been advanced into clinic for proof of concept in investigator-initiated trial to treat CD19 CAR-T resistant\/relapsed patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cb508e03-6434-4703-ad65-a15ab07510b0\/@z03B8ZX1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CD19,CD22,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jenna Nguyen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gening Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keming Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annie Luu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kehao Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Preclinical studies suggest that BRAF-targeted therapy in combination with immune checkpoint blockade could enhance anti-tumor activity. We have previously reported on the efficacy from an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial of anti-PD-1 antibody spartalizumab in combination with BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib in BRAFV600E CRC patients. Of 26 patients, overall response rate (ORR) was 38% (10\/26) and compares favorably to the historical controls in BRAFV600E CRC, yet the mechanisms of patient response in this trial need further investigation.<br \/>Methods: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) was performed on 23 paired baseline and day 15 tumor biopsies. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) were generated from baseline tumor biopsies.<br \/>Results: scRNA-seq of paired biopsies revealed increased CD8+ T cell infiltration after treatment in patients with better clinical outcome (PFS &#62; 6 months, n=11). From the on- versus pre-treatment differentially expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis in the tumor epithelial compartment, we observed greater induction and enrichment of immune gene signatures such as antigen processing and presentation, type I and II interferon response, chemokine activity, as well as superior MAPK pathway inhibition with therapy in patients with PFS &#62; 6 months. In comparison, patients with PFS &#60; 6 months (n=12) showed less immune gene upregulation and MAPK pathway inhibition in tumor cells. PDOs treated with dabrafenib and trametinib exhibited gene expression changes that mirrored the changes observed in scRNA-seq of tumor cells in the same patients from which they were derived. BRAF\/ERKi treatment in PDOs produced greater MAPK pathway inhibition and immune genes induction than BRAF\/MEKi.<br \/>Conclusion: Correlative studies of combined anti-PD-1 and BRAF\/MEK inhibition suggest that the tumor-intrinsic immune response induced by MAPK pathway inhibition might underlie cooperativity between BRAF-targeted therapy and immune checkpoint blockade. A greater degree of immune gene induction in tumor cells could be enhanced by superior MAPK pathway inhibition, which provides rationale for further clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f89c2e65-11ee-48ad-b598-65845a0bcd2b\/@z03B8ZX1\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Colorectal cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jun Tian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan H.

However, acquired resistance to PARPi is a major challenge in the clinic. Therefore, understanding the resistance mechanism and developing new treatment approaches are important to overcome therapeutic resistance to PARP inhibition. By using our GEM of Brca1-deficient ovarian tumor model, we uncovered a new mechanism underlying a secondary resistance to PARP inhibition mediated by tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Mechanistically, PARP inhibition induced the STAT3 signaling pathway in tumor cells, which in turn promoted pro-tumor polarization of TAMs in the TME of ovarian cancer. Ablation of STAT3 in tumor cells mitigated polarization of M2-like pro-tumor macrophages in the TME and increased tumor infiltration T cells in response to PARP inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that STING agonists reprogramed myeloid cells in the TME of ovarian tumor into antitumor M1-like macrophages and activated dendritic cells (DCs) in a myeloid cell STING-dependent manner. These findings were recapitulated in patient-derived PARPi-resistant ovarian tumor models. Finally, we show that STING agonism was able to overcome the secondary resistance to PARPi in ovarian cancer rendered by immunosuppressive TME. Our study elucidates a new mechanism of PARPi resistance and provides a new treatment strategy to overcome the TME-induced therapeutic resistance to PARP inhibition in ovarian cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e7f0420b-bc90-499b-b28f-f64ef49026a4\/@A03B8ZX2\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Ovarian cancer,STAT3 activation,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Liya Ding<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiwei Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Kearns<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Changli Qian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Myeloid cells, including monocytes and macrophages are the primary orchestrators of immune responses and are found to accumulate in tumors, in some cases contributing up to 75% of the tumor mass. Myeloid cells express a wide range of innate immune sensors such as Toll-like receptors, RIG-I and cGAS-STING as well as co-stimulatory molecules like CD40. The activation of these innate immune pathways in myeloid cells can associated with anti-tumor immune response. Notwithstanding the ability of the myeloid cells to infiltrate tumors and elicit broad immune responses, technologies capable of harnessing these cells to target cancer remains elusive. Here we designed and engineered a new class of chimeric antigen receptors that couple tumor recognition with multiple innate immune signal domains, referred to as Activate, Target, Attack &#38; Kill (ATAK) receptors. By combining cancer recognition domains with intracellular signaling domains from innate immune receptors such as Fc, TLR and cytokine receptors, we show that myeloid cells can be controlled and programmed to recognize cancer and elicit a broad and tunable immune response. Critically, in mice with established, highly immunosuppressive B16 melanoma tumors, delivery of monocytes engineered to express ATAK receptors results in anti-tumor activity. Our data show the versatility of building ATAK receptors by harnessing innate immune pathways and support their clinical development in cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2b60d4b-7254-4f10-bcd7-1d16ead66895\/@A03B8ZX2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Cancer,Chimeric antigen receptor,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Neha Diwanji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyong-Rim Kieffer-Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Prod’homme<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce McCreedy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yuxiao Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Getts<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, for the majority of patients with advanced solid tumors, sustained clinical benefit has yet to be achieved. Myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages readily accumulate in tumors, in some cases contributing up to 75% of the tumor mass. Reprogramming circulating and tumor associated myeloid cells to activate their ability to elicit anti-tumor adaptive immunity by phagocytosis, cytokine secretion and antigen presentation is an attractive approach to harness and orchestrate systemic anti-tumor immunity. It remains challenging to specifically target and activate myeloid cells in vivo. To overcome this hurdle, we have developed a novel in vivo myeloid cell engineering platform: Fc-alpha Receptor Fusion Constructs. Unlike other chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) the construct was engineered by fusing a tumor recognition scFv with the alpha chain of human Fc receptors. The stable expression and function of these receptors requires endogenously expressed Fc receptor gamma chain, a protein with limited expression to immune cells, mostly myeloid cells. Here, we present that intravenous infusion of lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulating the Fc-alpha Receptor Fusion Construct mRNA results in the uptake and expression of the construct by myeloid cells. In immunodeficient xenograft models of hepatocellular carcinoma and triple negative breast cancer, delivery of LNP mRNA encoding for GPC3 or TROP2 targeted Fc-alpha Receptor Fusion Constructs resulted in tumor killing, confirming the ability of this approach to program myeloid cells. Furthermore, in the B16 syngeneic melanoma model, treatment with the melanoma antigen GP75 targeted Fc-alpha Receptor Fusion Constructs was also associated with the initiation of broad systemic immune responses, characterized by tumoral accumulation of activated CD8+ T cells, reduced tumor associated Tregs and activation of antigen presenting cells in spleen. Together these studies highlight the potential of Fc-alpha Receptor Fusion Construct delivered directly in vivo to program myeloid cells to recognize and kill cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b67b4e51-7298-4f96-a2af-7fa64e077866\/@A03B8ZX2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,mRNA,Chimeric antigen receptor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hongyun Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inna Shcherbakova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Prod’homme<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce McCreedy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yuxiao Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Getts<\/i><\/presenter>.

Little progress has been seen in patient&#8217;s outcome due to high desmoplasia and chemo-resistance. Immunotherapy has shown promising results in cancers, except pancreatic cancer due to their characteristic fibrotic tumor microenvironment. The therapies are unable to penetrate fibrotic tumor leading to insufficient availability of therapeutic drugs at the tumor site. A recently identified mucin, MUC13 is aberrantly expressed in pancreatic tumors but not in normal pancreas, that makes it an excellent protein tumor target. This study is unique as it utilizes MUC13Ab for targeting the pancreatic tumor site and SPION nanoparticle system for delivering the stroma depleting drug (curcumin), which would help in improving immunotherapy response.<br \/>Methods: The inhouse generated MUC13Ab have been conjugated with our recently developed novel patented superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONS). Conjugation efficiency of the SPION-Anti-MUC13 particles was seen through cell uptake studies, by measuring fluorescence intensity, Prussian blue staining. Invasion assay and migration assay was carried out on KPC cells. We have used female C57BL\/6J black mice, orthotopic mice model for investigating targeting efficacy of MUC13-SPION-CUR. Immune checkpoint therapy (PDL-1 and CTLA-4) was administrated along with MUC13-SPION-CUR and conjugated with fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) dye for monitoring the tumor growth. Further, immunostimulatory effect of the nano formulation was done using flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: Our results showed that MUC13Ab conjugated SPIONS can efficiently internalize the PDAC cells. SPION-MUC13 using Indocyanine dye (ICG) specifically reached to the tumor site in an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of PDAC as indicated by ICG fluorescence. Additionally, the combination formulation inhibited the tumor growth and showed more survival rate with CTLA-4. The combined treatment with CTLA-4 increased infiltration of total T cell population and CD8+T cells, reduced the population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) by 43% (CD45+, CD3-, CD11b+, Ly6C high, Ly6G-) and T-Regulatory cells (Treg) by 23.8% (FoxP3+CD25+CD45+CD3+) in KrasG12D; LSL-Trp53R172H syngeneic mouse model of PDAC. Similar results were observed in SP-CUR-M13+PDL-1 group, which showed reduction in MDSCs (by 26.6%) and Tregs (by 0.1%) as compared with PDL-1 alone.<br \/>Conclusion: The formulation softens up the tumors for therapies that resulted in improved response to checkpoint immunotherapies in a pancreatic orthotopic mice model. Therefore, this study indicates high significance of MUC13-SPIONS-CUR for achieving pancreatic tumor specific delivery of drugs. This study has a potential to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by the disease and improve survival in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f0ba8a76-31b4-483c-a96a-385d4bce5e43\/@A03B8ZX2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas,Immune checkpoint inhibitors,Nanodrug delivery system,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Poornima Shaji<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Martinez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melida Flores Cantu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anupam Dhasmana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neeraj Chauhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fnu Shabnam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Diego<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meena Jaggi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Behrman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murali M.

Among these newer designs, allogeneic cell therapies are positioned to unlock the broad potential of engineered immune cells as a leading therapeutic modality. However, expansion, persistence, armoring, and trafficking of allogeneic CAR-T cells are critical to achieving long-term efficacy. Caribou Biosciences is advancing a BCMA-specific allogeneic CAR-T cell product candidate, CB-011, with an immune cloaking approach that includes both the removal of the endogenous B2M protein and the insertion of a B2M-HLA-E-peptide (B2M-HLA-E) fusion protein transgene. This strategy is designed to blunt CAR-T cell rejection by both recipient T cells and NK cells, and CB-011 is in preclinical development for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r\/r MM). We used Cas12a chRDNA guides in the manufacture of CB-011 to make four edits, including site-specific insertion of a proprietary humanized anti-BCMA CAR into the <i>TRAC<\/i> locus with high specificity and efficiency, thus eliminating TCR expression to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In addition, we inserted a gene encoding a B2M-HLA-E fusion protein into the native <i>B2M<\/i> gene locus. This method simultaneously prevents the expression of the native B2M protein and expresses a minor HLA class I antigen HLA-E to blunt both T- and NK-mediated rejection of the CAR-T cells by the recipient&#8217;s immune system. B2M is a protein that stabilizes all HLA class I antigens on the cell surface, therefore its knockout eliminates endogenous HLA class I presentation on the surface of the CAR-T cells. To demonstrate that the B2M-HLA-E fusion protein expression protects CB-011 from NK-mediated cell killing, we developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> competition assay in which CB-011 cells are co-incubated with NK cells. We observed that CAR-T cells expressing the B2M-HLA-E fusion have a survival advantage over cells that do not express the fusion in the presence of NK cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, indicating that they could resist killing by a recipient&#8217;s NK cells and potentially circulate longer. The BCMA-specific CAR leads to long-term survival in mice bearing established orthotopically-engrafted MM tumor cells. Furthermore, mice treated with high doses of CB-011 did not experience symptoms typical of GvHD. This strategy should enable CB-011 CAR-T cells to remain in circulation longer in recipients, providing for increased potential of antitumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f6c83ac-3ff4-4278-b89d-66b11e855f8d\/@A03B8ZX2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CRISPR,Multiple myeloma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Elizabeth Garner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Emilie Degagne<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suparna Roy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Donohoue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tristan Fowler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morena Stanaway<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanina Vicena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Devin Mutha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Schilling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>McKay Shaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mara Bryan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leslie Edwards<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Kohrs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynda Banh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle McSweeney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Skoble<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Kanner<\/i><\/presenter>.

These types of mutations can determine a shift of the translational reading frame, generating Frame Shifted Peptides (FSPs). FSPs are tumor-specific neoantigens. Nous-209 is an off-the-shelf vaccine encoding 209 FSPs shared across dMMR\/MSI tumors (Leoni et al., Cancer Res, 2020). The combination of the Nous-209 genetic polyvalent cancer vaccine and pembrolizumab has been demonstrated to be safe, highly immunogenic, with promising early signs of clinical efficacy in 12 patients with 7 durable confirmed PRs, 2 durable SDs and 3 PDs observed (Overman et al., SITC Nov 13, 2021 Poster number: 410). Here, we explore immune correlates potentially associated with the clinical outcome with the aim to address the Nous-209 contribution to the activity of pembrolizumab in this patient population. Several immunological analyses were performed on biological samples collected before and after treatment with Nous-209. Analyses were performed on paired blood and tumor biopsy samples. In periphery, vaccine immunogenicity was demonstrated by ex-vivo interferon-gamma ELISpot assay in 67% of subjects in dose level 1 (n=3), and 100% (n=7) of patients in dose level 2 with a mean of &#8776;1,500 IFN-&#947; SFCs\/million PBMCs at the peak of the immune response. In 3 patients with partial response whose pre\/post tumor biopsies were available, the intratumoral TCR repertoire was expanded and diversified post treatment with Nous-209. Moreover, in one out of these three patients it was possible to track vaccine-induced neoantigen specific TCR in the tumor biopsy post Nous-209 treatment. Overall, these results indicate that neoantigen specific CD8+ T cells, induced by Nous-209, expand and diversify upon treatment, and successfully traffic to and infiltrate the tumor microenvironment to exert anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a00c8c6-e4d2-4b71-9cbb-7f7223ed7c54\/@A03B8ZX2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Vaccines,Immune response,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anna Morena D'Alise<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guido Leoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Langone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Micarelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriella Cotugno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael James Overman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marwan Fakih<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dung Le<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Théa Faivre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Scarselli<\/i><\/presenter>.
