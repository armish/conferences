[{"Abstract":"<i>Introduction: <\/i>Aberrant cell-cycle regulation is common in cancer, making it an attractive therapeutic target. The cell cycle inhibitor Palbociclib has been shown to have a cytostatic effect on HCC cells via the induction of quiescence and senescence, though it has limited cytocidal effect. We hypothesized that arrested cells upregulate mTOR signaling to stay metabolically active and investigated the effect of combining Palbociclib with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin on HCC cell lines in-vitro.<br \/><i>Methods: <\/i>We employed single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) of 10 paired RNA-seq and 15 paired proteomic data sets as well as 371 HCC tumors from TCGA to identify commonly altered molecular markers in HCC, including cell cycle related genes. Subsequently, we studied the effect of Palbociclib and Rapamycin on two HCC cell lines, SNU398 and HuH7. We treated the cell lines with increasing doses of Palbociclib and used cell counting to assess growth inhibition, as well as &#946;-galactosidase activity assay to assess induction of senescence. We then treated both cell lines with Palbociclib for ten days followed by Palbociclib plus Rapamycin for 4 days and performed an MTT assay to assess relative viable cell number. We also did a fixed ratio treatment with Palbociclib and Rapamycin, followed by calculation of combination index to determine the nature of their interaction. Finally, we performed Western Blot analysis for various proteins of the cell cycle and mTOR pathways to elucidate the effects of combination treatment.<br \/><i>Results: ss<\/i>GSEA revealed significant positive enrichment of several cell cycle and mitosis related gene sets. Palbociclib treatment showed a dose-dependent inhibition of growth as well as increase in senescence associated &#946;-galactosidase activity for both SNU398 and HuH7 cell lines. Addition of Rapamycin demonstrated a dose-dependent potentiation of Palbociclib induced growth inhibition, and fixed ratio treatment with the two drugs established a synergistic effect as indicated by a combination index of less than 1. Western blot analysis showed increased levels of intrinsic CDK inhibitors p16, p15, p21 and p27 with Palbociclib treatment. Western blot analysis of proteins of mTOR pathway revealed that Palbociclib treatment caused an increase in levels of p-mTOR as well as its downstream signaling proteins p-4eBP1, p-p70 and p-s6, and addition of Rapamycin suppressed their levels.<br \/><i>Conclusion: <\/i>HCC cells over-express genes and proteins that drive cell cycle progression. Palbociclib induces senescence in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines along with an associated upregulation in mTOR signaling, and combination with Rapamycin has a synergistic effect on growth inhibition in-vitro possibly by eliminating senescent cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aaf92e08-3598-4241-beb4-64a92554b06a\/@t03B8ZE9\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Palbociclib,Rapamycin,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12348"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ankur Tiwari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Araceli Huerta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hakim Bouamar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Debodipta Das<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco G.

While there are current standard treatments for NSCLC, these treatments may cause severe side effects, drug resistance, or lead to ineffective treatment, recurrence of the cancer, and death. It has been shown that most cancer types are &#8220;addicted&#8221; to glucose, and are sensitive and vulnerable to glucose deprivation, making the inhibition of glucose transport into these cells an attractive anticancer strategy. DRB18 is a small molecule proprietary compound that has been shown to target and inhibit class I glucose transporters (GLUTs, GLUT1-4), which are responsible for the uptake of glucose into cells, particularly these types of cancer cells. DRB18 has been shown to be effective in inhibiting cancer cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in <\/i><i>vivo <\/i>without noticeable side effects<i>.<\/i><sup>1<\/sup> While this may be a promising anticancer therapy by itself, combining DRB18 with another anticancer drug that has a totally different anticancer mechanism should substantially increase the efficacy of the treatment while potentially minimizing the rate of resistance and recurrence of the cancer without increasing unwanted side effects. This research focuses on combining DRB18 with FDA-approved target drugs Trametinib and Brigatinib, the FDA-approved chemotherapy drug Paclitaxel, and a glutamine transporter inhibitor (V-9302). Thus, the treatment groups are vehicle, each of the previously mentioned drugs alone, as well as DRB18+Trametinib, DRB18+Brigatinib, DRB18+Paclitaxel, and DRB18+V-9302. This study tests the hypothesis that, due to their different anticancer mechanisms, the combination of DRB18 with these anticancer drugs will have a synergistic anticancer effect. Preliminary <i>in vitro<\/i> data and an <i>in vivo<\/i> pilot tumor study in nude mice, using human NSCLC A549 cells, have shown the improved anticancer efficacy of the combinatorial approach by further reducing tumor growth when compared with single drug treatment. The results of a larger nude mouse study, as well as basic mechanistic studies <i>in vitro<\/i>, that are currently underway will be presented later at the AACR meeting. This combination therapy has great therapeutic implications and the potential to benefit cancer patients for decades to come.<br \/>1.

Nearly 85% of ES cases express the EWS\/FLI protein which functions as a transcription factor and drives oncogenesis. EWS\/FLI interacts with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) that is highly expressed in pediatric sarcomas, to repress critical tumor suppressors. We have developed a potent reversible LSD1 inhibitor, SP-2577 (Seclidemstat), that shows the ability to impair tissue culture cell viability in multiple ES cell lines and is currently in clinical trials. A more favorable therapeutic response to SP-2577 may be obtained by combining drugs that target multiple pathways and\/or inhibit resistance mechanisms.<br \/>Experimental Design: In this study, we applied an arrayed CRISPR screening (Synthego) to identify survival genes that can be candidates for molecularly targeted drugs. Gene candidates were validated using western blot, qPCR, soft agar assay. Ewing&#8217;s Sarcoma A673 ABL2i knockdown and scramble cell lines were generated, implanted into nude mice, and treated with SP-2577. Lastly, combinational drug treatments using FDA-approved inhibitors with SP-2577 were tested in 2D and 3D cultures.<br \/>Results: CRISPR druggable library screen identified that downregulation of several genes resulted in increased SP-2577 cytotoxicity in multiple ES cell lines. Importantly, ABL2 knockdown was found to have a significant synergy in combination with SP-2577 treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. siRNA knockdown of ABL2 in combination with SP-2577 treatment revealed an increase in JNK signaling and Cleaved Caspases-3 activation with decreased Src phosphorylation. This data suggests that downregulation of ABL2 in combination with SP-2577 treatment promotes activation of apoptosis pathways in ES. In addition, combination treatment of SP-2577 with drugs targeting ABL2 pathway showed high synergy in vitro.<br \/>Conclusion: This study highlights the potential for a combination treatment of SP-2577 with ABL2 inhibitors in ES patients. Further, our observations support the capability of arrayed CRISPR screening to identify new therapeutic strategies in ES.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a6f9dbe-76ab-4455-a5cd-6a2bfe78a7b2\/@u03B8ZEa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Ewing sarcoma,Drug synergy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12350"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samuel Sampson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Trason Thode<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Drenner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Rodriguez Del Villar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annika Ozols<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohan Kaadige<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexis Weston<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Serina Ng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tithi Ghosh Halder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shelby Rheinschmidt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Anderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Holden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raffaella Soldi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>.

Studies defined key mutations in the UDP-glycosyltransferase 1 polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) gene in CRC which play a role in the toxicity and resistance of a broad class of anti-cancer drugs that target DNA topoisomerases. . UGT-1A1 is responsible for the glucuronidation and detoxification of the active\/toxic metabolite of the topoisomerase I poison, CPT and its analogues, SN-38. Herein, we investigated the potential chemomodulatory effects of a UGT1A1-gene inducer, phenytoin, to the anticancer properties of CPT. The cytotoxic effects of CPT, phenytoin and their combination were evaluated against various colorectal cancer cell lines (SW620, HT29 and HCT116) using sulforhodamine-B assay under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In HT29, CPT alone and after combination treatment had IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of 0.1235 &#181;M and 0.0269 &#181;M, respectively, under normoxic conditions; and 0.1352 &#181;M and 0.0476 &#181;M, respectively, under hypoxic conditions. In SW620, CPT alone and after combination treatment had IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of 1.9861 &#181;M and 0.0087 &#181;M, respectively, under normoxic conditions; and 1.9549 &#181;M and 0.0024 &#181;M, respectively, under hypoxic conditions. In HCT116, CPT alone and after combination treatment had IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of 0.163 &#181;M and 0.0157 &#181;M, respectively, under normoxic conditions; and 0.1013 &#181;M and 0.0766 &#181;M, respectively, under hypoxic conditions. Flow cytometric analysis after annexin-V\/FITC staining showed that the combination treatment significantly induced total apoptosis in all cell lines under investigation. In both HT29 and SW620, the combination treatment significantly suppressed the autophagy compared to CPT treatment alone using acridine orange staining coupled with flowcytometry. Cell cycle analysis using DNA content flowcytometry after PI staining showed significant S-phase arrest in the combination treatment when compared to the control across all cell lines under investigation. This indicates that sub-molecular mechanisms of phenytoin induced chemomodulatory effect to CPT anticancer properties is oxygen tension dependent. Further investigation for the intratumoral metabolism of CPT under hypoxic as well as normoxic conditions and particularly those attributed to UGT-1A1 is currently undergoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/62fcfcef-1508-463a-919d-1bc5eb19766f\/@u03B8ZEa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Polymorphisms,Apoptosis,Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12351"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dalia Al Saeedy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reham K.

Pre-clinically, loncastuximab tesirine has shown potent and specific anti-tumor activity in lymphoma models both as single agent and in combination with other approved drugs. Clinically, loncastuximab tesirine is being tested in multiple clinical trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-lymphoma drugs including ibrutinib. Ibrutinib is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase, approved for treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and other haematological malignancies.Here, we investigated the combined effect of loncastuximab tesirine (lonca) and ibrutinib in pre-clinical models of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).<i>In vitro<\/i>, the combination of lonca and ibrutinib was tested in a panel of 5 NHL-derived cell lines covering activated B-cell-DLBCL (TMD8 and OCI-Ly3), germinal center B-cell-DLBCL (WSU-DLCL2) and MCL (REC-1 and Granta-519) subtypes and showed synergistic activity in all but one cell line (WSU-DLCL2), as assessed by the Chou-Talalay method.Quantification of cell viability (propidium iodide [PI]-negative and Annexin V-negative), early apoptosis (Annexin V-positive and PI-negative) and late apoptosis (Annexin V-positive and PI-positive) showed a statistically significant reduction of viable cells accompanied by an increase in early apoptotic cells after 72-hour treatment with the combination compared to the single agents.Analysis of &#947;H2AX and cleaved PARP protein expression revealed that ibrutinib drives the increase in both &#947;H2AX and cleaved PARP after 24 hours of treatment, while lonca is largely responsible for the upregulation of both markers after 72 hours of treatment, suggesting that the two drugs work with different kinetics. Interestingly, increased &#947;H2AX was detected in the combination setting compared to the two single agents at the 72-hour time-point.Gene expression profiling of TMD8 cells treated with lonca, ibrutinib or their combination revealed that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells pathway were among the most affected by the drug combination. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) was one of the most downregulated genes. Interestingly, quantitative gene and protein expression analysis revealed that IL-10 downregulation was more effective in the combination setting compared to the single agents. In conclusion, these preclinical data support the ongoing clinical investigation of lonca and ibrutinib in patients with advanced DLBCL or MCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/66aebac4-4a70-4931-8100-24073080cef7\/@u03B8ZEa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Ibrutinib,Combination studies,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12352"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Danilo Cucchi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikoleta Sachini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick H.

Current standard chemotherapeutic treatment <i>nab<\/i>-paclitaxel (NPT) plus gemcitabine (Gem) has been able to give an average prognosis of 8.5 months after detection. Aurora Kinase A (AURKA), an enzyme responsible for the regulation of cytokinesis, is mutated in over 55% of PDAC. Increased expression of AURKA inhibits metabolic stress-induced autophagy, thus promoting cell survival. Additionally, amplification of AURKA has been shown to lead to taxane resistance. Through inhibition of AURKA signaling with a small-molecule inhibitor alisertib (MLN8237, ALS), we evaluated an enhancement of NPT+Gem chemotherapy response in PDAC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> <i>In vitro<\/i> cell proliferation was evaluated in PDAC-associated cell lines by WST-1 assay. Protein expression was measured by Immunoblot analysis. Tumor growth and survival studies were performed using human PDAC cells AsPC-1 in NOD\/SCID mice. Intratumoral mechanism of action was determined by IHC and Immunoblot analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In AsPC-1 subcutaneous xenografts, chemotherapy regimen (NPT+Gem) and alisertib inhibited tumor growth while their combination exhibited an additive effect. The increase in tumor size was 255 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in controls, 105 mm<sup>3<\/sup> after NPT+Gem, 133 mm<sup>3<\/sup> after ALS and 38 mm<sup>3<\/sup> after NPT+Gem+ALS treatment. In peritoneal dissemination xenografts, animal survival was 23 days in controls that was increased by NPT+Gem (41 days, 78% increase), ALS (25 days, 9% increase) and NPT+Gem+ALS exhibited an additive effect (49 days, 113% increase). NPT+Gem and ALS effect on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis corresponded with subcutaneous tumor growth data. <i>In vitro <\/i>proliferation analysis of PDAC epithelial cells (AsPC-1, Panc-1), stromal cells and endothelial cells demonstrated that NPT+Gem and ALS inhibited cell proliferation and their combination treatment had an additive effect. Immunoblot analysis of PDAC cells showed increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP-1 in combination therapy pointing to increased levels of apoptosis with NPT+Gem+ALS treatment in all cell lines tested.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These findings demonstrate that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine standard chemotherapy response can be enhanced through specific inhibition of aurora kinase A signaling by alisertib in PDAC.

Our previous studies demonstrated that nonthermal plasma (NTP) selectively causes apoptotic cell death in melanoma cells while preserving the normal surrounding keratinocytes. The prodrug, tirapazamine, was shown to potentiate the effects of NTP while maintaining selectivity because tirapazamine only activates in hypoxic conditions, an environment common to many tumors. This patented combination therapy has an additive-to-synergistic effect on inducing apoptosis in melanoma. Previous studies have also demonstrated efficacy in a broad range of tumor cells including cervical carcinoma, colon cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This report demonstrates for the first time that while NTP alone kills a targeted area of glioblastoma cells and tirapazamine alone kills most of the susceptible cells, the combination of NTP and tirapazamine kills all the cells throughout the tissue culture plate. The mechanism for the increase in the surface area of cell death was identified as the passage of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by intercellular communication through gap junctions. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> dose of tirapazamine required to target several glioblastoma cell lines was less than that for melanoma cells. Through parameter optimization with varied plasma conditions and altered drug dosing, the selective killing of glioblastoma cells was achieved without affecting normal primary astrocytes. Primary astrocytes and glioblastoma cells were co-cultured to observe the effect on the optimal targeting dose of tirapazamine. Glioblastoma cells had an IC<sub>50<\/sub> at hypoxia which was reduced as compared to astrocytes in their normoxia state. The Glioblastoma IC<sub>50<\/sub> values were further decreased when co-cultured with astrocytes. This study documents an increase in the Connexin43 (Cx43) gap junction protein, upon treatment with NTP for both astrocytes and glioblastoma cells. However, treatment with tirapazamine alone ameliorates this effect in glioblastoma cells only and not in astrocytes. The combination therapy of NTP and tirapazamine increased this effect to levels comparable to the original expression levels. The regulation of Cx43 may reduce the metastatic potential of the glioblastoma cells while enabling the combination therapy to show efficacy both between glioblastoma cells and in the context of communication with astrocytes. By this mechanism, the astrocytes may act as conduits to transport ROS between pockets of glioblastoma cells. In summary, the results demonstrate that the novel combination therapy of NTP and tirapazamine is an effective method to selectively target glioblastoma cells with a potential for clinical applications with limited adverse reactions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc618f54-563d-441b-9d97-f619295d71d6\/@u03B8ZEa\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Drug sensitivity,Cancer therapy,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12355"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Matthew Yehl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Nicolais<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Gerardi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmad Dianat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Kucharski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy C.

The cell lines were from the PDMR collection (https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov\/models\/database.htm). The Ras mutation status of each line was known and included KRAS G12C (5 lines), KRAS G12D (7 lines) and 8 lines which were RAS WT or harbored other RAS mutations. The high concentration range of each agent was near the clinical Cmax for the drug or was 10 &#956;M and decreased in half-logs covering a 3-log range. The complex spheroids were established for 3 days before drug(s) were added. Seven days after drug exposure the experiment was terminated with CellTiter-Glo 3D. Cell viability was determined relative to a vehicle treated control and IC<sub>50<\/sub> values were calculated from concentration response curves. The concentration response for sotorasib and MRTX-1257 (except for concentrations 3 &#956;M or higher) inhibitors were shallow to flat. The 4 KRAS G12C mutant line were most sensitive to sotorasib and MRTX-1257 with the KRAS G12C mutant pancreatic cancer line being the next most sensitive. A similar pattern was observed with the SHP-2 inhibitor TNO-155; however, there was no selectivity for the KRAS G12C mutant lines in response to the SOS-1 inhibitor BI-3406. There was heterogeneity in the occurrence of additivity\/synergy amongst the KRAS G12C mutant lines in the combination studies likely indicating that factors in addition to KRAS mutations influenced response. The most successful combination was TNO-155 plus ipatasertib which resulted in more than 1-log of cell kill in 9 of 20 lines including the 5 KRAS G12C mutant lines. Venetoclax in combination with the RAS pathway inhibitors was active in 4 of the 5 KRAS G12C lines as was the combination of sapanisertib and TNO-155. TNO-155 in combination with sotorasib, MRTX-1257 or BI-3406 was highly active in the LG0567-F671 NSCLC harboring KRAS G12C. The response of the RAS mutant lines to the combinations was compared with the response of RAS WT lines to the same combinations. Often at the higher concentrations of the drugs\/investigational agents, lines without RAS mutations are responsive. Next steps include PDX studies with the same tumor models.

Complex tumor spheroids, consisting of combined patient-derived tumor cells and stromal cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells) serve as a physiologically relevant <i>in vitro<\/i> model of solid tumors that is amenable to high-throughput screening. In this study, ten anticancer agents with a range of targets including MEK, mTOR, RAF, PI3K, and the proteasome, were tested both alone and in combination with the ubiquitin activating enzyme inhibitor, TAK-243, or the pan-Akt inhibitor, ipatasertib. All anticancer agents were tested over a 3 log range of concentrations up to their clinical C<sub>max<\/sub> value, if known. The activities of single agents and combinations were evaluated in complex spheroids grown from patient-derived tumor cells from the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Patient-Derived Models Repository (<u>https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov<\/u><u><\/u>), including ten colon and six pancreatic adenocarcinoma and four melanoma cell lines. The spheroids were allowed to grow for three days prior to the addition of anticancer agents and cell viability was measured seven days later using CellTiter-Glo 3D. TAK-243 was cytotoxic against all six pancreatic adenocarcinoma spheroids and all four melanoma spheroids, as well as several colon adenocarcinoma spheroids. The single agent BRAF V600E-selective inhibitor, vemurafenib, showed selective cytotoxicity against melanoma spheroids with the BRAF V600E\/K variant. TAK-243 in combination with vemurafenib produced greater than additive cytotoxicity in most complex spheroid models. The overall cytotoxicity of the TAK-243 and vemurafenib combination was similar in melanoma spheroids containing WT BRAF and the BRAF V600E\/K variant. The activity of vemurafenib and the BRAF V600E-selective inhibitor dabrafenib were not equivalent in this combination screen and greater than additive cytotoxicity was observed more frequently when TAK-243 was combined with vemurafenib than with dabrafenib. The combination of ipatasertib and vemurafenib had additive and greater than additive cytotoxicity in more than half of the complex spheroid models tested. Other notable agents combined with ipatasertib included the MEK inhibitors trametinib and selumetinib, both of which produced greater than additive cytotoxicity in spheroids derived from pancreatic cancer metastases.

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the US. Greater than 50% of patients with mCRC harbor mutations in the oncogenic drivers KRAS or NRAS. While direct targeting of specific mutations in RAS is in the early stages of development in patients with mCRC, targeting most mutations in RAS is technically challenging. Hence, prior efforts have been focused on targeting MEK, a downstream mediator of RAS. Unfortunately, several MEK inhibitors that have entered clinical trials have failed to exhibit clinical efficacy as a monotherapy or in combination with select agents in patients with mCRC. Thus, identifying combination therapies with unbiased screening methods has the potential to improve the efficacy of MEK targeting in patients with mCRC.<br \/>Aims: We aimed to perform unbiased high throughput screening (HTS) to identify drugs that, when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, would enhance its efficacy.<br \/>Methods: We performed unbiased HTS with KRAS mutated CRC cells grown in 3D using the MEK inhibitor trametinib as the base drug, and two different &#8220;clinically ready&#8221; compound libraries; 1) the NCI oncology set V, and, 2) a custom clinical compound set composed of drugs either approved by the FDA or in clinical trials. Using the Bliss model of synergy, vincristine was identified to be synergistic with trametinib. Effects of combining trametinib with vincristine were analyzed <i>in vitro<\/i> by 1) cell growth assays, and 2) measuring changes in cell signaling and apoptosis mediators by RPPA and western blotting. The efficacy of this combination was also examined <i>in vivo<\/i> using KRAS mutated patient derived xenografts (PDXs).<br \/>Results: HTS studies demonstrated that combining trametinib with vincristine was synergistic in 3D CRC cell culture. This combination was further validated by MTT and colony formation assays. Analyses of markers for apoptosis by RPPA and western blotting demonstrated that the combination increases cell death in multiple CRC cell lines when compared to single agents. Furthermore, combining trametinib with vincristine led to significant inhibition in tumor growth when compared to the monotherapies<i> <\/i>using RAS-mutated PDXs <i>in vivo<\/i>. The combination was well tolerated by mice <i>in vivo<\/i> with minor decreases in body weight.<br \/>Conclusions: Our unbiased HTS along with <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> validation studies demonstrated that combining trametinib with vincristine can enhance the efficacy of MEK targeted therapy in RAS mutated CRC cells. Furthermore, our <i>in vivo<\/i> studies were performed using drug doses that reflect clinically achievable doses in humans and thus serve as basis for future clinical studies to determine the efficacy of this drug combination in patients with RAS mutated mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d74c8a9c-3927-445e-a29a-e9470bfbb12c\/@v03B8ZEb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Combination therapy,KRAS,High-content screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12360"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susmita Ghosh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fan Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Roszik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reid Powell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clifford Stephan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee M.

Palbociclib and ribociclib are FDA approved orally active, potent, and highly selective reversible inhibitors of the CDK4 and CDK6 kinases. As it is well established that ERK activation increases cyclin D levels and entry into the cell cycle, we hypothesized that the combination of ERK1\/2 and CDK4\/6 inhibition would have synergistic antitumor activity and cause tumor regression in vivo.<br \/>Initial in vitro work combined ulixertinib with CDK4\/6 inhibitors across a small panel of lung cancer cell lines. Cell lines carrying a KRAS mutation were more sensitive to ulixertinib relative to KRAS wild type cell lines based on single agent IC<sub>50<\/sub> values. The single agent IC<sub>50<\/sub> values for the CDK4\/6 inhibitors were dependent on whether a metabolic or non-metabolic readout for cell viability was used. The combination interactions across a dose matrix of concentrations were determined by the Loewe Additivity and Bliss Independence models. The results of combining ulixertinib and CDK4\/6 inhibitors ranged from additive to potentially synergistic.<br \/>The combination of ulixertinib and palbociclib was then assessed against four xenograft models representing colorectal, melanoma, and pancreatic tumor types, each harboring an alteration within a component of the MAPK pathway. Palbociclib monotherapy across all models showed limited tumor growth inhibition (TGI) while ulixertinib monotherapy demonstrated modest TGI across all models. The combination groups demonstrated significant responses ranging from 75% - 90% TGIs. All treatment regimens were well tolerated across all models. Downstream assays were completed including reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA). Using RPPA, treatment effects on protein signaling was evaluated in the MAPK family, cell cycle regulation, and other associated feedback and compensatory pathways. Notably, suppression of protein targets downstream of ERK1\/2 were seen with both ulixertinib monotherapy and combination therapy. Similarly, the combination therapy group reduced protein levels involved in cell cycle progression, which was not seen in either monotherapy group alone.<br \/>The efficacy demonstrated with this preclinical work has proven to be translatable to the clinic as the combination of ulixertinib and palbociclib recently achieved MTD in a Phase I trial in advanced solid tumors including pancreatic cancer (NCT 03454035).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/83af7609-d0a1-43d8-9653-bb9e26cdd91c\/@v03B8ZEb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12361"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caroline M.

PARP is a core component of single-strand break repair, so in tumors with DDR deficiencies, double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs) accumulate and lead to cell death. Combining PARP inhibition with other DNA-damaging therapies, such as DNA alkylating agents, has proven to be more effective than PARP inhibition alone, as DNA alkylators can lead to the formation of DSBs. However, combination therapies often require sequential administration due to pharmacokinetic considerations and overlapping toxicities, severely limiting their clinical utility. Here, we evaluate a novel class of PARP inhibitors combined with DNA alkylating functionality, in formulation as a single molecule.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>PARP1 activity was determined using the Trevigen Universal Colorimetric PARP Assay Kit and PARP2 activity was determined using the BPS Bioscience PARP2 Colorimetric Assay Kit. Methylator release was evaluated by measuring the appearance of a certain degradation product. Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide staining and quantified using flow cytometry. pH2AX expression as a measure of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) was quantified by flow cytometry using an Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-H2AX phospho (Ser139) antibody from BioLegend. Detection of pH2AX by western blot and immunofluorescence assays was done using anti-phospho histone H2AX (Ser139) antibody from Cell Signaling Technologies.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>kt-4000 series compounds are potent inhibitors of both PARP1 and PARP2 with IC50 values in the low nM range, comparable to FDA-approved PARP inhibitors. The compounds release methylator in a similar manner as temozolomide, an FDA-approved DNA alkylating agent. They induce S-phase and G2\/M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and lead to accumulation of pH2AX by flow cytometry, western blot, and immunofluorescence assays.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our novel class of PARP inhibitors combined with DNA alkylating function show potent inhibition of both PARP1 and PARP2. These compounds also lead to accumulation of H2AX phosphorylation, a sensitive marker for double-strand breaks, and S-phase and G2\/M cell cycle arrest. Development of these bifunctional, single molecule therapies may extend the clinical utility of PARP inhibitors to DDR proficient disease and increase efficacy for DDR deficient disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/adca7a19-7345-4819-8c3a-2d36379803ea\/@v03B8ZEb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,DNA damage response,Alkylating agents,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12362"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Truong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beibei Zhai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fariba Ghaidi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louise Ramos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Joshi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil Sankar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Langlands<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Bacha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wang Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mads Daugaard<\/i><\/presenter>.

AML treatment is very challenging owing to its complex heterogeneity resulting in a dismal 5-year overall survival rate particularly in elderly patients unfit for standard induction chemotherapy. The expansion of AML requires the availability of sufficient nucleotides supporting the anabolic processes required for AML growth thus, targeting nucleotide biosynthesis can halt AML progression. Indeed, targeting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a critical rate-limiting step in the <i>de novo <\/i>pyrimidine synthesis pathway not only induced cytotoxicity but has been shown to promote blast differentiation in a HOXA9\/MEIS1 over-expressing model. We sought to develop a DHODH inhibitor that had superior properties to those reported for AML therapy. Compound 41 (cmpd 41) demonstrates sub-nanomolar 50% inhibitory concentration for DHODH biochemical activity and potent <i>in vitro <\/i>activity across several AML cell lines and primary AML cells independent of mutational subtype, including mutated TP53. Cmpd 41 also demonstrated superior <i>in vivo <\/i>anti-leukemic activity in multiple AML xenograft models as monotherapy and demonstrated synergy with a hypomethylating agent, decitabine in TP53 mutated AML. Given the heterogeneity of AML and frequent emergence of resistant clones, we aimed to investigate ways to enhance response to DHODH inhibitors through combination. After <i>in vitro<\/i> treatment of AML cell lines and primary patient samples with DHODH inhibitors, we observed an increase in CD38 surface expression suggesting synergy with CD38 targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunotherapies. Indeed, we are the first to report synergy between DHODH inhibitors and anti-CD38 mAb in AML which emphasizes the synergy between this promising novel class of agents with immunotherapies via recruiting innate immunity. Consequently, given the relevance of CD38 mAb therapy to multiple myeloma (MM), we extended these studies to MM and remarkably found that cmpd 41 was highly efficacious as a monotherapy and in combination with CD38 mAb, resulted in complete tumor regression in a subcutaneous MM xenograft model. In summary, we introduce a best in class DHODH inhibitor with a data-driven combination strategy for both AML and MM. Our studies suggest a highly synergistic combination strategy involving immunotherapy for AML and other hematologic malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86cd16ef-b9d3-4afe-8ff4-1da2e7271f97\/@v03B8ZEb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Differentiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Differentiation,Drug discovery,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12365"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ola A.

The combination of high-throughput drug screening platforms that efficiently pinpoint drug sensitivities with patient-derived cross-species models is an innovative approach to address the critical need to identify novel treatment strategies for osteosarcoma patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed high-throughput drug screens on patient-derived osteosarcoma cell lines D418 (canine) and 17-3x (human), followed by validation of the top compounds, to identify drug sensitivities and novel therapeutic combinations.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> High-throughput drug screens using 2100 bioactive compounds show that osteosarcoma cell lines D418 and 17-3x exhibited sensitivity to standard-of-care chemotherapy drugs, inhibitors of XPO1 nuclear export, and proteasome inhibitors. The XPO1 inhibitor, verdinexor (VER), and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (BORT), induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in multiple osteosarcoma cell lines (D418, IC<sub>50<\/sub>VER: 3187 nM, IC<sub>50<\/sub>BORT: 2.8 nM; 17-3x IC<sub>50<\/sub>VER: 679 nM, IC<sub>50<\/sub>BORT: 10.9 nM). In addition, dual XPO1 and proteasome inhibition synergistically reduced cell proliferation in D418 (synergy score=12.89) and 17-3x (synergy score=17.87) cell lines (<i>p<\/i> &#60;0.05). Selinexor (SEL), an FDA approved XPO1 inhibitor used in combination with bortezomib to treat multiple myeloma, also demonstrated dose-dependent single-agent activity in patient-derived osteosarcoma cell lines (D418, IC<sub>50<\/sub>SEL: 370 nM; 17-3x IC<sub>50<\/sub>SEL: 101 nM). With drug screening of 119 oncology compounds in combination with selinexor in 17-3x cells, XPO1 inhibition again shows synergistic activity with proteasome inhibition in osteosarcoma.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Inhibition of XPO1-mediated nuclear export is a promising therapeutic strategy in osteosarcoma. These effects may be further potentiated when used in combination with other agents, such as proteasome inhibitors.

New and more effective treatments are needed. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), a form of fibroblasts that comprise much of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment, interact with the cancer cells via the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its receptor, LIF-R. This interaction contributes to tumor progression, survival, and resistance to various therapies, and is an important target for novel therapy. A small molecule inhibitor of LIF-R, EC359, inhibits growth of breast cancer cell line tumor explants in mice (Mol Cancer Ther 18: 1341-1354, 2019) and potentially modulates the activity of gemcitabine against such explants (Genes Cancer 10: 1-10, 2019). Given the involvement of the LIF axis in pancreatic cancer, EC359 was tested for its ability to inhibit proliferation of the human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1, Capan-1, and Capan-2, and its possible influence on activity of chemotherapy drugs against these cell lines. Five-day drug exposures were conducted in 96-well plates. Relative cell density determined using vital stains (alamarBlue&#169;, neutral red) was reported as a percent of the fluorescence\/absorbance of control cultures. The 3 cell lines exhibited different sensitivities to EC359, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 5 nM (Capan-1) to 150 nM (Capan-2). When combined with anti-pancreatic cancer standard-of-care drugs, EC359 yielded synergistic interactions in a concentration-dependent manner. Depending on the cell line, EC359 decreased the IC<sub>50<\/sub> value for oxaliplatin by as much as 83%. Such enhancements of cytotoxicity for other drugs were up to 84% for docetaxel, 67% for paclitaxel, and 50% for irinotecan. EC359 was also synergistic with IBR120 (a novel small molecule inhibitor of RAD51) against PANC-1 cells. EC359 additively inhibited proliferation in combination with irinotecan or 5-FUdR. The nanomolar activity of EC359 against pancreatic cancer cell lines makes it a good candidate for potential treatment of this generally refractory disease. The synergistic interaction of EC359 with standard-of-care drugs provides an opportunity for increasing the therapeutic index for these agents, and ultimately improving clinical outcomes for pancreatic cancer and other cancers against which EC359 is currently in clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c9b63768-0e9b-49f5-bd3f-412d9fe1b30f\/@w03B8ZEc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination studies,leukemia inhibitory factor,LIF receptor,LIF-R inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12367"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peter J.

Compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC is associated with a higher risk for metastatic recurrence. While immunotherapy, PARP inhibitors, and sacituzumab govitecan have shown benefit in a subset of TNBC patients, chemotherapy with doxorubicin remains a mainstay of treatment. Senescence is a cellular phenomenon where cells are committed to an arrested state, however, senescent cells are able to secrete pro-tumorigenic factors which can help to promote tumor progression and invasion. It has been suggested that senescence is a potential mechanism of resistance in doxorubicin (dox) treated cells. Transitioning senescence mediated resistance to apoptosis is crucial to the treatment of TNBC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the combination BCL-2 and HDAC inhibitors with dox to overcome resistance and induce apoptosis.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures:<\/b> TNBC cell lines resistant and sensitive to doxorubicin were identified using a CellTiter-Glo Viability Assay and resistant cell lines were selected for further analysis. To assess proliferation, dox resistant TNBC cell lines were plated in 96-well plates. Cells were exposed to vehicle control, dox, BCL-2 inhibitor, HDAC inhibitor or the combination of dox and BCL-2 inhibitor or HDAC inhibitor for 72 hours. Cellular proliferation was assessed using the BioSpa live cell analysis system. Apoptosis at 24 hours was analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V on cells treated in combination and as single agents. Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate the downstream effects of apoptosis and senescence of drugs as single agents and in combination.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The addition of a BCL-2 inhibitor and HDAC inhibitor to doxorubicin resulted in decreased proliferation in resistant TNBC cell lines compared to single agents and vehicle control by live cell microscopy. Furthermore, the combination of dox and a BCL-2 inhibitor resulted in increased apoptosis when compared to single agents and control using Annexin V staining. The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p16 were over-expressed in cells exposed to combination treatment. Apoptotic proteins BAD, PUMA, cleaved PARP and the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 were upregulated in cells treated with a BCL-2 inhibitor with or without dox.

However, alternative pathways driving stromal paracrine signals might impair its effect. Autotaxin (ATX) is an enzyme that converts lysophosphatidylcholine into its bioactive lipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which in turn promotes inflammation and fibrosis, and contributes to treatment resistance. IOA-289 is a novel ATX inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of tumors burdened with a high degree of stromal involvement. Here, we hypothesized that ATX could sustain an adaptive response upon inhibition of TGF&#946; receptor signaling, impairing GAL antitumor activity.Among ten different murine PC orthotopic models, mice bearing RC416 tumors had the highest plasma levels of TGF&#946;1 as well as high infiltration of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and fibrosis as measured by Masson&#8217;s staining. In coculture models of RC416 with murine pancreatic stellate cells (mPSC4), we measured a significant overexpression of ATX upon treatment with galunisertib mainly by mPSC4, which showed a skewing toward an inflammatory iCAF phenotype through the upregulation of CXCL1 and LY6C1 and the down-regulation of myCAF markers including ACTA2 and Taglin. In the RC416-mPSC4 coculture model, anti-tumor activity was achieved with a combination of gemcitabine plus GAL plus IOA-289, whereas these treatments were ineffective in single culture conditions. Mice bearing RC416 tumors reached a statistically significantly longer survival following treatment with gemcitabine plus IOA-289 or gemcitabine plus GAL [median overall survival (mOS)= 35 days, p&#60;0.05] compared with any single treatment or no treatment control. Most importantly, mice treated with the triple combination of gemcitabine plus IOA-289 and galunisertib had a significantly longer survival than any double combination treatments [mOS=47 days, p&#60;0.05]. In mice treated with gemcitabine in combination with IOA-289 and\/or GAL we measured a significantly reduced infiltration of CAFs, a reduction in plasma levels of CTGF and a diminished degree of fibrosis compared with any single control treatment.In conclusion, we demonstrate that the overexpression of autotaxin by stromal PSC might be an adaptive mechanism in response to TGF&#946; receptor inhibition. IOA-289 is a novel agent that warrants further clinical development in combination with gemcitabine plus GAL for the treatment of PC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/831e5ba4-dcfd-45fe-9d7b-3caf9513e26b\/@w03B8ZEc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;),autotaxin,Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12368"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Fabio Sabbadini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Bertolini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Domenico Mangiameli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Serena Contarelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoë Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael M.

Previous studies showed that terrein possesses cytotoxic properties attributed to interrupting various molecular pathways, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB). Gemcitabine (GCB) is an anticancer drug commonly used to treat colorectal cancer; however, it suffers from tumor cell resistance and subsequently treatment failure. In this study, the potential anticancer properties of terrein as well as its chemomodulatory effect on GCB are assessed against various colorectal cancer cell lines (SW620, HT29 and HCT116) under normoxic and hypoxic (pO<sub>2<\/sub> &#8804; 1%) conditions. The antiproliferative effects of terrein, GCB and their equitoxic combination were evaluated using sulforhodamine-B assay. In SW620, terrein had IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of 66.89&#177;8.5 &#181;M and 73.4&#177;1.3 &#181;M as single treatment, and the IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of GCB in combination treatment were 0.27&#177; 0.01 &#181;M and 0.24&#177;0.04 &#181;M, under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively. In HT29, terrein had IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of 85.5&#177;4.4 &#181;M and 49.6&#177;11.4 &#181;M, and the IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of GCB in combination treatment were 3.2&#177;0.08 &#181;M and 0.27&#177;0.005 &#181;M, under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively. In HCT116, terrein had IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of 21.6&#177;2.891 &#181;M and 74.76&#177;0.97 &#181;M, and the IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#8217;s of GCB in combination treatment were 0.23&#177;0.03 &#181;M and 0.23&#177;0.005 &#181;M, under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively. In both SW620 and HCT116, terrein exhibited a preferential antitumor effect in hypoxic conditions; however, the opposite was observed in HT29. Upon further analysis via flow cytometry after annexin-V\/FITC and PI staining, GCB and its combination treatment with terrein were found to induce necrosis in all cell lines under investigation. In addition, terrein was found to significantly induce significant S-phase cell arrest compared to GCB treatment alone using DNA content cytometry assay coupled with PI staining. Currently, we are studying the expression of multiple cyclins\/CDK&#8217;s involved in the different cell cycle phases for further understanding of the detailed mechanism of action. Using flowcytometry assessment after staining with acridine orange, terrein suppressed autophagy compared to control cells as well as GCB treatment. NMR metabolomic analysis revealed that the change in oxygen levels significantly affected extracellular amino acid metabolite profiling such as leucin, which increased significantly due to hypoxia; while tyrosine decreased significantly in response to hypoxic environment. Currently, the gene expression profiling corresponding to these amino acids metabolomic changes are undergoing. Therefore, oxygen concentration plays a vital role in the intratumoral amino acid metabolism in response to terrein, GCB and their combination within colorectal cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cdb449d5-a35b-40a0-bcd5-1ddf33ec0974\/@w03B8ZEc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Gemcitabine,Metabolomics,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12369"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Reham K.

Epidemiological studies have linked obesity with EAC. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is an important mediator in obesity-associated EAC. Paclitaxel (PT) has been used in combination with carboplatin as a standard combination therapy for advanced EAC. PT required emulsification with solvents which have resulted in serious adverse effects in patients. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is an albumin-stabilized, cremophor-free and water-soluble nanoparticle formulation of PT. Nab-paclitaxel has recently shown greater efficacy over PT in EAC. In this study, we evaluated the potential of targeting IGF signaling and improvement in nab-paclitaxel response by the addition of BMS-754807 in experimental EAC.<br \/>Methods: We first evaluated the phosphorylation status of IGF-1R\/IR protein by Western blot in a panel of EAC cell lines. BMS-754807 and nab-paclitaxel, alone or in combination were tested for effects on cell growth, cell apoptosis, cell migration and cell cycle analyses of EAC cell lines detected respectively by WST-1 assay, Western blotting, would healing scratch assay and propidium iodide flow cytometry. We then explored the antitumor efficacy of BMS-754807 and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy and in combination in murine subcutaneous xenograft and peritoneal metastatic survival models of human EAC.<br \/>Results: BMS-754807 dose-dependently inhibited <i>in-vitro<\/i> cell proliferation of EAC cell lines having phosphorylation of IGF-1R\/IR protein. The co-administration of BMS-754807 and nab-paclitaxel effectively enhanced cell growth inhibition, cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, <i>in-vitro<\/i> wound healing inhibition and cell cycle arrest at sub G0\/G1 phase. BMS-754807 in combination with nab-paclitaxel treatment resulted in significantly higher antitumor efficacy by increasing intratumoral apoptosis and survival benefit compared with BMS-754807 or nab-paclitaxel treatment alone. In subcutaneous xenografts using OE19 cells, average net tumor growth after two weeks in different therapy groups was 558.67 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in control, 208.47 mm<sup>3<\/sup> after BMS-754807 (p=0.043), 104.60 mm<sup>3<\/sup> after nab-paclitaxel (p=0.013), and 14.30 mm<sup>3<\/sup> after BMS-754807 plus nab-paclitaxel (p=0.0005). There was a significant increase in median animal survival after BMS-754807 plus nab-paclitaxel treatment (85 days) compared to control (47 days, p=0.0034), BMS-754807 monotherapy (57 days, p=0.0021) or nab-paclitaxel (68 days, p=0.0339) monotherapy.<br \/>Conclusion: These results support the potential of BMS-754807 in combination with nab-paclitaxel as an effective option for EAC therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e46bb9c5-cbb0-491f-bcef-fea6e7e24787\/@w03B8ZEc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Insulin-like growth factor (IGF),Apoptosis,Antitumor effect,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12370"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Md Sazzad Hassan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Cwidak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chloe Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saisantosh Ponna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niranjan Awasthi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Urs Von Holzen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Extrinsic apoptosis can be activated through multimerization of death receptor 5 (DR5), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family member highly expressed in many cancers. However, cellular resistance mechanisms within the intrinsic pathway may limit DR5 activity, including inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) that block caspase activity or promote pro-survival NF&#954;B signaling. Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) is an endogenous bivalent IAP antagonist. Birinapant, a bivalent SMAC mimetic that binds and degrades IAPs, has been evaluated through Phase 2, demonstrating good safety and on target activity but minimal efficacy as a monotherapy. We hypothesized that simultaneously targeting the extrinsic apoptotic pathway with IGM-8444, an anti-DR5 multivalent IgM agonist, and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway with birinapant could enhance tumor cell apoptosis. Human cancer cell lines including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), head and neck, ovarian, colorectal, lung, and sarcomas, were screened for sensitivity to IGM-8444 and birinapant combination. Strong synergistic cytotoxicity was observed <i>in vitro<\/i> in 36\/45 (80%) cancer cell lines, as measured by both Bliss synergy score and maximal killing. IGM-8444 and birinapant combination also induced synergistic cytotoxicity in cells with acquired resistance to DR5 agonist antibodies. By contrast, IGM-8444 and birinapant did not kill primary human hepatocytes <i>in vitro, <\/i>demonstrating the potential clinical safety for this combination. <i>In vivo<\/i>, the IGM-8444 and birinapant combination dose-dependently reduced tumor growth in a MDA-MB-231 TNBC model, with 8\/10 tumor-free mice at the highest dose of birinapant tested. By comparison, birinapant combination with an anti-DR5 IgG agonist showed a modest response. IGM-8444 and birinapant also showed significant anti-tumor responses in additional cell line and patient-derived xenograft models, including 7\/9 tumor-free animals in a HT-1080 fibrosarcoma model and 9\/10 complete responses in a EBC-1 lung squamous cell lung carcinoma model. Lastly, pharmacodynamic biomarkers including cIAP1 degradation, caspase activation, and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 in tumor and serum correlated with anti-tumor response. In summary, combined targeting of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways with IGM-8444 and birinapant respectively enhances tumor cytotoxicity in multiple preclinical models. The combination of IGM-8444 with birinapant is currently under evaluation in a Phase 1 study in patients with relapsed and\/or refractory solid cancers (NCT04553692).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8fc8eae1-dc0e-43d4-a5ba-fe25108d108c\/@w03B8ZEc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Death receptors,Combination studies,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12372"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"41075502-ca6d-42da-b7db-4353d9cfcf50","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41075502-ca6d-42da-b7db-4353d9cfcf50\/@w03B8ZEc\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Beatrice T.

OBT076 is a novel and selective clinical stage ADC with potent activity against CD205-positive liquid and solid tumors. We explored the cellular cytotoxicity profile of combination chemotherapy with OBT076 and two standard-of-care platinum-based compounds, Oxaliplatin (Ox) and Cisplatin (Cis), in preclinical gastric, pancreatic and colorectal cancer models.<br \/>A panel of gastric cancer and other solid tumor cell lines were selected, based on mRNA data, for CD205 expression. This was confirmed using flow cytometry. The cell lines were assessed for susceptibility to monotherapy with OBT076, Ox and Cis. Cells lines displaying positive cytotoxic responses were assessed for susceptibility to combination chemotherapy by first treating cells with a single dose of OBT076 for 72 hours, leading to 20% growth inhibition (IC20), and subsequently with either Ox or Cis for 48 hours (OBT-Ox and OBT-CIS, respectively). The ATP-dependent fluorescence-based cellular viability system cell titer-glo was used as the cytotoxic readout.<br \/>In our preclinical gastric cancer model, pre-treatment with OBT076 followed by either Ox or Cis displayed synergistic combination effects, reducing the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) of Ox and Cis by 40- and 10-fold respectively. The resultant cellular cytotoxicity of OBT-Ox and OBT-Cis combination therapy was higher compared to monotherapy with either agent. Moreover, while monotherapy with Ox was less potent than with Cis, OBT-Ox achieved similar potency to OBT076-Cis. For colorectal and pancreatic cancer models, the effects were less pronounced: OBT076-combination therapy increased Platinum sensitivity by 2 to 5 times. No synergistic effects were observed when the treatment order was reversed. These results and those from ongoing <i>in vivo<\/i> studies in gastric cancer models will be discussed.<br \/>In summary OBT076, a clinical stage ADC displays synergistic anti-tumor effects in preclinical gastric cancer models, when used in combination with Ox or Cis. OBT076 is currently being evaluated in the gastric clinical population where Platinum-based therapies remain the mainstay of treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d94ee41a-5beb-4d81-9ab8-1b94928cc8fc\/@w03B8ZEc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Combination studies,Gastric cancer,Oxaliplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12373"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arnima Bisht<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murray Cox<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chander Sekhar Peddaboina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Crocamo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abderrahim Fandi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Rohlff<\/i><\/presenter>.

It reduces testosterone production by blocking the enzyme cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase. Despite exhibiting improved survival outcomes, almost all patients with advance-stage disease relapse, progressing to a more aggressive and lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our pathway-related analysis and characterization of gene expression identified activation of the &#946;-catenin pathway in abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer. Increased expression of androgen receptor (AR) and &#946;-catenin and their crosstalk between distinct signaling pathways causes activation of AR target genes and regulatory networks for which overcoming innate or acquired resistance remains a major challenge. Here we show that co-targeting AR and &#946;-catenin induces cell death in abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer. For these studies, we generated abiraterone-resistant C4-2B cells (C4-2B-Abi) by growing them in progressive concentration of abiraterone 5-20&#181;M to develop resistance and maintained in 5&#181;M abiraterone in the culture medium for &#62;20 generations. Treatment of C4-2B-Abi cells individually with abiraterone (20&#181;M) and ICG001 (2&#181;M) for 72 h exhibited a partial suppressive effect in cell growth compared to C4-2B parental cell line. A combination of abiraterone and ICG001 (20&#181;M + 2&#181;M) exhibited marked cell growth inhibition with significant increase in G1-phase cell cycle arrest, inhibition of migration and invasion in C4-2B-Abi cells, compared to the parental counterpart. Furthermore, combination treatment led to significant reduction in cell proliferation as assessed by PCNA along with reduction in the protein expression of AR, AR-v7, CDC20, PSA, &#946;-catenin and its downstream targets, cyclinD1 and c-Myc, which were more prominent in C4-2B-Abi cells, compared to parental C4-2B cells. Co-targeting AR and &#946;-catenin potentiated cell death in C4-2B-Abi cells as evident by increased PARP cleavage. Together, our data identify activation of the &#946;-catenin pathway as a major mechanism contributing to abiraterone resistance and demonstrate that combined treatment with abiraterone and ICG001 appears to be an effective regimen for treatment of abiraterone-resistant cancer cells. This opens new therapeutic modality for advance-stage castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Signaling,Resistance,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17444"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ibrahim M.

In this study we compared the efficacy of TOL and paclitaxel, a current standard chemotherapeutic agent for treating advanced murine breast cancer, as a positive control. For this, BALB\/c mice with 4T1 homografts were treated with TOL alone, paclitaxel alone or with a combination regimen of paclitaxel and TOL. For TOL, mice received 8 hourly doses (3 mg\/kg) of digoxin on 2 successive days. Upon reaching steady-state levels (dose 5) the mice were exposed to 4 X 30 minutes of pulsed electric field stimulation (18 V\/m, 10 ms pulses, 15 interstimulus intervals) hourly for a total of 2 hours of stimulation. Alternatively, mice received paclitaxel (20 mg\/kg) by i.p. injection. Mice that were treated concurrently with TOL and paclitaxel received paclitaxel 2 days prior to treatment with TOL. Groups of mice that received digoxin alone, stimulation alone, paclitaxel + digoxin, paclitaxel + stimulation or vehicle alone served as negative controls. Initially, the homografts were measured daily and then every other day with a digital caliper until criteria for humane endpoint euthanasia were met. The mean time to meeting criteria for humane endpoint euthanasia in mice treated with paclitaxel alone (2 days) was identical to that observed in the negative controls. Mice treated with TOL alone, on average, met criteria at post-treatment day 5, whereas administration of paclitaxel two days before TOL reduced the effectiveness of TOL, decreasing mean survival to day 3 post-treatment. Immunohistochemical evidence indicated that paclitaxel&#8217;s effect on tubulin may impede the transport and insertion of channels into the cell membrane, thereby reducing the channel density and the effectiveness of TOL. By contrast, the administration of TOL either before or after treatment with paclitaxel improved host survival. Normal tissues were unaffected. These results are evidence that TOL is equal to or better than paclitaxel for increasing survival of murine hosts with advanced breast cancer when TOL is administered before or between paclitaxel dosing cycles. Sequential use of TOL may well improve survival, but simultaneous administration of paclitaxel and TOL will likely reduce TOL&#8217;s adjunctive benefit. Because of the conserved nature of the sodium channel\/sodium pump mechanism, the comparable efficacy to TOL to a currently approved treatment and the favorable adverse effect profile, we submit that TOL warrants further study as a promising option for treating individuals with advanced neoplastic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1d9903a8-ef73-4108-a9aa-4d4fc4ad9ce0\/@x03B8ZEd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17445"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Harry J.
