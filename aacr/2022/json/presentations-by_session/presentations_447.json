[{"Abstract":"Osteosarcoma is the most common pediatric bone tumor. &nbsp;Death from osteosarcoma is almost always due to metastatic spread to the lungs, which largely occurs after the primary tumor has been resected and treated with chemotherapy. Others have suggested that the primary tumor elaborates factors that suppress metastasis, though mechanisms explaining this phenomenon have not been well-validated suggested that primary osteosarcoma tumors suppress metastasis by recruiting circulating tumor cells back to the tumor via self-seeding, though the mechanism(s) of recruitment remained poorly defined.<br \/>We found that osteosarcoma cells induce chemotaxis of other osteosarcoma cells <i>in vitro<\/i>.&nbsp; We previously demonstrated that osteosarcoma cells produce IL6 and CXCL8.&nbsp; Here, we found that both cytokines induced chemotaxis of osteosarcoma cells. Conversely, inhibition of both cytokines prevented osteosarcoma-induced osteosarcoma chemotaxis. These results suggested a model wherein tumor cells attract other tumor cells via inflammatory cytokine signaling.<br \/>Within a living organism, such mechanisms might have implications for therapy. We wondered whether resection of a primary osteosarcoma tumor might redirect circulating tumor cells from the primary tumor to the lung (the &#8220;next best&#8221; site). To test this hypothesis, we generated orthotopic tibial tumors in mice.&nbsp;One cohort of mice underwent amputation of primary tumor while another retained their primary tumors.&nbsp; At euthanasia, mice that underwent amputation had significantly increased tumor cell burden in the lungs. &nbsp;In separate experiments, lungs from mice with established primary tumors showed significantly less osteosarcoma lung burden than was seen in mice that did not have a primary tumor. Many of infiltrating (labeled) tumor cells were subsequently identified within the primary tumor, strongly supporting the self-seeding model.&nbsp;<br \/>Finally, we asked whether this same self-seeding mechanism might drive events important to lung metastasis. To test this hypothesis, mice were first inoculated with green labelled osteosarcoma cells to induce lung metastasis. Fourteen days later, the same mice received inoculation with red labelled osteosarcoma cells.&nbsp; Strikingly, we found that lesions contained many more red- than green-labeled osteosarcoma cells.&nbsp; In addition, we have demonstrated that inhibition of IL6\/CXCL8 blocks circulating tumor cell recruitment to established lung niches.&nbsp; This suggests circulating tumor cells preferentially target an established niche within the lung in an IL6\/CXCL8 dependent manner in the absence of a primary tumor. Collectively, our data suggests that a loss of self-seeding in osteosarcoma on excision of the primary tumor increases metastatic burden. We are now exploring ways to leverage this biology in the development of novel therapies that prevent metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f74bb357-f4e6-4cf8-90cb-e9077dc85f23\/@n03B8ZLp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Metastasis,Cytokines,Circulating tumor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11552"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amy C.

Given the ongoing disease burden and mortality from advanced prostate cancer that persist despite available therapies, novel therapeutic targets are clearly needed.<br \/>To this end, we conducted a high-resolution analysis of primary prostate cancer samples across a spectrum of tumor stage using 10x Chromium scRNAseq. Within each patient, we compared the prostate tumor to its adjacent normal tissue. These samples were also compared to healthy prostate samples collected from patients whose prostates were removed in the setting of bladder cancer surgery.<br \/>Joint analysis revealed a rich repertoire of immune and non-immune stroma cells. Significant alterations were apparent in the prostate tumor microenvironment compared to adjacent normal and healthy samples. One striking difference was an expansion of T-cell cluster characterized by decreased cytotoxic and an increased exhaustion gene signatures. Another difference was the significantly higher regulatory T cell (Treg) activity.<br \/>There was a substantial population shift within the myeloid compartment. Specifically, tumor tissue showed a selective enrichment in M2-like macrophages which was validated by multiplex immunohistochemistry. In addition, tumor tissue showed a significant increase in the myeloid-derived suppressor cell scoring in tumor inflammatory monocytes that strongly correlated with Treg activity. The changes in both myeloid and T cell gene expression suggest an immune suppressive environment within the tumor.<br \/>In addition, we performed Slide-seqV2 to generate high spatial resolution maps of cellular organization of prostate tissues. The highly detailed spatial configuration of the healthy prostate tissue showed well-organized prostate epithelial glands surrounded by immune and non-immune stromal cells. This tissue architecture was severely disrupted within the cancerous prostate. Endothelial and fibroblast populations were disorganized and dispersed throughout the invading tumor. Context-dependent differential expression gene analysis on endothelial cells showed significant upregulation of sprouting angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways in the tumor context. In addition, we developed an approach to characterize the coordination between tumor cells and stromal compartment via spatial ligand-receptor (L\/R) interaction. Data revealed 405 significant potential communication channels with many of these interactions known to have a role in prostate tumor angiogenesis and progression.<br \/>These data provide a high resolution landscape of localized prostate cancer via 10x and Slide-seq. Data showed an immunosuppressive milieu in addition to highly active endothelial angiogenic program. L\/R interaction analysis revealed interactions that may serve as potential therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ac39a45d-379b-40fa-804a-eeacb56aeef1\/@n03B8ZLp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Immunosuppression,Angiogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11553"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Taghreed Hirz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenglin Mei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirak Sarkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youmna Kfoury<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shulin Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chin-Lee Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evan Z.

Even though 35-40% of young people so treated still die from the disease, usually from complications related to lung metastasis, our standard of care remains unchanged since 1982. While effective metastasis-targeting interventions could transform clinical care, our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms driving tumor spread have hampered efforts to develop rational, targeted therapeutic interventions. Working to address these gaps, our lab previously showed that concurrent inhibition of IL6 and CXCL8 could prevent metastases in up to 85% of osteosarcoma-bearing mice, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Seeking to understand the mechanism, we generated single-cell RNA-seq datasets from the lungs of osteosarcoma bearing mice collected at multiple time points during lung colonization. We employed niche labeling technology to isolate both tumor and tumor-associated cells and generated single cell transcriptomic datasets from the isolated cells. We used this data to perform inter-cellular signaling analyses and to characterize changes occurring in the composition and phenotype of cells occupying the metastatic niche over developmental time. Immunofluorescent staining of both murine and human metastatic lesions confirmed key findings from the scRNA-seq data. We found that a small subpopulation of osteosarcoma cells triggers an IL1-IL6 paracrine loop upon interaction with lung epithelial cells, driving IL6\/CXCL8 production within the early metastatic niche. This subset of tumor cells is hypo-proliferative, hyper-secretory, p21+, and survives the stresses of dissemination to the lung. We call these metastasis initiating cells \"anchor\" cells and their rapidly proliferative counterparts \"growth cells.\" Very early metastases show near-complete enrichment for anchor-phenotype osteosarcoma cells, while growth cells become dominant as lesions expand. Anchor derived signals can recruit circulating growth cells into a developing niche. However, it remains unclear whether this or state changes in anchor cell progeny are the primary mechanism for the appearance of growth cells within a lesion. Intriguingly, anchor cells appear resistant to chemotherapy, providing a potential mechanism for relapse after treatment. Taken together, the data suggest that the establishment of lung metastases arises through cooperation among tumor cells with distinct phenotypes. Anchor cells survive the initial stresses of the pulmonary environment and modify that environment. Proliferating growth cells are subsequently recruited to anchored niches to produce clinically relevant metastatic lesions. Effective treatment of metastases likely requires combinations of agents that target both osteosarcoma subtypes, which exhibit highly divergent sensitivity to conventional therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/35d2d0ea-5e06-4a20-8ccc-d152bfdea56c\/@n03B8ZLp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Metastasis,Heterogeneity,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11554"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>James B.

BC patient prognosis has improved for localized BC, yet metastatic BC continues to cause high mortality with a 5 year survival rate of only 27%. Approximately 70% of BC metastases occur in the bone, with a tumor microenvironment (TME) composed primarily of BC cells, immune cells, and bone cells. In these cellular compartments, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling exhibits unique TME dependent tumor promoter and suppressor effects. Previous studies in our lab have found BMPs promote myeloid progenitors, polarization of M2 macrophages, and tumor progression in a BMPR1a LysMCre conditional knockout mouse model. Yet to establish BMPs as a viable target for the treatment of metastatic bone, the mechanisms behind BMPs promoting BC bone metastases must be investigated. To further investigate BMP dependent myeloid heterogeneity in cancer, we have utilized a cohort of non-treatment na&#239;ve BC patient bone biopsies to unveil the distinct myeloid populations in the TME of BC bone metastases. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a subset of patient samples with a high myeloid gene signature, corresponding with increased chemokine, cytokine and JAK\/STAT signaling gene pathways in addition to enhanced BMP signaling. Digital Spatial Profiling via the NanoString GeoMx platform and multiplexed immunohistochemistry staining via the AKOYA Vectra Polaris platform were used to analyze the spatial context of the TME in our cohort of patient bone. We found enhanced myeloid cell infiltration, myeloid heterogeneity and M2 macrophage polarization in the TME of high myeloid gene signature patient samples. This precision oncology analysis into the unique landscape of the metastatic bone TME revealed BMP driven phenotypes in distinct TME cellular components. To then determine if the TME features observed in the metastatic bone samples was reflective of altered innate trained immunity regulated by BMPs, we investigated the requirement for BMP signaling in myeloid inflammatory responses both <i>in vitro<\/i> and in a mouse model of BC bone metastasis. We found BMPs alter the ability for macrophages to undergo innate trained immunity functions and BC bone metastases alter myeloid inflammatory responses in mice. Investigating the heterogeneity and functions of myeloid cells in the TME of bone metastatic BC will help advance therapeutic target development for BC patients with bone lesions. Expanding therapeutic options for metastatic BC patients will improve patient quality of life and reduce deaths caused by metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc222770-3e88-48c9-b9ef-09fe1343c947\/@n03B8ZLp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Breast cancer,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11560"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Claire Louise Ihle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Desiree Straign<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Owens<\/i><\/presenter>.

Whereas the PDAC TME is known to be highly immunosuppressive, it remains elusive how distinct genetic alterations affect TME cell type recruitment and how this, in turn, influences progression and treatment outcome. Therefore, we systematically investigated the TME composition and tumor-immune crosstalk in molecular PDAC subtypes. We delineated the TME landscape of a comprehensive tumor cohort derived from <i>Kras<\/i>-driven PDAC mouse models by integrating single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) with histopathological analysis, tissue RNA-seq followed by deconvolution and flow cytometry immunophenotyping. Our results show that distinct molecular PDAC subtypes recruit divergent subpopulations of infiltrating immune cells, most notably evidenced by major differences in frequency and phenotype of macrophages and neutrophils. Functional secretome analysis of well-characterized <i>Kras-<\/i>driven mouse and primary human PDAC cell lines revealed subtype-specific factors which differ between the two main transcriptional subtypes of PDAC (classical and mesenchymal). Accordingly, crosstalk between tumor and immune cells inferred by interaction probability analysis through ligand-receptor pairs from scRNA-seq data nominates the CSF signaling network as a key player in mesenchymal PDAC, whereas CXCL signal hubs mediate higher infiltration of immunosuppressive neutrophils in classical tumors. Our findings contribute to the understanding of PDAC subtype-specific biology and aid the identification of potential immunotherapeutic vulnerabilities thereof.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/62b556a7-df02-4cb7-9c38-3bd4fc6d6760\/@n03B8ZLp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11565"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stefanie Bärthel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Falcomatà<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastian A.

Up to 50% of colorectal carcinoma patients develop LM during their disease and this is associated with a poor prognosis. Our laboratory previously identified a sexual dimorphism in the regulation of the immune microenvironment (IME) of LM and showed that estrogen could promote the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Tregs in the liver in response to invading cancer cells. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of estrogen in the recruitment and polarization of monocytes\/macrophages and in the accumulation and phenotype of natural killer (NK) cells in the IME of colorectal carcinoma LM (CRCLM). Moreover, we sought to determine the therapeutic potential of Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader (SERD) therapy in tumor bearing female mice. In estrogen-competent female mice bearing CRCLM, we found increased gene and protein expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-&#946;, and inversely a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. Furthermore, we identified a significant increase of newly recruited, immunosuppressive CD68<sup>+<\/sup>F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>CD163<sup>+<\/sup> M2 macrophages, as compared to estrogen-depleted (ovariectomized) mice. The recruitment of pro-inflammatory CD68<sup>+<\/sup>F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>TNF-alpha<sup>+<\/sup> M1 macrophages, and the accumulation of the highly cytotoxic NK1.1<sup>+ <\/sup>CD49a<sup>+<\/sup> liver NK cells were increased in estrogen-depleted female mice and could be restored upon estrogen supplementation. Moreover, treatment of female mice with the SERD Fulvestrant, markedly reduced the number of CRCLM compared to vehicle-treated mice, and significantly reduced the cell frequencies and counts of recruited myeloid cells and M2 macrophages in the liver. Taken together, our results identify estrogen as a critical regulator of an immunosuppressive tumor ME in the liver and a potential therapeutic target.

The 5-year survival rate for PDAC is 10% following diagnosis. Preclinical murine models have been developed that leverage key driver mutations and have significantly contributed to our understanding of PDAC. One such genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) that has emerged as an important tool is the KPC mouse (LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>;LSL-Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>; p48-Cre) that spontaneously develops pancreatic tumors at ~14-16 weeks of age. Cadherin-11 (Cdh11), a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule has been suggested to play a role in development of the desmoplastic stroma in PDAC, that leads to difficulties in drug accessibility and has been hypothesized to contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance and correlate with poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms by which Cdh11 deficiency in the stromal microenvironment of PDAC-bearing KPC mice influences tumor infiltrating immune cells, has yet to be fully understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of the immune (CD45+) compartment of tumor bearing Cdh11 proficient (KPC\/Cdh11<sup>+\/+<\/sup>), tumor bearing Cdh11 deficient (KPC\/Cdh11<sup>+\/-<\/sup>), non-tumor bearing Cdh11 deficient (Cdh11<sup>+\/-<\/sup>) and wildtype (Cdh11<sup>+\/+<\/sup>) mice was performed. We observed a sharp decrease in the presence of myeloid\/monocyte lineage cells (CD14+) in KPC\/Cdh11<sup>+\/-<\/sup> tumors and also an increase in T, B and plasma cells, compared to KPC\/Cdh11<sup>+\/+ <\/sup>tumors. Genes upregulated in infiltrating T- and NK cells specific to a Cdh11 deficient background include <i>Cd8a, Nkg7, Maf<\/i>. Additionally, genes found to be upregulated in B cell clusters in Cdh11 deficient mice include those related to B cell differentiation\/activation such as <i>Lgals1<\/i>, <i>Id2<\/i>, <i>Itgb1<\/i>, <i>Rgs1. <\/i>The increase in B and T cell infiltration was specific to the Cdh11 deficient background, since both pancreata from KPC\/Cdh11<sup>+\/+<\/sup>and Cdh11<sup>+\/-<\/sup> mice had elevated levels of infiltration. Immunohistochemical validation of these findings has confirmed these changes in tumor infiltrating immune cells. Additionally of note, an increase in antibody-producing plasma cells was observed specifically in a Cdh11 deficient background. <i>Igkc<\/i>, an immunoglobulin found to be enriched in plasma cells was highly expressed in this group of immune cells. We also observed that <i>KPC<\/i>\/<i>Cdh11<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i>had significantly more <i>Igkc<\/i> expressing cells than <i>KPC<\/i>\/<i>Cdh11<sup>+\/+<\/sup><\/i>. Future work is needed to clearly define the role of Cdh11 in modulating B, T and plasma cell behavior and subsequent contributions to PDAC outcome. <i>This study received funding by LDRD 19-SI-003.

To decipher potential mechanisms linking tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with an expression of immune-related genes in EBVaGC we utilized RNAseq gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) dataset and performed cellular deconvolution analyses by a mixed approach including two complementary approaches (MIXTURE and xCell). In accordance with previous studies, we observed an increase in CD8+ cells and Interferon activity. Further analysis by gene set variation analysis (GSVA) showed an increased exhausted CD8+ signature accompanied by a higher intratumoral Treg signature. Accordingly, an enrichment in both stimulatory and inhibitory immune checkpoint levels on EBVaGC tumors was observed. We next performed differential expression analysis comparing EBVaGC to other STAD subtypes (CIN, GS, HM-SNV, HM-indel) individually. As a result, from this approach, we generated a list of unique EBVaGC-specific genes that was used to construct EBVaGC-specific cell-cell interaction networks. To infer cell-cell interactions underlying the specific tumor immune microenvironment, we implemented the NicheNetR algorithm by including only differentially expressed ligands and targets from the list of EBVaGC genes obtaining a ligand-interaction matrix from which we constructed a EBVaGC-like gene signature. Functional annotation of this ligand-target network showed ligands and targets principally involved in chemotaxis, T-cell apoptosis, and cellular responses to bacterial infection. This signature correlated with better survival not only in EBVaGC but also in other TCGA cohorts such as colon adenocarcinoma and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. Our findings identified an increase in exhausted CD8+ signature, high intratumoral Treg signature and enrichment in inhibitory immune checkpoint transcripts. We herein propose a new EBVaGC-like gene expression signature that correlates with better survival in multiple cancer types. In-vitro and in-vivo assays will be required for functional validation of these findings as well as clinical trials to confirm the role of our novel EBVaGC-like gene signature in a precision oncology setting.

Additionally, the consequence of weight loss (WL) prior to the diagnosis of cancer has not been fully explored. One possible link is via the immune system. Obesity is associated with metabolic dysfunction as well as inflammation of the adipose tissue. While WL is a great tool to combat metabolic dysfunction, we have shown that following WL the adipose tissue does not properly reprogram its immunophenotype and remains in a heightened inflammatory state.<br \/>Accompanying the heightened inflammatory state and increased immune infiltration found in obesity, a novel subset of macrophages termed &#8220;lipid associated macrophages&#8221; (LAMs) with high expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) have been discovered in adipose tissue of obese mice and humans. Data from our lab shows LAMs are found at low levels in the adipose tissue of lean mice and enhanced in weight gain (WG) and WL mice. While other investigators have shown Trem2-expressing tumor associated macrophages contribute to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, the implications of enhanced Trem2<sup>+<\/sup> LAMs found in obesity and WL have not been explored in the context of cancer. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the impact of obesity and WL on breast cancer tumor progression.<br \/>Female mice were ovariectomized to model post-menopause and to enable greater weight gain. High fat diet (HFD) and low fat diet (LFD) feeding paradigms were used to produce three diet groups: lean, WG, and WL. Lean mice were maintained on LFD for the entirety of the study. WG mice were fed LFD for 12 weeks followed by HFD for 12 weeks. Mice in the WL group were fed HFD for 12 weeks to establish obesity and then fed LFD for 12 weeks to achieve WL. Four weeks prior to the end of the dietary paradigm, mice were injected with E0771 mammary cancer cells into the mammary fat pad.<br \/>We confirmed that obesity drives accelerated tumor growth progression resulting in significantly increased tumor mass. We found that WL results in an intermediate phenotype between the lean and obese models, suggesting WL may provide some protection to tumor growth, but does not restore the tumor-bearing host to the same level of protection as a consistently lean model.<br \/>We also demonstrated significantly increased gene expression of both Adgre1 (gene for F4\/80) and Trem2 in obese ovarian and mammary adipose tissue compared to lean adipose tissue. Future studies will focus on understanding the mechanistic links between heightened inflammation in obese and WL adipose tissue and tumor progression.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, MDSC, are functional myeloid cells with immune suppressive properties. When infiltrated into the tumor, these cells induce dysfunction of cytotoxic T cells via the secretion of immunosuppressive molecules like arginase-1 and promote tumor progression. MDSC is classified into two major subsets in a mouse by their surface antigens: monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs; CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>Ly6C<sup>high<\/sup>Ly6G<sup>&#8722;<\/sup>) and polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs; CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>Ly6C<sup>low<\/sup>Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>). To date, MDSCs are difficult to identify because they express the same surface markers as neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. CD244, an immunoregulatory transmembrane receptor molecule, has been highlighted as a surface antigen to distinguish PMN&#8208;MDSCs from normal neutrophils. However, few studies have demonstrated whether and how MDSCs, especially CD244<sup>+<\/sup> PMN-MDSC, affect the generation and progression of PD.<br \/><b>Objective <\/b>To clarify CD244<sup>+<\/sup> PMN-MDSC affects the progression of PD and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Female C57BL6J mice were injected 5.0&#215;10<sup>5<\/sup> ~ 2.0&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> cells of MC38 colon cancer intraperitoneally to establish the PD model, and we had conducted the following three experiments: Exp. 1) Investigation of the trend of immune cells including MDSC and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell in the PD nodule, peritoneal cavity, blood, and spleen; Exp. 2) PMN-MDSC depletion test in PD model; and Exp. 3) Investigation of direct influence of CD244<sup>+<\/sup> or CD244<sup>-<\/sup> Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup> cells in T cell proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Exp. 1) PD nodules became enlarged and increased over time. All mice had died by day 40 after the cancer was inoculated in the PD model, which was significantly shorter than the MC38-based subcutaneously inoculation model. In the PD model, a significant increase of PMN-MDSCs was observed in the peritoneal cavity, blood, and spleen, and also observed these cells in the PD nodule at day 20. Of note, the CD244<sup>+<\/sup> PMN-MDSC predominantly existed in the population of myeloid cells in the peritoneal cavity. Exp. 2) To deplete the PMN-MDSC, the mice were administered a Ly6G antibody. Although Ly6G treatment could not improve the survival rate of the PD model, the tumor progression was significantly decreased, and the number of both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was notably increased in the peritoneal cavity at day 19. Exp. 3) Finally, we sorted CD244<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD244<sup>-<\/sup> Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup> cells and co-cultured them with splenocytes.

Although NK cells, a member of innate immunity, recognize and exert anti-tumor immune responses, tumors escape NK cell immunity and progress to late stages by inducing factors like inhibitory receptors and cytokines. IL-15, a cytokine, stimulates NK cell function and persistent exposure to IL-15 induces cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH), an inhibitory receptor and a marker of NK cell exhaustion. It is unknown if ovarian tumors use this phenomenon in their favor as the tumor secretes enhanced levels of IL-15. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with root powder of Ashwagandha (ASH), a natural herb and an anti-stress compound has shown to decrease the rates of OVCA metastasis and enhance the frequency of intratumoral NK cells in a preclinical model. However, it is unknown if ASH supplementation improves NK cell frequency by inhibiting CISH. The goal of this study was to examine if OVCA progresses by inducing CISH-expression in NK cells and if dietary ASH supplementation reduces NK cell exhaustion by decreasing CISH expression.<br \/>Materials and methods: Two studies were conducted. Study 1: Exploratory study with clinical specimens including normal ovaries (n=5) and ovarian high grade serous carcinoma at early and late stages (n=5 each). Study 2: Prospective study using the laying hen model of OVCA supplemented with or without 2% dietary ASH root powder for 90 days (n=7 for each group; normal, early and late stage). Hen normal and tumor ovarian tissues were collected at the end of the study. Both the clinical and hen specimens were used for immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and gene expression assays to determine the frequency of CISH-expressing NK-cells and intensity of GRP78 expression (a marker of cellular stress). Data were collected and analyzed by ANOVA and unpaired t-test and considered significant when <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05.<br \/>Results: CISH-expressing NK cells were localized in normal and tumor ovaries in women and hens. Compared with normal ovaries, frequency of CISH-expressing NK cells was significantly higher in tumors at early and late stages in patients and hens. Similarly, strong expression of CISH gene and protein (29kDa) was detected in tumor tissues. Enhanced expression of CISH positively correlated with expression of GRP78. Compared with untreated, ASH supplementation reduced tumor progression in 5 out of 7 hens and significantly decreased the frequency of CISH-expressing NK cells and GRP78 (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that expression of CISH by NK cells and cellular stress were associated with OVCA progression and dietary ASH supplementation<br \/>reduced NK cell exhaustion by decreasing CISH and GRP78.

Peritoneal lavage often strips protective mesothelial linings and can promote formation of peritoneal adhesions. However, the impact of peritoneal lavage on the omentum, which is also exposed to this procedure, is unclear. The omentum is a fatty tissue that suspends from the stomach and contains highly vascularized immune cell structures called milky spots. Because circulating ovarian and gastric cancer cells have strong predilection for implanting in milky spots, it is important to understand the impact of peritoneal lavage on the omentum, as not all patients with these cancers undergo omentectomy. In this study, we administered clinically relevant amounts of normal saline solution to immunecompetent mice to mimic peritoneal lavage, and evaluated the absorption of saline solution and the gross architecture and immune cell composition of the omentum and other peritoneal fat tissues. As compared to other peritoneal fat tissues, the omentum showed the highest capability to absorb saline solution. Following administration of saline, a dramatic expansion in milky spots and increased vessel density were observed in the omentum. Immunophenotyping and functional studies revealed that these cellular changes were due in part to the expansion of a sub-population of peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, studies using mouse allograft models of ovarian cancer revealed that saline administration stimulated the implantation of circulating cancer cells on to the omentum. Collectively, these findings raise the possibility that peritoneal lavage &#8216;primes&#8217; the omentum to be conducive for colonization by occult cancer cells that circulate in the peritoneal fluid.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6cd326eb-bfce-451a-b3dc-a624314f7d65\/@o03B8ZLq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Angiogenesis,Macrophages,Metastatic potential,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11621"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hironari Akasaka<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Honami Naora<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, predicting which of these mucinous PCL may progress to PDAC and warrant surgery remains a clinical challenge. Moreover, identifying those clinically emergent mucinous PCL for which a surveillance approach is best is a dire clinical need. Therefore, we aimed to identify molecular signatures that distinguished between PDAC with and without clinical evidence of a PCL to identify novel biomarkers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We leveraged data from the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network <i>(<\/i>ORIEN) multi-institute sequencing project and analyzed 66 PDAC cases recruited to ORIEN from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Moffitt Cancer Center for which tumor whole transcriptome sequencing datasets were generated. We separated the cases based on whether a tumor had originated from a cystic lesion (n=16) or presumably through the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) pathway (n=50). We then performed differential expression and pathway analysis using both Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Pathway Analysis with Down-weighted Genes (PADOG) algorithms. Based on the emerging importance of the immune landscape in PDAC development, we also analyzed immune profiles using a novel tool, Tumor-immune Microenvironment Deconvolution Web-portal for Bulk Transcriptomics (TIMEx).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> When grouped by tumor origin, cyst-derived PDAC gene expression sets are enriched in immune signaling pathways, specifically NOTCH signaling (p=0.04), and demonstrate significant downregulation in amino acid metabolism, mitochondrial import and G<sub>s<\/sub><sub>&#945;<\/sub> signaling pathways. Furthermore, GSEA based on TIMEx signatures indicated that multiple immune cell-specific profiles had significant enrichment scores in either the cyst-derived (for example, plasma cell: normalized enrichment score=-1.53; p=0.007) or non-cyst-derived (for example, neutrophil: normalized enrichment score=2.24; p=0.0001) PDAC cohorts.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data suggest that cyst-derived and non-cyst-derived PDACs differ by immune profile, enhanced NOTCH pathway usage and in the metabolic processing of multiple amino acids.

However, 20-30% of patients do not respond to RT. Neutrophils have previously been linked to radioresistance, but the specific mechanism is still unknown. Previous work by our team has shown that neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation plays a role in RT resistance in an immunologically hot tumor, with high T cell infiltration, using the MB49 murine bladder cancer cell line, in a vivo model. In MIBC, a recently developed cell line can be used to study cold, luminal-like tumors. However, work on this cell line and its response to RT is still in its initial stages. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1 have been tested by our team in these cold tumors of MIBC and have not shown to be effective in treating or radiosensitizing the tumor. Consequently, we aim to determine how neutrophil migration and neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) impact tumor growth in a cold, luminal-like tumor model. Furthermore, we aim to understand how neutrophil migration and NETs impact immunological changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME).<br \/>Methods: To determine the response to RT in these cold tumors, mice were injected with 5M cells on the right flank of our luminal-like cancer model (UPPL cell line). Once tumors reached 0.1-0.15 cm3, mice were randomized into the different treatment groups: 1) Control; 2) RT; 3) Anti-PDL1 4) DNAse I; 5) RT + Anti-PDL1; 6) RT + DNAse I; 7) Anti-PDL1 + DNAse I; 8) RT + Anti-PDL1 + DNAse I. Size of the tumor was monitored. 8 mice tumors per group were collected at the primary endpoint set at 1.5 cm<sup>3<\/sup> and 5 mice tumors per group were collected after 21 days (midpoint). Tumors were collected analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC).<br \/>Preliminary Results: Prolonged survival was observed in the mice treated with the triple combination when compared to the other groups. Tumor growth in this group also showed delay early on. So far, the frequency of pro-tumorigenic neutrophils infiltration in tumors seems to happen early on (midpoints) in mice treated with RT, whereas the infiltration happens later (endpoint) in the mice treated with the triple combination. Currently, we are also evaluating the NET production in these tumors through IHC.<br \/>Conclusion: This ongoing experiment using RT on the UPPL cell line will allow us to understand what happens in patients who are resistant to RT. Understanding the role of neutrophils and NETs, along with the changes in the TME caused by the manipulation of these is key to understanding radiation resistance. This knowledge will bring us one step closer to developing new bladder-sparring treatments and improving patient care in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf74a5b2-bc59-4d98-8316-443b7944afd1\/@o03B8ZLq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Radiation therapy,Bladder cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11624"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"5b221bf3-5e71-43fa-bc23-7c1b82897b76","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5b221bf3-5e71-43fa-bc23-7c1b82897b76\/@o03B8ZLq\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sabina Fehric<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Michaud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Surashri Shinde-Jadhav<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JiaMin Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose J.

There are well-recognized health disparities in TNBC outcomes, and the risk of TNBC is higher among African-Americans (AA). It is unclear whether immunological features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with disease stage, socioeconomic factors, or comorbidities such as obesity may affect tumor immunity. The incidence of TNBC and obesity in Louisiana is among the highest in the nation, and we have documented disparities in incidence linked to race and disparities in mortality linked to social determinants of health. Recent studies described immunologic characteristics of the TNBC TME. However, the possible association of immunogenomic portraits of TNBCs with race, comorbidities or socioeconomic factors remains understudied.<br \/>Methods: We studied the expression of immunity-associated genes in clinically annotated TNBCs from Louisiana AA and European-American (EA) patients with or without obesity. Primary invasive breast cancer cases with confirmed TNBC diagnosis were identified by the Louisiana Tumor Registry (LTR). Sections of FFPE tissue containing &#8805; 50% tumor were identified and processed for RNA-Sequencing [(n = 256; White women:125 (Lean: 50 and Obese:75) and Black women:131 (Lean:28 and Obese: 103)] at Translational Genomic Core, LSUHSC. Categorical outcomes were compared via Chi-squared tests, and survival was compared via log-rank tests. Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine associations between CIBERSORT cell populations and stage of disease at diagnosis.<br \/>Results: We found that race was associated with the stage of TNBC, and AA patients were more often diagnosed with a later stage of TNBC (p=0.0447). However, race was not associated with survival (p=0.4673). Obesity was not associated with stage at diagnosis (p=0.7256). Stage at diagnosis was the strongest determinant of survival (p&#60;0.0001). We utilized CIBERSORT analysis to identify and quantify immune cell populations within the TME. Later stage at diagnosis was associated with increased T follicular helper cells (p=0.0038), M1 macrophages (p= 0.0032), and activated mast cells (p=0.0487). Conversely, later stage of disease was associated with decreased resting mast cells (p=0.0004) and monocytes (p=0.0455). Immunosuppressive Treg cells were positively associated with stage at diagnosis in AA patients (p=0.0273) but not in EA patients (p=0.9141).<br \/>Conclusions: Stage at diagnosis was the strongest determinant of survival and was associated with significant differences in TME immune cell populations. Stage, race and obesity were associated with the presence of immunosuppressive Treg cells. If confirmed, these findings may help understand the variability in immunotherapy responses in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Gene expression profiling,Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11625"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fokhrul Hossain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Danos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jovanny Zabaleta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiande Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Anne Lynch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Del Valle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao-Cheng Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Augusto Ochoa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chindo Hicks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucio Miele<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, we evaluate cell densities of NSCLC tissue specimens with known KK-LC-1 gene expression to better characterize the tumor immune microenvironment in such patients.<br \/>Methods: A seven-plex mIF panel (FoxP3, PDL1, PanCK, PD1, CD8, KK-LC-1, and CD68) was developed based on a previously established mIF Lung-cancer panel and addition of KK-LC-1 following rigorous optimization of KK-LC-1 antibody titer and panel order with qualitative assessment of monoplex immunofluorescent assays. Serial sections from 23 NSCLC cases (14 biopsy samples and 9 excision specimens) with known KK-LC-1 gene expression values were collected. Tissue sections were stained and imaged on an Akoya Biosciences Vectra Polaris multispectral imaging platform. The regions of interest were identified and stamped with the Phenochart mIF image management software. Spectral unmixing, tissue segmentation and cell phenotyping were performed with Akoya Biosciences InForm image analysis software using the multispectral fields workflow. The 4-tier positive staining thresholds for PD-L1 and KK-LC-1 were determined by a pathologist (WDW). Cell densities in the tumor and adjacent stroma as well as the KK-LC-1 H-score were assessed by linear regression analysis. Student&#8217;s t-test was used to compare between the top quartile of tumors based on KK-LC-1 gene expression (Q4) and the remaining 3 quartiles (Q1-Q3).<br \/>Results: The study consisted of 17\/23 adenocarcinoma (73.9%), 4\/23 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (17.3%), and 2\/23 (8.6%) unclear or mixed histology tumors. Adenocarcinoma trended to have higher KK-LC-1 gene expression compared to SCC tumors (mean 17.34 vs. 0.65, p-value = 0.204). 13\/23 (56.5%) were pan-wild type, 6\/23 (26.0%) were EGFR mutated, 2\/23 (8.7%) were KRAS mutated, and 1\/23 (4.4%) were MET Exon 14 skip and multiple alterations. We saw significantly higher cell density of FoxP3 in tumor cells in Q4 versus Q1-Q3 (mean 7.17 vs. 0.8 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p-value = 0.004), and there was a trend towards a higher FoxP3\/CD8 cell density ratio (mean 3.28 vs. 0.05, p = .110) and higher PD-1 cell density (mean 186.7 vs. 32.8 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p=0.1548) in tumor cells in Q4 versus Q1-Q3. There was significant correlation towards increased CD8+ T cell density ratio between tumor and stroma cells in cases with higher KK-LC-1 gene expression (r<sup>2<\/sup>= 0.307, p = 0.011).<br \/>Conclusion: KK-LC-1 expression in lung cancer is seen in multiple molecular subsets and is associated with increase in both regulatory T cells in tumor and in CD8+ T-cells in tumor relative to stroma. Strategies to deplete regulatory T cells and to further amplify CD8+ T cells should be pursued in the development of T-cell receptor therapy targeting KK-LC-1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/957e586c-8386-4b4b-8e22-ab5a8a92fafa\/@p03B8ZLr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Tumor microenvironment,Adoptive cell therapy,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11626"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ainaz Dory Barkhordarzadeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Robert C.

These ascites, acting as a complex mixture of soluble factors and cell components, are known to be rich in macrophages which were suggested to skew to a M2-like phenotype involved in resistance and metastases. However, while macrophages can adopt different phenotypes, it's now postulated that tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) from ovarian cancer patient ascites may even acquire mixed M1\/M2 properties, providing a particular pro-inflammatory and tumor-promoting microenvironment. Characterization of cell composition along with the growth factors present in the microenvironment is thus crucial to understand ovarian cancer biology and more particularly the immunosuppressive pathways that would underlie the altered immune cell activity.<br \/>Methods &#38; Results: Through flow cytometry-based marker expression analysis and quantitation of soluble mediators in ovarian cancer ascites, we investigated here the cell component nature as well as the presence of several growth factors. While these ascites were interestingly enriched in major \"immunosuppressive\" cell subsets including T and myeloid populations, TAM were intriguingly shown to display a mixed phenotype characterized by high expression of CD163, unrelated to M1\/M2 categorization since also expressing Arg1, CD80, and iNOS markers. The immunosuppressive phenotype was also linked to IL6, LIF and IL10 among other factors present in the ascitic environment. In order to assess their role in the occurrence of such an immunosuppressive cell status, soluble mediators were then investigated on healthy monocytes undergoing M1 polarization. We demonstrated that, while LIF did not directly affect IL6 and IL10 levels released by the cells, interestingly IL6 alone or in co-presence with LIF decreased IL6 supernatant content, with respect to the control. These changes were concomitant with a decrease and increase in the expression of CD80 and CD163, respectively. Furthermore, CD14 and CD206 were found to increase in the presence of IL6+\/-LIF.<br \/>Conclusion: All these data highlight a switching activity of IL6 skewing cells from M1 polarization and resulting in a proper macrophage phenotype exhibiting a mixed M1\/M2 status and would suggest these ascite-containing factors as keys conferring an immunosuppressive cell phenotype. Altogether, these translational findings highlight ovarian patient-derived ascites as a valuable tool to understand the mechanisms of suppression and to allow for the identification of novel markers to develop innovative targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/794bc833-4ff9-4942-aac7-7e713655ea7f\/@p03B8ZLr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Ascites fluid,Macrophages,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11627"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Imane Nafia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Assia Chaibi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Rey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Philippe Guegan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alban Bessede<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Coriolan Lebreton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Italiano<\/i><\/presenter>.

PDLIM2 function is associated with tumour suppression and also with the acquisition of a metastatic or epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. We recently showed that PDLIM2 is more highly expressed in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) tumours than in other breast cancer types or normal breast tissue, and that this is associated with active beta catenin in TNBC (1). Interestingly, in PDLIM2-positive TNBC tumours, PDLIM2 was also present in the tumour-associated stroma. However, whether stromal PDLIM2 expression contributes to TNBC cancer progression is unknown.<br \/>To investigate this further we assessed the phenotype of PDLIM2-expressing stromal cells and determined that they most strongly represented a M2-like macrophage population. We then investigated the requirement for PDLIM2 in polarization towards either the M1 and M2-like macrophage phenotype using cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages from PDLIM2 knockout mice compared with wild type. This demonstrated that PDLIM2 is required for full adoption of IL-4-induced M2 macrophage polarization and function, including cell adhesion and migration. M1 polarization was less dependent on PDLIM2, although potential for activation of STATs and NFKB was similar in both macrophage populations.We conclude that high expression of PDLIM2 in TNBC influences the tumour microenvironment through the presence of an M2 macrophage population.<br \/>Reference: (1) Cox, O.

In the present study, we identified groups of FL patients with discretely unique TMEs and determined whether the T-cell phenotypes in the TME differed among groups. Using a cohort of 82 FL patients with biopsy specimens collected before treatment, we defined the type of TME based on the content of major lineages (T, B, monocytes\/macrophages and NK cells) determined by CyTOF analysis. Hierarchical clustering of this cohort stratified patients into 4 groups with different TME: group 1 (G1) included patients with a high percentage of monocyte\/macrophages\/NK cells; patients from G2 and G3 were enriched for intratumoral T and B cells, respectively. Patients with intermediate numbers of T and B cells were included in G4. CITRUS analysis revealed that T-cell clusters with phenotypes expressing KLRG1, CD57, PD-1<sup>dim <\/sup>and rich in T<sub>EMRA<\/sub> cells were significantly more abundant in G1 when compared to G2, G3 or G4. In contrast, T-cell clusters with phenotypes containing CD127, CD45RA, CCR7 or PD-1<sup>high<\/sup> cells were significantly less abundant in G1 when compared to other groups. When compared to G3 or G4, 2 classes of T cell clusters, all from CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, were significantly more (CD127<sup>+<\/sup>KLRG1<sup>-<\/sup>) or less (CD57<sup>+<\/sup>PD-1<sup>high<\/sup>) abundant in G2, respectively. Clusters with a phenotype rich in short-lived effector cells (SLEC) (from CD8<sup>+<\/sup>) were upregulated in G3 when compared to G4. These results suggest that patient groups with distinct TME exhibited variable T-cell phenotypes. To determine the role of T-cell differentiation in predicting patient outcome in FL, we identified T-cell subsets using tSNE plots based on the expression of T-cell maturation markers. We identified 18 subsets (S1-S18) of T cells (11 from CD4, 6 from CD8 and 1 from CD4<sup>-<\/sup>CD8<sup>-<\/sup>) in each sample. Four subsets - S4 (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>N<\/sub>), S5 (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>CM<\/sub>), S7 (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>N<\/sub>) and S10 (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>MEPCs) - were considered to be na&#239;ve cells or cells in the early stages of differentiation. Four additional subsets - S8 (CD57<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>FH<\/sub>), S9 (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>EXH<\/sub>), S13 (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>SLECs) and S17 (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>reg<\/sub>) - were memory cells with expression of surface markers indicting late-stage differentiation. We found that the 4 subsets (S4: p=0.08, S5: p=0.01, S7: p=0.04 and S10: p&#60;0.01) with an early-stage phenotype were associated with a favorable clinical outcome. In contrast, subsets (S8: p=0.02, S9: p=0.04, S13: p=0.07 and S17: p=0.06) with a late-stage differentiation phenotype had an unfavorable survival. Supporting this finding, we observed that increased numbers of CD45RA<sup>+<\/sup> T cells correlated with a favorable survival. These results indicate that the differentiation stage may determine the role of T cells in predicting patient outcome in FL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68b6cd2b-58fa-419c-b672-349723cefe71\/@p03B8ZLr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Tumor microenvironment,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11641"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhi-Zhang Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyo Jin Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongyan Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyi Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Krull<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrizia Mondello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Villasboas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Novak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Ansell<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, immunotherapies that elicit anti-tumor responses are of great interest for the treatment of various cancers. Macrophages are a current immune cell type of interest due to the ability to polarize into anti-tumor (M1) and pro-tumor (M2) phenotypes. The density and phenotype of macrophages within the tumor and TME have been linked to prognosis in multiple types of solid tumors. Our hypothesis is that colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with high immune infiltration and greater amounts of anti-tumor immune cells within the tumor compartment will have an increased time of survival compared to cancers with immune excluded or desert environments.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> One CRC tumor microarray (TMA) containing primary tumors, metastases, and normal tissue were stained via multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) for 6 different immune markers: CD3, CD8, CD56, CD68, CD163, and PD-L1. The stained TMAs were analyzed utilizing Flagship Biosciences&#8217; proprietary image analysis platform. Machine learning algorithms used cellular features to stratify cells as belonging to either the tumoral or stromal compartment. Core level expression data was pulled and represented on a whole-cohort basis. All staining and image analysis outputs were reviewed by a board-certified, MD pathologist. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated using survival data in relation to the low, medium, and high expression of CD68, CD163, and\/or PDL1 in the whole tissue, as well as tumor and stromal compartments. Patients were also stratified into low (1 and 2) and high (3 and 4) cancer stages.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> There is a correlation between patient survival and the presence or absence of macrophage markers CD68 and CD163 and lack of immune-suppressive marker PDL1. Specifically, lower levels of CD68+CD163- cells within the tumor compartment correlate with an increase in patient survival. Similarly, lower PDL1 expression in the stromal compartment positively correlate with prolonged patient survival in CRC patients.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Data generated through Flagship Biosciences&#8217; image analysis platform showed a strong relationship between CD68 and CD163 presence and localization with CRC patient survival. Altering the immune cells within the tumor to an anti-tumor immune environment could increase patient survival times in high stage CRC patient populations. Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with current FDA approved therapies for CRC are of interest to further extend patient survival, as PDL1 expression negatively correlate with CRC patient survival. Further, utilizing Flagship Biosciences&#8217; image analysis software to understand cancer immune microenvironments should be further utilized to aid in diagnosis and treatment decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f3ab980-718c-47cb-b82a-1e4e9eafdc1a\/@p03B8ZLr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,PD-L1,Colorectal cancer,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11642"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dannah Miller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kate Hieber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Will Paces<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huong Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Beharry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Gianani<\/i><\/presenter>.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for new therapies and better preventive strategies. Aging and obesity are two of the biggest risk factors for HCC, and with ever-increasing aging and obese populations, uncovering how aging and obesity drive the increased risk for HCC has become imperative. Aging and obesity are well known to be characterized by immune dysregulation leading to persistent inflammation, and a dysregulated immune microenvironment is also a common theme shared by multiple hallmarks of HCC. In this study, we aim to assess the immune microenvironment of aged and obese mouse livers by performing spatial phenotyping of distinct immune signatures which can potentially predispose hepatocytes to HCC. To address this, we used Akoya&#8217;s ultra-high multiplexed CODEX (CO-Detection by indEXing) imaging system to interrogate 31 different biomarkers in liver samples at the single cell level. Specifically, we compared the liver immune microenvironment of mice within 2 different treatment groups (old mice on a high fat diet (HFD) and young mice on a normal diet (ND)) to the immune landscape of liver tumor tissue. Our goal is to identify distinct immune phenotypes present in both, liver tumor tissues and livers of HFD mice, compared to ND livers - to better understand how immune dysregulation can predispose an aged and obese liver to HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c29893d5-1821-4997-ae12-f1f090e5c0db\/@p03B8ZLr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Liver cancer,Immune response,Multiplexed Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11643"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adarsh Rajesh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Havas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siva Karthik Varanasi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katrina Evans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bassem B.
