Increasing evidence shows that cancer cells can disseminate from early-evolved primary lesions much earlier than the classical metastasis models predicted. The current paradigm supports that the tissue microenvironment where disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) lodge is a critical determinant of the timing of metastasis. However, how tissue-resident myeloid cells control this process is largely unclear. The lung tissue contains a resident population of alveolar macrophages (AMs), whose function in metastatic dormancy and growth is largely unexplored. Here, we used various transgenic mouse models, human sample analysis and single cell RNA-sequencing to reveal DCC heterogeneity and plasticity in the lung across disease evolution. We found a previously unrecognized role of mesenchymal- and pluripotency-like (M-like) programs driven by the transcription factor ZFP281 in coordinating early cancer cell spread and a long-lived dormancy program in early DCCs. The gene profiles revealed molecules that would allow early DCCs to crosstalk with AMs. Using a 3D Matrigel assay, we found that AMs are responsible for inducing an M-like phenotype in cancer cells (of both early and late evolved cancer cells) and exclusively suppressed growth of early lesion (EL) HER2+ cancer cells. The conditioned media (CM) from AMs was also found to induce an M-like phenotype and growth arrest of EL cells. RNA-sequencing profiling of pure EL cells and AMs that had been co-cultured revealed a reciprocal influence of the two cell types: increased ECM organization and induction of invasiveness in EL cells, as well as changes in inflammatory response and immune programs in AMs. Prediction of ligand-receptor interactions using the NATMI tool allowed for identification of signaling axis that would allow AMs to induce an M-like and growth program in EL cells. To test whether indeed AMs are inducing an M-like and growth arrest phenotype in early DCCs in lungs, we depleted AMs in mice bearing early MMTV-HER2 or late evolved E0771 breast cancer cells in lungs via intranasal instillation of clodronate liposomes or via the use of a AM=specific CD169-DTR targeting system. Following AM depletion, dormant DCCs began to proliferate and formed clusters and overt metastases. Our results support that tissue resident macrophages play a key role in limiting metastatic expansion of breast cancer cells <i>via<\/i> the induction of a DCC mesenchymal-like dormancy program.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Metastasis,Macrophages,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julio A.

The uncertainty of whether and when metastases will occur poses a major challenge to treatment effectiveness. In many cancer patients, persistent disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) enter a state of dormancy upon arrival at the distant tissue, only to awaken years or even decades afterwards and initiate deadly metastases. How are DTCs kept dormant, what prompts them to awaken, and how can dormant DTCs be targeted are pressing questions in cancer research. Because cancer dormancy provides a unique therapeutic window for preventing metastatic disease, a comprehensive understanding of the distribution, composition and dynamics of reservoirs of dormant DTCs is imperative. Recently, we developed a tool to follow dormant DTCs, and surveyed the anatomical distribution of dormant reservoirs in models of breast cancer metastasis. We discovered that DTCs laid preferentially dormant in the liver, and spatially distinct liver sub-microenvironments allow coexistence of dormant DTCs and rare growing metastases even within the same tissue. To explore whether the distinct fates of DTCs stemmed from intra-organ microenvironmental differences, we performed global transcriptomic profiling on hepatic milieus corresponding to dormancy and metastasis. We found that stromal cells clustered on the basis of disease stage, and genes that were upregulated in dormancy samples were associated with host defense processes and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated response. A thorough examination of viable populations of immune cells in each hepatic milieu revealed that NK cells were the only type of immune cell that increased in dormancy milieus. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vivo further indicated that the pool of NK cells encountered by DTCs is decisive on their awakening. Remarkably, adjuvant interleukin-15-based immunotherapy ensured an abundant pool of NK cells that sustained dormancy, thereby preventing hepatic metastases and prolonging survival. In addition, we demonstrated in vivo and in liver-like co-cultures that NK cells control dormant DTCs through IFN-&#947;-induced quiescence. Thus, we uncovered an alternative cytostatic IFN&#947;-mediated mechanism of NK cell immunity that is essential to the control of breast cancer dormancy. This finding reroutes the importance of IFN&#947; to much earlier stages of disease, and encourages its therapeutic use for establishing the non-permissive cytokine milieu that is necessary to limit the emergence of DTCs from dormancy. Another key finding of our work is that liver injury limits NK cell expansion, thus triggering the switch from dormancy to liver metastasis. Using a model of chemically-induced liver injury, we found that activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs, which activate from quiescent HSCs to proliferative myofibroblasts) orchestrate a stromal response that hampers NK cell-mediated immunity and precipitates metastasis. Mechanistically, we show that aHSCs secrete the chemokine CXCL12, inducing NK cell quiescence via its cognate receptor CXCR4. This NK cell-inhibitory function of CXCL12 adds to its canonical effect as an inducer of DTC proliferation, and contributes to metastatic outgrowth. Our findings revive clinical interest on the use of CXCR4 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with cancer, but suggest that they should be repurposed to earlier stages to prevent progression of dormant disease. Because the size of the NK cell pool can itself determine metastatic outgrowth, a decrease of NK cells in patients with cancer who are apparently disease-free might identify individuals who are at risk of recurrence and who would benefit from CXCR4 inhibition therapy - a question that we will address in a clinical trial that we are currently setting up at the University Hospital Basel. All this work, which I am the first and corresponding author of, was recently published in <b><i>Nature<\/i><\/b> (Correia et al. Nature, 2021). In summary, our study shows that DTC dormancy is achieved by preserving normal tissue physiology&#8212;particularly tissue innate immunity&#8212;and that disruptions of the latter present DTCs with an opportunity for reactivation. In patients, this is reflected in the invariable decline in host defense capabilities that occurs during ageing, but also in the increased risk that recurrent infections and lifestyle-related injury triggers (such as alcohol, obesity and smoking) bring to the sprouting of site-specific metastases. We envision adjuvant NK cell immunotherapy as a means to preserve tissue physiology and prevent metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Metastasis,Natural killer cells,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ana Luisa Correia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Metachronous brain metastases or relapse are observed in approximately fifty percent of HER2+ breast cancer patients considered disease free after a variable length of time post primary diagnosis and treatment. Disseminated latent residual cells that survive current therapies are responsible for these relapses or metachronous metastasis. How disseminated tumor cells survive as latent\/dormant entities for extended period before initiating metachronous metastasis is poorly understood. Moreover, the basis for disparate metastatic fitness among disseminated tumor cells of similar oncotype within a distal organ is unknown and vital for better clinical management. Through a phenotypic screen in mice, we have isolated HER2+ latent (Lat) and brain metastatic (BM) cells.Transcriptomic and metabolic profiles of these brain-tropic breast cancer cells identified actionable dependencies and unique therapeutic opportunities. Brain-tropic Lat and metastatic cells have distinct metabolic profiles that determine their metastatic fitness. Both latent and metastatic cells survive in equilibrium with innate immune surveillance, oxidize glutamine and maintain cellular redox homeostasis through the anionic amino acid transporter xCT. Likewise, xCT expression was significantly higher in matched metachronous brain metastatic samples compared to primary tumors from HER2+ breast cancer patients. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of xCT eradicates residual disease and brain metastatic relapse in these preclinical models. Lactate secreted by aggressive metastatic cells limits innate immune surveillance and triggers overt metastasis. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis identified augmented AXL expression. Depleting or inhibiting AXL in these HER2 targeted therapy resistant brain-tropic cells attenuates metastatic incidence. In sum, by investigating phenotypically distinct brain-tropic latent and metastatic cells, we uncovered the impact of metabolic diversity and adaptations on metastatic fitness and identified targetable vulnerabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Disseminated tumor cells,Brain metastasis,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Srinivas Malladi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
