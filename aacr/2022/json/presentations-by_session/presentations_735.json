Increasing participation in clinical research and patient registries, related to precision cancer medicine, will significantly improve cancer health equity. Many AA cancer patients are treated in community oncology clinics. Unfortunately, these health systems have limited access to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) next generation sequence (NGS) germline and somatic DNA and RNA testing that are used to inform oncologists on the best treatment and\/or clinical trial options for cancer patients. Indeed, AA CLIA NGS sample sets are poorly represented, which could presumably result in incomplete knowledge of genomic variants that could affect their treatment and overall outcomes. Hence, it is crucial to implement CLIA NGS efforts for all cancer patients. To address these disparities, Morehouse School of Medicine has formed the Comprehensive Approach to Reimagine health Equity Solutions (CARhES) consortium with Tuskegee University that has engaged community oncology practices in Alabama and Georgia - two of five Black Belt states. The CARhES consortium aims to implement precision cancer medicine to underserved and underrepresented communities that will improve the standard of cancer care by providing access to CLIA NGS testing, clinical trials, and personalized cancer care. Here we describe the first proof of concept of this approach with community oncology partners, i.e., Grady Health System, Wellstar Health System, Georgia Urology, Midtown Urology, and Maui Memorial Medical Center. At the time of consent, saliva, buccal, and tumor samples were collected from participants. Germline and somatic CLIA NGS was performed, and medical reports were returned to practitioners within 14 days. Prior to the COVID pandemic, the study enrolled over 880 patients with a 88% consent rate (n = 1000) in the first 11months of the program. At the start of the COVID pandemic, recruitment efforts were suspended for four months with a slow restart by June 2020. A decrease in the number of staff, office visits (67% reduction), and increase in COVID cases significantly limited recruitment efforts. During this slowdown, we established and improved eConsenting capabilities, which exist today. Community anxiety, due to the pandemic and SARS-CoV-19 vaccine efforts, resulted in a significant reduction in consent rates (88% to 60%). Nevertheless, this study began in April of 2019 and consented 1,750 participants in less than 2 years. Taken together, our study shows that a community-focused precision medicine approach requires meeting people where they are and providing them with access and understanding the benefit of clinical trial participation. The approximate 2,000 clinically annotated genomic AA datasets will greatly contribute to our understanding of cancer health disparities and among the first steps to democratize precision medicine.<br \/>This study was funded by the American Association for Cancer Research, The Pelotonia Foundation, the M2Gen Foundation, and the National Cancer Institute (U54CA118638).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-03 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":"TEST Webcast Link"}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Latrisha L.

Here, we generated an anti-Nectin-4 ADC that shows superior activity to enfortumab-vedotin (Padcev&#174;, EV) in head-to-head <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies. Based on enfortumab as the targeting antibody and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) as payload, we generated within 24 hours highly homogeneous and pure ADCs with a drug-to antibody-ratio (DAR) of approximately 2 and above 98% monomeric content. In<i> i<\/i><i>n vitro<\/i> assays on target positive cell-lines, the Araris ADC demonstrated potent cell-cytotoxicity in the low nM-range similar to the approved enfortumab-vedotin which has a DAR of 4. Moreover, our ADC showed excellent stability in mouse, cynomolgus and human sera exemplified by the absence of payload deconjugation or linker cleavage while EV showed significant payload deconjugation during the 14d incubation period. Interestingly, despite the improved stability, the kinetics for MMAE release was comparable to EV in human Cathepsin B or human liver-lysosome (HLL) enzyme cleavage assays. Most importantly, the ADC was extremely stable in circulation as shown in pharmacokinetic studies in rodents, demonstrating an exposure profile comparable to the unmodified enfortumab parent antibody. There was no loss of payload during the 3 week study duration and the calculated half-life of the Araris ADC was approximately 10 days, which is more than 2-fold the half-life of EV. In efficacy studies using a SUM-190PT breast cancer model, a single injection at a dose of 10&#181;g\/kg normalized payload induced a complete tumor regression that lasted throughout the whole study duration of more than 100 days. EV administered at the same payload dose showed only a short and transient tumor regression with no animal (0\/6) reaching a complete response with some tumor growth retardation until day 20. Our data impressively show that the Araris ADC has superior efficacy even at least 3x lower payload dose compared to EV which are normally needed to achieve complete tumor remission. The very high efficacy even at low dose levels combined with the high plasma stability offer the opportunity to develop an ADC having potentially lower dose-limiting toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy, skin toxicity or neutropenia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Nectin-4,Solid tumors,Microbial Transglutaminase (MTG),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isabella Attinger-Toller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Probst<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Romain Bertrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramona Stark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roger Santimaria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dragan Grabulovski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernd Schlereth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Spycher<\/i><\/presenter>.

This study aimed to pinpoint tumor suppressive miRNAs with therapeutic potential against GBM, one of the most deadly cancers. Whole transcriptome and miRNA expression profiling analyses were performed on human GBM patient tissues. Transient transfection of miRNA mimics was used to investigate the tumor suppressive role of a miRNA (miR-138) in cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration, would healing, and chemosensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ). Orthotopic xenograft mice model using human patient-derived primary GBM cells was used for the survival studies. miR-138 was found as one of the most significantly downregulated miRNAs with an inverse correlation with CD44 expression. Functional studies unveiled that miR-138 negatively regulates the expression of CD44 at protein level by directly binding to the 3&#8217; UTR of CD44. CD44 inhibition by miR-138 overexpression resulted in an inhibition of glioblastoma cell proliferation in vitro through cell cycle arrest as evidenced by a significant induction of p27 and its translocation into nucleus. Ectopic expression of miR-138 also increased survival rates in mice that had an intracranial xenograft tumor derived from human patient-derived primary GBM cells. In addition, miR-138 sensitized GBM tumor to TMZ in mice. We demonstrated a therapeutic potential of tumor suppressive miR-138 through direct downregulation of CD44 and sensitization to chemotherapy for the treatment of primary and even chemoresistant GBM","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,MicroRNA,Temozolomide,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tae Jin Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Young Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deokhwa Nam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Seon Shim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Bueso-Perez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Balveen Kaur<\/i><\/presenter>.

This poor prognosis is likely multifactorial, including increased clonal heterogeneity, drug resistance mechanisms, and alterations of the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Methods: The primary data source was multi-platform data coming from the AURORA US Project that includes RNAseq, DNAseq, and DNA methylation arrays, which assayed 55 MBC patients representing 51 primary cancers and 102 linked metastatic specimens. In addition, RNA sequencing data from two other datasets of primary tumor-metastasis pairs were also used (i.e. UNC Tumor Donation Program\/RAP dataset (24 primary and 74 metastasis specimens), and the GEICAM\/2009-03 ConvertHER trial dataset (102 primaries and 102 metastatic pairs)). In total, this combined RNAseq dataset contained 177 primary tumors and 278 metastases, including 28 liver, 18 lung, 12 brain, and 24 lymph node metastases. We used these data to address two pressing questions, namely: 1) do gene expression features vary in primary tumors vs metastases according to PAM50 expression subtype, and 2) do gene expression features vary according to site of metastasis.<br \/>Results: Using the AURORA multi-platform data, we determined that 17% of metastatic tumors (mainly TNBC\/Basal-like) showed reduced expression of HLA-A that was associated with DNA methylation and\/or focal DNA deletions near the HLA-A locus; these methylated tumors also showed concomitant lower immune cell infiltrates. Reduced expression of HLA-A gene and immune cell infiltrates were also validated at the RNA level in RAP dataset. Next, RNA expression differences were examined using the combined data set and varied according to tumor<br \/>subtype. ER+\/Luminal metastases had lower fibroblast and endothelial cell content, while triple negative (TNBC)\/Basal-like metastases showed a dramatic decrease in T cell and B cell signatures\/features. Comparative analyses between primary and site-specific metastasis (i.e., primary vs liver metastasis) or between sites of metastases (i.e., liver vs lung metastasis) revealed that both liver and brain, on average, had low immune cell features regardless of the primary tumor phenotype. Even within the same patient, we detected low immune cell features in brain and liver metastases compared to lung and lymph node metastases. Lastly, liver metastases showed a gain of Luminal B\/HER2E gene expression features and MYC targets, and brain TNBC metastasis showed a gain of cell differentiation\/Luminal-related gene signatures.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings could have direct implications for the treatment of MBC patients with immune-based therapies and suggest new therapeutic avenues depending upon the tumor metastasis phenotype, and site of metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,Gene expression,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susana Garcia Recio<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshinori Hinoue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory L.

Hypertranscription is the genome-wide increase in RNA output. Hypertranscription&#8217;s prevalence, underlying drivers and prognostic significance are undefined in primary human cancer. This is due in part to limitations of expression profiling methods, which assume equal RNA output between samples. Here, we developed a computational method to directly measure hypertranscription in 7,494 human tumors, spanning 31 cancer types. Hypertranscription is ubiquitous across cancer, especially in aggressive disease. It defines patient subgroups with worse survival, even within well-established subtypes. Our data suggest that loss of transcriptional suppression underpins the hypertranscriptional phenotype. Single-cell analysis reveals hypertranscriptional clones, which dominate transcript production regardless of their size. Finally, patients with hypertranscribed mutations have improved response to immune checkpoint therapy.

One such change occurs with MUC1, or Mucin-1, a large variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)-containing transmembrane protein that is overexpressed and hypoglycosylated on a majority of precancerous and adenocarcinoma cells, including those of the colon, lung, breast, pancreas and ovaries. This tumor form of MUC1 is recognized by both cellular and humoral immunity. Healthy individuals at high risk of developing colon cancer due to a history of colonic polyps were enrolled in a clinical trial testing the feasibility of prophylactic vaccination against the tumor form of MUC1, also expressed on polyps (Kimura et al., 2013). Half the participants generated high levels of anti-MUC1 IgG antibodies, some of which were cloned to further analyze their tumor specificity and to potentially develop them as therapeutics for patients with cancer (Lohmueller et al., 2016). As these fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were selected and affinity matured in healthy individuals who experienced no negative side effects to the vaccine in &#62;10 years, it increases the likelihood that as therapeutics they will be safe. To study anti-tumor efficacy and mechanism(s) of action of 12 of these mAbs, tumor cells were co-incubated with immune cells in the presence of the mAbs, and each mAb&#8217;s ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by NK cells, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by monocytes, antibody-dependent trogocytosis\/trogoptosis (ADCT) by neutrophils, antibody-dependent cytokine release (ADCR) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was assessed. Several MUC1 mAbs examined could mediate ADCC, ADCP, ADCT and ADCR, with some mechanisms being cell-line dependent. One mAb was selected for <i>in vivo<\/i> testing and found to delay breast cancer growth and prolong survival in immunocompromised mice lacking T cells, B cells and NK cells, pointing to ADCP and ADCT as important anti-tumor functions. Additionally, the relationship between epitope location and immune effector functions was explored by creating different MUC1 constructs that vary epitope distance from the cell surface, number of epitopes, etc, to test properties of the target antigen that may affect antibody efficacy. These latter experiments revealed an increased efficiency in phagocytosis and trogocytosis when the mAbs bound an epitope that was both proximal to and anchored to the membrane. Notably, unlike published studies of rituximab and alemtuzumab, the amount of MUC1 mAb binding did not always correlate with increased effector function. Our results may inform not only the development of these MUC1-based therapies but more broadly future therapeutic mAb design against a variety of targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),MUC1,Phagocytosis,Adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michelle L.
