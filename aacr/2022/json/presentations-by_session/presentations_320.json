[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Gastric cancer (GC) is the leading cause of cancer death in Chile, claiming &#62;3,000 lives per year. On April 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the combined use of Nivolumab (immunotherapy) plus chemotherapy as frontline treatment for advanced GC. Unfortunately, as occurs with any therapy, a proportion of treated patients are either unresponsive or display poor responses. Our study sought to obtain a profile of GC patients categorized as responders or non-responders to immunotherapy in order to identify better predictors of response and novel targets for treatment refractory patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A total of 50 GC patients were included into our study. Demographic and basic information was obtained from medical records. Additionally, we retrieved information on response to treatment, histological type, PDL1 and HER2 status. Nucleic acid samples were collected from a subset of 45 patients (responders and non-responders) and analyzed by massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE-seq) assessing 3&#8217; mRNA sequencing.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Patients were predominantly male (76%) and advanced stage (III\/IV; 98%). Within this subset, 26 were responders and 24 were non-responders. Among clinical variables, body mass index was significantly higher on responders versus non-responders (p=0.026). Among responders, tumors were predominantly located on the gastro-esophagic junction. As expected, responders also displayed a higher prevalence of HER2- and PDL1+. Our 3&#8217; MACE analysis confirmed distinct profiles on responders compared to non-responders.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our findings confirm distinctive profiles among Chilean GC patients categorized as responders or non-responders to immunotherapy. These results could deliver novel markers that may serve as predictors of response to immunotherapy (as an alternative to PDL1) or to identify patients more likely to be refractory to treatment. Future studies should further confirm and validate these findings in a larger sample.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0fdf2d06-c549-48cd-9122-7d3a3e0eeed7\/@p03B8ZBU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Immunotherapy,Response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16600"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mauricio P.

Common immunological profiling for immunotherapy response depends on assessment of the composition of immune cell types in tissue samples and the periphery. Still, the function and state of each of these cells further contributes to the ultimate clinical benefit of immunotherapeutic response. Additionally, our ability to comprehensively study treatment strategies depends on elucidating the temporal effects different immunotherapy regimens have on the immune system of patients. Single-cell proteomics profiling with CyTOF mass cytometry enables robust protein-level profiling of cell types and is also high-dimensional enough to characterize functional states of immune cells. To construct an immunological framework that may feasibly serve to empower functional assessment of immune cell states for clinical trial monitoring strategies using CyTOF, we are employing single cell trajectory inference methods and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). We demonstrate this approach using peripheral blood derived CyTOF mass cytometry data to model T cell states at the proteomic level. First, we extract T helper (Th) and T cytotoxic (Tc) cell integrated metrics from CyTOF mass cytometry data obtained from diverse cell marker panel designs, immunological states, and diseases to benchmark that these computational pipelines can accurately reflect Th and Tc activation and exhaustion. Next, we develop a new pipeline that enables the use of continuous functional cell-state metrics from continuous pseudotime and NMF pattern weights as immunological profiling markers from CyTOF that can be applied to cancer immunotherapy clinical trials. For instance, we find CyTOF Tc pseudotime and memory pattern weights are higher in PDAC patients with stable disease treated with ipilimumab and a pancreatic cancer-specific vaccine. Thus, our pipeline has the ability to integrate metrics from mass cytometry data to empower translational analyses for determining patient responses in cancer immunotherapy, such as adaptive immune responses to checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines. Moreover, applying this pipeline to peripheral blood samples obtained before and after treatment also enables us to map further temporal cell state transitions in Tc and Th cells resulting from that treatment. Future work will include leveraging CyTOF T cell integrated metrics in larger scale survival analyses to test the predictive potential in a clinical proof of concept.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5243bb58-7baf-451d-94a8-79ff0b4d35a4\/@p03B8ZBU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Pancreatic cancer,Proteomics,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16601"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dimitrios N.

This is a significant concern especially for frail individuals who are more vulnerable to immunological dysregulations. A robust analysis is needed to understand whether we should expend efforts to limit treatment-related hematological toxicities in HNSCC.<br \/><b>First, <\/b>we would like to understand the prognostic significance for baseline (BL) vs. treatment-related lymphopenia (TRL). We want to know if lymphopenia is merely a reflection of the patient&#8217;s frailty at baseline, or if this is iatrogenic and therefore can be a target for treatment modifications in a bid to improve survival. Here, we identified 222 newly diagnosed M0 HNSCC patients treated with radiation &#177; systemic therapy in 2015-2018 at our institution. Clinical frailty is defined by age &#8805; 65 or KPS &#8804; 70. Using Kaplan Meier estimates and Cox regression with dichotomous variables, we performed multivariate analysis for both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Important predictors included frailty (p &#8804; 0.002) and &#8805; 2K\/mm<sup>3<\/sup> decrease in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) (p &#8804; 0.006). BL did not significantly impact OS or PFS (p &#8804; 0.37). For TRL, ALC decrease had greater prognostic significance compared with ALC nadirs (p &#8804; 0.45).<br \/><b>Next, <\/b>we simplified our survival model to include only frailty and TRL. Overall, fit patients with modest ALC decline (&#60; 2K\/mm<sup>3<\/sup>) achieved excellent survival outcomes while frail patients with severe ALC decline (&#8805; 2K\/mm<sup>3<\/sup>) had inferior outcomes (3-year OS 95% vs. 56%, p &#60; 0.0001; 3-year PFS 84% vs. 42%, p = 0.002). On subgroup analyses, similar outcomes were also identified for HPV+ HNSCC (n = 172, 3-year OS 96% vs. 71%, p = 0.002; 3-year PFS 89% vs. 54% p = 0.03).<br \/><b>Finally, <\/b>we want to know if ALC decline is determined primarily by treatment intensity, or if frail patients are naturally predisposed to greater ALC decline during treatment. In our data, frail patients had more modest ALC decline when compared to fit patients (1.26 &#177; 0.57 vs. 1.54 &#177; 0.58 K\/mm<sup>3 <\/sup>p = 0.0006). In our survival model, we did not observe any first-order interactions between frailty and ALC decline (p = 0.54). The extent of ALC decline was also higher for patients with concurrent administrations of cisplatin (as opposed to radiation alone, p &#60; 0.0001). Thus, we postulate that the extent of ALC decline is determined primarily by treatment intensity. It is possible that frail patients with severe ALC decline have inferior survival outcomes because they cannot maintain immunological balance and respond poorly when there is significant TRL. This opens opportunities to re-evaluate if the risk of TRL is modifiable by limiting the number of concurrent cycles of chemotherapy administered, and by considering radiation dose de-intensification especially for HPV-associated HNSCC. Lastly, TRL becomes an important consideration when immunotherapeutics are grafted onto existing CRT treatment paradigms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d6f98d5f-c0b3-4135-9442-f93ae2eb100b\/@p03B8ZBU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immunosuppression,Survival,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16602"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carmen Kut<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todd McNutt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carole Fakhry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theodore DeWeese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harry Quon<\/i><\/presenter>.

In a previous study, we characterized the antigenic landscape of ovarian carcinoma by mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics and identified novel OvCa-associated tumor antigens, including Mucin-16 (MUC-16) and Mesothelin (MSLN) with the aim to develop novel T cell-based immunotherapies (Schuster <i>et al.<\/i> PNAS 2017). Here, we analyzed the immunopeptidomics data of this OvCa cohort in relation to clinical patient characteristics and disease outcome. Analysis included 43 OvCa patients with respective immunopeptidomics and RNA sequencing data, comprising immunopeptidome diversity, tumor antigen presentation and expression (MUC16, MSLN) as well as HLA mRNA expression.Analyzing HLA class I-restricted tumor antigen presentation in relation to clinical data, we could show that nodal-positive patients presented more frequently HLA-restricted peptides derived from the tumor antigen MUC16 (p = 0.0087) and showed significantly increased numbers of unique MUC16-derived HLA-presented peptides within the total immunopeptidome (p = 0.042) compared to nodal-negative patients. No significant difference in HLA class I immunopeptidome diversity, overall tumor antigen presentation, and expression was observed for histological subtypes, grading, or the prevalence of distant metastases. For HLA class II-restricted tumor antigen presentation and HLA expression in relation to clinical data, we observed a more diverse HLA class II immunopeptidome in terms of different HLA class II-presented peptides (p = 0.011) for patients with high tumor grading (G3) compared to low\/intermediate (G1\/G2) grading. In line, the tumors of these patients also presented an increased number of different MSLN-derived HLA class II-restricted peptides (p = 0.021). No significant difference in HLA class II immunopeptidome diversity, tumor antigen presentation and expression was seen for the prevalence of distant metastasis, histological subtypes, or nodal positivity.Of note, patients presenting MSLN-derived peptides in their immunopeptidome showed a significantly prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS, p = 0.011). In addition, patients exhibiting a high expression of HLA-DR showed a significantly increased RFS (p = 0.018 for HLA-DRA, p = 0.0031 for HLA-DRB).In conclusion, this work provides first insights on the relation of immunopeptidomic characteristics, comprising HLA expression and tumor antigen presentation, with clinical characteristics and disease outcome of OvCa patients. The observed correlation of HLA-DR expression and HLA class II tumor antigen presentation with prolonged RFS indicates a central role of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses for anti-tumor immune surveillance in ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3e80970d-780f-4cb2-89d9-203467a09aae\/@q03B8ZBV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,MUC16,Mesothelin,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16604"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christian M.

LAG-3 is also highly expressed in esophagogastric cancers. The microbiome, a novel and potentially modifiable, biomarker of IO response, has not yet been examined in the neoadjuvant setting in esophageal cancer and is the goal of our study.<br \/>Methods: Fecal samples were collected from patients with stage II\/III esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma eligible for curative resection treated with the standard of care regimen of carboplatin paclitaxel (50mg\/m2), radiation 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions and an Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy 6-10 weeks after last CRT and immunotherapy (IO) dose. Patients on arm A (n=11) received 2 cycles of induction with nivolumab plus 3 additional cycles on week 1, 3 and 5 of CRT. Patients on arm B (n=8) received nivolumab plus relatlimab on the same schedule (Clinical trial: NCT03044613). We examined longitudinal fecal samples from n=19 patients across both arms (n=90 samples) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Patients were classified based on pathological response: complete response (CR) and grades 1, 2, and 3 (G1, G2, G3) with increasing residual tumor visible in the resected specimen. Sequencing data was trimmed and filtered for contaminants, followed by high-resolution taxonomic assignment and normalization of reads across all samples. Analysis was performed using multiple metrics for alpha diversity and beta-diversity, with principal coordinates analysis\/PERMANOVA, and pathway analysis using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt).<br \/>Results: Patients with improved response in the neoadjuvant setting (CR\/G1 vs G2\/G3) grouped in distinct clusters using Bray-Curtis (p &#60; 0.001).

The I+N combination demonstrated superiority in patients with a tumor mutation burden (TMB) &#8805;10 mt\/MB and PD-L1 expression &#60;1% suggesting that a subset of patients may benefit from the addition of I. We leveraged specimens from S1400I to explore the immune signatures associated with outcome across both arms (I+N versus N) and investigate the potential superior benefit from I+N in SCC.<br \/>Methods: RNA extracted from baseline FFPE samples from 66\/252 patients enrolled in the S1400I trial was received from the SWOG bank with 28 samples considered inadequate due to low input RNA. 38 samples were run on the ncounter platform using the PanCancer Immune Profiling panel using the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions with the addition of Human Reference RNA control. Data were processed and normalized using nSolver. All samples passed the post run QC with no batch effect. Using a log-rank test on dichotomized normalized data, we performed time to event analysis to identify genes that correlated with overall survival (OS) and PFS (Progression Free Survival) for all 38 samples and for each arm (23 N and 15 I+N). We ran a Cox model using significant genes identified independently and in association with TMB&#8805;10 and PD-L1 &#8805;5 thresholds identified in the clinical studies. TIMER and nSolver advanced analysis were used to infer immune cells that correlated to clinical outcomes.<br \/>Results: We observed that <i>BLNK,<\/i> <i>CD163, FCGR2A<\/i> associated with increased OS (p&#60;0.01), <i>IRF1 <\/i>and <i>BLNK <\/i>associated with increased PFS (p&#60;0.01). <i>FADD <\/i>and <i>MAPK11 <\/i>associated with poor OS (p&#60;0.01). Cox model analysis confirmed that <i>FADD<\/i> and <i>MAPK11<\/i> were associated with negative clinical outcomes (p&#60;0.05) while <i>CD163<\/i> was associated with positive clinical outcome. Incorporating TMB and PD-L1 into the Cox model validated that MAP kinase activity resulted in a negative clinical outcome while <i>CD163<\/i> correlated with positive clinical outcomes (p&#60;0.05). Focusing on immune signatures within the I+N arm, we observed higher CD45+ immune cell scores including exhausted CD8+ T cells and neutrophils in responders versus non-responders (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Despite a small dataset, this analysis shows a potential advantage in PFS and OS with increased presence of immune cells including exhausted CD8+ T cells and genes associated with myeloid cells. Validation of these findings is warranted and may refine patient populations that would benefit from this combination strategy.<br \/>Acknowledgments: Scientific and financial support: U10CA180888, U10CA180819, U24CA224285, U24CA224316, PACT, PPP and FNIH","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/21c786e4-32e4-4bdf-b78d-40c704a48b53\/@q03B8ZBV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Gene expression profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16606"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dzifa Y.

Here we report on a potential novel immuno-oncology mechanism revealed during the Translational Phase I (NCT04064359) immuno-blood profiling of a chemo-refractory patient treated with OBT076, an experimental CD205-directed ADC.<br \/>A chemo-refractory advanced gastric cancer patient with 60% CD205 expression in the primary tumor via IHC and having previously undergone 2 lines of chemotherapy treatment (Docetaxel\/cisplatin\/5FU and Ramucirumab\/Paclitaxel), received five 21-day cycles of OBT076 (one at 2.5mg\/kg and four cycles at 2.0 mg\/kg) followed by 1 cycle of Pembrolizumab (PZ; 200mg) ~4 weeks later. Clinical response was evaluated and immunological markers (CD45, CD205, CD4, CD8, and PD1) in peripheral blood cells were quantified using flow cytometry.<br \/>After 2 OBT076 cycles at 2.0 mg\/kg, there was an ~40% shrinkage in the primary gastric tumor size and resolution of ascites and lymph node metastases were observed. Following 2 further cycles and PZ, complete response was achieved for the primary tumor. Flow cytometry showed (1) an initial decrease in the absolute numbers of dendritic cells by day 8, followed by a 2-fold increase in numbers by day 21 after treatment; (2) a near total decrease in the population of CD8+ CD205+ cells by day 8, no recovery in levels were observed; (3) a 3-fold increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers between days 8 and 21 and (4) an initial decrease in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> PD1<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell numbers followed by an ~4-fold increase between days 8 and 21.<br \/>In summary our results show that increases in PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells, T-cell induction, and decreases in immuno-suppressive CD4<sup>+<\/sup> CD205<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CD205<sup>+<\/sup> cells occur simultaneously; coinciding with rapid resolution of the primary tumor, lymph node metastases and ascites. These findings suggest that OBT076 activates the patient&#8217;s immune response against the tumor through a potentially novel mechanism: drug-induced depletion of CD8+ CD205+ immuno-suppressive cells and subsequent T-cell activation. Additionally, our data support the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in conjunction with OBT076 to achieve favorable clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f02e9b8-d39c-409b-9cc1-8195f94abbe9\/@q03B8ZBV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Gastric cancer,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16607"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christian Rohlff<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Solmaz Sahebjam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Mita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosen Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chander Sekhar Peddaboina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arnima Bisht<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsey Hudson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wolf Fridman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abderrahim Fandi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Rixe<\/i><\/presenter>.

BT7480 is a <i>Bicycle<\/i> TICA&#174; being developed as a first-in-class CD137 therapeutic for the treatment of human cancers associated with Nectin-4 expression which is currently being investigated in an ongoing phase I\/II clinical trial. Monitoring target engagement for a given therapeutic can be a key factor in recommending the phase II dose. While flow cytometry-based receptor occupancy (RO) assays are commonly used to monitor target engagement in the clinic, a CD137-specific RO assay presents several important challenges that have historically hampered monitoring RO in the clinic including the dynamic expression of CD137 on unstimulated and stimulated T cells, the low frequency of CD137+ cells in human blood and limited reagents to confidently detect CD137+ cells in the presence of CD137-targeting drugs. To address these challenges, a fit-for-purpose 14-plex flow cytometry panel was developed that incorporates a fluorescently labelled CD137-specific binding <i>Bicycle&#174;<\/i>. This CD137 <i>Bicycle&#174;<\/i> was shown to directly compete with BT7480 for binding to CD137, but not with fluorescently labelled anti-CD137 antibody, thereby enabling simultaneous detection of various CD137+ immune cell types as well as receptor occupancy by BT7480 in a single blood sample. Panel performance was tested across blood-based sample matrices routinely used in the clinic including EDTA and Cyto-Chex&#174; blood collection tubes and Cell Preparation Tubes (CPT) (n=3 each). CPT were selected as the optimal sample matrix based on sample viability and highest detection of CD137 antibody+ and CD137 <i>Bicycle&#174; <\/i>+ cells.

The 30-marker panel Maxpar&#174; Direct&#8482; Immune Profiling Assay&#8482; (Cat. No. 201325) for suspension mass cytometry provides an unprecedented sample-to-answer solution for detecting and analyzing 30 surface markers in a single experiment. With 18 open mass channels for additional biological markers, the Maxpar Direct Assay facilitates panel expansion and enables flexibility for higher multiplexity and applications. Among the potential complementary applications with the Maxpar Direct Assay, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) is of particular interest as it may be used to assess infiltrating immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment. However, for the purpose of assessing cell viability in this workflow, the effectiveness of the Cell-ID&#8482; Intercalator-Rh (Cat. No. 201103) that is included in the Maxpar Direct Assay is in question, since cell permeabilization during ICS can potentially damage the DNA-intercalator bondIn this study, we investigated the compatibility of the Cell-ID Intercalator-Rh (103Rh) with intracellular staining. To do this, we stained either human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) or whole blood samples (FLDM-400287) with the Maxpar Direct Assay followed by intracellular staining for the detection of expressed cytokines. The intercalator was evaluated for its ability to discriminate live and dead cells when the sample undergoes surface antibody staining. The monoisotopic Cell-ID Cisplatin-194Pt (Cat. No. 201194) was used as the control to provide benchmark measurement of cell viability of the samples. For both sample types, known percentages of heat-killed PBMC were spiked into the samples in order to evaluate the influence of dead cells. We demonstrate that 103Rh provides equivalent functionality as a cell viability indicator during intracellular staining for cytoplasmic proteins compared to Cell-ID Cisplatin-194Pt. This work was designed to support the use of the Maxpar Direct Immune Profiling Assay in combination with additional intracellular markers. Overall, these findings expand the applicability of Cell-ID Intercalator-Rh (103Rh) to processes that involve cytoplasmic staining. For Research Use Only.

They enable the formation of a cytotoxic synapse where the release of perforin and granzyme B induces target cell killing. Nevertheless, on-target activation of T-cells is associated with an intrinsic risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), one of the safety risks associated with the treatment with T cell engaging therapies. In this work, we focused on dissecting the cellular and molecular players of TCB-mediated cytokine release using single cell RNA sequencing of whole blood treated with CD20-TCB, targeting CD20-expressing B cells, as model system. In particular, we aimed at dissecting the kinetics of events along with identifying the main players that &#8220;trigger&#8221; with others that &#8220;amplify&#8221; the cytokine release. In accordance with previous reports, we show that activated T-cells initiate the cytokine cascade by releasing cytokines and chemokines stimulating monocytes and neutrophils that consequently amplify TCB-induced cytokine release. Additionally, we revealed inflammatory gene signatures and pathways evolving over treatment time in T cells, monocytes and neutrophils, highlighting potential novel biomarkers of CRS. Furthermore, using an <i>in vitro<\/i> co-culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with tumor cells or a whole blood assay in the presence of CD20-TCB and neutralizing antibodies against the identified molecular targets, we confirmed their role in triggering or amplifying<br \/>cytokine release. We further corroborated their role by depleting and\/or blocking different cellular and molecular players in tumor-bearing humanized NSG mice treated with CD20-TCB. Last, we assessed the effects of dexamethasone, adalimumab (anti-TNF-a), tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) and anakinra (anti-IL-1R) on cytokine release and anti-tumor efficacy of CD20-TCB in the same in vivo tumor model. Among the considered mitigation strategies, dexamethasone and adalimumab reduced the level of cytokines and chemokines, correlating with milder CRS signs upon TCB treatment. Importantly, none of the mitigations strategies interfered with anti-tumor efficacy, except adalimumab, which partially impacted the tumor growth inhibition and affected early T cell infiltration in the tumor.In summary, our findings reveal novel molecular and cellular biomarkers of TCB-induced cytokine release, and in addition provide insights on the potential mitigation strategies of the same. Our work sheds new light on the kinetics of mechanisms of inflammation driven by TCBs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5652a7b5-d2cc-422f-b070-bc6aafac01aa\/@q03B8ZBV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,T cell engager,Toxicity,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16612"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gabrielle Leclercq<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathalie Steinhoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>LLucia Alberti-Serverra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilio Yángüez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sina Nassiri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna-Maria Giusti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anneliese Schneider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Klein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hélène Haegel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pablo Umaña<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johannes Sam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Bacac<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, only a subset of patients experience benefit after receiving ICBs. There are several treatments including combination of PD-1 blockade and low dose chemotherapy, but only few robust synergetic effects were reported. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to increase the response rate by elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms and identifying novel therapeutic targets to enhance the efficacy of IBCs in non-responders.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We analyzed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 295 NSCLC patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy by segregating them with multiple clinical factors including sex, age, race, smoking history, BMI, tumor grade and subtype. Tumor samples from 48 patients were sequenced and their genomic profiles were extracted for analyses. We identified key signaling pathways and mutations that are enriched in those patients with distinct responses to ICB by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and mutational analyses. The efficacy of combination treatment with mitochondrial activator, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and PD-1 antibody is evaluated in LL\/2 and CMT167 murine lung cancer model.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that smoking status was the only parameter that was correlated with the ICB responses compared to sex, age, race, BMI, tumor grade and subtype. Former and current smokers have a higher response rate to anti-PD-1 treatment than non-smokers. GSEA results revealed that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial related pathways are significantly enriched in both responders and smokers, suggesting a potential role of cellular metabolism in regulating immune response to ICB. We also demonstrated that ATRA which increased mitochondrial function significantly by MitoSox and MitoTrack enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in vivo. Our clinical and bioinformatics based analyses revealed a connection between smoking induced metabolic switch and the response to immunotherapy, which can be the basis for developing novel combination therapies that are beneficial to never smoked NSCLC patients.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In this study, we discovered that smokers respond better to immune therapy than non-smokers due to elevated OXPHOS capacity and mitochondrial activity, which could be a potential target to boost the response to immune therapy in NSCLC patients who never smoked.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b1f2636-4d9f-4307-a467-0607d1163cae\/@r03B8ZBW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,NSCLC,Smoking,Oxidative stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16613"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuezhu Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jimmy Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Margaret Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Kucera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Umit Topaloglu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stacey O’Neill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Xing<\/i><\/presenter>.

The impact of underlying liver pathology, including liver cirrhosis or metastasis, on the incidence of irH remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that presence of underlying liver pathology would increase the risk of irH in patients with cancer treated with CPI.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We conducted a retrospective case-control study of irH in patients with cancer receiving CPI at the University of Washington\/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance between 2016 and 2020. Cases of irH were first identified through relevant ICD-10 codes, followed by systematic chart review to confirm provider-documented diagnosis and biochemical criteria for &#8805; grade II immune related hepatitis. Controls were matched to cases in a 2:1 ratio based on age (&#177; 5 years), sex, time of CPI initiation (&#177; 1 year), and available follow-up time. Cases were excluded if there were no available controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between irH, liver metastasis at CPI initiation and history of cirrhosis, and adjusted for covariates, including ECOG performance status at CPI initiation, combination (vs single agent) CPI, history of autoimmune disease, and hepatitis B or C infection.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the 97 cases of irH identified, 43% were women and median age was 61; 45% were undergoing treatment for skin, 22% for genitourinary, 16% for lung, 8% for head\/neck cancers and 5% for GI cancers including HCC. 94% of cases had metastatic disease at CPI initiation, including 27% of cases with liver metastases. Cirrhosis was present in only 4.9% (n=5) of cases. Among cases, median doses of CPI received prior to onset of irH was 2 (IQR 1-4). Biochemical liver injury presented with transaminase elevation with median peak values of AST 152 (IQR 101-316), ALT 221 (IQR 139-327), alkaline phosphatase 142 (IQR 92-330) and total bilirubin 0.9 (IQR 0.5-1.6). History of cirrhosis was associated with lower odds of irH (adjusted OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.76). Presence of liver metastasis was associated with an increased odds of irH (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.42-4.80), although the association between irH and liver metastasis lost significance (OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.94-4.26) when adjusted for covariates, particularly combination CPI therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We demonstrated an independent negative association between liver cirrhosis and irH, while liver metastasis was not significantly associated with increased odds of irH after adjustment for covariates. The former might be related to misattribution, low number of cases with cirrhosis, and\/or potentially due to suppressed transaminase elevation due to underlying hepatocyte exhaustion. Limitations include retrospective nature, small sample size of specific case subsets, potential selection and confounding biases; our findings are hypothesis-generating and warrant external validation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e1e23b8-7a1e-482c-9d4c-4067032f5ea7\/@r03B8ZBW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunotherapy,Toxicity,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16614"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erica M.

We recently completed phase I\/II testing of ONCOS-102, a GM-CSF-encoding oncolytic adenovirus (Ad5\/3-D24-GMCSF), for therapeutic efficacy and capacity to remodel tumor micro-environment (TME) in combination with pembrolizumab (pem) in patients (pts) with non-resectable, stage III-IV, anti-PD-1 resistant\/refractory (R\/R) melanoma (NCT03003676). Here we report comparative, longitudinal gene expression analysis of tumor samples from pts with complete\/partial response (CR\/PR), stable (SD) or progressive (PD) disease by RECIST1.0.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In study part 1, n=9 pts received three intra-tumoral (i.t.) injections of ONCOS-102 every 3 days during the first week of treatment. Pem was administered i.v. at 10 mg\/kg from day 22 every 3 weeks for 6 months. In study part 2, n=12 pts received additional injections of ONCOS-102 at day 15 and then every 3 weeks along with pem. On-treatment tumor biopsies were collected at baseline, day 22 and 64. Total RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression analysis using DESeq1 was conducted on n=17 pts to disclose dynamic transcriptome changes associated with ONCOS-102 administration and clinical response.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Baseline biopsies of CR\/PR pts showed 1,5-2 fold higher levels of expression of innate and adaptive immune response-related genes compared to PD pts. Treatment with ONCOS-102 upregulated immune related genes at day 22 across most tumors with no clear PR\/PD differentiation. However, at day 64 a striking distinction between pts with CR\/PR compared to PD emerged, showing 4-5 fold increase in expression levels for several immune-related gene categories including check-points, co-stimulatory and cellular cytotoxicity genes. TME remodeling in CR\/PR pts was sustained at least until day 64. On individual genes,higher and more sustained upregulation of several co-stimulatory molecules (4-1BB, OX40, CD28) and checkpoints (LAG-3, TIGID, TIM-3) was seen in responders. Expression of adenovirus genes was more prevalent in CR\/PR (2 of 3 pts) than PD (0 of 2 pts) on day 64, suggesting that tumor susceptibility to virus entry and replication drives clinical benefit of ONCOS-102. Our findings were supported by analysis of other gene subsets and comparison of different schedules of ONCOS-102 administration.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> ONCOS-102 drives pro-inflammatory modulation of the TME in PD-1 R\/R melanoma tumors. Clinical response ONCOS-102 is associated with efficient viral gene expression and strong, sustained activation of immune-related genes, which may be targets for future combinations of ONCOS-102 and immune-modulators beyond PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bda24d78-983c-4913-827e-33a5b7287aef\/@r03B8ZBW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Anti-PD-1resistance,Tumor microenvironment,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16616"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erik Digman Wiklund<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lukasz Kuryk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandeep Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Magnus Jaderberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Levitsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Birkballe Hansen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Sophie Moller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Shoushtari<\/i><\/presenter>.

Combining stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), to increase release of cancer cell antigens, with an anti-CTLA-4 and PD-L1 inhibitor may lead to increased response rates. No solid biomarker in predicting treatment response is available. We set out to study feasibility of combined durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4) with SBRT on the primary tumor. The extend of tumor-infiltrating cells has shown to correlate to improved prognosis using checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment of various cancers. We hypothesized that the peripheral blood T-cell activation status may be a predictor of response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>Three immunotherapy regimes were combined with SBRT in sequential cohorts as &#8805;2<sup>nd<\/sup> line in CPI na&#239;ve patients with NSCLC stage IIIB\/IV. One week after the 1<sup>st<\/sup> dose of CPI, patients were irradiated on the primary tumor (1x 20Gy on 9cc). The 1<sup>st<\/sup> cohort (n=3) received durvalumab, the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 3<sup>rd<\/sup> cohort (both n=6) a combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab, followed by durvalumab monotherapy. Exploratory endpoint was the correlation of response with T-cell function. T-cell function was assessed using flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood T-cells and compared to simultaneously included healthy controls. In short, whole blood was activated ex vivo using Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) after which the T-cell activation status was assesses by expression of CD69 and cytokines (IL-2, IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945;). Patients were divided in above (responders, R) and below median PFS (non-responders, NR). We compared intracellular cytokine production in both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-lymphocytes between both groups and with healthy controls (HC) using the Mann-Whitney U test.<br \/>Findings:<b> <\/b>Fifteen patients were included as described above. Median PFS was 2 months, OS 10 months (immature). Baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable. T-cell function was assessed in 14 patients and HC at baseline. Data are shown as median (P-value) for R vs NR below. R had a significant higher percentage activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells upon SEB stimulation than NR: CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD69<sup>+<\/sup> 15.8 vs 3.5 (0.008) and IL-2<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD69<sup>+<\/sup> 8.8 vs 2.9 (0.02). There was a trend in TNF-&#945;<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD69<sup>+<\/sup> 19.8 vs 8.0 (0.11) and IFN-&#611;<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD69<sup>+<\/sup> 21.4 vs 5.5 (0.22). These differences were all significant for R compared to HC (p&#60;0.03), but not for NR (P&#62;0.66).<br \/><sup><\/sup> Interpretation: With a mild antigen independent stimulus (SEB), the CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells of responders were significantly more activated at baseline compared to non-responders and healthy controls. This suggests an elevated pre-treatment T-cell activation status in patients that responded to the treatment and the possibility to use this as a potential biomarker to predict the response to CPI treatment.<br \/>Disclosure:<b> <\/b>This study was sponsored by a research grant from AstraZeneca.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/218d5e2e-4692-4129-9ccd-7aee4e14317b\/@r03B8ZBW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,NSCLC,Immunotherapy,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16618"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hanneke Kievit<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>M.

Recently, it came into light that ICI can increase the risk of HBVr. Immune-mediated adverse events including immune-mediated hepatitis have been widely reported. However, HBVr is an extremely rare adverse event that has been seldom reported. Herein, we report the first case of ipilimumab\/nivolumab induced HBVr in metastatic squamous cell lung cancer patient.<br \/>Case Presentation: 71-year-old Asian gentlemen with stage IIIB poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 5-10%) was initially treated with 4 cycles of carboplatin\/paclitaxel\/pembrolizumab and one dose of maintenance pembrolizumab. The treatment was complicated by immune-related adverse events of thyroiditis and adrenal insufficiency and followed by surgical resection of the tumor. Unfortunately, he developed recurrent metastatic disease of the brain which provoked craniotomy and resection followed by multiple courses of radiation therapy. The patient was then started on treatment with ipilimumab\/nivolumab maintenance therapy following 2 cycles of carboplatin\/paclitaxel\/nivolumab\/ipilimumab combined therapy (every 3 weeks). Bevacizumab was added for cerebral edema associated with brain metastasis. The patient was initially noted to be positive for hepatitis B Antigen. However, he was asymptomatic and liver function test (LFT) and liver ultrasound were unremarkable. He had been monitored for LFT at every visit. After 5.5 months from starting the treatment (after seven cycles of ipilimumab\/nivolumab and six cycles of bevacizumab), transaminitis was noted and treatment was held. He was admitted for abdominal pain with labs demonstrating hepatocellular injury with ALT 1761 units\/L, AST 607 units\/L, and total bilirubin 3.3 mg\/dL. Hepatitis work-up revealed HBVr (positive for HBs Ag, hepatitis B viral load 11,745). Patient was started on tenofovir daily and LFT was normalized after three weeks without synthetic dysfunction or metabolic encephalopathy. Ipilimumab\/nivolumab treatment was held for six weeks and reintroduced without any further significant events.<br \/>Conclusion: It has recently been reported that pembrolizumab had a strong signal associated with HBVr. However, to our knowledge, this is the first case report for HBVr in squamous cell carcinoma of lung patient treated with ipilimumab\/nivolumab. ASCO recommends universal screening for hepatitis B for patients anticipating systemic anticancer therapy. As illustrated by our case, it is important to have hepatitis B screening before starting systemic therapy including immunotherapy. Additional larger studies are warranted to validate the role of each type of ICI in HBVr.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0acd7415-f7c7-4e5f-93e3-6b89abf959fc\/@r03B8ZBW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatitis B virus,PD-L1,Ipilimumab,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16619"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leeseul Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Horyun Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeun Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinah Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/presenter>.

Immunotherapeutic (I\/O) agents like checkpoint inhibitor aim to prevent anergy whilst T cell agonists co-stimulate CTLs to reinvigorate them and thus leading to tumor cytotoxicity. In this study we investigate the abundance and functionality of the intratumoral CTLs post stimulation, across different tumor indications, to understand the differential response across samples and indications to immune cell stimulation. These include Head and Neck Squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), stomach adenocarcinoma (ca-Stomach) and Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Using the Farcast<sup>TM<\/sup> TiME tumor histo-culture platform, that preserves both tumor and immune components in culture, we stimulated tumor explants with anti-CD3 (10ng\/ml) + IL2 (100units\/ml) for T-cell activation. Supernatants were collected pre-treatment and at 24-hour intervals for evaluation of cytokine release. At termination the explants were either fixed in formalin to generate paraffin blocks or dissociated into single cells for flowcytometry. 3-5 samples from each tumor indication were included in this study. Flowcytometry based immunophenotyping indicated presence of 48.6% &#177;5.4 live CD3+ T-cells and 20.6% &#177; 3.1 live CD3+CD8+ CTLs across all indications in the absence of any stimulation. HNSCC, RCC and ca-Stomach had similar proportion of CTLs, while TNBC had much lower proportions of T cell and CTLs. HNSCC and TNBC had a very low proportion of functional Granzyme-B+ CTLs (0.29%&#177;0.08) whereas ca-Stomach and RCC had relatively higher proportion of these cells (6.9%&#177;2.5). The proliferating Ki67+ CTLs sub-population was low across all indications (0.37%&#177;0.2). Upon stimulation there was a significant increase (&#62;2.5-fold, p&#60;0.05) in the proliferating CTLs sub-population across all indications though the cytokine release pattern varied. HNSCC showed a consistent increase (7.4-fold) in functional CTLs in all samples accompanied by a significant increase in INF&#611;, Granzyme B and Perforin secretion. RCC and TNBC showed minimal change in functional CTLs but showed a significant increase in secretion of these cytokines. In ca-Stomach there was an increase in INF&#611; secretion, but not Granzyme B and Perforin. In summary, while CTLs were present in TiME, the proportions of activated and proliferating sub-populations differed across indications. The presence of active CTLs did not always translate to tumor cytotoxicity. This could be due to other pro-tumor cells and factors that offset the anti-tumor activity of T cells. The TiME platform thus provides a unique platform to study complex interactions between tumor and intratumoral immune cell populations that could be further probed to understand differential response in patients to immunotherapy mediated tumor cytotoxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e16d426-35e6-4171-bc62-32448805485a\/@s03B8ZBX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immunostimulation,Immune response,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16620"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nandini P.

The definition of HPD is not fully established and risk factors are uncertain. Our aim in this study was to find the incidence of HPD as well as its significant clinical and genetic risk factors.<br \/>Method: A total of 203 patients with NSCLC who received ICI at Northwestern Memorial Hospital during 2008-2020 were included. Tumor growth kinetics (TGK) on immunotherapy and TGK pre-immunotherapy were collected and TGK ratio (TGKR) was calculated. HPD was defined as TGKR&#8805;2.<br \/>Result: HPD was observed in 16% (n=33) of patients. HPD was significantly associated with high ECOG (3-4 vs 1-2) [OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 1.31 to 16.29, P = 0.01], presence of bone metastasis [OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.10 to 5.28, P = 0.01], neutrophils\/lymphocyte ratio(NLR) &#8805;5 [OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.24 to 5.81 P = 0.01], thrombocytosis (platelet count &#62;450k) [OR = 5.31, 95% CI = 2.07 to 14.70, P=0.0003], and treatment with PD-L1 inhibitor vs PD-1 inhibitor [OR = 2.14, 95% CI= 0.97 to 4.68, P= 0.068]. HPD was inversely associated with positive PD-L1 expression [OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.86, P = 0.01], ICI combined with chemotherapy vs ICI monotherapy [OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.055 to 0.97, P=0.04], and positive TTF-1 expression [OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.21 to 1.02, P=0.057]. HPD was not associated with histology of NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma), age(&#60;70, &#8805;70), sex, smoking history, number of metastatic lesions (&#60;3, &#8805;3), brain metastasis, liver metastasis, brain metastasis before treatment initiation, EGFR mutation, TP53 mutation, BRAF mutation, and TNM staging.<br \/>Conclusion: The incidence of HPD in NSCLC treated with ICI was consistent with current literature. High NLR and platelet count are suggestive of an immunosuppressive environment that could contribute to the rapid growth of tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an inverse correlation of PD-L1 expression and TTF-1 expression with HPD. The strength of our study lies in a large number of patients. Further studies on validating risk factors of HPD and exploring their associated mechanisms are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aa37cce9-9519-4860-a15c-cd2aae0569c2\/@s03B8ZBX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,NSCLC,Immune checkpoint blockade,Risk factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21767"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hyeonseon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeun Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiwoo Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Leeseul Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Jeong Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Horyun Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinah Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/presenter>.
