[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Rab34 encodes a protein belonging to the Rab family of proteins, which are small GTPases important in regulating signal transduction and cellular processes. A potential role of Rab34 in cancer has been suggested, but few studies have reported its function in human epithelial cancers. It was reported that prostate cancer (PCa) patients were more prone to biochemical recurrence when Rab34 was downregulated in PCa tissue compared with benign prostate tissue (BPT), being negatively associated with miR-148, a miRNA that increased the growth in cell lines and was up-regulated in PCa samples. Rab34 is a putative target gene for miR-9. We aimed to explore the Rab34 and miR-9 expression in PCa using a bioinformatic analysis, however, the mere presence of miRNA-binding sites is insufficient for predicting target regulation, and therefore, we also analyzed Rab34 expression in BPT and PCa tissues.<br \/><b>Design:<\/b> The expression of miR9-5p and Rab34 mRNA was explored in the tumor tissues of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) through the bioinformatics tools of the dbDEMC2 and GEPIA2 web servers, and additional evidence of miR-9\/Rab34 interaction was sought in the miRTarBase of experimentally validated microRNA-target interactions. Two pathologists evaluated Rab34 immunohistochemical expression in localized PCa and BPT in a prostate tissue microarray. For each spot an H-score was obtained by microscopic assessment of epithelial cells with positive staining. Differences in Rab34 expression were found by comparing H-Scores between BPT and PCa tissues using Mann-Whitney test, a <i>p value <\/i>less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The analysis of miR-9 and Rab34 expression in the TCGA showed that Rab34 has a diverse expression in tumor tissues, being downregulated in colon, rectum and PCa, and upregulated in lymphoma, leukemia and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, miR-9 was upregulated in PCa and downregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. There were no experimental evidence supporting the miR-9\/Rab34 interaction in PCa tissues from the miRTarBase. However, most of the breast cancer datasets showed a negative correlation in the expression of both genes. Rab34 expression at protein level was assessed in 123 tissue cores representing PCa, and 86 tissue cores representing BPT. In cores with PCa mean Rab34 expression was significantly lower than the mean Rab34 expression in cores with BPT (p less than<i> 0.0001<\/i>). There was a lower mean staining score in PCa (87.3, 95% CI: 73.78 - 100.9), compared to BPT (156.3, 95% CI: 144 - 168.5).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our study shows that Rab34 is downregulated in PCa tissue. These findings are in accordance to a previous report that associated its lower expression to worse prognosis and tumor recurrence. The downregulation of Rab34 in PCa tissue might be related to overexpression of its putative microRNA, miR-9. Additional studies to detect the <i>in situ<\/i> expression of miR-9 in PCa are in progress to validate these results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6bcadc9b-9b91-4aa5-b357-f7e53b891d55\/@w03B8ZSs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,MicroRNA,Tissue microarrays,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17817"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ines Benedetti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lia Barrios<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Rebollo<\/i><\/presenter>.

NB accounts for more than 15% of all childhood cancer-related deaths. Despite the most intensive multimodal therapy, more than 50% of patients with high-risk NB relapse with often fatal, resistant disease. Finding novel treatments, especially for relapse disease, is desperately needed for high-risk NB. In cancers, distinct transcription factors TFs networks forming core regulatory circuitries (CRCs) control gene expression programs that drive cell identity. Recent studies reported the presence of two types of identity states in NB tumors: one establishing a more proliferative adrenergic (ADRN) cell state and a second establishing a more invasive, therapy-resistant mesenchymal (MES) cell state. While most studies are investigating the CRC members for targeting MYCN amplified NB (ADRN) or the MES\/NCCs cell states, most primary tumors are heterogeneous, comprised of cells with both identities. Thus, our work is focused on identifying universal factors shared across different lineage states to determine whether targeting both identities could be a valuable strategy for NB treatment. NB was identified from a screen of 673 cancer cell lines as highly sensitive to the BET-inhibitor JQ1. In our work, we identified the class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (bHLH) TCF4 as a critical target of JQ1 mediated cell death in NB. TCF4 functions as a transcriptional hub that heterodimerizes with class II (bHLH) TFs including the proneural gene ASCL1 (ADRN), and TWIST1 a master regulator of the MES state<b>. <\/b>Heterodimers formed between TCF4 and ASCL1, and TWIST1, have been demonstrated to provide lineage-specific differentiation from embryonic stem cells<b>. Here, we hypothesize that TCF4 is a cell dependency gene in NB that is crucial for determining NB identity. <\/b>Using RNA seq analysis of TCF4 dox-inducible shRNA stable cell lines, we found that the gene expression changes in TCF4-depleted cells indicate a role for TCF4 in differentiation, cell signaling, and neurodevelopment. Interestingly, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicates that both identity states are suppressed after silencing of TCF4. Our data also shows that inducible decrease of TCF4 protein resulted in a significant inhibition of NB cell growth, and impaired tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we identified TCF4 targets in NB by combined analysis of TCF4 ChIP-seq data and gene expression changes following TCF4 knockdown. ENRICHR analysis suggests that differentially expressed genes in TCF4-knockdown cells that also have a TCF4 ChIP-seq peak are targets of the TFs TWIST1 (MES) and HAND1 (ADRN) that interact directly with TCF4. In conclusion, our preliminary data supports the hypothesis that TCF4 is a master transcriptional regulator of NB oncogenic program that is crucial for maintaining NB identity states.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/523ed869-9bda-457d-8715-d8b065a9e0e8\/@w03B8ZSs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17818"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nour Aljouda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dewan Shrestha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan Walker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satyanarayana Alleboina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Evan Glazer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Freeman<\/i><\/presenter>.

The radiosensitization by various poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been intensively investigated in many solid tumor models especially harboring deficient BRCA1\/2. However, the impact of a PARP1\/2 inhibitor niraparib on radiosensitivity of glioblastoma cell lines with proficient BRCA1\/2 and underling mechanisms has yet not been fully elucidated.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> GDSC dataset with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of PARP inhibitors and transcriptome profiles as well as NCI-60 cell lines with known survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) were used to deduce potential pathways by which PARP inhibitors suppress cell viability and confer radiosensitization through linear regression and reactome gene set enrichment analysis. Two GBM cell lines with proficient BRCA1\/2, A172 and U-87-MG were used to evaluate IC<sub>50<\/sub> and radiation dose enhancement factor DEF<sub>37<\/sub> of niraparib by CCK8 experiment and clonogenicity assay. Changes in the distribution of cell cycle and DDX21 protein expression were analyzed with flow cytometry and western blot respectively. The involvement of DDX21 in the mechanism mediating radiosensization of niraparib was performed with small inference RNA experiment.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Pathways relevant to ribosome biosynthesis and functions such as eukaryotic translation initiation, rRNA processing was found to be responsible for cytotoxicity of niraparib in 519 tumor cell lines. Moreover, mRNA expression of PARP1\/2, genes participated in ribosome biosynthesis and homologous recombination (HR) were all significantly negatively associated with SF2 in 44 NCI-60 cell lines. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> of niraparib in A172 and U-87-MG cell lines were 10.77&#177;3.31 and 32.37&#177;2.84 &#956;M respectively. The DEF<sub>37<\/sub> was established as 1.99 at 348 nM, 2.17 at 1044 nM for A172 cell line and 1.10 at 1056 nM, 1.44 at 3169 nM for U-87-MG cell line, respectively. Treatment with niraparib alone and in the combination with radiation (4 Gy) resulted in significant increase in fraction of G2 phase in both cell lines. Treatment with niraparib alone did not change protein expression level of DDX21 in both cell lines. However, knockdown of DDX21 with siRNA significantly reduced proliferation in U-87-MG cells. Niraparib at 1056 nM further decreased clonogenic number in the combination with 4 Gy radiation in U-87-MG cells compared with those treated with radiation alone. Importantly, knockdown of DDX21 resulted in significant increasing in clonogenic number of U-87-MG cells treated with radiation alone or the combination of niraparib and radiation compared with control cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Niraparib has radiosensitization effect for GBM cells with proficient BRCA1\/2 at low concentration.

Association with Myc converts Miz-1 from being a transcriptional activator to a repressor. This binding and the formation of Myc\/Miz-1 complex induces a change in the biophysical properties of the Miz-1 protein, rendering the complex insoluble and causing to relocalize inside the nucleus. In addition, this association stabilizes Myc and as a result represses transcription. With uncontrolled tumor progress, metastatic tumor expansion can occur through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the induction of ZEB-1 (Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox-1). Zeb-1 expression is highly associated with aggressive behavior tumor types. A cohort of 98 human cholangiocarcinoma carcinoma (CC) including 14 with mixed (CC) \/ (HCC) resected cases whose formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections containing adjacent benign and malignant tumor lesions were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using Miz-1 (ZBTB17), ZEB-1 (OT13G6), c-Myc (Y69), and Ki-67 (Mib-1) monoclonal antibodies. The clinicopathologic variables, including viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, tumor size, grade and number, vascular invasion, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, were obtained from each patient&#8217;s medical records. The variables were assessed for correlation with the immunohistochemical results. Compared to the adjacent benign liver section, reduction of Miz-1 expression was observed in 98\/98 (100%) <i>(P&#60;0.0001)<\/i> cases, while positive expression of c-Myc, Ki-67 (&#62; 5%), and ZEB-1 was observed in 18\/98 (18.36%) <i>(P&#60;0.0001)<\/i>, 27\/98 (27.55%) <i>(P=0.000003)<\/i>, and 15\/98 (15.30%) <i>(P&#60;0.00001) <\/i>cases<i> <\/i>respectively<i>.<\/i> Of note, complete loss of Miz-1 expression was noted in 20\/36 (55.55%) <i>(P=0.106)<\/i> high grade tumors (III\/IV) associated with positive c-Myc, Ki-67 (&#62;5%), ZEB-1, and nuclear Miz-1 expression in 12\/20 (60%) <i>(P=0.12)<\/i> cases (4 CC and 8 mixed (CC)\/(HCC) cases). All 12 cases with positive ZEB-1 had confirmed positive lymph node involvement. These results support the role of Miz-1 as one of the intermediary checkpoints required for the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Positive c-Myc\/ZEB-1 coupled with Miz-1 reduced cytoplasmic and its re-localization to a nuclear expression confirms the transcriptional repressor role of the Myc\/Miz-1 complex and the activation of the ZEB-1 gene as a predictor of increased metastatic expansion, therapy resistance, and poor survival in high grade CC, and CC\/HCC cases. These findings correlate with a cohort of an adequate number of differently graded lesions from 147 HCC cases that showed similar expression pattern of Miz-1, c-Myc and Zeb-1 to better confirm our hypothesis in epithelial derived human malignancies with frequently amplified 8q24 chromosome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Cholangiocarcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17820"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Joeffrey J.

Recent work has identified CPSF73 as a promising drug target for inhibiting the growth of specific cancers, and higher level of CPSF73 correlates to poor survival in breast cancer patients. However, our understanding of the regulation of CPSF73 is still at an early stage. Here, we report that a HECT-like E3 ligase, UBE3D, participates in stabilizing CPFS73 protein by preventing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the proteasome. Depletion of UBE3D in both non-cancer cells and cancer cells leads to CPSF73 downregulation, a pre-mRNA cleavage defect and dysregulated gene expression. UBE3D dysfunction or chemical inactivation of CPFS73 inhibited migration and invasion as well as stem cell renewal phenotypes in vitro in triple negative breast cancer cells. In addition, genetic overexpression of CPSF73 promoted breast cancer stemness and knocking down of CPSF73 inhibited stem cell renewal property. Together, our findings indicate that targeting the pre-mRNA processing nuclease CPSF73 has potential for breast cancer therapy.<br \/>This work was supported by the NSF grant NS0224 to C.

In addition to AP-1 site, JDP2 also binds to cAMP responsive element (CRE) site in numerous <i>cis<\/i>-elements of the target genes. JDP2 has been shown to be involved in cancer development and cell-cycle regulation, suppression of adipocyte differentiation, and controlling bone homeostasis and antibacterial immunity. ATF3 and JDP2 share high similarity in C-terminal domains with identities of 65%. Previous studies have demonstrated that ATF3 can bind to p53 and regulate p53 transcriptional activity and stability. Though couple of studies have shown that JDP2 inhibits expression of p53 and p53 represses the transcriptional activity of JDP2 promoter; however, whether JDP2 directly interacts and regulates p53 transactivation remains largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that JDP2 can directly interact with p53. First, we found that both ATF3 and JDP2 can bind to p53 and the C-terminus of JDP2 is required for p53 binding. Secondly, in p53-null H1299 cells, JDP2 dose-dependently enhances p53 transactivation using p53RE-Luc (14X). Moreover, we demonstrated that JDP2 dose-dependently decreases p53 protein level in consistence with the previous reports. Finally, JDP2 increases p53 stability in CHX chase experiments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that JDP2 directly binds to p53 and enhances p53 transactivation and stability, suggesting that JDP2 is a novel regulator of p53.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bad13983-2bbf-4548-abba-c2868c56281a\/@w03B8ZSs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,JDP2,ATF3,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17822"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wei-Hsiung Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kasey Price<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leticia Cardoso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiung-Min Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Yang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Activating mutations, the NF-E2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2, NRF2) transcription factor induces constitutive expression of cytoprotective and redox maintenance genes. Inactivating mutations in members of the SWI\/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, especially SMARCA4 (BRG1) and ARID1A, lead to changes in nucleosome positioning and gene expression. Here, we show that loss of SWI\/SNF complex function activated a subset of NRF2-mediated transcriptional targets. Using a series of isogenic NSCLC lines with reduced or depleted BRG1 and\/or BRM expression, we observed significantly increased expression and protein levels of the NRF2-target genes HMOX1 and GSTM4. RNA sequencing of BRG1-proficient and -deficient cell lines confirmed changes in KEAP1-NRF2 target gene expression as well as identified novel targets of the SWI\/SNF complex. Importantly, low BRG1 expression levels in primary human NSCLC tumors correlated with increased NRF2-target gene expression. In addition to BRG1 levels, we examined loss of ARID1A across primary human tumors and found ARID1A deficiency was associated with altered NRF2 signaling. The tumors with the highest frequency of altered NRF2 signaling were lung squamous (LUSC) and head and neck squamous (HNSCC), cancers strongly associated with environmental toxicants. Interestingly ARID1A loss depressed NRF2 signaling in LUSC while amplifying it in HNSCC, an observation we are exploring mechanistically in cell line knock out models. Our data demonstrate that loss of SWI\/SNF in lung cancer results in activation of the NRF2\/KEAP1 pathway and increased expression of a subset of its downstream targets. These data provide an additional molecular explanation for why patients harboring SWI\/SNF mutations show a poor prognosis. Our results also potentially link mutations in SWI\/SNF complex components, that occur in &#62;20% of human cancers, with exposure to environmental toxicants. A better understanding of these mechanism may yield novel insights into the design of targeted treatment modalities for human lung cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,SWI\/SNF,Nrf2,ARID1A,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18748"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vinh Nguyen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Travis Shranck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samera Hamad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernard Weissman<\/i><\/presenter>.

We previously utilized a computational screen to find that <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r infant ALL demonstrated somatic allele specific expression for 431 genes when compared to non-<i>KMT2A<\/i>-r samples (Abstract Number 3649, AACR 2019). The gene that exhibited the most differential allele specific expression (ASE) pattern was <i>HOXA9<\/i>. Here, we follow up that analysis with manual examination of additional infant ALL samples.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 48 infants with ALL (33 <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r cases and 15 non-<i>KMT2A<\/i>-r cases) treated on Children&#8217;s Oncology Group protocol AALL0631, at diagnosis (DX), at remission (MD), and at relapse (RL), if applicable. WGS data at MD was phased using a 1000 Genomes reference panel. <i>HOXA9<\/i> expression was quantified in transcripts per million (TPM). Biallelic expression was manually calculated on the phased genome for samples with at least 1 germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within <i>HOXA9<\/i> and at least 5 aligned RNAseq reads over the <i>HOXA9<\/i> transcript. ASE was defined as minor allele fraction (MAF; allele fraction for the less prevalent allele) of &#8804; 0.35. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing data and sequencing-derived copy number data were also analyzed to investigate possible explanations for <i>HOXA9<\/i> ASE.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified diagnostic samples from 21 patients, 9 <i>KMT2A-AFF1<\/i>, 9 <i>KMT2A-MLLT1<\/i>, and 3 non-<i>KMT2A<\/i>-r, that passed manual filtering. Data included 5 patients with paired DX and RL samples. Of the 15 <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r samples unable to be analyzed for ASE, 13 lacked a SNP for phasing and 2 had &#60; 5 reads. For the 12 non-<i>KMT2A<\/i>-r samples unanalyzable for ASE, 6 lacked a SNP and 6 had &#60; 5 reads. Average <i>HOXA9 <\/i>expression was 15.17 TPM (range 0.01 to 44.34) in <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r samples and 2.91 TPM (range 0 to 29.29) in non-<i>KMT2A<\/i>-r samples. ASE of <i>HOXA9<\/i> (MAF &#8804; 0.35) was observed in 14 samples, 72% of <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r (13 of 18 samples) and 33% of non-<i>KMT2A<\/i>-r (1 of 3 samples). RL samples were found to have <i>HOXA9<\/i> ASE in all cases with ASE of <i>HOXA9<\/i> in the DX sample. Of the 18 <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r samples, 6 of 9 with <i>KMT2A<\/i>-<i>AFF1<\/i> and 7 of 9 with <i>KMT2A-MLLT1<\/i> demonstrated HOXA9 ASE. Frequency of <i>HOXA9<\/i> ASE at diagnosis was similar between patients known to later relapse versus those known to remain in remission. Allele specific methylation, mono-allelic deletion, or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cn-LOH) for <i>HOXA9<\/i> were not observed in <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r nor non-<i>KMT2A<\/i>-r samples.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our expanded cohort supports the ASE of <i>HOXA9<\/i> in <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r infant ALL. This phenomenon did not appear to segregate by <i>KMT2A<\/i>-r partner gene, nor could it be explained by allele specific methylation or copy number variation (e.g., deletion of one <i>HOXA9<\/i> allele or cn-LOH).

We systematically profiled the splicing landscape of 83 gastric tumors and matched normal mucosa.

These subtypes were associated with distinct molecular signatures and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. Subtype-specific splicing events were enriched in motifs for splicing factors <i>RBM24<\/i> and<i> ESRP1<\/i>, which were upregulated in Mesenchymal-splicing and Epithelial-splicing tumors, respectively.

Although high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients initially respond to chemotherapy, over 70% relapse in two years. This paradigm can be understood through ovarian cancer&#8217;s pronounced heterogeneity whereby a majority of cancer cells are highly proliferative and chemosensitive and a minority of cells, termed tumor-initiating cells (TICs), are relatively quiescent and chemoresistant stem-like cells. Both are presumed to be important for tumor repopulation. Our lab previously demonstrated that TICs exhibit an upregulation of stem cell genes and NF-&#954;B signaling. RNA sequencing of cells grown in TIC enhancing, non-adherent conditions shows significantly increased expression of NF-kB genes NFKB2, RELA, and RELB, as well as stem cell genes SOX2 and ALDH1A2. In this study, we are investigating the mechanism through which the NF-&#954;B transcription factors RelA and RelB support TICs to promote relapse in ovarian cancer. RNA sequencing of shRNA knockdowns of RELA or RELB from cells grown in TIC conditions shows that RELA knockdown impacts 1415 unique genes, RELB knockdown impacts 2016 unique genes, and RELA or RELB knockdown decreases expression of 1912 shared genes. Gene ontology analysis suggests RELA regulates genes in growth and differentiation pathways while RELB regulates genes in metabolic pathways. Specifically, RELA knockdown significantly decreased expression of NF-kB pathway genes (RELA, RELB, NFKB2) as well as stem cell genes CD117 and ALDH1A2. RELB knockdown significantly decreased expression of NF-kB pathway genes (RELA, RELB) as well as stem cell genes CD117, CD133, ALDH1A1, and ALDH1A2. To expand on these findings we performed ChIP-sequencing of RelA and RelB in OV90 cells cultured in TIC enhancing or adherent monolayer conditions. Our results show that both RelA and RelB bind at promoter sites for NFKBIA and NUAK1 in both conditions. In monolayer cultures RelA uniquely binds 14 different genes, including lncRNAs, miRNAs, and Cyclin L1, important in G0-G1 cell cycle progression. In TIC conditions, RelB uniquely binds 16 different genes, including lncRNAs, miRNAs, and WNT10A, important in stem cell self-renewal. Experiments are underway to validate our top hits in ovarian cancer, using siRNA knockdowns to corroborate the genes and pathways through which RelB supports self-renewal and RelA supports cell cycle progression. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify downstream pathways regulated by NF-kB that can be targeted to overcome relapse in HGSOC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dddc1a47-fc7f-47dd-9bad-c63790192ecc\/@x03B8ZSt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NF-&#954;B,Recurrence,Chromatin immunoprecipitation,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18751"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emily M.

FOXA1 expression is also observed in other tumors of epithelial lineage such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but whether and how it is required for tumor growth in these contexts is not known. Analyzing data from genome-scaled pooled loss-of-function screens, we identified and validated a subset of NSCLC cell lines with reduced cellular fitness following <i>FOXA1 <\/i>knockout. We performed a rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME) screen to nominate candidate factors that may cooperate with FOXA1 to mediate oncogenic transcription programs. This screen revealed a chromatin-localized interaction between FOXA1 and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Depletion of GR expression using shRNA or CRISPR\/Cas9 suppressed the proliferation of FOXA1-dependent, but not FOXA1-independent NSCLC models, suggesting GR specifically contributes to tumor growth in the FOXA1-dependent context. To assess the potential therapeutic utility of targeting the FOXA1-GR signaling axis, we employed two structurally distinct ligand antagonists of GR from ORIC Pharmaceuticals: ORIC-101, a steroidal antagonist, and OP-4954, a non-steroidal antagonist. Both antagonists inhibited dexamethasone stimulated GR-transactivation of a glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-luciferase reporter with equal potency. However, proliferation and colony formation of the FOXA1\/GR-dependent NSCLC cells were only inhibited upon treatment with ORIC-101, and not OP-4954. Gene expression analysis uncovered a discrete set of GR target genes, including <i>SFTPB<\/i>, <i>TRAF4<\/i> and <i>SGK1,<\/i> whose expression was reduced by ORIC-101 but unaffected or even induced by OP-4954. The specific inhibition of GR target gene expression and attendant induction of apoptosis by ORIC-101 suggest a hierarchy of GR targets relevant to the FOXA1\/GR-growth program in NSCLC. Finally, we evaluated the in vivo therapeutic potential of ORIC-101 using NSCLC xenografts and found that single-agent ORIC-101 exhibited potent antitumor effects in these models. Taken together, these data establish a model of FOXA1-GR-dependent tumor growth amongst a subset of NSCLCs and demonstrate that effective blockade of this complex is a rational therapeutic avenue to be explored in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e34c6c64-98bf-4201-ac64-e6a59bd14b5c\/@x03B8ZSt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutic target,Glucocorticoid receptor,Proteomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18752"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Madeline Dorso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Recently, it has been proposed that the robust transcription of genes at such SEs is enabled by the formation of phase-separated condensates by transcription factors and coactivators with intrinsically disordered regions. The androgen receptor (AR), the main oncogenic driver in PCa, contains large disordered regions and is co-recruited with the transcriptional coactivator MED1 to SEs in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, thereby promoting oncogenic transcriptional programs. In this work, we show that AR-rich, liquid-like foci form in prostate cancer models upon androgen stimulation. We reveal that foci formation correlates with AR transcriptional activity, which can be modulated by changing cellular foci content genetically or chemically. We also demonstrate that the transcriptional coactivator MED1 plays an essential role in the formation of transcriptionally active AR-rich foci and that AR antagonists that block cofactor recruitment or DNA binding hinder foci formation and thus AR transcriptional activity. The liquid like properties of the condensates were also validated <i>in-vitro<\/i> by using recombinant AR protein. Using clinical specimens, we detected the interaction between AR and MED1 in advanced forms of prostate cancer and not in benign tissues. These results suggest that enhanced compartmentalization of AR and coactivators at SEs may play an important role in the activation of oncogenic transcription programs in androgen-dependent PCa. A better understanding of the assembly and the regulation of these AR-rich compartments may provide novel therapeutic options for PCa by targeting downstream events of androgen activation and DNA binding of AR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bab1c7b0-0a3a-4af1-82cc-5111151cd2da\/@x03B8ZSt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Coactivator,Transcription,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18753"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Fan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maitree Biswas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shreyas Lingadahalli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Wells<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neetu Saxena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bei Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana K.

More specifically, NMYC is amplified and overexpressed in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). NMYC elicits its oncogenic effects by forming a heterodimer with MAX. This complex binds to regulating elements and activates the transcription of MYC target genes that play roles in tumor growth and progression. It is well known that members of the MYC family of proteins make compelling targets for cancer treatments. However, to this date, no tangible drug candidates have been developed into the clinics for MYC. In previous studies utilizing a rational computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) approach, we identified VPC-70551 as our most active hit. Subsequent optimization with the VPC-70551 scaffold has led to the identification of a new series of compounds. Using <i>in silico<\/i> drug screening followed by functional validation, we identified a small molecule inhibitor, VPC-70619, that exhibits higher microsomal stability and is better absorbed and tolerated orally than most MYC inhibitors described in the literature.<br \/>Method: We used a transcriptional reporter assay to determine the effect of VPC-70619 on MYC-mediated transcription. To validate on-target effect, we evaluated the effect of VPC-70619 treatment on MYC-positive (LASCPC-01, NCIH660, LNCaP N-MYC, 22Rv1 N-MYC) and MYC-negative (HO15.19) cancer cells. We also evaluated the effect of VPC-70619 on MYC\/MAX interaction by PLA and on DNA binding by BLI. The direct binding between recombinant MYC\/MAX protein complex and VPC-70619 was evaluated by MST.<br \/>Results: VPC-70619 inhibited MYC transcriptional activity in dose dependent manner and the proliferation of MYC-positive cell lines. VPC-70619 did not interfere with MYC\/MAX interaction however it blocked the complex interaction with DNA. We confirmed the direct binding of VPC-70619 to the purified MYC\/MAX complex by using MST.<br \/>Conclusion: This project presents the identification of a new MYC inhibitor that blocks the transcriptional activity of this oncogene and elucidates the molecular mechanism of action of this inhibitor. Our findings help prelude the development and discovery of more effective treatments for NEPC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d3e7ae3c-edba-4740-80d7-21d0de1ccdeb\/@x03B8ZSt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,MYCN,Drug-discovery screen,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18755"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jane Foo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anh-Tien Ton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kriti Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fuqiang Ban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helene Morin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric LeBlanc<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nada Lallous<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Artem Cherkasov<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previously, we reported that the combination of <i>p53<\/i> inactivation and <i>Myc<\/i> overexpression, mediated by Runx transcription factors (TFs), leads to osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone cancer. However, the mechanisms leading to <i>Myc<\/i> upregulation by Runx in a <i>p53<\/i>-deficient microenvironment remain unclear.<br \/>TGF&#946; is a main driver of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and its signal-dependent TFs, Smads, are known to associate with lineage-determining TFs including Runx. As TGF&#946; paracrine signalling is reportedly increased during human OS development, we immunodetected increased co-expression of TGF&#946; and phospho-Smad2 in the bone marrow of osteoprogenitor-specific <i>p53<\/i> knockout mice, <i>Osterix (Osx)\/Sp7<\/i>-Cre; <i>p53<\/i><sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice, which are widely used as an animal model of human OS. Heterozygous deletion of the type II TGF&#946; receptor in those mice weakened their susceptibility to OS, phenocopying the overall life-extending effect of <i>Myc<\/i> depletion in the same model.<br \/><i>p53<\/i> disruption caused TGF&#946; to aberrantly induce <i>Myc<\/i> in osteoprogenitors, rendering the cells tumorigenic upon transplantation into immunocompromised mice. Within the 3-Mb <i>Myc<\/i> regulatory region, we identified a TGF&#946;-responsive element dubbed <i>m340<\/i>, which contains binding sites for multiple TFs including Runx. The <i>m340<\/i> enhancer caused Myc upregulation upon <i>p53<\/i> disruption by switching its associated promoter from the lncRNA <i>Pvt1<\/i> to <i>Myc<\/i>. In support of this promoter switching mechanism, a specific disruption of the evolutionarily conserved p53 site within the <i>Pvt1<\/i> promoter recapitulated TGF&#946;-induced <i>Myc<\/i> overexpression. At <i>m340,<\/i> TGF&#946; promoted its occupancy by a transcriptional complex consisting of Runx, its cooperative factors Smads and AP1, and CBP, further activating the enhancer by increasing H3K27ac deposition.

The loss of p53 is thought to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of HPV+ HNSCC, which comprise approximately 35% of all HNSCC. Currently, standard care for HPV+HNSCC includes radiation and chemotherapy. However long-term toxicity related to these treatments is a concern, and there is a need for newer therapeutic strategies. Previously, we reported that two alternatively spliced, functional truncated isoforms of p53 (p53&#946; and p53&#947;, comprising of exons 1 to 9&#946; or 9&#947;, respectively) are degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a regulator of aberrant mRNA stability. Here, using HPV+HNSCC cell line models, we show that NMD inhibition rescues p53&#946;\/&#947; isoforms and activates p53 pathway. Furthermore, we show that p53&#946;\/&#947; isoforms are more stable compared to p53&#945; in these cells, with reduced vulnerabililty to HPVE6-AP- mediated degradation, and that p53&#946;\/&#947; isoforms contribute to increased expression of p53 transcriptional targets p21 and PUMA following NMD inhibition. Consistent with p53 pathway activation, NMD inhibition enhanced radiosensitivity of HNSCC cells. NMD inhibition attenuated colony forming ability and disrupted cell cycle progression. To evaluate the therapeutic implications of NMD inhibition, we assessed the in vivo growth of HPV<sup>+<\/sup> UMSCC47 tumors. Nude mice were injected with UMSCC47 cells either subcutaneously or orthotopically in the tongue and randomized to receive vehicle or with an NMD inhibitor. In both tumor models, we observed a significant reduction in tumor volume with NMD inhibition as compared to the vehicle-treated animals. To investigate whether NMD inhibition induced the expression of p53&#946;\/&#947; isoforms and activated the p53 pathway in vivo, we collected tumor tissues from animals and evaluated expression of p53 isoforms and transcriptional targets by RT-PCR. We observed increased expression of p53&#947;, p21, GADD45A and PUMA mRNAs in NMD inhibitor treated UMSCC47 tumors, compared to their respective vehicle treated controls. These results identify NMD inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for restoration of p53 function in major subgroups of p53-deficient HPV+ HNSCC tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c2273962-24f0-405e-9286-d5825163b716\/@x03B8ZSt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Nonsense-mediated mRNA dcay,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,p53 pathway activation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18757"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jayanthi Gudikote<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tina Cascone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alissa Poteete<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Piyada Sitthideatphaiboon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonia Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fahao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lerong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monique Nilsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phillip Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Christophe Bourdon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Faye M.

Inducing differentiation of premalignant cells and malignant cells are proposed strategies for cancer prevention and treatment, respectively. Retinoids, compounds related to retinol, drive terminal differentiation of numerous cell types. These compounds exhibit efficacy for the prevention of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), and their incorporation into treatment plans for these cancers is supported by laboratory and clinical studies. Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) is a cancer-testis antigen that represses retinoid signaling, and is associated with adverse outcomes in a plethora of malignancies. Although PRAME is known to be expressed in subsets of cutaneous SCC (cSCC) and head and neck SCC (HNSCC) tumors, its functions, prognostic and therapeutic significance have never been investigated in these cancers. We hypothesize that PRAME expression in SCC cells confers resistance to the anti-neoplastic effects of retinoids and supports cell proliferation. <b> <\/b>PRAME expression was evaluated in human cSCC tumors, and in cSCC and HNSCC cell lines by immunoblotting and qRT-PCR. PRAME-overexpressing immortalized keratinocyte, cSCC and HNSCC cell lines were generated. shRNA-mediated knockdown of PRAME was performed in a cSCC and a HNSCC cell line. Cells were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 24, 48 or 72 hours. Expression of differentiation markers was assessed by immunoblotting and qRT-PCR of markers of differentiation. Cell counting assays, immunoblot analysis of cell cycle genes and Ki67 immunofluorescence staining were used to assess proliferation. <b> <\/b>PRAME expression is detected in subsets of cSCC tumors and in select SCC cell lines. Overexpression of PRAME in HNSCC cells enhanced cell proliferation compared to control cells. Treatment with ATRA did not promote differentiation of PRAME-expressing cells. Furthermore, PRAME overexpression attenuated the anti-proliferative effect of ATRA in HNSCC cells. We conclude that PRAME enhances proliferation of malignant keratinocytes in vitro and may confer resistance to retinoid-induced differentiation and proliferation arrest. Investigations to assess the prognostic and therapeutic significance of PRAME expression in SCCs are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/43597b76-af3b-4cb3-ab09-4825d26a9ed0\/@x03B8ZSt\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Squamous cell carcinoma,Retinoids,Differentiation,Skin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18758"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brandon Liam Ramchatesingh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Litvinov<\/i><\/presenter>.

RMS tumors are unable to terminally differentiate into syncytial muscle despite elevated expression of the muscle master regulators, MyoD and Myf5. Fusion-positive RMS (FP-RMS) and fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) have emerged as the two major RMS subtypes. The pathogenesis of FP-RMS is commonly defined by the balanced translocation of chromosomes 2 and 3 resulting in the misexpression of a chimeric PAX3\/7-FOXO1 oncoprotein that derails normal differentiation pathways. However, the molecular basis of FN-RMS is poorly understood as single nucleotide variations in genes like KRAS, NRAS, and TP53 have limited recurrence (less than 10% of all patient tumors). In contrast, DNA copy number variations are highly recurrent and the genes they encode represent vulnerabilities in FN-RMS. Strikingly, we discovered that 72% of FN-RMS patient tumors harbor copy number amplifications at loci of TWIST1, TWIST2, or both, resulting in the upregulation of TWIST gene expression. We demonstrated that depletion of TWIST2 using a doxycycline inducible shRNA system caused cell cycle arrest and increased myogenic differentiation in xenograft models of FN-RMS. To interrogate whether TWIST2 can directly regulate the expression of these genes, we performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for TWIST2, H3K27Ac, and MYOD in TWIST2 knockdown and control FN-RMS cells. Utilizing this genome-wide data of chromatin binding, we comprehensively demonstrated that TWIST2 competes with MYOD preferentially at a subset of enhancers required for myogenic differentiation, causing repression of these loci. Interestingly, while MYOD binding is gained at myogenic loci in the absence of TWIST2, binding of MYOD is not lost at growth-promoting, oncogenic enhancers despite a decrease in their associated gene expression. This suggests that TWIST2 interacts with a different slew of transcription factors or chromatin regulators to activate gene expression. To interrogate this possibility, we are characterizing the TWIST2 protein interactome in FN-RMS cells using BioID as well as motifs enriched at TWIST2-regulated peaks. By studying TWIST2-associated pathways that affect RMS growth and differentiation, we see an opportunity to unlock novel therapeutic strategies for RMS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/08a7fae8-d354-44ef-9c53-da8ff9f38066\/@x03B8ZSt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Twist2,Transcriptional regulation,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19029"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"f025f30a-8f48-4d91-bc21-1a2e0a0f9d5b","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f025f30a-8f48-4d91-bc21-1a2e0a0f9d5b\/@x03B8ZSt\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akansha Shah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priscilla Jaichander<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenian Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karla Cano Hernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rhonda Bassel-Duby<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Olson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Targeting aberrantly active WNT signaling provides an alternate route for CRC treatment. Here we show that the high DKC1 expression in CRC patients associates with advanced-stage disease regardless of <i>RAS\/RAF<\/i> mutation status, indicating the potential of DKC1 as a pan-CRC therapeutic target. We show a direct regulation of <i>DKC1<\/i> downstream of canonical WNT signaling and confirm it as one of the WNT targets. Mechanistically, DKC1 regulates several critical cellular processes such as telomere maintenance, pseudouridylation of ribosomal RNAs, ribosomal biogenesis, etc. However, its plausible association with cancer stemness remains largely unexplored. We generated stable <i>DKC1<\/i><i> <\/i>knockdown (<i>DKC1<\/i>-KD) cell lines, namely WiDr and Colo320HSR to investigate its role in cancer stemness and CRC progression. <i>DKC1<\/i>-KD cells show a significant reduction in the tumor sphere forming ability along with diminished cell surface expression of stemness markers. Using multiple publicly available gene expression datasets for CRC patients, we performed Gene Set Variation Analysis to characterize the association of DKC1 with upregulated gene signature of consensus molecular subtype 2 (CMS2) of CRC, which has been associated with the highest incidence rate and active WNT signaling. Further, Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery tool-based analysis across these CRC patient samples striated based on DKC1 expression shows positive enrichment of biological processes related to cell cycle regulation. Consistently, we observed a G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest upon silencing <i>DKC1<\/i> in CRC cells. We also show that silencing <i>DKC1<\/i> results in enhanced chemosensitivity with a remarkable reduction in lipid accumulation. Moreover, upon <i>DKC1<\/i> silencing, an increase in epithelial marker E-cadherin and a decrease in mesenchymal marker N-cadherin expression was observed, suggesting its role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC. Our findings demonstrate the role of DKC1 in regulating stemness, drug resistance, and EMT to drive CRC oncogenicity. Taken together, we highlight the role of DKC1 as the most suitable pan-CRC drug target by employing the potential of pharmacological inhibitors against WNT signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ffed93ec-edd7-4392-89ef-1921de502684\/@y03B8ZSu\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stemness,Transcriptional regulation,Colorectal cancer,Wnt signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20595"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shivansh Nigam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ayush Praveen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bushra Ateeq<\/i><\/presenter>.

Occurrence of sporadic HGSOC is associated with high genomic instability, which causes amplification and deletion of several different genes. BRD4 is one of the most frequently amplified genes in ovarian carcinoma patients. BRD4 amplification leads to overexpression of BRD4 proteins including long and short BRD4 isoforms (BRD4-L and BRD4-S, respectively), and is associated with poor patient prognosis. Recently, it has been shown that the short isoform BRD4-S contributes to oncogenic properties of several tumor types; however, little is known about its role in ovarian cancer. Therefore, in order to interrogate the function of different BRD4 isoforms in HGSOC, we generated ovarian cancer cell lines stably overexpressing BRD4 isoforms (BRD4-L and BRD-S). Our data revealed that overexpression of BRD4-S in ovarian carcinoma cell lines induces a highly aggressive tumor phenotype <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Ovcar4-BRD4-S cells showed significantly higher cell proliferation rate and increased anchorage-independent growth when compared with parental cell lines. In addition, Ovcar4-BRD4-S presents a high level of DNA damage reflected by increased pH2AX foci. We also observed a disruption of cell cycle in Ovcar4-BRD4-S cells associated with a higher number of cells arrested in G2\/M phase and increased population of polyploid cells. <i>In vivo <\/i>experiments demonstrated that BRD4-S expressing tumors grow significantly faster than parental tumors. BRD4-S overexpressing tumors are also very resistant to DNA-damage agents including standard of care platinum drugs. Finally, our preliminary drug screening demonstrated that Ovcar4-BRD4-S cells are highly sensitive to Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775. Furthermore, the combination of MK-1775 with paclitaxel synergistically increased the antitumor effect. In summary, our studies indicate that amplification of the BRD4 gene in HGSOC patients might lead to an increase in splicing of BRD4-S transcript, which in consequence promotes highly aggressive and platinum-resistant tumors. Precision therapies targeting BRD4 amplified tumors, such as Wee1 inhibitors in combination with paclitaxel hold great promise to improve ovarian cancer treatment and reduce chemotherapy resistance, which is a critical problem for eradication of this aggressive tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b7755d37-250d-48b2-a424-cbd06a9a17b3\/@y03B8ZSu\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRD4,Ovarian cancer,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20096"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ana Luiza Drumond-Bock<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luyao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Magdalena Cybula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Rostworowska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Magdalena Bieniasz<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have previously found that the oncogenic regioisomer (&#177;)14,15-EET drives mitochondrial respiration, ATP synthesis, and proliferation of ER+\/HER2- breast cancer cells [Cell Chem Biol. 2017 Oct 19;24(10):1259-1275]. RNAseq analysis was performed (5 replicates per condition) on serum starved (16 hours) MCF-7 cells which were then treated with (&#177;)14,15-EET or vehicle (2 hours; serum and phenol red free medium without estradiol). Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we found that (&#177;)14,15-EET activated an estrogen receptor alpha (ER) hallmark early response gene set and synchronously activated a MYC hallmark gene set. With activation of the MYC hallmark gene set, c-Myc gene expression was also induced at 2 hours (3.99-fold; P=2.3 x 10<sup>-17<\/sup>; FDR=2.8 x 10<sup>-14<\/sup>). These data suggest an alternative pathway for activation of estrogen and MYC regulated genes in the absence of estradiol. The 15 genes most transcriptionally activated by (&#177;)14,15-EET at 2 hours were: VMP1, ZFP36, JUNB, FOS, IER3, EGR1, IER5L, ELF3, JUN, NR4A1, HES1, DUSP1, MYC, TOB1, and CITED2 [fold change range: 3.25 (CITED2) to 90.5 (FOS); all P&#60; 2.86 x 10<sup>-17<\/sup>; all FDR &#60; 3.03 x 10<sup>-14<\/sup>]. The ER regulated genes most transcriptionally activated (<u>&#62;<\/u>1.5 fold) were: IER3, TOB1, AREG, CISH, KCNMB3, and PDK4 (fold change range: 1.77 to 4.35; P= 1.74 x 10<sup>-18<\/sup> to 1.35 x 10<sup>-5<\/sup>; FDR=5.54 x 10<sup>-15<\/sup> to 6.4 x 10<sup>-4<\/sup>). The MYC regulated genes most transcriptionally activated (<u>&#62;<\/u> 1.5-fold change) were EIF4A1 (fold change= 2.37; P=1.0 x 10<sup>-7<\/sup>; FDR=1.33 x 10<sup>-5<\/sup>), IRF9 (fold change=1.58; P=0.0044; FDR= 0.026), and FOSL1 (fold change=1.51; P=0.008; FDR=0.04). Supporting the hypothesis of (&#177;)14,15-EET activation of ER-regulated transcription, (&#177;)14,15-EET promoted nuclear translocation of ER at 1 hour measured by DAPI normalized immunofluorescence [MCF-7 nuclear ER increase of 1.66-fold (P=0.031); ZR75-1 nuclear ER increase of 1.77-fold (P=0.015)]. Supporting the hypothesis of (&#177;)14,15-EET activation of MYC-regulated transcription, (&#177;)14,15-EET treatment promoted nuclear translocation of c-Myc with MCF-7 cells exhibiting a 1.22-fold increase at 2 hours (P=0.002). (&#177;)14,15-EET also promoted nuclear translocation of FITC-70 kDa dextran with MCF-7 cells exhibiting an increase of 1.35-fold at 1 hour (P=0.029). These data suggest that (&#177;)14,15-EET can induce an estradiol-like immediate early gene response in ER+\/HER2- breast cancer cells correlating with c-Myc activation. In summary, while the effect of (&#177;)14,15-EET on nuclear translocation may be partially cargo agnostic, (&#177;)14,15-EET promotes ER and c-Myc nuclear translocation and associated transcription, mimicking a tandem hormonal and growth factor response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1d7fe954-846d-4c81-baae-662c574a92d8\/@y03B8ZSu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Oncogene,Estrogen receptor,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21186"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jianxun Lei<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhijun Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julissa Molina-Vega<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paloma Cervantes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swaathi Jayaraman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John R.
