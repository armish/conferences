[{"Abstract":"Monitoring measurable residual disease (MRD) via liquid biopsy is a promising method for catching early stage cancer and disease relapse long before traditional diagnostics, which generally require significant disease progression for detection. Assays in development include those that target patient-specific variants and fixed panels for all patients. Regardless, detection of variant allele frequencies at extremely low levels, well below the limit of detection of typical circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays, presents a challenge that can be surmounted with well-designed reference materials that allow for assessment of sensitivity and specificity. We developed the Seraseq&#174; ctDNA MRD Panel kit composed of 4 tumor fractions at decreasing levels to meet validation needs of both patient-specific and fixed panel targeted cfDNA NGS MRD assays. Genomic DNA from tumor and their SNP-matched normal cell lines, characterized by whole exome sequencing (WES), was fragmented to approximate the size of circulating cell free DNA (ccfDNA). This DNA was blended at tumor fractions (TF) of 0.5%, 0.05%, and 0.005% and biosynthetic DNA fragments containing more common and clinically relevant variants were spiked in at similar TF levels. A normal (0% tumor) ctDNA reference material was produced for comparison and identification of background variants. The VAFs for the biosynthetic variants were determined by digital PCR (BioRad QX200) and targeted cfDNA NGS assay (ArcherDx LiquidPlex) in the 0.5% TF mix. Somatic variants from the tumor DNA were assessed using a custom Agilent SureSelect XT HS2 assay targeting ~100 variants in the MRD panel mix using 50 ng as input. Variants were called at 1 observation. All biosynthetic variants were detectable in the TF 0.5% mix at anticipated VAFs (dPCR: 0.43% &#177; 0.12% and NGS: 0.33% &#177; 0.15%). Somatic VAFs of the ctDNA MRD panel mixes were measured at expected levels although not all variants were detected below 0.05% due to sampling. Agilent SureSelect XT HS2 libraries had ~25% incorporation efficiency and ~ 72% on-target. The 0.5% and 0.05% mixes showed evidence of more of the somatic variants at 1 or more copies than the other samples. The 0.005% mix showed evidence of more of the somatic variants than the 0% mix. The Seraseq ctDNA MRD Panel Mixes have been designed to provide a broad range of DNA mutations from tumor-normal matched cell lines and spike-in variants to aid sensitivity and specificity when applied to MRD evaluation of patient-specific and fixed panel cfDNA NGS MRD assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4466bc8d-12b8-4746-a3aa-b478cda6bcfa\/@G03B8ZKD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Liquid biopsies,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13351"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dana Ruminski Lowe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benedicta Forson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew G.

Most patients harbor multiple molecularly distinct cancer foci at diagnosis that likely arose as independent clones. There is a critical need for molecular biomarkers that can distinguish the multifocality and inter-focal heterogeneity of tumors and help stratify patients for treatment. PTEN loss and ETS gene rearrangements are among the most prevalent genomic alterations in prostate carcinogenesis. The detection of both ERG overexpression and PTEN protein loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) have proven to be reliable substitutes for detecting genomic alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. We developed monoclonal antibodies against ETV1 and ETV4 and evaluated their performance in prostate cancer specimens. The expression of ETV1, ETV4, were examined in relation to ERG and loss of PTEN expression in TMAs constructed from primary prostate cancer specimens of two independent patient cohorts. The first TMA was constructed from multiple 1 mm cores representing distinct tumor focus from multifocal tumors from 50 African American (AA) and 50 Caucasian American (CA) men. The second was constructed from a single 2 mm core of individual tumors from an independent cohort of 152 AA and 304 CA men. We present results on the expression of each protein biomarker in the context of patient race and their association with clinico-pathologic features, together with concurrence or mutual exclusiveness for each event. These results support the application of ETS monoclonal antibodies in IHC assays to detect prostate cancer tumor heterogeneity and to identify subsets of prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d90cba6d-8d12-4f74-a491-67512d0c1784\/@G03B8ZKD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,PTEN,Immunohistochemistry,Progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13352"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cara Schafer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Young<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingjie Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiji Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albert Dobi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gyorgy Petrovics<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bettina F.

Involvement of the margins is associated with tumour recurrence and adverse outcomes. Determining whether or not the histological margins are involved by melanoma, particularly in situ melanoma, can be very difficult particularly in acral locations where insitu melanoma can be extremely subtle. This study sought to determine the proximity of acral melanoma in situ to the surgical excision margin using multiple methods including routine histopathological assessment, FISH (<i>CCND1 <\/i>amplification<i>)<\/i>, and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF: SOX10, p16, Cyclin D1 and PRAME) in primary acral melanomas with initially histopathologically reported clear excision margins of &#38;gt;0.3mm (n=85). The clear excision margins determined by each modality were compared between those melanomas which recurred (n=47) and those which remained recurrence-free at last follow-up (median = 46 months, range = 1-260 months) (n=35). Histopathologically confirmed excision margin width was smaller in the tumours of patients who recurred (mean = 7.083mm vs 9.964mm, p = 0.0811). Intratumoural <i>CCND1<\/i> amplification was increased in recurrence-free patients in comparison to recurrence patients (16.2% vs 7.7%). FISH and mIF confirmed the correlation of intratumoural <i>CCND1<\/i> amplification with Cyclin D1 expression SOX10+ melanoma cells (p=0.0347). No correlations between recurrence status and Cyclin D1, PRAME or p16 expression levels in the tumour or epidermis were identified. In histopathologically normal epidermal tissue as assessed on H&#38;E sections,Cyclin D1+, p16- and PRAME+ cells were classified as malignant cells when co-expressed with SOX10. Upon measuring the distance from the tumour margin to the nearest malignant cell, we found that malignant cells were closer to the tumour in recurrence patients in comparison to recurrence-free patients (mean = 7.324mm vs 9.464mm, p = 0.2735). These distances closely correlated with the excision margin width as determined via histopathological assessment (R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.7424, p&#38;lt;0.0001). In conclusion, histological assessment, FISH and mIF determined excision margins are highly correlative in acral melanomas. Narrower excision margins were associated with local recurrence of melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/07715dc7-69ec-419b-9b10-524d68f82424\/@G03B8ZKD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Molecular markers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13355"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Grace Heloise Attrill<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa A.

However, PSA is not cancer-specific, and the challenge persists of differentiating those PCa patients with indolent tumors from those requiring definitive therapy. Metabolomic profiles have the potential to capture molecular dynamics of disease and to reflect disease status <i>before<\/i> cellular manifestations become observable by histopathology. With clinical, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-positive, fusion biopsy-targeted tissue cores and mpMRI-negative controls in a training-testing cohort design, we studied the potential of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to yield cancer metabolomic profiles that could help discriminate likely indolent from clinically significant disease. Using MRS-based PCa metabolomic analyses, performed prior to histology, our approach is able to: <i>determine metabolomic relevations identified in fusion biopsy targets<\/i>, <i>estimate the scale of PCa metabolomic fields<\/i>, and <i>detect <\/i><i>clinically significant disease<\/i> in tissues deemed benign or low-risk PCa by pathology and imaging. Our intact tissue MRS metabolomics evaluations indicated significant differences in individual prostate tissue metabolites based on Target-Contralateral (Contral) paired comparisons for both Training and Testing cohorts. We identified metabolomic differences among Target prostate biopsy cores obtained from mpMRI lesions of different PI-RADS scores, and between Target and non-target Contral cores. As a retrospective study, we also analyzed data collected at the time of the initial prostate biopsy alongside patient status across follow up. By introducing metabolomics, as compared with using PSAd or PI-RADS alone, the sensitivity predictions increased by 80.0% and 25.0%, respectively; NPV increased by 18.1% and 8.0%; and accuracy for PSAd increased by 13.0%. PI-RADS accuracy stayed the same Our results show that tissue metabolomic profiles could augment current MR-based imaging findings and histopathological evaluations of fusion biopsies for certain patient populations by more accurately characterizing them into clinically significant or insignificant subgroups. In our analyses, tissue metabolomics alone, or its combination with other clinical parameters, improved sensitivity and negative predictive values, as well as overall accuracy, for our testing cohort. This method, which relies on performing tissue MRS of needle biopsy cores prior to histopathologic analysis, causes no interruption to patient care. Findings from our study demonstrate the utility and translational potential of cancer metabolomics in personalized treatment for PCa and encourages the development of <i>in vivo<\/i> PCa metabolomic imaging to enhance the diagnostic utility of mpMRI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a9801424-eec2-4e73-b0f3-f9a37bd8e2a2\/@G03B8ZKD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-01 Application of molecular pathology in clinical prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Prostate-specific antigen (PSA),Metabolomics,Fusion genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13356"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leo L.

Women with TNBC, who constitute 15-20% of breast cancer patients, are often diagnosed with aggressive\/metastatic disease. Advanced studies implicated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in aggressive\/metastatic properties of TNBC subtype. Alternatively activated immature myeloid cells including tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN), tumor-associated dendritic cells (TADC) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) constitute a major component of TME. However, anti-tumorigenic microenvironment is also reported and that may have clinical relevance in early TNBC patients. Therefore, our hypothesis is that myeloid cells polarize to become immunosuppressive and infiltrate tumors and pre-metastatic niches in patients with advanced disease, while patients with early TNBCs may elicit anti-tumor immune response eliminating disseminated tumor cells (DTC). The utilization of syngeneic immunocompetent mouse models has contributed to our current understanding of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory TME. Using these models, we have demonstrated that tumor dissemination and growth at metastatic sites is facilitated by MDSC&#8217;s. Emerging technologies; single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), mass cytometry (CyTOF) or cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing (CITE-Seq) has been powerful platforms for detailed characterization of tumors and TME compartments. Our bulk gene expression data of the myeloid cell populations of tumor microenvironment, lung, spleen and BM from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice showed distinct MDSC gene signatures. When applied to publicly available scRNAseq data, lung gMDSCs from 4T1 metastatic tumor model appeared to show different trajectory of polarization than the tumor gMDSCs. Consistent with previous findings by Hedrick Lab, lung gMDSCs from 4T1 mice also express higher levels of NeP markers compared to BM and tumor gMDSCs as well as lung gMDSCs from EMT6 mice. However, analyses of immune cells from EMT6 tumor bearing mice exhibited an anti-tumor immune signature which is consistent with the clearance of the DTCs following complete resection of the primary tumors. Using the murine TNBC models in syngeneic mice, we provide evidence that early TNBC tumors may elicit anti-tumor immune responses and thus the survival outcome in those patients is substantially increased after complete surgical resection of the primary tumors. Whereas immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributes to the poor overall survival in patients with advanced TNBCs. Therefore, identifying an anti-tumor immune signature in early TNBC patients may be utilized as a clinical biomarker before surgical intervention as well as improve the survival outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6fa22b11-42e1-493b-86ad-7e4e39d2978d\/@G03B8ZKD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Proteomics,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13357"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fulya Alkan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raziye Piranlioglu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunmi Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Ouzounova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine C Hedrick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huidong Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hasan Korkaya<\/i><\/presenter>.

The ctDNA burden may change over time, decreasing after treatment response and increasing with development of resistance to therapy. Monitoring the dynamics of ctDNA burden over the course of treatment with a rapid, non-invasive test enables physicians to make timely treatment decisions. Using the DNA evaluation of fragments for early interception (DELFI) approach, we have developed the DELFI Monitoring Score (DMS) to longitudinally assess ctDNA burden during therapy of cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: We performed low coverage whole genome sequencing on 302 cfDNA libraries of 76 treatment-naive metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with at least one blood draw prior to and after treatment initiation. Mutations in KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF were independently measured by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for all timepoints evaluated. We trained a Bayesian regression model with the mutant allele fraction (MAF) of KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF as response and fragmentation-related features as predictors as well as a random intercept. To avoid overfitting and assess generalizability, we used cross-validation, wherein each patient&#8217;s samples were held out of the dataset and a model was trained on the samples of all other patients to generate predictions for the held-out samples. Patients with DMS below and above a detectability threshold at the first blood draw post-treatment (between 4-12 weeks) were classified as molecular responders and non-responders, respectively. Progression-free survival outcomes, defined as time to progression by RECIST 1.1 or death, were evaluated using a Kaplan-Meier estimator in these two groups.<br \/>Results: Molecular responders based on DMS assessment experienced longer progression-free survival than molecular non-responders (p &#60; 0.01), similar to a MAF-based approach. Additionally, in the 43 patients for whom the MAF of the KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF variants was 0% at the first blood draw post-treatment, we observed further separation on progression-free survival by the DELFI Monitoring Score (p = 0.014).<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a novel quantitative measure of ctDNA burden using cell-free DNA fragmentation patterns that is estimable from low coverage whole genome sequencing. The DMS appears to be useful for measuring ctDNA burden and enabling a non-invasive approach to treatment monitoring, as it distinguishes therapeutic responses in a mCRC cohort. Our ability to detect differences in progression-free survival among patients with undetectable ddPCR MAFs suggests that DMS may be more sensitive and predictive than conventional mutation-based approaches for treatment response monitoring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a34cb28-c392-4e2c-adea-8674b009b80b\/@G03B8ZKD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Liquid biopsies,Whole genome sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13359"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Keith Lumbard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurel A.

Cytologic evaluation of cyst fluid is widely-used but has poor sensitivity. We previously found that activity of the lysosomal serine protease tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) is associated with mucinous PCLs that harbor AN (AUC 0.72). We aimed to identify additional functional biomarkers that would improve performance of our classifier for dysplastic grade in mucinous PCLs.<br \/>Methods: We used a combination of global protease activity profiling and shotgun proteomics to identify differentiating markers between PCLs with low-grade dysplasia (LGD, n=3) and HGD (n=3). Candidate biomarkers were validated in an independent cohort of 28 clinically-annotated mucinous PCLs (HGD n=12, LGD n=16), by measuring both protein concentration (using ELISA) and enzymatic activity (using internally-quenched fluorescent substrates). We used a nested cross-validation approach to iteratively split our cohort into training and validation sets to predict HGD. Model accuracy was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.<br \/>Results: We identified 8 proteins that were highly abundant in mucinous PCLs with HGD. Among these were the inflammatory enzymes myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (ELANE), suggesting that differential activity levels could be exploited that would minimize fluid requirements and cost. Among 28 mucinous PCLs, a composite score that included both activity and mass of MPO performed the best for HGD in mucinous cysts (AUC 0.955, sensitivity 98%, specificity 93%). ELANE activity (AUC 0.76, sensitivity 69%, specificity 59%) and TPP1 activity (AUC 0.765, sensitivity 71%, specificity 74%) had modest performance.<br \/>Conclusions: Our functional biomarkers accurately classified HGD among mucinous cysts.

The USPSTF guidelines for lung cancer screening recommends annual screening for select current or former smokers over 50 years of age. While annual screening via low dose CT has been demonstrated to decrease lung cancer mortality, compliance with screening guidelines remains low. Additional prognostic tools for future lung cancer risk stratification, particularly those without immutable demographic and health history, may be beneficial in increasing screening compliance and monitoring changing risk across time.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Using modified-aptamer proteomics technology, SomaScan&#174; assay v4.0, we scanned ~5000 proteins in 6085 EDTA plasma samples from &#8220;Ever Smokers&#8221; (current or former smokers, aged 50-73) with no known prevalent cancer at visit 3 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, for a total of ~30 million protein measurements.

Many advances have been made in understanding how the age associated acquisition of point mutations and somatic structural variants (SSVs) in blood, termed Age-Related Clonal Hematopoiesis (ARCH), predispose individuals to hematological cancer or cardiovascular disease. Yet, ARCH is commonly observed in healthy individuals and our ability to predict who is at risk of progressing to disease remains limited. A previous study which integrated deep learning and population genetics methods to evaluate the complex interplay of selection on point mutations in deeply sequenced blood samples highlighted the role that negative selection plays in prevention progression to hematological cancer. Here, we interrogate the mutational and selective pressures within blood to better understand how the full spectrum of somatic changes within an individual impact clonal fitness and disease outcomes. We evaluate how selection shapes the prevalence of large somatic structural variation in blood sampled from 15,910 individuals across over 20 different genetic ancestries, including the Thousand Genomes Study and the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow&#8217;s Health study. Using dense genotyping arrays, we capture SSVs among 20 populations and find that ARCH attributed to somatic structural variation is three times as high as previously reported with up to 14% of individuals harbouring at least one large SSV in their blood. We estimate the rate at which SSVs accrue in blood cells and find that selection impacts the size and frequency of SSVs within individual blood populations. To determine the functional impact of clonal mutations on molecular phenotypes, we investigate the relationship between structural variation and the transcriptome. We show that gains, losses and copy number neutral variants impact gene expression distinctly, with stabilizing selection shaping the penetrance of copy number alterations in gene expression. Our work shows how different classes of selection shape clonal dynamics in blood thus enabling us to better understand why certain individuals are at a high risk of malignancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4dae6023-6bb8-4e1a-91a2-963156de15ef\/@y03B8ZKE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Predictive biomarkers,Cohort study,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13363"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kimberly Skead<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Soave<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie-Julie Fave<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vanessa Bruat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quaid Morris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Awadalla<\/i><\/presenter>.

During persistent infection, viral DNA integration into the host genome may occur, which is suggested to affect carcinogenesis. One of the most critical limitations of currently used HPV integration detection techniques (PCR-based or NGS-based) is their application to FFPE material, because of DNA fragmentation. The aim of this study was to assess HPV integration in HPV-positive HNSCC cell lines and FFPE tissue comparing the new Targeted Locus Amplification (TLA) technology with previously used PCR technology (APOT\/DIPS).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Seven HPV-positive cell lines and FFPE material of 10 HPV-positive HNSCC were used for HPV integration detection by TLA, a proximity ligation-based next-generation sequencing technique. Crosslinked DNA is digested with restriction enzymes, and re-ligated into chimeric DNA molecules. For cell lines, a PCR based HPV16 target enrichment is performed, and for FFPE material a capture-based target enrichment is performed for HPV16 and HPV18 sequences, both followed by Illumina sequencing.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> TLA was able to sequence up to 100 kb around the target, detecting exact HPV integration loci, structural variants, and chromosomal rearrangements. In all cell lines, one or more integration sites were identified, in accordance with APOT\/DIPS PCR data and the literature. In the FFPE tissue samples, TLA identified integrated HPV in 6 out of 10 tumors, with simple and complex integration patterns. In general, TLA confirmed PCR data and detected additional integration sites.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> TLA provides the opportunity for reliable and robust detection of HPV integration in HNSCC cell lines and FFPE tissue.

Most screening-based hrHPV tests involve pooled detection of any hrHPV type or of HPV 16\/18 only. Extended HPV genotyping, particularly of non-16\/18 hrHPV types, may improve risk stratification for millions of cervical abnormalities detected each year, but HPV genotype-specific progression risks are not well characterized. HPV genotype-specific incidence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or more severe (CIN2+) was examined among individuals with normal or low-grade (CIN1) histology following an abnormal screening cytology result.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>A US-based prospective, multiracial cohort of 343 colposcopy referral patients with normal (n=226) or CIN1 (n=117) histology was assessed. Baseline cervical samples underwent HPV DNA genotyping. Participants were followed for up to five years. Genotype-specific CIN2+ incidence rates (IR) were estimated with accelerated failure time models for interval-censored data. Cumulative CIN2+ risk over five years was estimated non-parametrically and compared for HPV risk groups (HPV 16\/31\/18, else HPV 33\/58\/52\/45, else HPV 39\/68\/35\/51\/59\/56\/66) and age groups (ages 21-24, 25-29, 30+).<br \/>Results: At enrollment, median participant age was 30.1 years; 67.1% were hrHPV-positive. During follow-up (median 24.3 months), 24 participants progressed to CIN2+ (7.0%; 6.2% among normal histology and 8.6% among CIN1). CIN2+ IR among hrHPV-positive participants was 3.2\/1,000 person-months. CIN2+ IRs were highest for HPV 16 (IR 8.3; 95% CI 4.1, 16.6), HPV 33 (IR 7.8; 95% CI 2.0, 31.3), and HPV 58 (IR 4.9; 95% CI 1.2, 19.6). IRs were highest for HPV 16, 68, and 33 among normal histology and for HPV 33, 31, 16, and 58 among CIN1. Five-year CIN2+ risks were 0.27 for HPV 16\/31\/18, 0.11 for HPV 33\/58\/52\/45, and 0.13 for HPV 39\/68\/35\/51\/59\/56\/66 (p=0.04). CIN2+ risk did not differ by age group.<br \/>Conclusion: In addition to the established HPV type 16, HPV 33 and 58 were consistently predictive of progression to CIN2+ over a five-year period in this cohort. These findings also support the utility of HPV risk groups to stratify women with non-16\/18 hrHPV positivity who exhibit differential risks of progression. Additionally, HPV risk groups appear to predict progression regardless of age; thus, although hrHPV testing is not recommended for initial screening of women under 30 years of age, it may be a risk-stratification tool for these younger women, once a cervical abnormality is found. In conclusion, extended genotyping of non-16\/18 hrHPV may be useful to identify individuals with normal or low-grade histology results who are at increased risk of progression to CIN2+, thereby improving the efficacy of cervical cancer screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/adf9f36a-a963-402f-b328-e1b4bed2efd9\/@y03B8ZKE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Screening,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13367"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexandra Bukowski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cathrine Hoyo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael G.

Exosomes derived from tumors could provide a non-invasive way to diagnose cancer, assess cancer progression, and track treatment responses. However, exosome analysis would be aided by new molecular methods, which would speed up basic and clinical exosome research. Exosome research is rapidly advancing, providing new insights into the physiological role of exosomes and their significant link to human health. Although tumor-derived exosomes have been shown to be promising biomarkers for cancer detection and disease progression due to their inherited biological contents from the parent cancer cells and unique roles in tumor metastasis and invasion, rapid and effective isolation from complex biological samples and high-precision real-time analysis remains a difficult task. In this work, we present a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platform for integrating multiple hepatocellular carcinoma exosomes conventional method to read different peak positions and amplitudes of spectrum, whole SERS spectra of exosomes were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). In addition, label-free analysis of purified exosomes from normal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma were clearly distinguished from normal cell derived exosomes by 96.4% sensitivity and 98.2% specificity using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) . In this study, the possibility of using exosomes as biomarkers for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was discussed. From this study, SERS can serve as a valuable tool for separating exogenous subpopulations and can be used to characterize exosomes for cancer diagnosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c2221f51-a4e4-43ce-b321-1564518f19e0\/@y03B8ZKE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Hepatocellular carcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13369"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ola Sayed Ahmed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hisham Imam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdel Rahman Zekri<\/i><\/presenter>. cancer national institute -Cairo university, Cairo, Egypt, niles national institute- Cairo university, Cairo, Egypt, cancer national institute-Cairo university, Cairo, Egypt","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5564eeec-f0ae-4f05-8431-639f9df0811a","ControlNumber":"5325","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>O.

We used antibody combinations comprising 1 capture antibody and 2 oligonucleotide-tagged detection antibodies, recognizing 1, 2 or 3 unique biomarkers. We evaluated this approach by testing plasma samples from early stage I\/II lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients (15 smokers, 19 non-smokers), late stage III\/IV LUAD patients (16 smokers, 18 non-smokers), and healthy donors (34 smokers, 33 non-smokers). Samples were from one vendor, processed using a standardized protocol. LUAD samples were sourced from a cancer research center and healthy samples from a primary care facility. PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were generated for each combination and data was evaluated using univariate analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Combinations recognizing 3 biomarkers were better in detecting all stages of LUAD (AUC=0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.90), as compared to combinations recognizing 2 biomarkers (AUC=0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80) or 1 biomarker (AUC=0.50, 95% CI 0.35-0.55), demonstrating greater accuracy with an increasing number of co-localized biomarkers. In detecting LUAD (all stages) at a specificity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.69-0.88), sensitivity improved as the number of co-localized biomarkers increased from 1 (0.08, 95% CI 0.03-0.18) to 2 (0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.72) to 3 (0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.86). In detecting early stage I\/II LUAD, the most effective combination used 3 biomarkers (STn, MUC1, CEACAM6) and had a sensitivity of 0.56 (95% CI 0.38-0.73).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These preliminary data highlight the potential of detecting biomarkers co-localized on the surface of single EVs as an effective tool for early stage LC detection, and the benefit of using 3 biomarkers simultaneously. Despite inherent challenges associated with commercial samples, our finding that detection of co-localized EV surface biomarkers distinguished LUAD is promising. Additional studies with LC cohorts beyond LUAD are underway to refine combinations and independently validate our assay for early stage LC detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9c6ef845-0f89-458c-9d16-88d1f0dbb683\/@y03B8ZKE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Biomarkers,Screening,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13371"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel P.

Early-stage LC are small and hard to distinguish from benign nodules. Patients are often infirm, increasing biopsy risks. Monitoring for LC progression, recurrence or second primaries are further challenges. CTCs recovered from blood sample is non-invasive, easily repeatable across the clinical course of disease treatment and progression. Unlike cell-free nucleic acid profiles, CTC is mutation agnostic.<br \/>Aims\/Methods:<b> <\/b>Pilot test of a Carbon-nanotube (CNT) platform on capturing suspected LC cells across a range of stages\/cell types.51 &#8220;normal controls&#8221; recruited to balance cancer: benign cases and to test specificity. Study period 1\/2020 - 8\/2021Procedure details per Loeian M Lab on a Chip 2019;11:1899. 16 ml of whole blood was lysed, nucleated cells cultured for 48 hours on a CNT coated surface. Cells were fixed, stained with CK7\/8\/18\/pancytokeratinAE1\/2 epithelial markers (CTC), CD45(WBC), nuclear DAPI control. A sample is considered CTC positive if 1 or more CD45- \/CK+ cells are found.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>142 subjects were recruited from four clinical sites. 18 samples were non-analyzable due to shipping and preanalytical error.43 of 56 cancers had pathologic staging: 30% I, 16% II, 35% III, 19% IV.CTCs were found in 77% of LC samples (sensitivity), specificity 94%, Positive Predictive Value 92% and Negative Predictive Value 83%.Even in Stages I\/II patients, 75% were found to have CTCs. The number of CTC found varied by patient, (range 0-31).<br \/>Conclusion: CNT adherence enables antigen independent capture of live, viable LC CTCs from whole blood with high specificity and PPV. Planned inclusion of additional CTC markers should improve the detection of other classes of CTCs. High specificity and PPV identify this as a useful &#8220;rule-in&#8221; test to pursue downstream testing to confirm early LC diagnosis or follow-up surveillance for recurrence.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{74150842-4929-4C53-A109-3A3C5241DCBB}\"><caption>Table 1 Performance of SS-CNT in capturing CTCs<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Test Result<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tissue Positive Cancer<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tissue Negative Cancer or Control<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CNT Test +<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">True Pos (TP) 43<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">False Pos (FP) 4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CNT Test -<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">False Neg (FN) 13<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">True Neg (TN) 64<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">77<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">56<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">68<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">124<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Test Performance<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 or more CTC as positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sensitivity<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TP\/(TP + FN)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">76.80%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Specificity<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TN\/(TN + FP)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">94.10%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive Predictive Value PPV<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TP\/(TP + FP) Rule-in<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">91.50%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative Predictive Value NPV<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TN\/(TN + FN) Rule- out<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">83.10%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/322fddb7-8141-41aa-ae9c-00ad941e3273\/@y03B8ZKE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Carbon Nano Tube (CNT),Biomarker,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13375"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rex Chin-Wei Yung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Connor Tyree<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashlee Colbert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ganesh Krishna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rakesh Mehta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Moja<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Fox<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeff Allard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Connelly<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, clinicians are still faced with significant uncertainty when considering whether to avoid or to proceed to systematic biopsies in a man with negative MRI (nMRI). When making such an informed decision, information on the risk of subsequent csPCa diagnosis after nMRI in respect to risk of csPCa in general population may be beneficial.<br \/>Hence, our objective was to compare incidence rate (IR) of csPCa and overdiagnosis rate (diagnosis of ISUP grade group 1 cancer, isPCa) after nMRI (PI-RADS 1-2) to outcomes in general population, and to assess the value of age and PSA-density in stratification.<br \/>We utilized institutional and national registries to retrospectively identify 1,685 50-79-year-old PCa-free men who underwent a primary nMRI at our institution, of whom 906 men had PSA-D &#60; 0.15 ng\/ml\/cm<sup>3<\/sup>. We compared the IR of csPCa and overdiagnosis rate in relation to general population (n=230,246) during follow-up (up to four years) under clinical routine since December 2015 (PIRADS v2 era).<br \/>We calculated age-standardized IR ratios (IRR) of csPCa and odds ratios (OR) of overdiagnosis with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) as age-pooled and among 10-year interval groups (50-59, 60-69 and 70-79 years).<br \/>Follow-up times in general population cohort, nMRI cohort, and nMRI and low PSA-D cohort were 885,792, 3,363, and 1,821 years and IRs of csPCa were 406, 2,201, and 989 per 100,000 person years. In reference to general population, IRR of csPCa in nMRI cohort was 4.2 (95% CI 3.3-5.4) which reduced to 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.9) if PSA-D was &#60; 0.15 ng\/ml\/cm<sup>3<\/sup>. ORs of isPCa were 3.0 (95% CI 2.0-4.6) and 4.6 (95% CI 2.2-9.5), respectively. IRRs of csPCa of 50-59, 60-69 and 70-79-year-old men were 14.1 (95% CI 10.5-25.4), 3.2 (95% CI 2.1-4.6) and 3.4 (95% CI 1.6-3.9).<br \/>Limitations of this study include retrospective and registry-based design.<br \/>In conclusion, the risk of subsequent csPCa after nMRI in young men is significant, when compared to population risk. However, with advancing age, these risks converge. For a subgroup of men with PSA-D &#60; 0.15 ng\/ml\/cm<sup>3<\/sup>, the relative risk of csPCa is low in all age groups and comparable to population risk. At the same time, the risk of overdiagnosis after nMRI is substantially higher than in general population. In light of our results, elderly men with nMRI and men at all age groups with nMRI and PSA-D &#60; 0.15 ng\/ml\/cm<sup>3 <\/sup>could be considered candidates for follow-up instead of systematic biopsy.<br \/>References:<br \/>1.

With new developments in cancer screening, including multi-cancer early detection tests, it is important and timely to understand the overall cancer burden in populations outside those traditionally targeted for single-cancer screenings. Thus, we sought to identify the most important risk factors for developing any invasive cancer, and to calculate associated 5-year absolute risks, with a particular focus on persons under age 50 years.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Two large American Cancer Society cohorts followed prospectively for cancer, the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-IINC) enrolled from 1992-1993 and Cancer Prevention Study 3 (CPS-3) enrolled from 2006-2013, were used to examine a broad range of cancer risk factors. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between potential risk factors and subsequent overall risk of any invasive cancer. The Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimation tool used these HRs to estimate absolute risk in 5-year age groups.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 15,226 cancers were identified among 429,991 participants within 5 years of follow-up. Several risk factors including smoking history, obesity, alcohol, family history of cancer, and various chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) were associated with a higher risk of cancer. Persons above age 50 years, regardless of other risk factors considered, had at least 2% absolute risk per 5 years. Among persons under age 50 years, smoking status was the most important factor differentiating risk. For men under age 50, absolute risk of any cancer did not exceed 2% except for men ages 45-49 years who currently smoke or recently quit (within 30 years). For women under age 50, absolute risk exceeded 2% starting at age 35-39 years for current or recent former smokers, and all women, even long-term nonsmokers, at age 45-49 had over 2% absolute risk.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Smoking history is important in differentiating absolute risk of any cancer in adults under age 50 years.

Many studies have identified risk factors for pancreatic cancer, nevertheless, there have been few combined risk factor models developed for the UK specific population. Due to the high incidence with a poor survival rate together with the potential high preventable rate, it is important to establish an accessible predictive risk factor model for identifying potential high-risk populations.<br \/>Study aim: To establish a pancreatic cancer risk prediction model by integrating the current risk factors together with established genomic biomarkers.<br \/>Method:Using data from the UK biobank we have investigated the role of established and suggested risk factors for pancreatic cancer. The established risk factors include age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes and pancreatitis. We also calculate the added prediction from the current polygenic risk score (PRS) to evaluate the risk for genetic predisposition. Last, we utilise the multivariate logistic regression models to establish a novel risk model by integrating the well-known risk factors such as cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, increased BMI, chronic pancreatitis, diabetics, some germline mutation, and our new evaluated PRS and biological clocks.<br \/>Results: We will present the performance of the novel integrated model which will be useful for use in primary care to identify the at-risk population. This will assist in the promotion of prevention recommendations and for future health check follow-up.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f5ee16d-583b-4c7b-a205-c65df1f800b8\/@y03B8ZKE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Prevention,Predictive biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13707"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Temin Ke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Artitaya Lophatananon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Muir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinzhu Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

This is based on data from multiple studies demonstrating an approximately 7% cancer detection rate on baseline screening. However, the rate of actionable findings and malignancies on initial versus subsequent screenings has yet to be compared in a patient cohort.<br \/>Patients and Methods: We identified 68 adult LFS patients in a single institutional cohort that received more than one full body MRI (including brain MRI). For each screening instance, findings and subsequent recommended interventions (immediate and short-term imaging, biopsy, and\/or surgery) were recorded. Invasive interventions (biopsy and\/or surgery) were denoted with free text describing pathology results. We analyzed findings on initial versus subsequent scans.<br \/>Results: There were 258 instances of whole-body MRI screenings performed in 68 patients (28% male, 72% female) in the cohort. The mean number of screenings per patient analyzed was 3.8&#177;1.9 over 3.3&#177;2.4 years. Among 68 initial screenings, 26 (38.2%) required follow-up imaging or invasive intervention. Among 190 subsequent screenings, the follow-up intervention rate was significantly lower (n=36, 18.9%, p=0.0026). Eleven screenings (5.8%) required invasive follow-up (biopsy or surgery); two (3% of patients) were from an initial screening and nine (13% of patients) were from a subsequent screening. From these interventions, we identified six total cancers in five patients amongst the cohort (7% of patients), with two cancers (3% of patients) being identified on the first screening and four (6% of patients) being identified on a subsequent screening.<br \/>Conclusion: Cancer detection rates were similar between initial and subsequent whole-body MRI screenings in LFS patients. Follow-up interventions decreased significantly on subsequent screenings compared to the initial screen. These findings may be useful in counseling of LFS patients initiating a screening program. Limitations of this study include lack of inclusion of other screening modalities in the analysis, short follow-up duration, and loss to follow-up. Further studies involving a larger cohort with longer-term follow-up are needed to fully determine the impact of long-term whole-body MRI screening in LFS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6b0ffa17-d87d-40f4-a1ec-6c906baaaf74\/@y03B8ZKE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,Screening,TP53,Cancer genetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13708"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yun K.

A mixture cure model divides cancer cases into two populations: one where cancer is likely to severely impact mortality (not-cured) and one where long-term survival with low risk is possible (cured). Previous work on such models has concentrated on estimating cure for either many cancer types without regard to stage (public health arena), or single cancers by stage at diagnosis (screening arena). A gap in the current literature is an estimation of likelihood of cure in many cancer types at all stages.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We estimate a mixture-cure model for all stages simultaneously for stageable cancers using the fact that cancer is a progressive disease (worse by stage) as a constraint on model parameters. We applied this estimation procedure to 21 cancer classes with standard American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging using 12 years of cancer-specific survival data in 50-79 year old individuals using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program data from 2006-2015 followed to 2018. For each stage, we recover the fraction of those cured (&#8220;cure fraction&#8221;, i.e., long-term survivors with minimal excess hazard) and not-cured (severe acute mortality due to cancer, modeled as a Weibull distribution).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Cure fractions varied between cancer classes. Two important types of cancer behavior are illustrated by colorectal and gallbladder cancers. Colorectal cancer had a good potential for cure at any stage <b>before<\/b> metastasis, with a precipitous drop from 63% (95% CI: 62-64%) cure at stage III to 7% (6-7%) cure at stage IV. In contrast, gallbladder cancer exhibited a systematic decrease at each stage, with 47% (43-52%) cure fraction at stage I, 22% (20-24%) at stage II, 20% (17-22%) at stage III, and 2% (2-3%) at stage IV. Differences in 5-year survival between earlier stages and metastasis were highly correlated to differences in cure fraction (r^2=0.97), suggesting differences in 5-year survival are a proxy for differences in cure.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Long-term survivors were evident at early stages for all 21 cancer types examined. These survival fractions were all greatly reduced by the time cancer reached metastasis. This indicates early-stage cancers do not differ from late-stage cancers simply by lead time and provides statistical evidence that detection of cancer in early stages may result in long-term survival for many stageable cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5e94e458-5c9e-4052-8cff-8605df543eb3\/@z03B8ZKF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Cancer detection,Screening,SEER,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13712"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Earl Hubbell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Clarke<\/i><\/presenter>.

Four scenarios were examined: two cancer interception and two cancer prevention + interception. Individuals were screened from age 45 to 75. CRC IR and MR outcomes compared to no screening were aggregated from age 40 until death. Threshold analysis identified the &#8805;10mm adenoma sensitivity needed for a base case cancer interception test to yield CRC MR equivalent to a near-perfect cancer interception test (#2).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The base case scenario (#1) resulted in 15.0% CRC IR and 34.2% MR compared to 14.7% CRC IR and 38.3% MR for the near-perfect interception scenario (#2). In the threshold analysis, a modified base case cancer interception test (#5) yielded MR equivalent to a near-perfect interception test (#2) when &#8805;10mm adenoma sensitivity was increased from 1% to 1.94%. Due to adenoma detection, the cancer prevention + interception scenarios (#3, #4) resulted in outcomes more than twice as favorable as either cancer interception scenario.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This analysis highlights that even small improvements in the detection of precancerous lesions for certain cancers (e.g., adenomas for CRC), which enable cancer prevention, can yield clinical benefits that meaningfully exceed those from tests that primarily detect cancer.

The ANCHOR study showed that treating high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) significantly reduces anal cancer incidence. Limited research has been done to understand the validity and associated costs of screening tools used to detect anal lesions in Hispanic populations. We aimed to evaluate the clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]) and screening test costs in the clinic-based sample. Understanding the accuracy and costs of screening tools can guide interventions in resource-limited settings to broaden the availability of effective, low-cost screening options and promote anal cancer prevention.<br \/>Methods: The cross-sectionally analyzed data was collected (May 2015 - June 2021) by the Anal Neoplasia Clinic of the University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center. The clinic predominantly serves referred adults (&#8805;18 years old). Patients were included in the analyses if they had complete results for anal cytology, high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) with biopsy, and anal high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) typing (n=436). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were estimated to evaluate the clinical performance of anal cytology alone and in combination with HR-HPV typing in the detection of histologically confirmed anal HSIL (Gold standard). Analyses were stratified by risk group (women, MSM, and heterosexual men) and HIV status. Evaluation of cost-effective alternative screening strategies is currently ongoing.<br \/>Results: The mean age of our sample was 44 &#177; 13 years; more than half (67%) were male. HIV-infected MSM, HIV-infected women, and HIV-negative MSM comprised 45.4%, 22.2%, 13.3% of our sample, respectively. 40% of the sample had HSIL and 69% tested positive for HR-HPV. Measured against the gold standard, we found that co-testing (anal cytology and HR-HPV typing) increased the sensitivity in the groups evaluated and decreased specificity in some. Among HIV-infected MSM, the sensitivity of anal cytology alone to detect HSIL was 84.7%, whereas specificity was 30.0%. Although the sensitivity of the 2 tests combined (anal cytology and HR-HPV typing) to detect histologically confirmed HSIL increased (91.8%), the specificity decreased (22.0%). Overall, the sensitivity of cytology alone was higher in women compared to men and among PLWH compared to HIV-negative individuals.<br \/>Conclusion: While higher sensitivity for HSIL detection was seen for cytology alone for women and HIV-infected populations, co-testing increased the sensitivity for HSILs detection. Understanding the accuracy and cost of screening tools can guide interventions to broaden the availability of effective, low-cost screening options and promote anal cancer prevention. Access and availability of these tools in a wide context of communities must be considered.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e27dbc4-37bf-4305-aa19-1e94486e0c46\/@z03B8ZKF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hispanic,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Anal cancer,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13714"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kandyce G.

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is a well-established procedure for lung cancer screening in academic medical centers, but few local community oncology centers utilize this technology. Highlands Oncology Group (HOG), located in Northwest Arkansas (NWA), took the initiative to bring LDCT screening to a non-academic medical center and provide routine LDCT screening to a rural population. The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefits of free LDCT screening at a community oncology clinic.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The study compared for-fee and free periods of LDCT screening at HOG and their impact on identifying cancer in NWA. The study population was patients in HOG&#8217;s catchment area who fell into the risk categories set by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology to be eligible for screening between March 2013 and February 2020.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 5,402 eligible participants enrolled in the study. During ten months of for-fee screening (n=60), 3.3% of patients diagnosed had Stage I lung cancer, and 1.7% were diagnosed with Stages II-IV. During the first ten months of free screening (n=729), 3% of patients were diagnosed with Stage I lung cancer, 1.8% were diagnosed with Stages II-IV, and 1.1% were diagnosed with other cancers. Over the entire program until February 2020 (n=5,402), a total of 76 patients were diagnosed with Stage I lung cancer, 52 were diagnosed with Stage II-IV, and 35 were diagnosed with other cancers.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The result of this study suggests that eligible patients are more receptive to free lung cancer screening, even though most insurance coverage does not have a required co-pay for eligible patients. We also observed an increased diagnosis rate for early-stage lung cancers due to increased patient influx with free LDCT screening. The state central registry data showed a decline in distant lung cancer after the free LDCT screening offered in the northwestern counties in the HOG catchment area. At the same time, no such trend is visible for the entire state, suggesting a stage shift in lung cancer due to free LDCT screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c993794a-137e-40b7-a27a-cdb2f7bc6aa2\/@z03B8ZKF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Screening,LDCT,Rural,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13715"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Edgar T.

A blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test is available for use as a complement to existing single cancer screening modalities, however experience deploying such tests is limited. PATHFINDER (NCT04241796; enrollment complete, n=6662) is an ongoing prospective study in asymptomatic adults &#8805;50 y that returns MCED test results (&#8216;signal not detected&#8217; or &#8216;signal detected&#8217;) with &#8805;1 cancer signal origin (CSO) prediction to direct diagnostic workup. To better understand challenges and opportunities following a signal detected result, GI case studies are presented.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Participants who were confirmed with a new Clinical Stage I\/II GI cancer from the interim PATHFINDER data set (data cutoff Mar-19-2021) were included. Data were reviewed, and key diagnostic steps from signal detected (Day 1) to resolution were summarized.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Individual 1 was a female &#62;60 y without additional cancer risk factors (CSO=Colon\/Rectum, Upper GI Tract). CT abdomen was performed, followed by colonoscopy then upper endoscopy. A 4.0 cm mass identified was further evaluated via endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy and confirmed a Clinical Stage I duodenal adenocarcinoma (Day 60), which was treated with surgery (Pathologic Stage III) and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patient tolerated the treatment and remains disease free. Individual 2 was a male former smoker &#62;65 y with a history of hepatitis C (CSO=Liver\/Bile-duct); CT confirmed cirrhotic liver with 6.4cm LI-RADS 5 mass at Day 57 (Clinical Stage Ib). Treatment was declined following surgical referral and participant died &#60;9 months post-test result. Individual 3 was a male former smoker &#62;70 y (CSO=Pancreas\/Gallbladder, Lung). Work-up included metabolic panel, CA19-9, CT abdomen and chest, and PET-CT. A CT-guided core biopsy confirmed diagnosis of a Clinical Stage IIb resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma on Day 38; surgery (Pathologic Stage IIa) and adjuvant chemotherapy followed; patient is disease free to date.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The MCED test detected cancer signals and predicted a GI CSO for three individuals with Clinical Stage I or II GI cancers for which there is currently no single early cancer screening method.

Given the aggressiveness of PDAC, the window of opportunity for GT is short and often overshadowed by treatment initiation and other clinical milestones. Thus, there is an unmet need for a model that streamlines GT and makes it available to a wider audience in a rapid fashion. Moreover, in pandemic times, video-based alternatives for medical care are increasingly relevant.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We implemented a novel care delivery model in which a seven-minute educational video describing the benefits, risks, and implications of GT was shown to PDAC patients. The video was shown in lieu of an initial consult with a genetic counselor. Only patients who had not undergone GT or previously met with a genetic counselor were included. After watching the video, patients could elect to pursue GT and get tested on-side or remotely (at home). Genetic counselors disclosed results and provided post-test counseling by phone. Clinical and germline data were collected through medical records on a cohort of PDAC patients seen at the Gastrointestinal Center-MD Anderson during a 2-year enrollment period (May 2019-July 2021), which included the COVID-19 pandemic period.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 286 PDAC patients watched the educational video. From 175 patients that watched the video pre-pandemic, 12 declined testing, whereas in the post-pandemic period, none of the 111 patients declined testing (6.9% vs 0%; p&#60;0.004). We excluded data from 29 patients who elected to undergo GT but declined to participate in the registry. From the 241 patients with successfully collected samples, 21 patients (8.7%) had a pathogenic variant (PV), 38 patients (15.8%) had a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS), and 182 patients (75.5%) tested negative. The pathogenic variants detected included: <i>BRCA2<\/i> (most frequent), <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>BRCA1<\/i>, <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, <i>PALB2<\/i> and <i>APC<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> GT can have tremendously beneficial effects, such as qualifying for targeted treatment options and facilitating cancer prevention in probands&#8217; at-risk family members. Comparing uptake of GT pre- versus post-pandemic suggests that patients were more willing to trust information from a video platform, likely due to the global effect of living in a &#8220;virtual&#8220; society as a result of the pandemic. We suggest an approach in which every PDAC patient is shown a genetics educational video and given the choice to undergo GT and post-result counseling, greatly reducing the burden on genetic counselors. We report here the feasibility of implementing video-based germline testing in PDAC patients which resulted in unexpectedly high uptake levels, particularly post-pandemic. Further investigations are needed to explore the feasibility of a fully remote GT model in diverse populations to assess additional barriers to universal GT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0233aae2-3d16-4f80-81c9-ffaa4acc0a7d\/@z03B8ZKF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-02 Cancer prevention and early detection during the COVID-19 pandemic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Cancer genetics,Pancreatic cancer,Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21197"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Saumya Kasliwal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seyda Baydogan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Devon Harrison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Hurd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maureen Mork<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anirban Maitra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florencia McAllister<\/i><\/presenter>.
