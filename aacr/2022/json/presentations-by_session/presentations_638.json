[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) have been attributed to the recent increased incidence of thyroid cancer. Although indolent, a subset of PTMC could potentially develop distant metastasis (DM). This study aimed to evaluate the clinico-pathological features and molecular characteristics of PTMC and identify the risk factors for DM in PTMC patients from Middle Eastern ethnicity.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We retrospectively analyzed 210 patients with histologically confirmed PTMC. Clinico-pathological associations for DM, <i>BRAF<\/i> mutation and <i>TERT<\/i> mutation were analyzed successfully in 184 patients. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among the PTMC patients included in this cohort, DM was noted in 6.0%(11\/184), whereas tumor relapse occurred in 29\/184 (15.8%). Of the 11 cases with DM, lung metastasis occurred in 8 cases, bone metastasis in 2 cases and brain metastasis in 1 case. Presence of extrathyroidal extension and older age were significantly associated with DM. Molecular analysis showed <i>BRAF V600E<\/i> mutations to be the most frequent, being detected in 45.7% (84\/184). <i>TERT<\/i> promoter mutations were detected in 16 (8.7%) cases and were significantly associated with DM and shorter metastasis-free survival in multivariate analysis.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our study indicates a surprisingly high frequency of <i>TERT<\/i> promoter mutation in Saudi patients with PTMC. Identifying <i>TERT<\/i> promoter mutations as an independent predictor of DM in patients with microcarcinoma could explain the inherent aggressive nature of PTMC from Middle Eastern ethnicity and magnify its role in patient risk stratification, which might help in improving therapeutic strategy for these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/571de8b2-df24-42e8-87d2-caa79fd4455f\/@t03B8ZV3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-01 Endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma,TERT promoter mutations,Distant metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17609"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Saeeda Omer Ahmed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdul K.

However, in vitro experiments suggested that these therapies could be beneficial for inflammatory breast cancer, the most aggressive type of breast cancer. For this reason, the aim of this study is to determine why these therapies had poor effectiveness on TNBC. To this purpose, we evaluated the efficacy of Dutasteride (a 5&#945;-Reductase inhibitor) and Anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) in three TNBC cell lines, SUM-149, SUM-159 and MDA-MD-231; and another no TNBC cell line, MCF-7. Sensitivity, proliferation and hormone secretion of estrone sulfate (E1SO4), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and dehydrotestosterone (DHT) was performed. Firstly, it was realized a sensitivity assay for determinate the half-maximal effective concentration (EC-50) of the two compounds <i>in vitro<\/i>. The results obtained from this aasay revealed an effective concentration of 1&#956;M for each compound. Then, a cell proliferation assay was performed. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates with 1&#956;M concentration of Dutasteride and Anastrozole for 24h. After, media was collected in order to determine hormone secretion of E1SO4, E2, T and DHT by an amplified enzymeimmunoassay. Our results revealed a significant reduction of 50% approximately in the TNBC cell lines for both treatments, except in MDA-231, which was more resistant, decreasing its proliferation in approximately 20%. However, the MCF-7 cell line had increased around 20% its proliferation. Regarding hormonal secretion, Dutasteride and Anastrozole treatments promoted a significant increase in T and DHT levels in TNBC cell lines while in MCF-7 a significant decreased was observed. Therefore, the increased on androgen secretion is related with the anti-proliferative effects of Dutasteride and Anastrozole in TNBC cell lines. However, both treatments also resulted in an increased on E1SO4 and E2 levels in all cell lines, being this increase greater in MCF-7. Therefore, although endocrine therapies could be effective in <i>in vitro<\/i> conditions, cells would be able to secret estrogens in order to survive and proliferate and limiting the effectiveness of these treatments. In conclusion, dutasteride and anstrozole promote a reduction in cell proliferation by increasing the secreted levels of androgens. The combination of these treatments with potent inhibitors of estrogen secretion may result in a promising treatment for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7b534d5-6939-48e8-96fa-504c44b39f96\/@t03B8ZV3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-04 Hormone signaling and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Anastrozole,dutasteride,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18539"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara Caceres<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Belen Crespo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Alonso-Diez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gema Silvan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josefina M.

Second generation antiandrogens such as abiraterone acetate have improved the survival of prostate cancer patients, however, resistance remains a problem and patients with PTEN-deficient tumors have poorer outcomes to abiraterone treatments. Moreover, PTEN-deficient tumors are also characterized with immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. In this study we investigate the benefit of adding capivasertib, a potent pan-Akt inhibitor, to abiraterone therapy in a preclinical model of <i>Pten<\/i>-deficient prostate cancer and examine the antitumor efficacy and its influence on antitumor immunity. The temporal effects of abiraterone and capivasertib alone and as combination therapy were evaluated after one and four weeks of dosing in conditional transgenic mice harboring <i>Pten<\/i>-deficient prostate tumors. While abiraterone therapy alone reduced genitourinary tract weights, which contain both AR-sensitive normal accessory sex organs and prostate tumor, the treatment had no overall effect on prostate tumor burden. Mice treated with capivasertib monotherapy experienced tumor burden reductions of 8.2% and 15.6% at week 1 and 8, respectively, moreover, the treatment combination of abiraterone + capivasertib significantly improved the therapeutic effect with tumor burden reductions of 35.6% and 37.8% at weeks 1 and 4, respectively versus vehicle control. qRT-PCR analysis of <i>Ar<\/i> target genes showed decreased expression in mice treated with abiraterone. All treatment combinations showed increased gene expression levels of <i>Casp3 <\/i>in tumors from mice at week one but were greatest in those treated with abiraterone alone or in combination and increased expression levels were sustained only in the combination cohort at week four. Immunological profiling of tumors from mice treated with abiraterone + capivasertib using qRT-PCR-based panel of immune-related genes revealed enrichments in genes associated with phagocytosis, antigen processing and dendritic cell function. Examination of the tumor draining lymph nodes by flow cytometric analysis showed ~1.5-fold-increases in the abundance of migratory dendritic cells (CD11b+\\CD11c+\\XCR1+) in all pharmacologically treated mice (versus vehicle control) and remained elevated only in mice receiving capivasertib as monotherapy or combination at week four. Additionally, mice treated with combination therapy also had enrichments in genes sets associated to T cell, NK cell and as well as T cell activation, cytotoxicity, and interferon gamma signature. The findings from this study provide preclinical evidence for the efficacy of combination therapy with abiraterone plus capivasertib and provides insights into its immunomodulatory effects and influence on antitumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/221cbcb7-e2d2-4d80-abcb-bbb599cc4494\/@t03B8ZV3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-08 Preclinical studies of endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Akt,Combination therapy,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18540"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marco A.

Gli is recognized as the mediator of activeHedgehog (Hh) signaling and plays an important role in cell development and growth. Gli activity isregulated by a post-translational proteolytic process that is suppressed by Hedgehog signaling.Previously we found that in prostate cancer, the ligand activated androgen receptor [AR] recognizes andbinds to Gli proteins at their<i> Protein Processing Domains.<\/i> This binding stabilizes Gli proteins in their un-proteolyzed active form and bypasses the Hedgehog signaling, thus promoting cancer progressionthrough non-canonical activation of Gli proteins. Due to the high similarity between AR and ER, wehypothesized that a similar Gli regulation could play a role in Breast Cancer (BrCA) progression. We thustested the ability of human ER-&#945; to bind and activate Gli in BrCa and evaluated the role of this pathwayin tumor cell growth.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> we measured Gli activity in 293T and BrCa cells (MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-453) in presence andabsence of steroid ligand using Gli-luciferase reporter assay.

The splice variants of AR (ARVs); notably full-length AR (AR-fl) of ~110 kDa and a C-terminally Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) truncated AR isoform (AR-V7) of ~67 kDa are present in a variety of tissues. The ligand-independent AR-V7 is constitutively expressed and confers castration resistance in prostate cancer. With the irrefutable role of ARVs in BrCa, we evaluated their expression profile in cell lines with their prevalence and clinicopathological correlation in BrCa patients from India.<br \/>Methods: Breast Cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and MDA-MB-453 were procured from American Type Culture Collection. Thirty-eight <i>de novo<\/i> cases of Breast Cancer undergoing surgical intervention at a tertiary healthcare center in India were recruited. Tumor and adjacent benign tissue were collected after informed consent. The ARVs expression at transcriptomic and proteomic levels was evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blotting &#38; Immunohistochemistry (IHC) respectively. For functional annotation, ARVs were knocked down <i>in vitro<\/i> using differently targeting siRNAs facilitated by Lipofectamine 3000 based transfection. There was a strong complementarity observed in western blotting and IHC.<br \/>Results: All the ARVs were significantly higher in MDA-MB-453 followed by MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The expression ratio of AR-V7 versus AR-fl is, however, elevated in highly aggressive TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. 67% of patients recruited were immunostained positive for AR (n=38). A majority of patients were of Luminal phenotype (37%) expressing both the prominent ARVs. One-third of the TNBC fraction were AR positive. Following the TNBC cell line, a subset of patients' samples also exhibited a substantial upregulation of AR-V7 compared to AR-fl. These patients had poor prognoses and aggressive features. The siRNA knockdown of all the ARVs resulted in decreased invasion and Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly knocking down of ARVs barring AR-V7, restored invasiveness suggesting the compensatory behavior of AR-V7.<br \/>Conclusion: Our work demonstrates the presence of ARVs in BrCa with a particular focus on the AR-V7. The LBD truncated AR-V7 potentiates the growth in BrCa cell lines and patients. This study further encourages the ARVs expression screening with AR positive BrCa for a prognostic biomarker of aggressive phenotype and therapeutic resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6f3fd344-7c58-4e2b-81bb-99981b30cf8a\/@u03B8ZV4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-03 Hormone receptors and diagnosis\/prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Androgen receptor,Splice variants,Prognostic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21714"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tryambak Pratap Srivastava<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruby Dhar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anurag Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>SVS Deo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajinder Parshad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhradip Karmakar<\/i><\/presenter>.
