[{"Abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a set of heterogeneous myeloid malignancies hallmarked by mutations in epigenetic modifiers, transcription factors, and kinases that can cause epigenetic reshaping. It is unclear to what extent AML mutations drive chromatin 3D structure alteration and contribute to myeloid transformation. We first performed Hi-C and whole-genome sequencing in 25 AML patient samples and seven healthy donor samples, and identified recurrent alterations of A\/B compartments, TADs, and chromatin loops that are unique to different subtypes. To investigate how altered chromatin organization contributes to transcriptional misregulation, we performed RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq and CUT&#38;ag for CTCF, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 in the same AML samples. We identified extensive and recurrent AML-specific promoter-enhancer and promoter-repressor loops. We performed both CRISPR deletion and interference experiments and validated two repressor loops that downregulated cancer related genes <i>IKZF2<\/i> and <i>RTTN<\/i>. Furthermore, by using our recently developed algorithm, we identified structural variation-induced enhancer-hijacking and repressor-hijacking events in AML samples. We further demonstrated the role of hijacked enhancers in AML cell growth by CRISPR screening, and the role of hijacked repressors by CRISPR de-repression. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in 20 AML and normal samples, and showed the delicate relationship between DNA methylation, CTCF binding and 3D genome structure. Finally, by treating the AML cells with the DNA hypomethylating agent and performing triple knockdown of DNMT1\/3A\/3B, we demonstrated the impact of altered DNA methylation on gene expression and 3D genome organization. Overall this study provides an invaluable resource for leukemia studies and also highlighted the role of repressor-loops and hijacked cis-elements in gene regulation and human diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Epigenomics,Methylation,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17276"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jie Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fan Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baozhen Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huijue Lyu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikoto Kobayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziyu Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ye Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaotao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Luan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bei Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lena Stasiak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qixuan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiushi Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yihao Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ross C.

CDK4\/6 inhibition can lead to either reversible or irreversible exit from the cell cycle (quiescence or senescence, respectively), but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Applying ATAC-seq in a liposarcoma cell line model of therapy-induced senescence, we have assayed alterations in the chromatin landscape that arise in response to CDK4\/6 inhibitor treatment to identify epigenetic changes that drive this cell fate decision. Additionally, we have compared this with cells that undergo senescence due to DNA damage induced by the drug doxorubicin, an anthracycline that is the standard first-line chemotherapy for liposarcoma. In CDK4\/6 inhibition, we identified dynamic patterns of accessibility as cells transition from quiescence to senescence over 28 days of treatment. NF-kB motifs in promoter-proximal regions displayed increased accessibility as cells commit to the senescence state, and ATAC-seq peaks with AP-1 transcription factor family motifs exhibit dynamic accessibility. We characterized the DNA damage response by gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 immunofluorescence and found that for CDK4\/6 inhibition there is minimal DNA damage and only at late senescence time points, in marked contrast with doxorubicin treatment. We observed differences in accessibility between CDK4\/6 inhibitor- and doxorubicin-induced senescence in a region on chromosome 6 that contains the gene <i>FRK<\/i>. This gene encodes a tyrosine kinase in the Src family that negatively regulates cell proliferation and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor through upregulation of p21, which may reinforce restriction of phosphorylation on Rb in parallel with CDK4\/6 inhibition. These findings provide further evidence of the epigenetic impact of CDK4\/6 inhibitors in cancer cells, and highlight shared and specific mechanisms that lead to therapy-induced senescence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f9158569-8696-4615-a9f2-3929666611c2\/@y03B8ZJT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Senescence,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17277"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justin Rendleman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanna Yeung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Pagane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Duba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Scortea<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Koff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viviana I.

Over 70% of breast tumors are hormone receptor positive and can be treated with endocrine therapy, however tumor recurrence remains a major obstacle. Oncogenic mutations in the catalytic subunit of PI3K occur in up to 40% of ER+\/HER2- negative breast tumors, making it a promising therapeutic target. Clinically, PI3K inhibitors have shown limited efficacy as monotherapy due to a number of resistance mechanisms, including an upregulation of ER-dependent signaling. Identification of the ER-PI3K signaling crosstalk led to clinical trials which resulted in the approval of the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with hormone-refractory ER+\/PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. Further work uncovered a key role for the chromatin modifier KMT2D in regulating ER-dependent transcription upon PI3K inhibition. PI3K effectors AKT1\/SGK1 negatively regulate KMT2D through direct S1331 phosphorylation. When PI3K is inhibited, this downstream regulatory event is lost, leading to increased chromatin recruitment of KMT2D and an upregulation of ER-dependent transcription. We have identified a novel methylation site on KMT2D, at K1330 directly adjacent to S1331, catalyzed by the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2. Knockdown of SMYD2 sensitizes ER+\/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell lines to PI3K inhibition. The combination of SMYD2 knockdown and alpelisib leads to a significant reduction in tumor growth compared to alpelisib alone in a xenograft model. Mechanistically, SMYD2 knockdown is able to attenuate alpelisib-induced KMT2D chromatin binding globally and at ER loci. Accordingly, loss of SMYD2 abrogates alpelisib-induced changes in gene expression, including ER-dependent transcription. Altogether our results demonstrate a role for epigenetic therapy using SMYD2 inhibitors in combination with alpelisib for the treatment of ER+\/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a2433827-14b7-4338-ad91-7440d5882b49\/@y03B8ZJT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Epigenetics,Cancer therapy,PIK3CA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17279"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan Blawski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mirna Sallaku<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyu Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Srushti Kittane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maurizio Scaltriti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minkui Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eneda Toska<\/i><\/presenter>.

KMT2 family protein KMT2A or MLL1 is a H3K4 methyltransferase, which is known to play an essential role in cancer development. MLL1 forms a COMPASS complex to function as an epigenetic regulator and Menin is one of the specific and required binding partner for the activation and function of this epigenetic enzyme. Menin acts as a tumor suppressor protein, and inhibition of Menin-MLL1 interaction has been shown to destabilize the MLL1 epigenetic complex, inhibits H3K4 methyltransferase activity, and hinder the oncogenic potential of various cancers. High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid pediatric tumor and accounts for almost 15% of all pediatric cancer-related deaths. Recent reports indicate that aberrant activation of epigenetic regulators may drive NB progression and relapse. Therefore, in the present study, we used a specific small-molecule inhibitor, MI-503 to disrupt Menin-MLL1 interaction, and to further understand the role of Menin in pediatric NB. We used different NB cell lines including MYCN-non-amplified (SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS, CHLA-255) and MYCN-amplified (NGP, LAN-5, IMR-32), and performed cytotoxicity and Colonogenic assays to determine the effect of Menin inhibition on NB proliferation. Results showed that MI-503 significantly inhibits NB proliferation and colony formation capacity in a dose-dependent manner in contrast to controls. Further, we performed apoptosis and cell cycle assays and observed that MI-503 significantly induces apoptosis as detected by the increase of Annexin-V positive early apoptotic cells, and blocks cell cycle progression at the S phase in all NB cell lines tested. Additionally, Western blot assays demonstrated an overall inhibition of H3K3me3 levels in NB cells in response to MI-503. To further determine the effects of Menin inhibition on NB tumor growth, we developed a NB 3D spheroid tumor model that recapitulate in vivo tumor growth for solid tumors. Treatment with MI-503 significantly inhibits spheroidal tumor growth by inducing tumor cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, these data highlight the role of epigenetic regulation, MLL1 complex, and of Menin in NB growth and tumorigenicity. In our future efforts, we will further elucidate the effects of MI-503 and the role of Menin in NB by using in vivo tumor models.

It is well established that RAS-mediated oncogenic transformation requires simultaneous inhibition of PP2A, but the molecular basis of their interaction is poorly understood. To address the target mechanisms co-regulated by RAS and PP2A we performed a phosphoproteomics screen upon RAS or PP2A manipulation. Overall the results indicated that RAS and PP2A regulate overlapping cellular processes, and that their activities might in particular converge at epigenetic machineries.<br \/>To study the RAS and PP2A synergy on transcriptional and epigenome regulation we performed multi-omics analysis of cancer cells in which RAS and PP2A activities were modulated. PP2A inhibition resulted in global gene activation while RAS inhibition lead predominantly to gene repression. Use of GFP reporter indicative of epigenetic silencing further confirmed the role of PP2A as a transcriptional repressor and RAS as a transcriptional activator. To investigate the DNA methylation changes and chromatin remodeling effects upon PP2A modulation we used RRBS (Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) &#38; ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) respectively. PP2A inhibition resulted in global DNA hypomethylation and an open state of chromatin confirming its role as a global repressor of epigenetic processes.<br \/>To delineate the molecular mechanism behind the transcriptional regulation by RAS and PP2A we monitored the chromatin recruitment of transcriptional repressors upon PP2A or RAS manipulation. Either pharmacological or siRNA mediated PP2A or RAS modulation significantly affected gene repressor complex recruitment to the chromatin. Role of phosphorylation as a critical switch for chromatin repressor complex recruitment was demonstrated by CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of PP2A target phosphorylation site, which also led to a clear phenotype in <i>in vivo<\/i> tumorigenesis and oncogenic transcription.<br \/>Collectively these results identify a novel phosphorylation switch on chromatin repressor complex as a converge point of KRAS and PP2A activities in lung cancer. Generally the results provide first indications to global importance of PP2A-mediated phosphorylation regulation in epigenetic gene regulation in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7dc283a8-fe4b-47fe-9d52-a43e2c92bc5a\/@y03B8ZJT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Cancer,Protein phosphatase,Ras,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17284"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mukund Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Aakula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Tabaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karolina Pavic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riikka Huhtaniemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matti Nykter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jukka Westermarck<\/i><\/presenter>.

The protein methyltransferase SET and MYND domain-containing 3 (SMYD3), which trimethylates H3K4 and H4K20, can stimulate gene transcription and activate several oncogenic pathways, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cell cycle related pathways. Additionally, its expression is associated with a poor prognosis in various cancer types, such as colon and ovarian cancer. This study aims to decipher whether SMYD3 has direct oncogenic effects and relevant mechanisms in HPV-negative HNSCC. Our preliminary results have demonstrated that SMYD3 is significantly overexpressed in HPV-negative HNSCC compared to normal and dysplastic epithelium. SMYD3 knockdown decreased cellular proliferation and clonal capacity in CFAs after siRNA-mediated SMYD3 knockdown in several HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines or CRISPR-mediated SMYD3 knockout. Cell cycle analysis of CRISPR SMYD3 KO cell lines showed a significant decrease in the S phase, supporting that cell cycle arrest may be a mechanism through which this decreased cellular proliferation occurs. Nuclear\/cytoplasmic dissociation and western blotting of 6 HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines, and immunohistochemistry for SMYD3 in primary and recurrent\/metastatic HPV-negative HNSCC tumor tissues have identified the expression of SMYD3 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with greater expression in the cytoplasm than the nucleus. Ongoing experiments aim to investigate the effects of SMYD3 knockdown on the global proteome, as well as its effects on histone post-translational modifications in HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines. Genome-wide mapping for SMYD3, H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 in HPV- negative HNSCC cells using CUT&#38;RUN assays are ongoing with the goal to identify direct downstream gene targets regulated by human SMYD3. Finally, we plan to investigate if SMYD3 knockout decreases tumor growth in NSG xenografts. This study may provide the biological rational to target SMYD3 as a novel therapeutic avenue in HPV-negative HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8bf40a83-4f1b-4808-ba3f-ad2a1694ab4a\/@y03B8ZJT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Cell cycle,Histone methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17307"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Madhavi Murali<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Tsai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nupur Nigam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyunghee Burkitt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sohyoung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vassiliki Saloura<\/i><\/presenter>.

Epigenetic programs influence AML cell fate decisions, and their mis-regulation can promote differentiation arrest. Itis therefore of paramount importance to identify the regulators of AML cell differentiation and understand the mechanisms by which they repress myeloid transcriptional programs. Here, we performed a cell-fate selection CRISPR screen for chromatin factors whose inhibition promotes AML cell differentiation. We found that the histone acetyltransferase KAT6A is a critical driver of the differentiation block, and that both genetic and chemical inhibition of KAT6A markedly de-repressed latent myeloid maturation programs, most commonly in MLL-rearranged AML. Inhibition of KAT6A catalytic activity reduced self-renewal, induced cell cycle arrest, and extinguished long-term proliferative capacity of AML cells. Through ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and extensive analysis of clinical datasets, we found that KAT6A is the likely initiator of a newly-described \"writer-reader\" module that drives oncogenic gene expression in AML. In this model,KAT6A catalyzes promoter H3K9 acetylation, which is bound by the H3K9ac reader ENL, leading to Super elongation complex (SEC) recruitment and release of paused RNA PolII at oncogenic loci such as<i> MYC.<\/i> KAT6A is elevated in human AMLs compared to matched normal tissue, and its downregulation correlates with monocytic differentiation transcriptional programs in clinical AML datasets. These findings suggest the potential of targeting both KAT6A and ENL to disrupt this writer-reader module and ablate downstream MYC transcriptional programs inMLL-rearranged AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52d03203-607f-4cc2-89a8-186453622ba4\/@y03B8ZJT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Differentiation,Acute myeloid leukemia,CRISPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21286"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andres Blanco<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Epigenetic regulation including chromatin remodeling plays a crucial role in the development and progression of many human diseases such as cancers. Epigenetic alterations contribute to the development and progression of PCa. These alterations may cause drug resistance to readily available treatment options for human cancers including PCa. Nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF) consists of bromodomain-PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF), sucrose non-fermenting-2-like (SNF2L), and pRBAP46\/48, controls the chromatin remodeling machinery. One of NURF&#8217;s major function is to regulate histone modifications and gene expression. Epigenetic factor, SNF2L, serves as the energy transducing subunit in NURF and is encoded by the SMARCA1 gene. SNF2L is a ubiquitously expressed transcription activator and its elevation is associated with cancer development. However, the role of SNF2L on PCa progression is still elusive. Therefore, there are unmet needs to understand the role of SNF2L in PCa in order to develop effective therapeutic approaches of controlling this malignancy. The objective of this project is to assess the impact of SNF2L loss on PCa progression. We hypothesized that SNF2L knockout (KO) will inhibit the proliferation of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa cells and targeting SNF2L or SMARCA-1 gene may be beneficial for controlling cancer progression. We have generated SNF2L KO PCa cells with CRISPR-Cas9 technology and inhibited SMARCA-1 gene via transient transfection application. Our results showed that SNF2L loss resulted in a reduced proliferation and altered morphology of PCa cells. SNF2L KO destabilizes the NURF complex and impairs chromatin remodeling and histone modifications for cell growth and survival. Thereby, targeting SNF2L may serve as a novel therapeutic regime in PCa control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/958abe04-1ea4-4ebb-aee5-b1ff392f51a1\/@y03B8ZJT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-05 Gene silencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Epigenetics,Gene silencing,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17317"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>LaKendria K.

Understanding the molecular evolution of ATC is a current challenge in thyroid cancer field that may lead to identification of new targets for treatment. In this extent, deregulation of epigenetic regulators and chromatin modifiers may contribute to ATC aggressiveness by altering chromatin state. High levels of EZH2, a component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) lead to deposition of H3K27me3 in histones, heterochromatin formation and repression of target genes expression such as tumor suppressors and differentiation genes.<br \/>Objective: Investigate the role of PRC2\/EZH2 in ATC biology, using strategies to block EZH2 function, either pharmacologically or with CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated gene editing.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>We analyzed the expression of PRC2\/EZH2, thyroid differentiation genes and EMT in human data from ATC microarray repository. In vitro, we analyzed protein levels of EZH2 in a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines using Western Blot. In order to block EZH2 function in ATC cells, we used two strategies: A) temporary blockade of EZH2 in KTC2 cells using GSK126, an allosteric inhibitor of EZH2, at 0.5 uM - 5.0 uM, for 6 days; B) permanent blockage of EZH2 using CRISPR\/Cas9-induced gene editing in KTC2 cells with PX459 plasmid that contains sgRNA to target <i>EZH2<\/i> start codon region. Gene expression of thyroid differentiation genes was evaluated by qPCR. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay.<br \/>Results: The expression of EZH2\/PRC2 components is upregulated in ATC while thyroid differentiation genes, transcription factors and epithelial genes are reduced, and EMT genes are induced. EZH2 function temporary blockage with GSK126 induced thyroid differentiation with dose dependent increase in <i>NIS<\/i>, <i>TG, TPO <\/i>(8-fold at 5uM), genes related to iodine metabolism in KTC2 cells. Moreover, thyroid transcription factors <i>NKX2-1<\/i> (7-fold at 5uM)<i> <\/i>and <i>PAX8<\/i> (5-fold at 5uM), and the epithelial gene <i>E-cadherin <\/i>(5-fold at 5uM) are induced by GSK126 treatment. CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated <i>EZH2 <\/i>gene editing efficiently reduced EZH2 protein levels, while induced a more epithelial-like cell morphology and reduced cell viability in KTC2-CRISPR-Cl5. Moreover, disruption of <i>EZH2<\/i> gene with CRISPR\/Cas9 increased <i>TPO <\/i>(6-fold), <i>NKX2-1<\/i> (1.8-fold) and <i>E-cadherin <\/i>(4-fold) mRNAs, however did not induce <i>NIS<\/i>, <i>TG<\/i> and <i>PAX8 <\/i>as observed in GSK126 treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: The over-expression and over-activation of EZH2\/PRC2 pathway in ATC may contribute to tumor aggressiveness by reducing thyroid cell differentiation and inducing EMT; These results indicate a potential benefit for EZH2 blockage as a neoadjuvant approach to induce differentiation and radioiodine uptake in aggressive thyroid cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/81518016-aa21-4fef-9ef9-742f68dc14a6\/@y03B8ZJT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,EZH2,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17320"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Diego C.

One of the challenges in the management of patients with cancer of the digestive tract is to prevent relapse. Epigenetic modifications (i.e. DNA methylation and histone marks) have been proven to be involved in the generation and maintenance of a subset of cells with stemness properties, that resist to conventional therapies. Our aim is to identify complexes of chromatin modifier enzymes (epienzymes) that are involved in acquired chemoresistance\/aggressiveness of colon and pancreatic cancer cells.<br \/><i>Experimental procedures\/Methods<\/i>. A meta-analysis performed on public transcriptomics data from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients cross-referenced with our own data including basal-like pancreatic cancer samples identified a limited number of epienzymes associated with aggressive subtypes of digestive cancers. Among them, the demethylase KDM4B, specific of the lysine 9 of Histone 3, and the transcriptional repressor PRDM1 where found correlated to the expression of several typical markers of cancer stemness. To confirm the role of these epienzymes in colon and pancreatic cancer cell chemoresistance, we have developed several <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> 2D and 3D models of acquired resistance to oxaliplatin-based combined chemotherapies, including FOLFIRINOX and FOLFOX. In this work, these models as well as patient samples have been used to study (i) the dynamic expression profile of these epienzymes (RT-qPCR, immunofluorescent multiplex staining, single-cell analysis and spatial transcriptomics), (ii) the gene regulons that are bound by these epienzymes (CUT&#38;RUN-seq) and (iii) the functional role of these epienzymes in cancer stemness (organoid and sphere-forming assays).<br \/><i>Results<\/i>. We have shown that PRDM1 and KDM4B are expressed heterogeneously in cancer cell populations and overexpressed during specific time frames along the acquisition of resistance to oxaliplatin-based combined therapies both in colon and pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, we have obtained promising results regarding the binding of PRDM1 and KDM4B to key players of pluripotency\/differentiation in chemoresistant colon cancer cells.<br \/><i>Conclusions<\/i>. Altogether, our data indicate that specific expression of chromatin modifier enzymes, most likely acting as epigenetic complexes, are key milestones of acquired resistance to conventional therapies. This work will pave the way for considering epienzyme-epienzyme interactions as potent drug targets that could circumvent cancer cell aggressiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8995d3e6-d7c1-4d5e-98ce-b20f8a599341\/@z03B8ZJU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Cancer stem cells,Chemoresistance,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17321"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elsa Hadj Bachir<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Poiraud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hugo Claux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soumaya El Moghrabi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonia Paget<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Belinda Duchêne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Jonckheere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernadette Neve<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuelle Leteurtre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Van Seuningen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Vincent<\/i><\/presenter>.

MLL1 fusion driven acute leukemia is characterized by deregulated activity of the <u>S<\/u>uper <u>E<\/u>longation <u>C<\/u>omplex (SEC) and the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L, which alter the epigenetic landscape and transcription of pro-leukemic MLL1 fusion targets like <i>HoxA9<\/i> and <i>Meis1. <\/i>The Eleven-<u>N<\/u>ineteen-<u>L<\/u>eukemia gene (<i>ENL<\/i> or <i>MLLT1<\/i>) is a common <i>MLL1<\/i> fusion partner and a SEC component. The ENL protein contains a highly conserved N-terminal epigenetic reader YEATS domain that recognizes acetylated H3K9\/K18\/K27 (H3Kac hereinafter). Wild type ENL was recently found to be essential for leukemic cell growth, which is dependent on its YEATS domain interaction with H3Kac. While this finding highlighted the YEATS domain importance in wild type ENL function in leukemic cells, the inclusion and importance of the YEATS domain in MLL-ENL fusion protein remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the clinical relevance and importance of the ENL YEATS domain in MLL-ENL leukemias. We analyzed &#62;300 t(11;19) MLL-ENL leukemia patients for the breakpoint location within the <i>ENL<\/i> gene and found that the YEATS domain is retained in the resultant MLL-ENL fusion protein in 84.1% of t(11;19) leukemia patients. We tested the importance of the YEATS domain in MLL-ENL mouse models and found that the YEATS domain and downstream sequence is required for MLL-ENL leukemogenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>. YEATS deletion decreased expression of pro-leukemic targets such as <i>Meis1<\/i>, an important factor for leukemic stem cells (LSC). To interrogate the contribution of the YEATS epigenetic reader function in MLL-ENL leukemogenesis, we introduced YEATS point mutations rendering the domain defective in interacting with H3Kac and found that this significantly increased leukemia latency <i>in vivo<\/i>. Further investigation revealed that YEATS point mutations disrupting H3Kac binding significantly decreased MLL-ENL LSC frequency while not affecting homing to the bone marrow. We attribute this LSC frequency change to altered <i>Meis1<\/i> expression. Additionally, disruption of the YEATS epigenetic reader function in MLL-ENL leukemia cells does not induce differentiation, apoptosis nor cell cycle arrest. Therapeutically, we predicted the YEATS domain in MLL-ENL would sensitize MLL-ENL leukemia to YEATS domain inhibitors. Indeed, MLL-ENL leukemia cells are more sensitive to the ENL\/AF9 YEATS domain inhibitor, SGC-iMLLT, compared to acute leukemia cells driven by other fusions. Together, our results demonstrate that YEATS-H3Kac binding plays an important role in MLL-ENL fusion mediated leukemogenesis. Our data establishes a strong rationale for future exploration of small molecules aimed at disrupting the YEATS-H3Kac interaction as a targeted therapeutics for treating t(11;19) leukemia patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/42c99046-5a05-46bd-8a53-bde1492efb2f\/@z03B8ZJU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Epigenetic Reader,Leukemic Stem cells,MLL\/KMT2A,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17332"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hsiangyu Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nirmalya Saha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ejaz Ahmad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuting Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lili Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Lachowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Blaine Teahan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sierrah Grigsby<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rolf Marschalek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zaneta Nikolovska-Coleska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew G.

The prevalence of HCC and the unmet clinical needs emphasize the urge for novel regimens for these malignancies. In this study, we performed an epigenetics-focused CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library screen in the HepG2-dCas9-Krab cells (a total of 3,669 sgRNAs targeting 728 chromatin regulator genes at their transcription start sites) and identified ACTR5 as a novel essential gene in HCC. CRISPR depletion of ACTR5 led to arrested cell cycle and attenuated HCC tumor progression in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significantly increased CDKN2A expression in the sgACTR5 transduced HCC cells, which led to the activation of Rb and repression of CDK6 and E2F signaling. Meanwhile, histone modification profiling identified loss of H3K9me2 and Hek9me3 at the CDKN2A promoters upon ACTR5 depletion, indicating the involvement of the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors (including CDKN2A) underlying the ACTR5-driven HCC progression. Mechanistically, we found that CRISPR targeting the ACTR5&#8217;s interacting protein IES6 (also known as INO80C) recapitulated the sgACTR5 phenotypes, highlighting the collaborative roles between these two partners. We then conducted a high-density CRISPR gene tiling scan using a sgRNA library that targets every NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) within the ACTR5 (284 sgRNAs) and IES6 (90 sgRNAs) coding exons. This saturating mutagenesis screen revealed the requirement of 2 regions (G502-S519 and I552-C569) within ACTR5&#8217;s 2nd Actin-fold domain for IES6 interaction. Reciprocally, our unbiased screen identified a previously uncharacterized domain (T163-V187) in IES6&#8217;s C-terminal region to mediate the ACTR5-IES6 complex formation. To investigate the clinical impact of ACTR5, we examined the response of HCC cells to various inhibitors upon ACTR5 depletion. While sgACTR5 did not affect the cellular response to sorafenib (an FDA-approved RAF and VEGF inhibitor for HCC patients), we found that suppression of ACTR5 sensitized the HCC cells to ribociclib (a CDK6 inhibitor) and UNC0642 (an H3K9 methyltransferase G9a and GLP inhibitor). Based on these observations, we rationalized a combination treatment of ribociclib\/UNC0642 that synergistically suppresses the proliferation of the HCC cells. In summary, our study revealed a pivotal role of ACTR5 (and its complex member IES6) in supporting the CDK6-driven cell cycle progression via an H3K9me2 H3K9me3-mediated silencing of CDKN2A. These notions can be exploited to develop novel combinational therapies against the difficult to cure liver cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f0a1554d-b8e0-4f51-abfb-bb0d41d7b474\/@z03B8ZJU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Hepatocellular carcinoma,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Histone methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17333"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaobao Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheela Pangeni Pokharel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingli Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiao Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Mattson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chun-wei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Group 3 (G3) is the most aggressive subgroup and is associated with amplifications of the <i>MYC <\/i>gene. MYC expression and function are controlled in part by epigenetic regulation, and interestingly, the few mutations that are found in G3 medulloblastoma are mostly located in genes encoding epigenetic regulators. Surprisingly, many tumors had no mutations raising the question as to whether non-mutated or non-amplified epigenetic regulators may be drivers of G3MB tumorigenesis. We previously found that dysregulation of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 cooperates with MYC in G3MB, indicating that epigenetic regulators may provide a source of potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, to identify novel epigenetic drivers in G3MB, we performed an unbiased shRNA screen of 243 known chromatin regulators. The most intriguing candidate was SMYD3, a multidomain-containing protein with histone H4-lysine 5 (H4K5) methyltransferase activity. Knockdown of <i>SMYD3 <\/i>suppressed G3MB proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor progression <i>in vivo<\/i>. SMYD3 protein is nuclear and associated with the <i>MYC <\/i>promoter.

Using a multi-omics approach including CUT&#38;RUN sequencing, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and proteomics we aim to elucidate how SMYD3 controls G3MB tumorigenesis.

To date, there is no FDA-approved HER3-targeted cancer therapy. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been approved for the treatment of refractory or relapsed cutaneous T cell lymphomas and show potency in TNBC cells.

Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to assess the interaction between proteins. Lentivirus vectors containing cDNA or shRNAs were used to overexpress or knockdown gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation<b>-<\/b>quantitative PCR and dual luciferase reporter assays<b> <\/b>were performed to elucidate the regulatory role of gene transcription.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Elevated expression of HER3 were observed in approximately half of the TNBC specimens and cell lines tested. HER3 was co-expressed and formed<b> <\/b>heterodimers with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to activate the PI-3K\/Akt signaling in HER3<sup>high<\/sup>-TNBC cells. Panobinostat and romidepsin induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in HER3<sup>high<\/sup>-TNBC<sup> <\/sup>cells via downregulating HER3 expression and inhibiting PI-3K\/Akt signaling. Significantly, HDACis in combination with an EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib) or an Akt inhibitor (Akti1\/2) synergistically enhanced the anti-survival effects on HER3<sup>high<\/sup>-TNBC<sup> <\/sup>cells. Besides, analyses of gene expression profiling datasets revealed a significantly positive correlation between expression of HER3 and transcription factor forkhead box A1 (FOXA1). Further studies discovered that FOXA1 activated HER3 expression through directly binding to <i>HER3<\/i> promoter. Moreover, ectopic expression of FOXA1 not only rescued the expression of HER3-downregulated by HDACis, but also attenuated these HDACis-mediated anti-survival effects on HER3<sup>high<\/sup>-TNBC<sup> <\/sup>cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> HDAC inhibitors exhibits potent inhibitory effects on HER3<sup>high<\/sup>-TNBC<sup> <\/sup>cells via downregulation of FOXA1-mediated repression of <i>HER3<\/i> gene transcription. Our data suggest that epigenetic targeting of FOXA1-HER3\/EGFR-PI-3K\/Akt signaling axis may be an effective therapeutic strategy for eradication of HER3<sup>high<\/sup>-TNBC tumors.<b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1cea21ad-0fa0-490c-be3c-018827a82298\/@z03B8ZJU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB3,FoxA1,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18173"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Congcong Tan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Lyu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanbao Ruan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bolin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

These oncometabolite producing mutations are prevalent in 70% of gliomas, &#62;76% of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, and &#62;25% of paraganglioma and pheochromocytomas, respectively. These oncometabolite producing cancers harbor vulnerabilities in multiple cellular pathways because oncometabolites competitively inhibit alpha ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases. This group of enzymes includes the ten eleven translocation (TET) family of enzymes, which catalyze locus specific DNA demethylation. Thus, oncometabolite producing cancers have been shown to exhibit global DNA hypermethylation, which drastically alters gene expression in the cell and is thought to occur via TET inhibition. Cells with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations, which produce 2HG, have loss of expression of a critical NAD biosynthesis enzyme, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT). We show that in addition to IDH1 mutant cells, fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient isogenic cell lines, which overproduce fumarate, show loss of NAPRT expression, which can be targeted by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors. The goal of our work is to determine if this NAPRT silencing is present in many oncometabolite producing cancers, elucidate the mechanism of silencing, and test therapies to target this vulnerability in NAD biosynthesis. FH-deficient cancer cell lines show reduction of NAPRT mRNA levels by qRT-PCR and absence of protein by western blot, suggesting a reduction in NAPRT transcription. In addition, FH-deficient cell lines exhibit synthetic lethality in short term cell viability assays when treated with NAMPT inhibitor, FK866, which inhibits a parallel NAD biosynthesis pathway. Cell viability is not rescued by nicotinic acid supplementation in FH-deficient lines while parental lines are rescuable, validating the loss of functional NAPRT in only FH-deficient lines. Furthermore, patient samples of FH-deficient renal cell carcinomas show higher NAPRT promoter methylation compared to healthy tissue via methylation array. Ongoing studies are investigating the role of TET1\/2\/3 enzymes in NAPRT promoter methylation. Together, these results suggest that hypermethylation of the NAPRT promoter is associated with silencing of NAPRT expression in FH-deficient cancers, which can be therapeutically targeted through NAMPT inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fecdaf01-6f97-4d2e-89b6-d6068451a5f9\/@z03B8ZJU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-05 Gene silencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Metabolism,NAD,Oncometabolites,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21153"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katelyn Noronha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiayu Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ranjit Bindra<\/i><\/presenter>.
