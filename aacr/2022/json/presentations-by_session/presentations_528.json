[{"Abstract":"Multiple myeloma (MM) comprised 0.9% of all new cancer cases and 1.2% of cancer death in 2020 and is the second most common hematological neoplasm in adults. Primary refractory to treatment and relapse resulted in a high death rate of MM patients. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are attracting candidate drugs against multiple myeloma by targeting CD3 on T cells and MM specific cell surface markers such as B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), CD38, and G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member D (GPRC5D). In the current study, we developed a humanized antibody targeting GPRC5D (clone number G-02-9D7). The antibody was derived from hybridoma of mouse immunized with GPRC5D overexpressed mouse cell line. Compared to the GPRC5D antibody in clinical (JNJ-64407564), this antibody has a higher affinity to 293T cells overexpressing GPRC5D (EC50=1.9nM vs. 3nM), MM cell lines, and MM patient samples. In addition, this antibody did not bind to GPRC5A, B, and C and had weaker non-specific binding to human serum albumin than JNJ-64407564. Bispecific antibody derived from the GRPC5D antibody and CD3 antibody (clone number: sp34) induced specific cytotoxicity of MM cells in the presence of T cells from PBMC. This bispecific antibody stimulated the release of cytokines from T cells such as INF-&#947;, IL-2, IL-8, and TNF-&#945;. In NCI-H929 prophylactic xenograft mouse model with PBMC transplantation, tumor growth could be prevented by administration weekly with this bispecific antibody as low as 0.1ug per mouse. In the presence of T cells, the bispecific antibody also resulted in complete remission of established MM.1S tumor in xenografted NSG mouse with the injection of 1ug antibody weekly. At last, MM patient bone marrow samples cultured in vitro with this bispecific antibody increased cell death of the CD138+ population. In summary, the GPRC5D antibody could efficiently target Multiple myeloma tumor cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/288aec28-1d36-420a-bb8a-5c01b9c36d75\/@u03B8ZR2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,T cell,GPRC5D,Bispecific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17610"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Feng He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kefei Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiabei Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianhui Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guojin Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jinying Ning<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

And because of its central role in limiting antitumor immune response and few immune-related adverse events with defect TIGIT, it has been an attractive target in cancer immunotherapy recently. Here we describe a humanized antibody against TIGIT by blocking its function and mediating ADCC to deplete TIGIT positive Treg cells. The antibody was derived from hybridoma of mice immunized with TIGIT-mFc. Comparing to TIGIT antibody in clinical (Tiragolumab), this antibody had higher affinity to 293T cells overexpressing human TIGIT (EC50=0.45nM vs 1.3nM) or cyno TIGIT (EC50=2.6nM vs 13nM), and also had higher binding affinity to activated CD8 T cell from PBMC (EC50=0.65nM vs 1.47nM), with lower Kd (0.9nM vs 1.8nM). This antibody also more efficiently blocked TIGIT binding to its ligand CD155 overexpressed on 293T cells with FACS assay than Tiragolumab (IC50=1nM vs. 1.4nM). In the cell-based reporter assay, the antibody had a lower IC50 than Tiragolumab (5nM vs. 21nM). When the primary CD8 T cell was co-cultured with 293T cells overexpressing CD155 and anti-CD3 scFv (OKT3) on the surface, the antibody increased the secretion of INF-&#947; along with an increase of antibody concentration. At last, this antibody-mediated depletion of TIGIT positive Treg from PBMC cultured in vitro with higher efficiency than Tiragolumab.

Elevated GDF-15 level was often the result of pathological conditions, including autoimmune disease and cancer. Increased GDF-15 caused metabiotic disorders such as anorexia and cachexia, and GDF-15 became an attractive target for metabolic intervention. Here, we developed a humanized GDF-15 neutralizing antibody (H53E5-8V2) from hybridoma of mice immunized with GDF-15-mFc. H53E5-8V2 had high affinity to GDF-15 (Kd=0.05nM), and demonstrated a stronger binding to coated GDF-15-HIS than Ponsegnomab (Pfizer Inc.) with ELISA assay (EC50=0.33nM vs 0.73nM). H53E5-8V2 also had strong binding to cynoGDF15 (EC50=0.3nM). In ELISA blocking assay, H53E5-8V2 disrupted the interaction of GDF-15 and GFRAL with a lower concentration than Ponsegnomab (EC50=0.25nM vs. 0.5nM). In addition, H53E5-8V2 neutralized GDF-15 in the culture medium and blocked GDF-15 induced GFRAL signaling more efficiently than Ponsegnomab in reporter cell assay (EC50=0.13nM vs. 0.27nM). H53E5-8V2 was stable and had a serum half-life of 9 days in mice with a single antibody injection. And it prevented body weight decrease of the mouse with HT1080 xenograft tumor, MC38 overexpressing GDF-15, or subcutaneous injection of protein GDF-15 fused with mouse Fc at C terminal. These results suggested that H53E5-8V2 was a good candidate drug for the treatment of cachexia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5b8bfbd0-29f0-4877-b5b5-96db30911b65\/@u03B8ZR2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Growth and differentiation factor 15,neutralizing antibody,metabolic intervention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17613"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Guojin Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinming Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meng Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengcheng Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jinying Ning<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We examined the additive effects of combinations of BC chemotherapy drugs associated with incident CVD events among women with a history of BC compared to those without.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The Pathways Heart Study is a cohort study within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) examining incident CVD events and risk factors in women with BC. Eligibility criteria included invasive BC diagnosis from 11\/2005 to 3\/2013, age&#38;ge;21 years, and KPNC membership&#38;ge;12 months at BC diagnosis. Controls without BC were matched 5:1 on birth year and race\/ethnicity. KPNC electronic health records were used to collect demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics. Chemotherapy drugs identified from clinical data included anthracyclines, cyclophosphamides, taxanes, and trastuzumab. Mutually exclusive groups were created according to the types of chemotherapy drugs received. Outcomes identified from ICD9\/10 diagnosis codes included incident ischemic heart disease, heart failure (HF)\/cardiomyopathy and stroke. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the CVD outcome by chemotherapy drug combinations received relative to matched controls.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 6,761 women with BC who received chemotherapy were identified and were matched to 33,801 controls. On average, women were 55.2 years old (standard deviation (SD)=10.9) and were followed for 7.1 years (SD=3.6). Four groups of women with distinct chemotherapy combinations were identified: anthracyclines + cyclophosphamide (AC, 10.5%), AC + taxanes (39.0%), AC + taxanes + trastuzumab (8.8%), and cyclophosphamide + taxanes (20.7%). Women who received AC had a 2.00 (95% CI: 1.27-3.14) increased risk of incident HF\/cardiomyopathy relative to matched controls without BC. When taxanes were added to this combination, risk was similar (HR=1.88; 95% CI: 1.44-2.47). However, when trastuzumab was further added, risk of HF\/cardiomyopathy increased more than 1.5-fold (HR=3.18; 95% CI: 1.91-5.30). The combined receipt of cyclophosphamide and taxanes was associated with a 1.42 (95% CI: 1.05-1.92) increased risk of developing stroke, but including anthracyclines with this combination inversed the association for stroke (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54- 0.99). No combinations examined were associated with incidence of ischemic heart disease.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Findings suggest specific chemotherapy drug combinations may differentially affect the risk of incident HF\/cardiomyopathy and stroke in BC survivors. Future work will examine dosage and duration of chemotherapy exposure, comparisons of the groups&#8217; characteristics to account for possible confounding by indication, and competing risk analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f19da69c-c18e-4a05-a3b8-ec2153388368\/@u03B8ZR2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17618"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"ca33b88c-93da-49b8-9803-3efbe25250cc","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ca33b88c-93da-49b8-9803-3efbe25250cc\/@u03B8ZR2\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hanjie Shen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eileen Rillamas-Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Iribarren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamal S.

However, most of the TNBC patients have high risk of recurrence after chemotherapy and metastatic tumor recurrence indicates rapid tumor proliferation and drug resistance. In TNBC cells, treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX) induces Transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#946; signaling pathway. TGF-&#946; is a master regulator of tumor angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are limiting the efficacy of cancer therapies and suppressing the anti-tumor immune response. TGF-&#946; induces autophagy in tumor cells and autophagy is closely associated with cancer cell survival and contributing to resistance to therapies. The targeting of TGF-&#946; pathway is possibly an effective strategy to inhibit drug resistance and increase the sensitivity of cancer treatment. Charis 1000 (C1K), which is currently under development, is a synthetic peptide that targets TGF-&#946;1. As C1K partially inhibits TGF-&#946;1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in TNBC cells, there is no risk of side effects unlike small molecules or antibodies that completely inhibit the TGF-&#946;1 signaling pathway. Combination therapies including chemotherapy are actively investigated as effective treatments for various cancers. PTX, one of frequently used drugs in combination therapies, increases phosphorylation of Smad2, a TGF- &#946;1 downstream signaling pathway and induces autophagy in TNBC cells, but PTX in combination with C1K increases apoptosis while reducing Smad2 phosphorylation and autophagy. The combination of C1K with PTX in the mouse TNBC model showed significant tumor size reduction in comparison to the PTX alone group. In addition, the combination of C1K with PTX confirmed the increased apoptosis and decreased autophagy in the tumor tissues. Furthermore, the combination of C1K with PTX increased the survival rate of mice that was reduced due to the side effects of PTX. These data indicate that the drug resistance induced by TGF-&#946; signaling pathway can be suppressed by C1K combination through TGF-&#946; signaling modulation. C1K may be a promising combination partner for cancer treatment by reducing drug resistance and increasing apoptotic potential of anticancer drugs.

Recently, efforts have been made to identify new targets and drugs to improve clinical outcomes in these patients. Because of its high expression in neuroendocrine tumors compared to normal tissue, delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) has emerged as a new therapeutic target in this setting.<sup>1,2<\/sup> Targeting DLL3 with the half-life extended bispecific T cell engager (HLE BiTE<sup>&#174;<\/sup>) immune therapy, tarlatamab, in a phase 1 clinical trial has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients.<sup>3<\/sup> In order to more precisely guide patient selection and clinical trial design, a better understanding and quantification of DLL3 expression is required. Thus, we investigated DLL3 immunohistochemical expression across SCLC, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and neuroendocrine carcinoma with combined histology (CNEC), and its associations with clinicopathological characteristics.<br \/><b>Design: <\/b><b> <\/b>Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded surgically resected lung neuroendocrine carcinomas (SCLC, n=17; LCNEC, n=20; CNEC, n=8) were selected based on tissue availability at MD Anderson Cancer Center and stained with a commercially available immunohistochemistry assay for DLL3 (clone SP347, Ventana). Total percentage and intensity of DLL3 expression of neuroendocrine carcinoma cells were scored and the results were presented as H-Score (0-300) and percentage (%) of DLL3 positive tumor cells. We correlated DLL3 expression with clinicopathological characteristics.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> <b> <\/b>DLL3 expression was observed in 37\/45 (82%) of all cases (SCLC: %, median=65%, 0-100%; H-score, median=95, 0-175; LCNEC: %, median=65%, 0-100%; H-score, median=100, 0-180; CNEC: %, median=55%, 0-95%; H-score, median=90, 0-175). In patients with LCNEC, DLL3 % was higher in male patients (p=0.0500) and former smokers (p=0.0298) compared to females and current smokers, respectively. No other clinicopathological associations were found with age, Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system, recurrence, neoadjuvant therapy or overall survival.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b>Our work confirms that most high-grade neuroendocrine tumors express DLL3 across histology types and TNM stage. Our results suggest that a large subset of patients with high-grade lung neuroendocrine tumors may be a target population of interest for DLL3-targeted therapies.<br \/><b>References<\/b><br \/>1.

While the overall response rate to first line therapy is encouraging (~80%), the majority of women develop recurrent disease that is characterized by resistance to chemotherapy. It is believed that cancer stem cells (CSCs) may contribute, in part, to resistance and recurrence of OvCa. To understand the pathways involved in enhancing this stem-like phenotype, we performed RNA sequencing. We identified that the TLR-ILR1 (TIR) pathways are highly activated in cisplatin resistant OvCa and in CSC-enriched 3-dimensional culture models. To further understand the role of the TIR pathway, we mined the Cancer Genome Atlas database and observed that interleukin receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), a critical mediator of TIR signaling is upregulated in cancer tissues. In addition, the locus surrounding the IRAK1 gene is amplified in 10% of OvCa patients. We confirmed that IRAK1 expression is upregulated in a majority of OvCa samples by immunohistochemistry of a tumor microarray consisting of 100 patient and paired non-cancerous fallopian tube tissues. Furthermore, this upregulation correlated with early cancer onset and shorter overall survival. To study the specific role of IRAK1 in OvCa, we knocked down its expression using specific shRNA. This significantly impaired cancer growth both <i>in vitro<\/i> in 2-dimension (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures, and <i>in vivo<\/i> in peritoneal disease models. Moreover, IRAK1 knockdown resulted in decreased expression of CSC marker genes, including MYC, ALDH1A1, DCLK1, and KLF4 suggesting a critical role in maintenance of stemness programming. Since IRAK1 is an upstream kinase that is activated by TIR receptors, we were intrigued by mechanisms driving its activation. In this regard, we have observed that low molecular weight hyaluronic acid (LMW HA) is present at high levels (100-200 ng\/ml) in malignant ascites following peritoneal metastasis. Treatment of OVCAR8, A2780 and A1847 cells with LMW HA (50-200 ng\/ml) induced IRAK1 phosphorylation at 80 ng\/ml that was further enhanced at 200 ng\/ml. In addition, LMW HA induced stemness and multidrug resistance genes. With additional studies using specific inhibitors, we identified that the increased spheroid formation occurred via a CD44-PKC-IRAK1-STAT3 signaling axis. Finally, using molecular modeling and in silico screening, coupled with Eurofin&#8217;s ScanMAX platform, we identified TCS2210 as a novel highly specific IRAK1 inhibitor. Also, TCS2210 abrogated LMW HA induced activation of IRAK1 and STAT3, and CSC marker genes MYC and DCLK1. Moreover, TCS2210 effectively suppressed OvCa cell growth in <i>in vitro<\/i> 2D and 3D cultures, and in peritoneal disease models alone and in combination with cisplatin. These data, taken together, strongly suggest that IRAK1 is a valid therapeutic target for OvCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Stemness,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17621"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Standing<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sumedha Gunewardena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Afreen A.

As a class of heterobifunctional small molecules, PROTACs recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase to a given substrate protein, resulting in its targeted degradation through the endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). PROTAC consists of three chemical elements: a ligand that binds to a target protein, a ligand that binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and a linker that connects the two ligands. Compared with traditional drug development, PROTAC technology possesses unique advantages including overcoming drug resistance and targeting the &#8220;undruggable&#8221;. Here we generated a kind of PROTAC target, like KRAS, BRD4, ESR1, associated cell lines to accelerate the discovery of new protein degradation drugs and the target protein degradation therapeutics by an optimized insertion system. In the beginning, we develop a system of different tag targeted cell lines, which can be easy to introduce HiBiT, Flag, GFP and also Halo Tag, et.al to target protein by CRISPaint or CRISPR Cas9 mediated HDR system. We also developed an arbitrary point mutation system based on the optimized PE3 mutation system, which can randomly modify any point mutation to simulate in vivo disease models in vitro. During this process, we have also optimized a series of validation system, like Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD), High-throughput flow cytometry (HTFC) and In-Cell Western (ICW) to shorten the detection time and improve detection stability. It is worth mentioning that we also develop a HiBiT and GFP dual-signal system, which can easily validate the target protein degradation and cell viability. We hope that our detection system can speed up the development of new drugs and contribute to human anti-tumor.Keywords: PROTAC, UPS, drug development, therapeutics","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6f39f8f-daa4-4a32-b624-6c6a0a631577\/@v03B8ZR3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,UPS,therapeutics,drug development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17622"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ruifeng Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

CD25, the high-affinity receptor subunit for interleukin (IL)-2, is highly expressed on Treg and considered a selective target for Treg depletion. However, CD25 is also expressed on activated effector T cells (Teff), and antibodies against CD25 with blocking IL-2 signaling have limited antitumor activity. Here we developed a humanized antibody against CD25 (H3F1-4V2) without blocking IL-2 signaling. This antibody was derived from hybridoma of mice immunized with CD25-mFc. Two CD25 antibodies Daclizumab and RG6292 were applied as reference antibodies, and Daclizumab blocked IL-2 signaling, and RG6292 did not block IL-2 signaling. H3F1-4V2 had higher affinity to 293T cells overexpressing human CD25 than Daclizumab (EC50=0.4nM vs 0.45nM), with lower Kd (0.88nM vs 1.5nM). Because of high affinities, H3F1-4V2 and Daclizumab both efficiently depleted Treg from PBMC in vitro, while RG6292 depleted Treg with weaker ability because of low affinity to CD25. In the Teff, downstream signaling of IL-2 was analyzed, and Daclizumab significantly decreased pSTAT5, while RG6292 and H3F1-4V2 kept the pSTAT5 level intact. PBMC was cultured in the presence of CD25 antibodies, and Daclizumab inhibited T cell proliferation (ki67+%) and activation (Granzyme B+%), but not for RG6292 and H3F1-4V2. At last, these CD25 antibodies were tested in humanized mice whose CD25 was replaced with human CD25, and MC38 tumor cells were transplanted into these mice.H3F1-4V2 completely suppressed tumor growth, while RG6292 also suppressed tumor growth with weaker efficiency and Daclizumab had little effect on tumor growth.

Both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) frequently overexpress in TNBC and cooperate with each other in autocrine and paracrine manner to enhance tumor growth and angiogenesis. Therapeutic mAbs targeting EGFR (cetuximab) and VEGFR2 (ramucirumab) are approved by FDA for numerous cancer indications, but none of them are approved to treat breast cancers. TNBC cells secrete VEGF-A, which mediate angiogenesis on endothelial cells in a paracrine fashion and promote cancer cell growth in autocrine manner. To disrupt autocrine\/paracrine loop in TNBC models in addition to mediating anti-EGFR tumor growth signaling and anti-VEGFR2 angiogenic pathway, we generated a bispecific antibody co-targeting EGFR and VEGFR2 (designated as anti-EGFR\/VEGFR2 BsAb), in which cetuximab IgG backbone is connected to the single chain variable fragment (scFv) of ramucirumab via a glycine linker. Physiochemical characterization data shows that anti-EGFR\/VEGFR2 BsAb binds to both EGFR and VEGFR2 in a similar binding affinity comparable to parental antibodies. Anti-EGFR\/VEGFR2 BsAb demonstrates potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in TNBC models. Mechanistically, anti-EGFR\/VEGFR2 BsAb not only directly inhibits both EGFR and VEGFR2 in TNBC cells but also disrupts autocrine mechanism in TNBC xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, anti-EGFR\/VEGFR2 BsAb blocks paracrine pathway mediated by VEGF\/VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. Collectively, our novel findings demonstrate that anti-EGFR\/VEGFR2 BsAb inhibits tumor growth via multiple mechanisms of action and has potential to be developed as an attractive targeted therapy for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17f96b20-7156-4262-885b-81f63671e0db\/@v03B8ZR3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody engineering,Bispecific antibody,EGFR,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18073"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nishant Mohan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary Olson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atul Agrawal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yukinori Endo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Rotstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorraine Pelosof<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wen Jin Wu<\/i><\/presenter>.

These intrinsic redox statuses capitalize on the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. Auranofin, an FDA-approved gold compound documented with effective pharmacokinetics and safety profiles in humans, has recently been repurposed for anticancer activity. This study examined the paclitaxel sensitizing effect of auranofin by targeting redox balance in the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. We observed that auranofin inhibits thioredoxin reductase activity (TrxR) in these breast cancer cells and collapses the cellular antioxidants status, including the reduced activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Furthermore, it has been noticed that auranofin augmented paclitaxel mediated cytotoxicity in a concentration dependant manner in both the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines. Furthermore, auranofin increased intracellular ROS levels (DCFH-DA staining) and altered mitochondrial membrane potential (Rhodamine-123 staining) in these breast cancer cell lines. The proapoptotic markers such as p53, Bax, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 expressions were higher in auranofin plus paclitaxel treated breast cancer cells when compared to paclitaxel alone treatment. Thus, the present results illustrate the chemosensitizing property of auranofin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8530493a-8fe5-443f-bff3-a9df905d2668\/@v03B8ZR3\/mp4?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-02 Biochemical modulators of the therapeutic index,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Oxidative stress,Taxol,Chemosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18542"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>N.

Antibodies targeting CD47 or SIRP&#945; are expected to block the CD47\/SIRP&#945; signaling pathway, thereby stimulating macrophage-based phagocytosis of tumor cells. Anti-CD47 antibodies usually have side effects related to anemia and thrombocytopenia since CD47 is expressed on normal cells, including red blood cells and platelets. Targeting SIRP&#945; on the macrophage is an alternative approach to blocking CD47\/SIRP&#945; signaling without the side effects observed in anti-CD47 antibody treatment. In addition to SIRP&#945; there are two other members of the SIRP family - SIRP&#946; and SIRP&#947;. These isoforms share high sequence homology with SIRP&#945; but have very different functionality. Moreover, SIRP&#945; is polymorphic in humans, among which SIRP&#945;V1, SIRP&#945;V2 and SIRP&#945;V8 are the main SIRP&#945; variants in diverse ethnic groups. Together, the key challenge of anti-SIRP&#945; antibody discovery is to identify lead candidates that specifically bind to SIRP&#945; and block the SIRP&#945;\/CD47 interaction while also recognizing the majority of SIRP&#945; variants.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures: <\/b>Humanized mice were used for immunization and the proprietary H<sup>3<\/sup> (<u>H<\/u>igh-throughput, <u>H<\/u>igh-content and <u>H<\/u>igh-efficiency) antibody screening platform was used to identify a lead candidate - BSI-082. Affinity was measured by SPR while specificity of antibodies to SIRP&#945; and blocking activity of CD47\/SIRP&#945; were evaluated by ELISA and FACS. Functional activity of antibodies was investigated using monocyte-derived macrophages and Raji cells in the presence of Rituximab with and without anti-SIRP&#945; antibody. Antibody internalization was evaluated by using the Biosion SynTracer&#8482; antibody discovery platform.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>BSI-082 is a fully human IgG1\/&#954; mAb that binds to SIRP&#945; and blocks the SIRP&#945;\/CD47-mediated signaling pathway. BSI-082 is a highly selective SIRP&#945; binder with very weak or no binding to SIRP&#946; and no binding to SIRP&#947;. In addition, BSI-082 binds three main SIRP&#945; variants (V1, V2 and V8) with high affinity. Through antibody engineering, BSI-082 harbors an engineered Fc domain that prevents Fc&#947;R binding and enhances FcRn binding, thus significantly reducing ADCC while also extending half-life. In the presence of rituximab, BSI-082 promotes macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. BSI-082 exhibits effective internalization, which would deplete SIRP&#945; on macrophages and enhance immune response.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> BSI-082 exhibits best-in-class biophysical properties, SIRP&#945; specificity, broad SIRP&#945; variant binding and superior functional characteristics, supporting the initiation of development activities including manufacturing and IND-enabling studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0fc6ecb-7814-4e4e-aa85-cb70bb36be02\/@v03B8ZR3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,SIRP&#945;,CD47,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18074"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zeyu Peng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinyu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenwen Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaodong F.

However, the clinical efficacy of sotorasib and other KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors is limited by intrinsic resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) and by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance in all treated solid tumors.

Compared with other uterine cancers, uterine LMS is an aggressive tumor associated with poor prognosis and has a high risk of recurrence and death, regardless of stage at presentation. Selinexor is a first-in-class selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound that binds covalently to exportin 1, thereby reactivating tumor suppressor proteins and downregulating the expression of oncogenes and DNA damage repair (DDR) proteins. Selinexor has demonstrated preclinical activity in various cancer types, including STS, and is currently in Phase I and II clinical trials for advanced cancers (Marretta et al. 2021). In this study, we evaluated the effects of Selinexor in combination with Dacarbazine, Gemcitabine, Doxorubicin, Pazopanib, Eribulin, and Trabectedin in LMS cell lines. The effects on cell viability were evaluated by treating the LMS cell lines SK-UT1 (p53-mut) and SK-UT1-B (p53 WT) with Selinexor and different chemotherapy combinations. Treatment with these drugs significantly decreased the cell proliferation and survival of SK-UT1 and SK-UT1-B cell lines tested <i>in vitro<\/i>. However, this effect was enhanced in SK-UT1 cells following treatment in the combination of Selinexor with Eribulin and Doxorubicin. The effects of treatment were also evaluated in mouse xenograft models generated with SK-UT1 cell lines. Treatment with Selinexor combined with Eribulin showed synergistic effects on tumor growth inhibition in SK-UT1 derived xenografts which warrant further investigation of these combinations at the clinical level.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b27de4a9-cbb6-4a54-a7af-9b2d949f602f\/@v03B8ZR3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,Cancer therapy,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18544"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"62a25d84-acd3-4718-9abf-3580f3c1f492","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/62a25d84-acd3-4718-9abf-3580f3c1f492\/@v03B8ZR3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sonam Mittal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ishaque Pulikkal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosef Landesman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Charlson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunila Pradeep<\/i><\/presenter>.

KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors have limited impact on the parallel oncogenic signaling driven by PI3K\/AKT, its regulator molecules such as the Rho GTPases, and their effectors. This signaling pathway can collectively promote p-ERK re-activation thereby blunting the efficacy of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> targeted drugs. The p21-activated kinase (PAK) family are crucial effectors of the Rho family of GTPases and act as regulatory switches that control important cellular processes including motility, proliferation, and survival. PAK4 is the main effector of Rho GTPase, cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42), and has an established role in mutant RAS-dependent tumor metastasis. In this study, we rationally targeted two parallel signaling pathways by combining KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors with the PAK4 inhibitor KPT-9274 in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant PDAC and NSCLC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We evaluated the cytotoxicity and molecular profile of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors in combination with PAK4 inhibitor KPT-9274 as well as positive control PF-3758309 in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant 2D and 3D cellular\/spheroid models. The anti-tumor activity of the combinations was evaluated in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant cell line-derived xenograft. Tumor volumes were assessed throughout the treatment period using an ultrasound scanner.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> PAK4 inhibitor KPT-9274 synergized with both sotorasib and adagrasib yielding suppressed growth of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant PDAC and NSCLC cells in 2D and 3D cultures, but not in KRAS<sup>wt<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>, and KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> cell lines (NCI RASless MEFs). In addition, the combination reduced the clonogenic potential of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant cancer cells. PAK4-KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor combinations resulted in enhanced and prolonged inhibition of KRAS downstream effector pathways. In xenograft studies, oral administration of KPT-9274 at sub-optimal dose (100 mg\/kg QD x 5 x 3 weeks) and sotorasib at one-fourth of MTD (25 mg\/kg QD x 5 x 3 weeks) demonstrated remarkable inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant MiaPaCa-2 tumor burden (p&#60;0.001 single agents vs combination treatment). Residual tumor analysis showed a reduction in proliferation index (ki67), activation of pro-apoptotic caspases, and inhibition of mutant RAS effector signaling. Studies in additional KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>xenograft and tumor explant models are ongoing.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This is the first study showing that KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors can synergize with PAK4 inhibitors. This combination can simultaneously target direct KRAS downstream effectors and the parallel PI3K\/AKT oncogenic signaling warranting further clinical investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a20abeb3-abde-4cf2-8a26-04d79b2ee4ea\/@w03B8ZR4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,KRAS G12C inhibitors,PAK4 inhibitor,KPT-9274,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18545"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Husain Yar Khan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sahar Bannoura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirva Mamdani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amro Aboukameel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yousef Mzannar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiwei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammad Najeeb Al-Hallak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ibrahim Azar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steve Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafic Beydoun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramzi Mohammad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosef Landesman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yue Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erkan Baloglu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Senapedis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ammar Sukari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Misako Nagasaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Shields<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asfar S.

Long-term ADT treatment results in adverse side-effects in patients including depression, frailty, cognitive impairment and dementia. Studies have reported increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory markers in older cancer patients, however, the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and the severity of cognition in prostate cancer patients under ADT has not been investigated. We sought to identify peripheral biomarkers that could provide links between the mental changes and major pathological mechanisms responsible for the development of cognition in these patients. For these studies, gene expression data (GSE69223) of 30 matched malignant and non-malignant prostate tissue samples from 15 prostate cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant antiandrogen therapy before prostatectomy, were compared in parallel with postmortem brain tissue samples of Parkinson's and Alzheimer patients as additional neurological diagnosis. IPA analysis was performed in the context of known biological response and regulatory networks. Fisher&#8217;s exact test for each network was converted to a score of &#8722;log10 (p-value). Further validation was performed<b> <\/b>in BT142-neural cells and M059K-glial cells by qRT-PCR with and without antiandrogen (enzalutamide) treatment. A total of 1952 DEGs were identified in postmortem brain tissue specimens, and 101 DEGs were identified in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT before surgery. IPA analysis revealed 33 commonly expressed genes with changes in cytokine-cytokine signaling network overlapped in both patient cohorts. Pathway analysis showed that IL17 signaling pathway, regulation of cytokine production and changes in T-cell subsets by IL-17A and IL-17F were overrepresented. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor and toll-like receptors were identified as upstream transcriptional regulators of these signaling pathways. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines <i>viz<\/i>. LIFR, IL1RN, IL6, IL10 and LIF were increased in both neural and glial cells treated with enzalutamide, compared to non-enzalutamide treated cells. Our results suggest that changes in cytokine signaling under the influence of ADT in prostate cancer patients may linked with cognitive impairment presenting new areas for diagnostic and therapeutic development in combating brain deficits.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e77c9726-a869-477e-bc0d-4e04abc6b20b\/@w03B8ZR4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen deprivation therapy,Gene expression profiling,Prognosis,Outcome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18546"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shiv Verma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eswar Shankar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viabhav Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sanjay Gupta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Combination therapy using retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) is considered standard treatment in the clinical environment. Resistance to both RA and ATO is associated with an increased risk of mortality. In addition, relapse occurs in approximately 10-20% of patients undergoing treatment for APL. Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) is a hypothalamic peptide that stimulates the release of Growth Hormone from the anterior pituitary. Our previous studies have demonstrated that human AML cell lines (K-562, THP-1, and KG-1a) display the GHRH receptor (GHRH-R). Incubation with GHRH-R antagonist MIA-602, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of GHRH-R antagonist MIA-602, on the NB4 Human Promyelocytic Leukemia cell line and its ATRA and ATO resistant sub-clone. NB4 cells expressed both GHRH-R and SV1 variants via western blot analysis. Wild type NB4 cells, as well as NB4 cells resistant to both ATRA and ATO (NB4-RAA), were cultured in suspension in RPMI and 10% fetal calf serum. NB4-RAA were established in Dr. Jimenez's lab from the wild type NB4 parent cell line. NB4 and NB4-RAA were plated in triplicate on multi-wells at 50,000 cells\/mL. Cell lysates were prepared after incubation with 0.05-5 &#181;mol\/L of MIA-602. Cell viability was measured at 24 and 48h. Flow cytometry was also performed on the na&#239;ve NB4 parent cell line in addition to NB4-RAA to assess expression of CD-56 the cell surface marker. Upregulation of CD-56, also known as Neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM-1), has been shown to confer drug resistance in AML and is an important prognostic marker in APL. The viability of both cell lines decreased to similar levels at 24 h and 48 h when exposed to concentrations of MIA-602 higher than 0.05 &#956;mol\/L (p &#60; 0.05). A significant decrease in cell viability was seen above 0.5 &#956;mol\/L after 48h. No viable cells were found in either cell line after 48h when exposed to 5 &#956;mol\/L of MIA-602. No difference in cell viability was found between na&#239;ve NB4 and resistant NB4-RAA when exposed to the same concentrations of MIA-602. MIA-602 induced significant changes in the expression level of many death-related genes including CASP9 (&#62;1.5-fold; P&#60;0.05). Results of flow cytometry revealed significantly increased expression of CD-56 (&#62;5.8-fold; p,0.05) in NB4-RAA cells as compared to the parent cell line. These results indicate that resistance to ATRA and ATO in APL cells does not confer subsequent resistance to MIA-602. As a result, MIA-602 targets a pathway that is distinct from that of ATRA &#38; ATO. More importantly, upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes by MIA-602 indicates an alternative pathway elicited by the GHRH-R antagonist in the setting of resistant APL cells. Our results indicate that the resistance to frontline APL therapy can be effectively overcome by using MIA-602.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2a690a33-8693-42dc-9ea6-5e3e0b83c1a4\/@w03B8ZR4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Acute myeloid leukemia,Arsenic trioxide,Retinoic acid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18547"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ravinder S.

BTN1A1 was identified as a potential stress-inducible candidate immune checkpoint using the STCube <i>in vivo<\/i> immune target discovery platform. Additional analyses revealed that BTN1A1 was highly expressed in multiple human tumor types including urothelial carcinoma and NSCLC, with no overlap between BTN1A1 and PD-1\/PDL-1 expression patterns. Mouse studies demonstrated that an anti-BTN1A1 antibody exhibited antitumor activity both as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 or radiation therapy. A humanized anti-BTN1A1 antibody, hSTC810, was developed and found to suppress tumor growth in A549 CDX humanized murine models. Further studies identified Galectin 9 (Gal9) as a BTN1A1 receptor that can form a three protein complex with BTN1A1 and PD-1, thereby suppressing T cell receptor signaling and T cell activation. As high Gal9 expression levels are correlated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers, our results highlight this BTN1A1-Gal9-PD-1 axis as a novel therapeutic target for immunotherapeutic drug development. Given these findings, a first in human study of hSTC810 is in development to evaluate the safety profile of this therapy and to identify a dose for its further evaluation as an anticancer therapy. PK modeling including allometric scaling was performed to conduct simulations to predict the PK profile of hSTC810 after IV administration in humans and to identify possible doses needed to achieve tumor concentrations corresponding to the minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) of 20% receptor occupancy (RO), 80% RO, or 95% RO. The partition coefficient was used to predict concentrations at the tumor site based on predicted serum concentrations. Simulations were performed for 100 subjects after the administration of multiple Q2W doses. The dose of 0.1 mg\/kg was predicted to have &#60;20% RO, 0.3 mg\/kg to have ~21-35% RO, 1 mg\/kg to have ~47-65% RO and 15 mg\/kg to have ~93-96% RO at steady state. We anticipate beginning study enrollment in the first quarter of 2022 at sites in the United States sand South Korea.

Three major families of enzymes are involved in the regulation of ubiquitination, including activating enzyme E1, Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 and ubiquitin ligase E3. UBE2K is an E2 conjugating ligase that was identified as an anti-cancer drug target from the BERG Interrogative Biology&#174; platform, an artificial intelligence multi-omics analytical method employing Bayesian algorithms. Herein, we used proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics to investigate the impact of the treatment of UBE2K small molecule ligand (BRG0451) on K562 leukemia cells. K562 cells were treated with 30, 100 and 300 nM concentrations for 24 hours with BRG0451 or Paclitaxel or 0.1% DMSO (Control). Cells were pelleted and analyzed using a multi-omics approach. Proteomic analysis was performed using Thermo Q-Exactive+ LC MS\/MS analysis. Lipidomic analysis was performed using SCIEX TripleTOF MS\/MS ALL shotgun workflow and metabolomics was performed using 3 different platforms (High resolution RP-LC-MS, HILIC QqQ LC-MS\/MS and GC-TOF MS). Unsupervised clustering and differential analysis were used to investigate the impact of the treatments. Proteomic analysis identified and quantified 6930 proteins from K562 cells using TMT labelling with offline 24 fractions and LC-MS\/MS. Structural lipidomics analysis evaluated 1980 lipid molecular species and metabolomics analysis identified over 700 metabolites using GC-MS, LC-MS and LC-MS\/MS. Multiomics and regression analysis for 30 nM BRG0451 treatment revealed no distinct pattern of omics variables. However, treatment on K562 cells with 300 nM treatment demonstrated 97 differentially expressed proteins compared to control. Pathway analysis revealed chromatin remodeling, and more specifically, regulation of chromatin silencing and localization to nucleolus as major pathways impacted by differentially expressed proteins. Similar pathways were impacted by Paclitaxel and Nocodazole treatment compared to control. Additionally, metabolomic and lipidomic differentials were observed with 300 nM BRG0451 treatment. Structural lipidomics revealed dose -dependent changes in triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters, glycolipid monounsaturated species, and glycolipid medium carbon chain subgroups. Dose dependent impact on amino acids metabolism, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism was observed with a high degree of similarity for compared drugs. Herein, we demonstrated the use of multi-omics technology in deconvoluting the impact of BRG0451 on independent biological pathways, revealing the intricate mechanisms targeting cell cycle as well as ubiquitin regulator components in a leukemia cell line.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5dc30d44-87b5-4a3e-b8ef-ac1eaf1d2f42\/@w03B8ZR4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Proteomics,Drug discovery,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18549"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Punit Shah<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Searfoss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valerie Bussberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bennett Greenwood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shraddha Karmacharya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison MacDonald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kennedy Ofori-Mensa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vladimir Tolstikov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pragalath Sundararajan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria-Dorothea Nastke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric M.

UBE2K was identified as a drug target from the BERG Interrogative Biology&#174; Platform, from an Artificial Intelligence derived <i>in vitro <\/i>pan-cancer Bayesian network. UBE2K (also known as Huntington Interacting Protein 2 and E2-25K) is one of the ~40 E2 enzymes from the Ubiquitin Proteasome System and belongs to the Class II of E2 enzymes that preferentially catalyze the synthesis of Lys48-linked changes on monoubiquitinated substrates. Recently, high expression of UBE2K in tumors of gastric cancer patients has been shown to associate with poor prognosis. BERG has developed BRG399 as a candidate molecule to modulate UBE2K activity for use in oncology. Here, we evaluated the anti-cancer effect of BRG399 using Hs 746T, a human xenograft <i>in vivo<\/i> model for gastric cancer. <i>In vitro<\/i> evaluation of BRG399 potency revealed an IC50 of 44.3nM in Hs 746T cells. For determination of BRG399 potency <i>in vivo<\/i>, nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with Hs 746T cell line and tumors were allowed to reach 120mm<sup>3<\/sup>. Animals were then randomized into four groups to receive oral administration of vehicle, 75, 100, or 150mg\/kg of BRG399 twice per day for 15 days. The result revealed that BRG399 significantly decreased the growth of Hs 746T tumors in a dose-dependent manner. Statistical analysis using a mixed effect linear model of the tumor volumes on the last day of study demonstrated a tumor growth inhibition of 60.3, 71.2 and 85.3% at the three doses, respectively, without any significant effect on body weight. These results are well correlated with the dose-dependent increase of BRG399 in both plasma and tumor tissues. Anti-tumor effect of BRG399 appears to be the result of G2\/M arrest, as indicated by a dose-dependent elevation of two cell cycle-dependent biomarkers, CNNB1 and pHH3, in tumor tissue. This is consistent with the role of UBE2K in regulating several components of cell cycle for dictating the precise timing of cell division. Mixed effect multivariable regression modeling was employed to identify the relationship between these two biomarkers and response. This analysis indicated that the level of plasma concentration of BRG399, together with the tumor levels of CNNB1 and pHH3, are significantly and negatively associated with tumor volume, allowing an inference that these biomarkers are indicative and\/or involved in the tumor response of BRG399. In summary, these results signify the anti-cancer efficacy of BRG399 and support its potential as a drug candidate for treatment of gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1daac5f6-f8f3-4be6-981d-29fc3841ffec\/@x03B8ZR5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Ubiquitination,Drug discovery,Cell cycle arrest,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18550"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shiva Kazerounian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mollie O'Hara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arcan Guven<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kashni Grover<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Pellegrino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kayleigh Gray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Can Bruce<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory M.

Here, we introduce BRG399, a novel modulator of UBE2K - a unique E2 conjugating enzyme of the UPS, that we previously identified as a potential therapeutic target using BERG&#8217;s Interrogative Biology&#174; platform. The anticancer potential of UBE2K modulation was validated by gene manipulation using siRNA mediated knockdown of UBE2K in several cancer cell models. Knockdown of UBE2K resulted in a 50% decrease in cell number in MIA PaCa2 cells and a 30% decrease in cell number in SKHEP1 and HepG2 cells at 96h post transfection. This effect was the result of a robust G2\/M cell cycle arrest associated with increased CyclinB1 expression. In addition, a modest increase in apoptosis\/necrosis (6-8%) was observed in cells with UBE2K knockdown. Using Fragment-Based Ligand Discovery and structure-based drug design, BRG399 was developed as a new chemical entity (NCE) which binds to UBE2K, resulting in modulation of several established canonical functions and an anti-cancer phenotype. In a panel of 102 cancer cell lines, BRG399 exhibited an anti-cancer activity in all cell lines tested as evident by extrapolation of IC<sub>50<\/sub> and %Max Effect values from the dose response curves. In all but one cell line, double to triple digit nanomolar potency was observed ranging from 17nM to 318 nM and viability of 76 cell lines was reduced by more than 70%. The anti-cancer potency of BRG399 was also established in a multi-tumor type panel of patient-derived organoids (PDO) of which 68% were highly or partially responsive to BRG399 as indicated by 37-73% decrease in PDO viability. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that BRG399&#8217;s anti-cancer effect was a result of a robust G2\/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis mediated cell death. Molecular events associated with G2\/M arrest included stabilization of CyclinB1 and sustained activation of cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1, while those associated with apoptosis involved decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 and increased expression of cleaved PARP (cPARP) and Capase 3. Together, these results support a novel role for UBE2K in the regulation of the cell cycle in cancer cells and demonstrate that its modulation by BRG399 influences phenotypic end-points consistent with an anti-cancer effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/442eebf7-741c-41cc-b6f2-cbc8d6d272f1\/@x03B8ZR5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Cell cycle arrest,Antitumor effect,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18551"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria-Dorothea Nastke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marisa Permatteo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pragalath Sundararajan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shefali Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Matson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaleigh Gray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arcan Guven<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiva Kazerounian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Diers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rangaprasad Sarangarajan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niven R.

It has been proposed that inhibitors targeting PDE10 may exhibit antitumor activities. Previous studies have shown that PDE10 inhibition can selectively activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase to suppress oncogenic &#946;-catenin signaling in colon cancer cells. However, the impact of PDE10 inhibitors on tumor cell immunogenicity has not been examined. Here we report the antitumor activity and immunomodulatory effect of a novel PDE10 inhibitor (ADT030) in preclinical models. We show that administration of ADT030 significantly inhibited the growth of murine colorectal cancer CT26. In a metastatic breast tumor model (4T1), ADT030 administration not only delayed the growth of the primary tumor but also reduced tumor metastasis, resulting in prolonged mouse survival. Immunological analysis revealed profound reduction of MDSCs in mice, and improved T cell tumor infiltration and function after ADT030 treatment. Moreover, the combination of ADT030 and anti-PD-1 antibody therapy led to further improved tumor growth control and mouse survival. These results implicate PDE10 as a promising therapeutic target and its inhibition may enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d9aafbef-d642-4e72-92f9-73786b73c258\/@x03B8ZR5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Inhibitors,Metastasis,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18552"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Md Yeashin Gazi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caitlin Brandle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ogacheko Okoko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Keeton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yulia Maxuitenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gary Piazza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gang Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have extended validation studies of a new liquid biopsy test panel that uses an amplicon-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel with a semiconductor-based system, the Ion GeneStudio S5 Prime. The workflow requires very low input (20 ng) of cell-free nucleic acids extracted from human plasma and has been demonstrated to yield results in less than 72 hours from sample receipt at the laboratory. This report details the analytic performance of the test panel for detecting copy number variations (CNVs), fusions and exon skipping variants in plasma. These data add to previously reported validation data for the detection of somatic nucleotide variants (SNV) and indels [97.7% - 100% concordant with orthogonal droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) tests]. The updated study sample sets included consented clinical and normal healthy, donor specimens, and reference cell lines to detect fusions and exon skipping [HCC78 (ROS1), CRL-5935 (EML4-ALK), KM12 (NTRK1) and HTB-178 (MET exon 14 skipping)], and CNVs [CRL-5928 (HER2 gain), SK-BR-3 (HER2, CDK6, EGFR and MYC gains), HCC-827 (EGFR gain) and CRL-5909 (MET gain)]. The limit of detection (LOD) for fusion\/skipping was initially established at a molecular coverage of 42 copies and was then verified by detection of three additional fusion\/skipping variants. The LOD for CNVs was initially established at 1.40 fold-change and was then verified with the detection of three additional CNVs. Verification was conducted with specimens near the initially established LOD. In the precision studies, all expected fusion\/skipping variants were detected in all runs and all days of testing (n=18\/18) generating a hit rate of 100%. An average CV of 20.5% (range 8.7% to 34.8%) for repeatability and 20.8% (range 15.7% to 30.5%) for reproducibility was established. Twenty eight of 29 CNVs were detected, generating a hit rate of 96.6%. An average CV of 1.85% (range 0% to 5.49%) for repeatability and 6.59% (range 1.65% to 9.22%) for reproducibility was established for detected CNVs. We conclude that the validated test panel meets the criteria for being rapid, highly sensitive and specific, and has utility for the reporting of clinically relevant variants of interest in multiple cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/32c3925f-a6c9-45a2-b135-2d9ea1c4879a\/@x03B8ZR5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer markers,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18553"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Audrey Audetat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cherie Tschida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Kreston<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leisa Jackson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hestia Mellert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Stephen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Gary A.

The different cell clones present in a tumor can display distinct molecular and phenotypic profiles, which may influence proliferation capabilities, metastatic potential and response to therapy. To better understand cancer progression and possibly design effective therapeutic strategies, it is fundamental to design cell-sorting technologies able to isolate rare, viable tumor cell clones from tissue or liquid biopsies. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is the most widely used technique to isolate cell populations from heterogeneous samples. However, FACS analysis presents technical limitations when applied to rare cell populations and\/or samples with low cellularity and limitations associated with the low total number of target cells in the sample. DEParray&#8482; PLUS (DA) is a highly automated image-based cell sorting technology capable of isolating pure, single and rare cells from heterogeneous samples. Here we evaluate the capabilities of the DA system to isolate a small number of viable tumor cells and assess the proliferation capacity of DA-sorted cells in comparison with FACS-sorted cells. Human Jurkat T lymphoblast cell line were cultured in RPMI medium and a double staining procedure was optimized to label cells with CellTraceFarRed (CTFR), division tracking dye and Live\/Dead (LD) Fixable marker. CTFR\/LD staining was performed for each experiment and, at days 0 and 7 of culture, CTFR and LD fluorescences were analyzed by means of BD CANTO II Flow cytometry. At day 0, FACS analysis discriminate dead from live cells, while at day 7 evaluate cell proliferation and viability after 7 days in culture. Comparison tests were carried out following two different recovery schemes: 1 recovery of 100 CTFR+\/LD- cells pool and 10 recoveries of 10 CTFR+\/LD- cells pool using DA Plus and BD FACSAria Fusion. For each experiment, the results were compared to cells seeded manually, which represent our unsorted control. When comparing the results obtained with a 100-cells pool, no significant difference in cell viability and proliferation were observed between DA-sorted and FACSAria-sorted cells after 7 days in culture. On the other hand, the 10 cells pool sorted with DA PLUS showed a significantly higher viability and proliferation rate compared to those sorted with FACSAria at day 7. Moreover, cells sorted by DA-technology showed less variation between experiments, highlighting a more robust performance when sorting a small number of cells. Overall, the results confirm the unique capability of the DA system to sort a small number of cells, which maintain a higher cell viability and proliferation capacity compared to those sorted with FACS. This opens up the possibility to isolate rare tumor cell clones for functional studies that can help to better understand tumor progression and response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a3a7253-0def-4553-bee0-cfaa8bf72a71\/@x03B8ZR5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell proliferation,cell sorting,rare cells,Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18554"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"37555fd8-fb8a-48b4-9f1f-2040d9447d55","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/37555fd8-fb8a-48b4-9f1f-2040d9447d55\/@x03B8ZR5\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Maximilian Sergio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Rossi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Valeria Stivani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilaria Maffei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Rossi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianpiero Parisi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianni Medoro<\/i><\/presenter>.

Numerous challenges hinder the successful development of new therapies, including drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the lack of clinically predictive cancer models. Here, we present the results of an image-based <i>ex vivo<\/i> drug-testing platform that addresses these therapeutic roadblocks. To demonstrate the clinical utility of our platform, in a retrospective cohort of 14 GBM patients, we show that <i>ex vivo<\/i> sensitivity to Temozolomide (TMZ, 1<sup>st<\/sup>-line GBM chemotherapy), is associated with longer progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Next, by screening 150 clinically approved drugs across 27 GBM surgical patient samples, we identify a set of BBB-permeable neuroactive drugs with anti-glioma activity. These neurological drugs display remarkably consistent on-target killing of cancer cells with minimal toxicity to non-malignant TME cells across both primary and recurrent GBM samples. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of GBM patient samples and functional genetics reveals novel glioma-dependencies on neurological drug-target expression. Furthermore, a drug-target network enrichment analysis uncovers an AP1\/BTG\/TP53 gene signature associated with the anti-glioma activity of neurological drugs. <i>In silico <\/i>screening of over 1 million compounds for this common gene signature identified additional drug hits that could be validated in patient samples with 90% accuracy. Multiplexed transcriptomics revealed AP-1 transcription factor family activation to be the common underlying feature of neurological drugs with anti-glioma activity. Among the most promising candidate drugs, we identify the atypical antidepressant Vortioxetine as the strongest inducer of this gene signature, and confirm its efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i> across multiple mouse models. Vortioxetine in combination with Temozolomide or Lomustine further increased median survival <i>in vivo<\/i> compared to single agents alone. This study thus provides a clinically predictive and personalized drug-testing platform that identifies new treatment opportunities for GBM, warranting further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/97530274-6984-4a0d-844f-8989ce1cd003\/@x03B8ZR5\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Precision medicine,Image analysis,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18555"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sohyon Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Weiss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcel Bühler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebekka Wegmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Mena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michel Bihl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Goetze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Van Drogen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabeth J.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a targeted EV to deliver a newly identified natural cytotoxic marine compound verrucarin A (Ver-A) or combination with highly potent microtubule polymerization inhibitor mertansine (DM1). The tumor models, glioblastoma (GBM), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and others, were used to validate the developed targeted therapy. First, the stirred-tank bioreactor-based EV biomanufacturing was optimized by developing a two-step purification procedure using size exclusion (300 kDa) and affinity (CD63) columns in liquid chromatography system. Second, both single and dual tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as anti-SSTR2, CD276, EGFR and\/or CD47 mAb either developed in house or used in clinics, were tagged on the surface of PEGylated EV to construct mAb-EV-drugs. The flow cytometry analysis, live-cell confocal images and IC<sub>50<\/sub> assay revealed the effective surface binding, intracellular drug delivery and high anti-cancer cytotoxicity of mAb-EV-drugs in cancer cell lines, and the biodistribution study confirmed the tumor targeting in xenograft mouse models. Furthermore, the maximum tolerated dose study showed minimal systemic toxicity, as confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin staining of multiple important organs. Finally, the anti-tumor efficacy study demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor growth by mAb-EV-Ver-A or Ver-A\/DM1 in cell line-derived xenograft models, patient-derived xenograft models, and\/or immunocompetent xenograft models. This study suggested that the targeted EV is an efficient platform to deliver combined potent chemotherapies to treat cancer or tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b691942-b158-4761-bab2-ba516d8c0e8a\/@x03B8ZR5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Targeted drug delivery,Chemopreventive agents,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18556"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kai Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingnan Si<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seulhee Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuoxin Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lufang Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>X.

NIR-PIT have already developed using a conjugate of a photoabsorber, IRdye700DX (IR700), and a monoclonal antibody which recognizes protein antigens on the target cells. In this study, we firstly developed a lectin-photoabsorber conjugate (BC2-IR700) and investigated a new cancer therapy targeting cancer cell surface glycans.<br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b>We developed BC2-IR700 by conjugation of rBC2LCN lectin with IR700 NHS ester. A pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 was used as a model which is bound by rBC2LCN. The cytotoxic effect of NIR-PIT with BC2-IR700 was first evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i>. We then evaluated the anti-cancer effect of BC2-IR700 <i>in vivo<\/i> using pancreatic cancer xenograft mice including subcutaneous tumor model. <i><\/i> <b>Results: <\/b>The product of BC2-IR700 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, that showed reasonable 16KDa sharp band with clear fluorescence intensity. After incubation with BC2-IR700, Capan-1 cells showed high fluorescence signal, which was confirmed with flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. BC2-IR700 was detected on the cell surface of Capan-1 after incubation for 1h. Immediately after exposure to NIR light, the cell death of Capan-1 was induced and the cytotoxicity significantly increased in a light-dose-dependent manner. After intravenous administration of BC2-IR700 into pancreatic cancer xenograft mice, BC2-IR700 was observed <i>in vivo<\/i> fluorescence imaging to be accumulated in tumor. NIR-PIT was performed by exposing to NIR light (100 J\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>) at 6 h following BC2-IR700 intravenous administration (20 &#956;g\/mice). Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the NIR-PIT treatment group compared with the other control groups such as no treatment, BC2-IR700 only, and NIR light exposure only (P &#60; 0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The lectin-photoabsorber conjugate, BC2-IR700, was able to be sufficiently applied for NIR-PIT in <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse model. The novel NIR-PIT targeting cell surface glycans could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a455d83-440b-49e4-99ee-dee1020bdfc1\/@x03B8ZR5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Photoimmunotherapy,Glycan,Lectin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18558"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yukihito Kuroda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Osamu Shimomura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiromitsu Nakahashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomoaki Furuta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshihiro Miyazaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahito Nakajima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroaki Tateno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatsuya Oda<\/i><\/presenter>.

Treatment is hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that restricts entry of the vast majority of cancer therapeutics to the brain. We have designed a peptide-drug conjugate, (Pt(IV)-M13), comprised of M13, a perfluoroaryl-stapled cell-penetrating peptide, covalently linked to Pt(IV) via an amide bond. Upon intracellular reduction the Pt(IV) prodrug releases active cisplatin eliciting DNA damage and cell death. To investigate the properties of Pt(IV)-M13 in detail, we determined <i>in vitro <\/i>cell killing, platinum brain accumulation, biodistribution, and efficacy in mouse models.<br \/><b>METHODS.<\/b> Pt(IV)-M13 tumor cytotoxicity was assessed <i>in vitro <\/i>using standard approaches. <i>In vivo<\/i> platinum levels were measured in the brain by ICP-MS, and BBB penetration assessed through a multicellular 3D <i>in vitro <\/i>BBB<i> <\/i>model, and biodistribution to peripheral organs was determined. Toxicity from bi-weekly injections of the Pt(IV)-M13 platinum conjugate was monitored from 5mg\/kg to 30mg\/kg. Animal survival was determined in a glioblastoma xenograft model. DNA damage was quantified by &#947;H2AX staining.<br \/><b>RESULTS.<\/b> Pt(IV)-M13 possesses <i>in vitro<\/i> tumor cell killing effects similar to cisplatin and Pt(IV) alone. Pt(IV)-M13 showed increased BBB penetration when compared to cisplatin in our <i>in vitro <\/i>BBB spheroid model (&#62;20-fold), in brain tissue (7-fold) and glioblastoma tumor-bearing mice (8-fold). Five hours after intravenous injection, biodistribution of platinum delivered by Pt(IV)-M13 was higher than cisplatin in the spleen, but lower in the heart. Bi-weekly injections of Pt(IV)-M13 were well-tolerated in nude mice to at least 15mg\/kg, three times the reported cisplatin MTD. Finally, Pt(IV)-M13 treatment increased survival in a murine glioblastoma xenograft model (median survival= 33 days for Pt(IV)-M13 vs. 22.5 days for cisplatin and 24 days Pt(IV) alone. Elevated &#947;H2AX foci were observed in Pt(IV)-M13 treated mice providing direct support for the improved delivery of cisplatin to brain tumors using this approach.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION.<\/b> Pt(IV)-M13 leads to enhanced BBB penetration and cisplatin accumulation in glioblastoma models, with consequent animal survival benefit. Overall, our data support further investigation and development of Pt(IV)-M13 for glioblastoma treatment. Future studies will include additional glioblastoma models, and further optimization of this approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c1e7bd1-df89-4356-9651-759b959d714c\/@y03B8ZR6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Blood-brain barrier,Brain tumors,Peptides,Platinum drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18559"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jorge-Luis Jimenez-Macias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yen-Chun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomer Finkelberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gilles Berger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michal Nowicki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Choi-Fong Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bogdan Fedeles<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrei Loas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brad Penetelute<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sean E.

Earlier we showed that nuclear exporter protein exportin 1 (XPO1) is a valid therapeutic target in PDAC and selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) selinexor (Sel), synergistically enhances the efficacy of GemPac in pancreatic cancer cells, spheroids, patient derived tumors and showed evaluable response in PDAC patients in a Phase I study. Here we investigated the mechanisms of this synergy utilizing PDAC cellular models <i>in vitro<\/i> and LSL-Kras G12D\/+; Trp53 fl\/+; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse model.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used single-nuclei RNA sequencing in KPC tumors, and poly A RNA sequencing in PDAC cells post sel-Gem-Pac treatment.

Molecular analysis of residual KPC tumors showed re-organization of tumor stromal architecture, suppression of proliferation and nuclear retention of tumor suppressors. Histopathological analysis for Ki67 suggests comparatively lower rate of proliferation and enhanced nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a in the treated mice. Loosening of stroma and lowering of collagen fiber is also evident in treated mice from Picrosirius and Masson&#8217;s trichrome staining. Additionally, the KPC derived primary tumor cells showed reduced colony formation upon combination treatment. Sn-seq showed reduction in tumor cell heterogeneity (less cell clusters based on gene expression), CDK8, CD44 and Camk1d stem cell and EMT related genes alongside significant alterations in mitochondrial signaling after combination treatment. In cellular models, GO and GSEA analyses of RNA-seq data predicted DNA templated regulation of transcription and DNA replication associated genes in Sel or Sel-GemPac mediated growth inhibition. The top downregulated genes including drug resistant related gene PFN1 and HSP90 identified in Sel or Sel-GemPac treated PDAC cells from RNA-seq data were validated using RNAi and confirmed their role in synergy.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Taken together Selinexor in combination with Gemcitabine-nab-Paclitaxel enhanced the survival of KPC mice through inhibition of well-connected tumor promoting molecules resulting in broad penetration in PDAC supporting signaling.

When activated by near-infrared light, AU-011 has a dual mechanism of action inducing rapid, tumor necrosis resulting in pro-immunogenic cell death and long-term anti-tumor immunity. HPV-derived VLPs bind a wide variety of tumor types via modified heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) found on the tumor surface. This study explores the breadth of tumor types that could benefit from a targeted treatment intervention with AU-011 and surveys genes and biological pathways that are positively and negatively associated with this targeting.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> AU-011 binding, cytotoxicity and HSPG specificity was surveyed in 127 tumor cell lines representing breast, cervical, CNS (glioblastoma, astrocytoma), colon, esophageal, gastric, hematopoietic, lung, liver, melanoma (cutaneous or choroidal), oropharyngeal, ovarian, pancreas, prostate, renal, urothelial and skin cancers, and sarcomas (osteosarcomas, mesotheliomas, retinoblastomas).

The aim of this study is to investigate whether perforin-rich tumor microenvironment could inhibit tumor growth. Advanced prostate cancer (PC) expresses high amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) that is a possible therapeutic target, therefore, we constructed a PSA promoter-driven perforin expression vector for its predominant expression in tumor microenvironment of PC. Prostate membrane-specific antigen (PSMA) expressed on PC cell surface is also an attractive therapeutic target. To deliver perforin expression vector to PC, it was encapsulated in liposomes conjugated with anti-PSMA antibody (PSMA-pLipo), then the anti-tumor effect of PSMA-pLipo was evaluated using docetaxel-resistant PC cell line, 22Rv1DR, expressing both PSA and PSMA. The conjugated anti-PSMA antibody on PSMA-pLipo recognized recombinant PSMA protein, and incubation with PSMA-pLipo induced perforin expression in 22Rv1DR cells but not in PC-3 cells not expressing both PSA and PSMA. Growth of 22Rv1DR and PC-3 cells was barely inhibited by PSMA-pLipo alone. Perforin functions in concert with cytotoxic lymphocytes, therefore anti-tumor effect of PSMA-pLipo was analyzed in the presence of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Low concentration of PSMA-pLipo with human PBMCs significantly inhibited growth of 22Rv1DR cells but not PC-3 cells. High concentration of PSMA-pLipo with human PBMCs showed nearly complete inhibition of 22Rv1DR cell growth. In a mouse xenograft model implanted with 22Rv1DR cells, PSMA-pLipo was intravenously administrated via tale vein and tumor volume was monitored. PSMA-pLipo inhibited growth of 22Rv1DR cells compared to injection of anti-PSMA antibody alone.

A PROTAC is a heterobifunctional small molecule with three distinct moieties: a ligand to bind a targeted protein of interest (POI), a second ligand to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase to form a ternary complex, and a linker for bridging the two ligands. Through the E3 ubiquitin ligase pathway, properly designed PROTACs can effectively degrade POIs with high specificity, which can be pathogenic proteins, thus regulate related pathways and inhibit tumor growth. Currently, there is no high-throughput biochemical assay to measure the POI degradation <i>in vitro<\/i>, hindering the application of the PROTAC technology. Here we report the development of a high-throughput cell based assay to quantitatively measure the endogenous drug target degradation induced by PROTACs. This assay encompasses over 800 cancer cell lines, many of which are CRISPR-engineered ones on common drug targets. A unique feature of our assay is the incorporation of HiBiT short sequence tags on either N-terminal or C-terminal of endogenous protein in E3 ligase matched cell line through site-specific gene homologous recombination technology. By highly specific and sensitive detection of HiBiT tag content in cell lysates with biochemical assay, we can determine target protein degradation by PROTAC treatment. We demonstrate the utility of the assay on a wide array of drug targets including RAS, LDHA, BTK and HPK1, and show that it can accelerate PROTAC drug discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e38fbef4-d67f-478d-9dfd-e7fea523f4c3\/@y03B8ZR6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,PROTACs,LDH,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19015"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yunpeng Zhai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Defu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guoqian Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinying Ning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Feng Hao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Antibody drugs targeting PD1\/PD-L1 have brought significant benefits for cancer patients. In the post-PD1\/PD-L1 era, many novel targets for tumor-related immune modulation have been discovered, and tremendous efforts have been put to develop new biologics for these targets. There is an urgent need for a high-throughput functional system that mimics tumor immune microenvironment to screen antibodies. Equipped with expertise in tumor immunology and cell biology, KYinno has generated a panel of reporter cell lines to accelerate immune-checkpoint antibody discovery. The reporter system includes two types of engineered cell lines, one is CHO-K1 or 293T based aAPC (artificial antigen presenting cell) which provides both stimuli and inhibitor (ligand) signals, and the other one is Jurkat-NFAT-luciferase reporter cell line that over-expresses the drug target (receptor). In this co-culture system, the ligand-receptor complex can induce NFAT inhibitory signals. The functional antibodies can rescue the inhibitory signal by blockage of the ligand-receptor interaction. All the reporter cell lines have been well validated with benchmark antibodies. Currently, the systems cover immune modulation for TIGIT, LILRB1, LILRB2, PVRIG, Lag3, TIM3, NKG2a, NKp30, PD1, NKp46, etc.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/22e114ce-2798-449c-9f36-e9592740b532\/@y03B8ZR6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Jurkat,NFAT,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19016"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Guoqian Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengcheng Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongling Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinying Ning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Feng Hao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In previously reported work, NN2101-DM1, a fully human, anti-cKIT antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), was developed as a proof-of-concept (PoC) entity by conjugating the site-nonspecific and uncleavable linker SMCC with the microtubule inhibitory payload DM1. This linker-payload system is the same used in ado-trastuzumab emtansine, an approved ADC for HER2-positive breast cancer. NN2101-DM1 showed therapeutic efficacy against SCLC and GIST both <i>in vitro<\/i> and in xenograft models <i>in vivo<\/i>, demonstrating the feasibility of ADC development using NN2101. Despite the potent efficacy of NN2101-DM1, there are inherent limitations to SMCC linker and DM1 payload systems. The nonspecific attachment of the linker to the antibody produces highly heterogeneous drug-antibody ratios (DARs) with unpredictable attachment. Additionally, impaired lysosomal proteolytic activity has been shown to contribute to resistance to SMCC-DM1 cleavage. To optimize the ADC configuration for advancement to a clinical candidate, four types of ADC with different linker-payload combinations and DARs were designed, and their efficacy and safety were evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Among them, NN3201, a conjugation of the antimitotic payload MMAE to the cKIT-targeting antibody NN2101 via a site-specific, cleavable peptide linker, with a homogenous (&#62;95%) DAR of 4 was selected as a lead candidate. This linker system utilizes a cysteine re-bridging technology to produce site-specific conjugation with high DAR homogeneity. NN3201 showed consistent sub-nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub>s in several <i>in vitro<\/i> cell lines and demonstrated complete remission as monotherapy in SCLC (H526), GIST (GIST-T1), AML (Kasumi-1), and mastocytoma (HMC 1.2) cell-derived xenograft models in doses ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg\/kg. There were no significant toxicities detected at doses up to 60 mg\/kg in normal mice, suggesting a therapeutic index greater than 20 times. In conclusion, NN3201 showed potent anti-tumor activity and was selected as preclinical candidate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/11eae76f-a315-4426-9936-e7b4ff79ef07\/@z03B8ZR7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Lung cancer: small cell,Gastrointestinal stromal tumor,Leukemias: acute myeloid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19918"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"93e4c4b0-b22c-4b7d-849e-5703626c9107","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/93e4c4b0-b22c-4b7d-849e-5703626c9107\/@z03B8ZR7\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jin-Ock Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han-Jik Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jae-Won Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Gyu Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

The pyridinobenzodiazepine (PDD) platform is a toolbox of sequence-selective, DNA Guanine mono-alkylating ADC payloads with varying potencies and biophysical properties, enabling a payload-based approach to targeting solid tumours and haematological malignancies. We recently reported the development of a lower potency DNA mono-alkylator, FGX20-75, with substantially superior <i>in vivo <\/i>properties to other DNA alkylating agents and an efficacy\/tolerability profile on-par with a topoisomerase inhibitor-based ADC. This molecule is active in the low nanomolar range (<i>i.e., <\/i>median potency of 6 nM across a 15 cell-line screen), but is sufficiently hydrophilic to allow efficient conjugation to IgG antibodies with Drug Antobody Ratios (DARs) of up to 7. A maleimide-linked analogue of FGX20-75 has been conjugated to a number of antibodies with a DAR of 4. The ADCs produced exhibit significant <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy in human tumour xenograft models. For example, in one case, an ADC targeted to an undisclosed antigen produced complete tumour regressions at 10 mg\/kg dosing (Q7dx2) in patient-derived xenograft model of osteosarcoma. A substantially increased tolerability profile compared to other DNA-interactive payloads has been observed (<i>e.g.<\/i>, single dose MED of &#60; 1 mg\/kg and MTD in mice of up to 80 mg\/kg for a DAR 4 construct). Furthermore, in cynomolgus toxicity studies, a HNSTD has yet to be established at 8 mg\/kg. Thus, the increase in loading compared to other DNA-interactive payloads compensates for the drop in potency of FGX20-75, resulting in a potent ADC with substantially increased tolerability and potent efficacy in solid tumours. The favourable hydrophobicity profile of the low potency alkylator FGX20-75, and its ease of conjugation to antibodies, along with the significant <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy and tolerability of the ADCs produced from it, suggest that this low potency DNA-alkylating payload represents a promising new approach in the treatment of solid tumours.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c00dcaa-51dc-43c0-8f99-4188e4d456a5\/@z03B8ZR7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Alkylating agents,Solid tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21370"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul J.
