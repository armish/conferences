[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Endometrial cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gynecologic cancer in the US; the incidence is rising, and survival rates for this cancer are decreasing. There is a paucity of effective treatment for recurrent endometrial cancer, especially high grade endometrial cancers (HGEC) which include serous, carcinosarcoma, endometrioid, and clear cell histologies. Models that mimic the clinical and molecular characteristics of HGEC are lacking. To support the development of next generation therapeutics for endometrial cancer, we report on the establishment of 3D endometrial patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from HGEC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>26 Tumors from 21 different patients with HGEC (Serous, Carcinosarcoma, Clear Cell and High-grade Endometrioid subtypes) who underwent surgical resection (n= 13), biopsy (n = 7), paracentesis (n = 3) or thoracentesis (n = 3) were passaged as 3D organoid cultures in Matrigel in an optimized media. Robust models (defined by average days to passage <u>&#60;<\/u>14 days) were viably banked. 3 frozen models were also thawed and re-cultured to assess the viability post freezing. PDOs were collected for H&#38;E staining and their histology was compared to the original diagnosis. DNA replication rate and the effect of replication stress on organoid growth were assessed by the DNA Fiber Assay and immunofluorescence (IF). Finally, an established clear cell endometrial cancer organoid model was engrafted in mice to generate a Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) model.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Endometrial PDOs were successfully developed from 19 of 26 original samples for an overall success rate of 73.1%. Successful PDOs were developed from multiple histologies, including 8 carcinosarcoma, 6 uterine serous, 2 endometrioid, 2 clear cell and 1 mixed uterine serous and endometrioid. Though biopsy samples had initially fewer viable cells, our overall success rate was similar at 85.7% compared to 84.6% for surgical resections and higher than 66.7% for paracenteses. Samples obtained via thoracentesis did not form PDOs. Endometrial PDOs were histologically validated to match the primary patient tumor. Freeze thawing had no effect on morphology and growth characteristics. DNA fiber assays could be successfully conducted in PDOs, with a reduction in replication rate observed in PDO models treated with ATR or WEE1 inhibitors, with concurrent increase in y-H2AX and decrease in pRPA2 observed by IF. We also successfully generated a validated PDX model from organoids. Studies to determine molecular fidelity between the original patient tumor and established organoids are ongoing.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We describe the successful establishment of 19 endometrial PDO models which retain original tumor morphology and demonstrate sensitivity to drug-induced DNA damage. 3D endometrial organoids can therefore be used for further target discovery and validation as well as biomarker studies to advance targeted therapies for high-grade endometrial cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/adfd9d78-41d8-416d-b6bf-affc89777bd0\/@t03B8ZMA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Organoids,Preclinical,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14449"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aisha L.

Furthermore, Hispanic\/Latino Americans continue to be underrepresented in GC genomic studies despite being twice as likely to be diagnosed with and die from GC compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). In order to address this pervasive health disparity, our lab has led efforts to characterize tumor biopsies from racial\/ethnic minority cancer patients to inform more effective cancer treatment and advance precision medicine among these high-risk populations. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 31 GC patient tumors with more than 60% of the samples coming from minority patients. We identified higher somatic mutation frequencies in the <i>ARID1A<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, and <i>APC<\/i> genes compared with the TCGA GC cohort, which is made up of mostly NHW patients. To better understand the role these genes play in cancer tumorigenesis among racial\/ethnic minority GC patients, our lab has established a CRISPR\/Cas9 genome-editing platform in minority patient-derived organoids (mPDOs). In this study, we utilized our platform to generate mPDO models of APC-TP53 double knockouts (dKO), ARID1A-TP53 dKO, and TP53-ARID1A-BRCA2 triple knockouts in organoid lines derived from normal gastric tissue. We developed medium to select for functional mutants following organoid cell electroporation that yielded near-complete selection for the desired gene knockouts, allowing us to generate isogenic mPDO lines modeling each gene KO combination. Our organoid models will provide a critical method to elucidate therapeutic sensitivity and resistance mechanisms in minority groups towards the ultimate goal of addressing GC health disparities in US racial\/ethnic minorities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8ccd6148-a548-4408-8fcc-c8d4bc564f45\/@t03B8ZMA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Precision medicine,CRISPR\/Cas9,Hispanic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14450"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexa Morales Arana<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole B.

Even with the standard-of-care chemotherapy, 40% of the patients are innately resistant and half of the initial responders develop acquired resistance. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of resistance in GEA remain largely unknown.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 30 GEA patients who received chemotherapy were included in this cohort. Both pre-and post-treatment primary tissues were collected to generate patient-derived organoids (PDOs). 29 PDOs were treated with chemotherapeutic agents and the cell viability was measured. We also evaluated the correlation between<i> ex-vivo<\/i> drug responses of PDOs and <i>in-patient<\/i> clinical responses. Data obtained from whole-exome (WES) and RNA sequencing of the primary tumor and their PDOs were analyzed to identify targetable molecules associated with chemo-resistance.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>After treatment, the cell viability of the PDOs obtained from chemo-resistant patients was significantly higher than that of chemo-sensitive patients. The variant allele frequency of the PDOs recapitulated their parental tumors. WES of one patient tumor revealed an increased copy number of EGFR, and their PDOs showed high sensitivity to an EGFR inhibitor in the subsequent drug screens. Furthermore, 40% of chemo-sensitive patients had mutations in one or more genes belonging to the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family. The adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway was found to be significantly activated only in chemo-sensitive patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing of pre-and post-treatment tissue revealed a broadly shifted transcriptome in epithelial cells. Patients with upregulated cell stemness genes including CTNNB1, MYC, ETS2, and KLF4 had disease recurrence 6 months post-surgery, while patients with unaltered or downregulated stemness genes remain disease-free 18 months until today.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our PDOs not only reflected the genetic profile of primary tumors but also recapitulated patient responses to chemotherapy. Genomic analysis revealed that mutations in a few GPCR genes might have a role in increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. In addition, the transcriptomic analysis showed stemness genes were associated with disease recurrence. Our GEA PDO platform allows the identification and the subsequent verification of resistant-conferring targets, providing insight for novel therapeutic combinations.<br \/><b>Funding:<\/b><b> <\/b>This project is supported by the Cancer Research Society (CCS), and the Department of Defence (DoD), USA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/500278de-91ea-46e7-b9a2-4aa3bd5ecd1e\/@t03B8ZMA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,High-throughput assay,Personalized medicine,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14453"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mingyang Kong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swneke Bailey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veena Sangwan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorenzo Ferri<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here we present the development of a novel method for efficient generation, expansion and use of HGSOC organoids from cryopreserved tumor material.<br \/>First, we assessed commonly used organoid media components and found that supplements such as FGF-2, R-Spondin1, Wnt or Noggin had negative impact on the HGSOC organoid derivation. But further, we found that supplementation with FGF-4, which has not been used in cancer organoid culture before, is beneficial for HGSOC organoid growth. Through extensive testing of various supplements and their combinations, we designed two novel HGSOC organoid media formulations - Medium 1 (M1) and Medium 2 (M2). Using M1 and M2 enabled generation and long-term expansion of living HGSOC organoid biobank with markedly improved success rate than in previous reports (55% vs. 23-38%). The organoids were established from cryopreserved tumor material, demonstrating the feasibility of using frozen tissue biobanks for HGSOC organoid derivation. Overall, we generated a collection of 18 expandable HGSOC organoid lines from 11 patients, encompassing samples from different tissue sites and disease progression stages.<br \/>We validated the organoids using whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing and demonstrated that they are genetically and phenotypically representative of original patient samples over long-term culture. Based on available patient consents, we deposited 3 organoid lines in a publicly accessible biobank. Finally, we investigated whether organoid drug responses correlate to those observed earlier in the clinic in the corresponding patients. Organoid-based drug-response profiling of clinically used HGSOC drug collection was performed in 384-well microplate format. To explore whether growth conditions impact correlation between organoid drug responses and clinical response, we compared the organoid drug responses in the nutrient-rich M1\/M2 growth media to the ones observed in human plasma-like medium (HPLM), supplemented with relevant niche factors from M1\/M2. Organoid drug responses correlated with clinical treatment outcomes, but only for organoids maintained in HPLM (Spearman r = 0.987, p=0.007 in HPLM vs 0.607, p=0.167 in growth medium, n=7), highlighting the importance of culture conditions in organoid-based functional assays. Taken together, we introduce a resource for efficient development and use of HGSOC organoids from cryopreserved material in ovarian cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a61dc04d-6e33-4144-bda9-4a5211d46442\/@t03B8ZMA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Ovarian cancer,Personalized medicine,3D cell culture,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14454"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wojciech Senkowski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Gall Mas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matias M.

Time for PDOs to reach 100-200 &#956;m ranged from 6 days to 14 days and exhibited structural features and pathological marker expression similar to their corresponding primary tumors reflecting respective histological subtypes - adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Chemotherapy testing (1 &#956;g\/ml Carboplatin plus 0.5 &#956;g\/ml Paclitaxel) showed differential responses (day 6 of treatment). Based on the scoring, PDOs were categorized as partially sensitive, very sensitive or resistant (based on organoid growth or regression in presence of chemotherapeutic drugs). Results of RNA sequencing may reveal distinct transcriptomic signatures and molecular pathways reflecting in differential chemoresponses.<br \/><b>Conclusions and future perspectives:<\/b> PDOs capitulate structural and pathological marker expression of patient primary tumors and serve as versatile, high-throughput drug testing platforms to treat NSCLC patients. Further, identification of key transcriptomic signatures and molecular pathways resulting in chemoresistance will be critical in formulating personal precision medicine to treat NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/45e91604-828e-4580-890a-db6dc695dacc\/@t03B8ZMA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Organoids,Chemotherapy response,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14455"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yariswamy Manjunath<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kanve Nagaraj Suvilesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iuliia Innokenteva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wesley Warren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric T.

The rarity of osteosarcoma and its highly heterogeneous genetic composition have resulted in a lack of curative treatments for recurrent and metastatic disease.<br \/>In this study, we present the functional and molecular characterization of a case of a pediatric patient with left distal femur osteosarcoma and pulmonary metastases at presentation. Through longitudinal sampling over the course of the patient&#8217;s illness, we have procured tissue from the initial treatment-na&#239;ve diagnostic biopsy, primary tumor resection and multiple subsequent lung metastasectomies, and have developed patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) from the viable samples. PDTOs are useful pre-clinical models that are representative of the source tissue and allow further interrogations of the biology of tumors. These models can also help with the identification of effective personalized therapies (Al Shihabi et al, 2021). We applied our mini-ring organoid screening technology (Phan et al, 2019; Nguyen et al, 2020) to perform high-throughput drug screening with different pharmacologic agents. We also performed deep whole-genome sequencing on all collected samples and corresponding organoids to reconstruct their evolutionary history, identify driver mutations and quantify heterogeneity in mutational processes across time and space.<br \/>Our preliminary data show that the subclonal content of the tumor and derivative organoids as well as the PDTO drug responses vary with the patient&#8217;s treatment history. We identify the genomic makeup of the subclones and posit changes that may be responsible for chemoresistance. Furthermore, our data shows correlations between the subclonal genomic composition of the PDTOs and source tissue, thereby reinforcing that PDTOs are capable of accurately recapitulating the subclonal heterogeneity of the parental tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ef818a7-f079-4c90-894b-20762ebbba7a\/@t03B8ZMA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Precision medicine,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14456"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ardy Davarifar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jane Yanagawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmad Al Shihabi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huyen T.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before cystectomy for muscle-invasive BC is standard management, though the absolute survival benefit is small, with many patients progressing during chemotherapy. Identifying therapies with a high probability of specific activity against each patient&#8217;s tumor remains a <u>critical need<\/u>.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Following informed consent, from patients undergoing a transurethral resection of bladder tumor or cystectomy, 1+ gram of tumor was procured and divided between DNA\/RNA sequencing, organoid drug-screening, and single-cell sequencing of cells surviving chemotherapy. Tissue was dissociated, filtered, and resuspended in organoid media for minimal passaging and drug screening. Drugs were tested at the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) in human trials, so to provide physiologic relevance. When material was sufficient, cells were additionally tested using dose response. Cmax screening results were normalized to control such that a value of &#8220;100&#8221; indicated no difference in organoid viability compared to control, and a value of 0 indicated complete response. The number of drugs screened was dependent upon tissue available, with up to 34 drugs screened at Cmax and 9 drugs screened in dose response format.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Thus far, &#62;100 patient-derived organoids have undergone collection and development with ~ 2\/3 samples collected resulting in organoid development and drug screening. RNA sequencing and GSEA enriched pathways across organoids was compared to other published datasets, noting high levels of correlation between our organoid models and in particular, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia urethral lines. Moreover, analysis of subtype and mutation\/copy number data further indicate that our organoid dataset is representative of the full spectrum of disease. RNA sequencing and subtyping of cultured organoids compared to patient tissue indicate that organoid models are representative of patient tissue and do not undergo subtype shifts in our short-term 3D cultures. Our drug screening results highlight the large spectrum of response to chemotherapies that in fact, clinically benefit only a small proportion of patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Crucially, we identify promising targeted therapies to consider for patients who progress following resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Rapid organoid development, characterization, and drug screening allows for the prediction of therapeutic response in ~10 days following sample collection. Use of this technique on tissue provided during disease work-up may further guide selection of effective therapeutic agents in patients with bladder cancer. This would overall minimize the morbidity of standard of care therapies and could be used to identify alternative therapeutics for patients who progress on standard therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/87d0b7b7-997a-4a69-9629-8ad3aba6533f\/@t03B8ZMA\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Bladder cancer,Sequencing,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14459"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nathan M.

A consensus classification, based on gene expression profiling, has identified six MIBC subgroups, ranging from basal\/squamous (Ba\/Sq) to luminal papillary (LumP). This classification is a static representation of the disease and does not account for cellular plasticity, which may induce phenotype switch and cancer progression. Here, we aimed at identifying factors involved in cellular plasticity using bladder cancer patient-derived organoids (PDO) models.<b><br \/>Methods:<\/b> Bladder cancer RNA sequencing data from bulk and single cell experiments were downloaded from public repositories. Samples from both datasets were classified using the consensus molecular classification. Pathway activation scores and cell-cell interaction scores were calculated for each subtype. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with the R packages edgeR and Seurat. MIBC samples were collected from bladder cancer patients undergoing surgical treatment. The samples were mechanically and enzymatically digested to generate a cell suspension which was seeded in Matrigel and immersed in growth-factor supplemented medium. Phenotypical characterization of long-term PDO lines was performed through immunofluorescence (IF). The PDOs were classified as Luminal, Basal or Mixed, based on the number of cells expressing the luminal marker CK8 or the basal marker CK5. Three selected organoids lines were cultured in alginate, immersed in a serum-free chemically-defined medium.<b><br \/>Results:<\/b> Long-term PDO lines were successfully generated from 6 out of 13 MIBC samples. Organoids from the same line showed a consistent expression of basal and luminal markers. One line was classified as Basal, 2 lines as Mixed and 3 lines as Luminal. Exploring bulk RNAseq and scRNAseq datasets, we identified several genes whose expression was significantly altered in Ba\/Sq and LumP MIBC subtypes. In particular, <i>SHH<\/i> and related <i>BMP<\/i> genes were significantly less expressed in Ba\/Sq samples than in LumP. In addition, we observed an overexpression of <i>BMP3<\/i> in LumP samples and of <i>TGF&#946;2<\/i> in Ba\/Sq samples. As preliminary test, we formulated a chemically-defined medium containing inhibitors of the proteins encoded by the identified genes (<i>TGF&#946; <\/i>inhibitor and <i>Noggin<\/i>); using this medium, we were able to maintain organoids from a Luminal, Basal and Mixed subtype in culture for up to two weeks. Interestingly, after two weeks of culture, IF analysis highlighted the presence of cells expressing luminal markers in the basal organoid line, suggesting culture-induced change of phenotype.<b><br \/>Conclusions: <\/b>Bladder cancer PDOs represent promising models to study MIBC plasticity. The integration of RNA sequencing data and the successful culture of PDOs in chemically-defined culture conditions may allow to identify candidate factors impacting the phenotype of bladder cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/786148e6-cb64-4d91-970d-d58d0ed45f6a\/@u03B8ZMB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Bladder cancer,Phenotype,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14460"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michele Garioni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Roma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renaud Mével<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatjana Vlajnic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heike Pueschel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dagmar Iber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans-Helge Seifert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cyrill A.

To tackle this problem, (phospho)proteomics analysis enables valuable insights into changes of protein expression and signalling in cancer that can be perturbed by drugs. To study mechanisms driving metastasis and perform subsequent drug testing, patient derived organoids (PDOs) are in development as preclinical models. PDOs are obtained by 3D culture of tumour tissue ex-vivo, which enables them to retain the heterogeneity and architecture of the tumor source. To identify putative drug targets for colon cancer metastasis, we performed comparative (phospho)proteomics analysis of metastatic colon tissues and their matched PDOs.<br \/>Methods: (Phospho)proteomics profiling was performed on PDOs generated from 10 patients with colon metastases to the liver, 10 matched tumour tissues and 4 normal colon mucosa. Unsupervised analysis of the (phospho)proteomic landscape was used to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways in colon metastases and their matched PDOs, compared to normal colon mucosa. We focused on phosphosites, proteins and pathways showing consistently altered expression in tumour tissues and PDOs. Kinase-substrate enrichment analysis was used to identify aberrantly activated kinases, based on the abundance of phosphorylation on the substrates. Putative drugs were selected using the consensus expression response to multiple small molecule drugs across cell lines and conditions from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database. Drug treatment of drug candidates was performed using the MTT Cell Proliferation Assay.<br \/>Results: Using the approach described above we identified 103 differentially expressed proteins and 236 phosphosites between tumour tissues and normals, which were also detected in PDOs, with overall high correlation of t statistics (0.6 Spearman&#8217;s rho) between tumor tissues and PDOs. MYC-targets, G2M checkpoints and E2F-targets were amongst the top positively enriched pathways in common, and the LINCS analysis identified multi-kinase inhibitor Nintedanib and NFKB pathway-targeting KIN0-260 as putative drugs for upregulated proteins. The kinase CSNK2A1 was overactivated in both groups, pointing towards the use of CK2 inhibitors for drug testing. Treatment at 5 days with Nintedanib and KIN001-260 on the PDOs resulted in significant reduction of cell viability compared with 5-FU.

The process in determining the optimal treatment for each patient is both long and tedious - and current strategies do not enable therapy optimization at the individual level. The incidence rate for pancreatic cancer in Puerto Rico between 2013 and 2017 was 8.2%, which is lower than the rate reported for non-Hispanic whites and blacks (16% and 12.9%, respectively). The causes for such health disparity are unknown but it is very likely associated with changes at the genomic and tissue microenvironment level at the sub-population level. To identify pathological markers in a more patient-specific manner, patient-derived models need to be integrated into studies of drug screening and efficacy. Patient-derived organoids (PDO) are becoming a potential model for diagnosis and the study of disease progression due to their ability to recreate the pathology of the tumor in the patients. Although several PDO studies have highlighted their potential for therapeutic applications, the ability to successfully culture and propagate these using standard methods has not been shown in samples collected from the Hispanic population. We assessed the feasibility of establishing PDOs from tissue specimens of a pancreatic mass lesion from Puerto Rican patients using standard methods for pancreatic organoids. A total of 9 samples were collected from endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle biopsies to examine the pathological features of the sample and the retention of the parental tumor characteristics in culture. All tissue specimens were cultured in Matrigel domes within 24 hours of extraction and organoid establishment was monitored for 7-8 days. All samples were positive for pancreatic adenocarcinoma but only around 50% of them were successfully cultured in Matrigel. High ATP levels were observed in tumor organoids after one week in culture which is indicative of a high cell viability. Examination of pathological markers indicated that all samples were negative for epidermal growth factor (EGFR), 5\/6 were positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA), 4\/6 were positive for Vimentin, and 1\/6 were positive for CA 19.9. Absence of EGFR was unexpected as this marker is highly expressed and abundant in 40-70% of pancreatic cancers. Samples with high levels of SMA, a fibroblast marker, resulted in a higher organoid yield than samples with no SMA present. Overall, the data suggests that the presence of fibroblasts is supportive of organoid establishment in culture and that standard culture methods need to be optimized to increase organoid yields. Future work will seek to increase the sample size to test alternative propagation methods and examine drug sensitivity in patient-derived pancreas organoids of the Puerto Rican population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c51cd78-22df-46b9-897e-50daed025f4c\/@u03B8ZMB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hispanic,Adenocarcinoma,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14462"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrea S.

Cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS\/HIPEC) has improved overall survival. Despite this advancement, there remain challenges in determining which patients may benefit from the procedure. Hyperthermia has been shown to potentiate chemotherapy toxicity through interfering with DNA repair, suggesting DNA repair proteins could serve as a predictive marker of clinical outcomes. Herein we applied patient derived tumor organoids (PTOs) to examine the personalized impact of DNA repair mechanisms in efficacy of HIPEC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tumor specimens were obtained from patients undergoing CRS under IRB protocols. Specimens were dissociated and incorporated into a collagen-hyaluronic acid organoid model and treated with clinical HIPEC regimens using mitomycin C (MMC) and oxaliplatin under normothermic (37&#176;C) and heated conditions (42&#176;C) for two hours. The post-treatment viability average responses were aggregated and used for statistical analysis. Treated organoids and tissues were processed histologically and qPCR was performed on patient tumor cells to determine expression of DNA damage markers and DNA damage response.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>From June 2019-October 2021, 59 appendiceal tumor tissues from 35 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis were acquired. 53 PTO groups, from 17 high grade and 36 low grade tumors, were successfully fabricated and tested for HIPEC sensitivity. Hyperthermia potentiated the cytotoxic effect for both MMC (35% vs 57%, p&#60;0.0001, 3\/17 HGA and 6\/36 LGA PTO sets) and oxaliplatin (41% vs 66%, p&#60;0.0001, 5\/17 HGA and 13\/37 LGA PTOs). Within the thermosensitive cohort, MMC and oxaliplatin based HIPEC, resulted in similar post perfusion viabilities (35% vs 41%, p=0.25). Furthermore, low and high grade primaries exhibited similar post perfusion viabilities for both MMC (32% vs 40%, p=0.25) and oxaliplatin (36% vs 49%, p=0.08)To test if resistance to HIPEC was associated with increased expression of DNA damage repair proteins in treated organoids, we examined Pax2-Interacting-Protein (PTIP), an important DNA repair protein for both chromatin remodeling and interactions with other DNA repair proteins. Lower PTIP expression in appendiceal tissue sections is correlated with HIPEC treatment sensitivity for both oxaliplatin when compared to high expression (32% vs 49%, p=0.02) and MMC (29% vs 38%, p=0.05). qPCR results confirmed these observations in PTOs, stratifying them into responding and non-responding groups.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Decreased expression of PTIP offers resistance in appendiceal cancer patients treated with HIPEC. PTOs can serve to determine personalized efficacy of HIPEC regimens both at the level of selection of perfusion chemotherapy agent or application of hyperthermia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/147695ad-c344-4434-8470-4c2062001612\/@u03B8ZMB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Hyperthermia,DNA damage response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14463"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Steven D.

Despite recent advances annotating the genetic and epigenetic changes underlying the initiation and development of ESCC and its precursor lesion, esophageal squamous dysplasia, more work is needed to translate these findings into novel therapeutic strategies. This gap is due in part to the lack of tractable models of ESCC initiation and development that can then be manipulated <i>ex vivo<\/i> for preclinical testing. Currently, the large-scale studies characterizing the aforementioned molecular changes have used primary tissue for their analyses and have subsequently been unable to test the specific hypotheses that arise from their data using the original tissue that they profiled. To address this gap, we have generated a large (n = 54) three-dimensional organoid library from the esophagi of mice treated with the carcinogen 4-Nitroquinoline N-oxide (4-NQO) representing each stage of esophageal squamous cell initiation and progression from early intraepithelial dysplasia through lung metastasis. We have determined that these organoids faithfully recapitulate the molecular biology, histology, and oncogenic phenotype of their tissue of origin. Through integrative analysis of both RNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing data, we have identified several novel therapeutic targets that contribute to ESCC initiation and development including the DNA damage response and NOTCH1 signaling. Together, our work capitalizes on the intersection of large-scale multiomics and sophisticated 3D organoid models to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of a devastating disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/17cb9aa6-b00e-4c1d-a29e-51778e66968c\/@u03B8ZMB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Multiomics,DNA damage response,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14464"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samuel Flashner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masataka Shimonosono<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Takada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norihiro Matsuura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuto Tomita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alison Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andres Klein-Szanto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fatameh Momen-Heravi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>J.

Developing clinical trials and identifying effective therapies remains a challenge given the rarity of these tumors and scarcity of available tumor models. Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) are representative of the native physiology of tumors across an array of malignancies (Phan et al, 2019; Al Shihabi et al, 2021). For rare tumors such as bone and soft tissue sarcomas, PDTOs could constitute an important tool to better understand the biology of the disease and identify treatment options. Here, we present the pipeline we have established at UCLA to systematically procure tissue, develop and characterize individualized sarcoma PDTOs, and identify tumor sensitivities using high-throughput drug screening. We have collected tumor specimens from 114 patients diagnosed with sarcomas, representing more than 30 distinct subtypes of soft tissue and bone tumors. We have established suitable conditions to generate organoids from over 100 samples collected from needle biopsies, tumor resections, and metastasectomies, including soft tissue sarcomas (liposarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, etc.) and bone sarcomas (chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, etc.). We take advantage of our mini-ring technology to generate PDTOs in a format compatible with high-throughput drug screening (Phan et al, 2019; Nguyen et al, 2020). Our results highlight tumor-specific drug susceptibilities to chemotherapeutics, targeted agents, and combination therapies, generating results within a week from surgery. We will show how several of the organoid response patterns we identified transcend cancer subtype and patient characteristics. Our findings support the feasibility of rapidly generating individualized organoid models from bone and soft tissue sarcomas to facilitate biological interrogations and investigate response to treatment. Direct testing of PDTOs derived from clinical specimens can provide timely, actionable information for functional precision medicine approaches with the potential to improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/94356aab-a3a5-426d-8aab-616511cfc120\/@u03B8ZMB\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Precision medicine,High-content screening,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14465"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ahmad Al Shihabi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peyton J.

By incorporating tumor cell heterogeneity and three-dimensional morphological features, patient-derived organoids provide an improved <i>in vivo<\/i> relevancy compared to established tumor cell lines grown as monolayers. However, organoids grow while embedded in an extracellular matrix material with complex media formulations, which poses challenges for culture scale-up and automated drug screening methods. Organoid models derived from a variety of human solid tumor types are distributed by the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Patient-Derived Models Repository program (https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov). A panel of human patient-derived colon adenocarcinoma organoid models was assembled to evaluate an automated high-throughput screening (HTS) platform. The organoid panel members were characterized for their reproducible growth and expansion capacity in culture, recovery from cryopreservation, and amenability to operations associated with HTS. Short tandem repeat profiling was performed regularly throughout the process to authenticate each sample. Among the organoid models, variations were observed in morphology (assessed by brightfield imaging) and growth rate (measured by population doublings). Most models expanded well in culture for greater than sixty days and all models demonstrated a sufficient recovery from cryopreservation. The aims in adapting organoid cultures to a HTS platform included minimizing the operational complexity, maximizing the process throughput, and maintaining high organoid viability. Assay conditions for all panel members were selected in conjunction with automated methods, instrumentation, and endpoint measurements. Details such as the optimal sample preparation steps, media formulation, and inoculation density varied among the organoid models. However, other aspects such as liquid handling procedures for organoid inoculation and drug delivery, microwell plate type, assay duration, and endpoint measurements were selected for their suitability to all organoid models tested. Using a custom-designed automated screening system, the refined methods were validated by screening the panel of patient-derived colon adenocarcinoma organoids against a library of oncology drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (https:\/\/dtp.cancer.gov\/organization\/dscb\/obtaining\/default.htm). Assay performance metrics and pharmacological data demonstrate the robust performance of this organoid screening platform. Future efforts will establish additional patient-derived organoid panels for expanded HTS using this platform. This project was funded in part with federal funds from the NCI, NIH, under contract no.

However, it is critical to establish high quality, reproducible, and well-annotated PDTOs that closely recapitulate the original tumors from which they were derived. Here, we established a biobank of over 20 colorectal cancer (CRC) PDTOs representing a racially and ethnically diverse patient population that has been subjected to rigorous quality control (QC) measures. We demonstrate the utility of a well-characterized biobank across several applications including the development of an integrated chemotherapeutic drug response database and image-based phenotypic analyses using deep-learning neural networks (NNs).<br \/>To ensure consistency across our biobank, PDTOs were subjected to a meticulous processing pipeline which includes the extensive collection of pertinent culturing metadata (i.e., multi-timepoint brightfield images pre- and post-passaging for consistent size and health of the PDTOs, short tandem repeat sequencing to establish a unique patient barcode, and routine mycoplasma testing results to minimize contamination) and DNA\/RNA sequencing to verify the PDTOs reflect the genetic profile of the original tumor. A dashboard is used to manage culturing and characterization tasks across the Cell Line Team and samples are registered in a Lab Information Management System (LIMS) for tracking of data associated with the samples, including detailed patient information.<br \/>Our high-quality biobank supports a diverse project portfolio including the creation of a database of PDTO drug responses to clinically-approved chemotherapy treatments 5-Fluorouracil and Irinotecan. This database compares PDTO-specific dose-response curves between ATP-based viability assays and image-based NN analysis and we found the IC<sub>50<\/sub> values from the two analytical methods to be comparable. The NNs were designed to segment and classify organoids as live or dead from brightfield images. The label-free, non-destructive nature of this method enables dynamic imaging and analysis over multiple timepoints. Notably, our biobank and NN analysis work in concert where the biobank provides valuable, consistent datasets that are used to train and validate NNs and the NN is subsequently used to understand phenotypic drug responses of PDTOs. From these results we can show inter-patient heterogeneity in drug responses.<br \/>In conclusion, we generated a reliable biobank to support numerous applications including the creation of a PDTO drug response database with deep learning validation. Such a biobank is only feasible through meticulous QC and can serve as a great resource to understand treatment outcomes and identify better therapeutic options for patients in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a459a2f-b562-4c58-862b-17e41500f586\/@u03B8ZMB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Biobank,Imaging,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14467"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"6de8088b-22bd-4bc8-93e3-c6b371cf9613","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6de8088b-22bd-4bc8-93e3-c6b371cf9613\/@u03B8ZMB\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Scott Valena<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pratiksha Kshetri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ah Young Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shohei Imamura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seungil Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael E.

Existing functional approaches in precision medicine face difficulties in the creation, scaling, and analysis of physiological tumor organoid models. We present a method for the automated bioprinting of tumor organoids coupled with real-time biomass quantification using high-speed live cell interferometry (HSLCI). This workflow enhances consistency, preserves sample viability, and assesses response to treatment with single-organoid resolution. First, we describe the bioprinting protocol used to achieve the deposition of organoids in uniformly thin three-dimensional layers of Matrigel. Then we show that bioprinting preserves the histological and molecular characteristics of manually seeded organoids. In drug screening experiments, we demonstrate the simultaneous monitoring of thousands of individual organoids and show that HSLCI can rapidly identify drug sensitivity and resistance to treatment. We observe significant heterogeneity in the drug responses of single organoids and discuss the potential implications for use of this pipeline in the clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9727e78-b855-49d6-b7d5-c2411698438b\/@u03B8ZMB\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Precision medicine,High-content screening,Live-cell imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14468"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peyton J.

HNSC arises from its histological precursor lesion, squamous dysplasia (HNSD); however, most patients are diagnosed with late-stage HNSC with no prior identification of pre-malignant disease. Earlier diagnosis and intervention could ameliorate the outsized burden of HNSC; therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to characterize the molecular changes underlying progression through HNSD to HNSC. To identify novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers that predict progression to HNSC, we have generated a three dimensional (3D) organoid library derived from dysplastic oral tissue harvested from mice treated with 4-Nitriquinoline N-oxide (4-NQO), a potent mimetic of tobacco smoke. Through RNA sequencing analysis of these organoids, we have identified two distinct gene expression states that accompany either early or late dysplasia. By performing gene set enrichment analysis of these two distinct gene signatures, we have identified c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling as a potential biomarker that predicts or progression from HNSD to HNSC. Together, we have identified the salient transcriptional changes that accompany progression through the histological precursor lesion of HNSC. This study positions JNK signaling as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for early intervention during the treatment of a deadly disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a56d76d4-eb3a-4864-8b0e-9c7f211df031\/@u03B8ZMB\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Dysplasia,RNA sequencing,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14469"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robert Agee II<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Flashner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masataka Shimonosono<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andres Klein-Szanto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroshi Nakagawa<\/i><\/presenter>.

To successfully use these models across a variety of research disciplines and applications, approaches that reduce variability and technology pipelines to image &#38; quantify these complex cell models are required. Here, we demonstrate simple, robust workflows for monitoring and automatically quantifying features, such as morphology, growth and death of organoids using real time live cell analysis. To quantitatively optimize and characterize organoid cultures <i>in-vitro<\/i>, mouse hepatic, intestinal and pancreatic organoids were embedded in Matrigel<sup>&#174; <\/sup>domes (50 % or 100%) in 24-well plates and imaged over time in an Incucyte<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Live Cell System. Organoid growth, differentiation, and maturation was measured using Incucyte&#8217; s automated Organoid Software Analysis Module, which tracks changes in size and morphology. Integrated metrics enabled objective determination of cell-type specific growth conditions and passaging regimes. To illustrate the utility of the Incucyte<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Organoid Analysis Software Module to track organoid growth and death in 96-well plates, intestinal and hepatic organoid fragments were embedded in Matrigel<sup>&#174;<\/sup> (50%) for 3 days prior to treatment with protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (1 &#181;M, STP). Vehicle treated organoids increased in size (10-fold; intestinal or 3-fold; hepatic) over time while marked reduction was observed in the presence of STP. Using label-free size and morphology metrics we could distinguish between cytotoxic and cytostatic mechanisms of action (MoA) of known chemotherapeutic compounds. STP, cisplatin (CIS, DNA synthesis inhibitor) or fluorouracil (5-FU, thymidylate synthetase inhibitor) exhibited concentration dependent inhibition of hepatic organoid growth, yielding IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 3 nM for STP, 9.7 &#181;M for CIS and 0.78 &#181;M for 5-FU. Whilst attenuation of size was observed across all compounds, increases in eccentricity and darkness indictive of 3D structure disruption and cell death respectively were only observed in CIS and STP-treated organoids (cytotoxic MoA). Differences between the size and morphology readouts illustrated the cytostatic mechanism of 5-FU. Use of this approach was extended to visualize and quantify CFTR function. Following forskolin stimulation, a concentration-dependent increase in intestinal organoid size was observed. In the presence of CFTR inhibitor CFTR<sub>inh<\/sub>-172 the maximal response was reduced by &#62;50% (~150% at 10 &#181;M) illustrating that swelling was CFTR-dependent. These data demonstrate the capability to kinetically visualize and quantify distinct organoid morphologies, assess drug-induced cellular changes label-free and illustrates the amenability of this approach across a range of disease areas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e9f9111e-e0a5-4a8c-926d-8a3b160beb3f\/@v03B8ZMC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Image analysis,In vitro,Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14472"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tim R.

A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PCa progression and treatment resistance is a prerequisite to address this challenge, which is currently limited by the scarcity of experimental models. Here, we aimed at establishing and characterizing new patient-derived organoids xenograft (PDOX) models of advanced PCa.<br \/><b>Materials &#38; methods:<\/b> We used two patient-derived organoid lines (PDOs), previously generated in our laboratory. P20-11 PDOs were derived from a lung metastasis obtained from a patient with hormone-na&#239;ve PCa. P20-23 PDOs were derived from a transurethral prostate resection obtained from a patient with metastatic castration-resistant PCa, previously treated with goserelin, docetaxel, and enzalutamide. PDOX were generated by subcutaneous injection of PDOs in NOD <i>scid<\/i> gamma (NSG) male mice. Organoids were derived from the PDOX tumors (PDOX-O). Matched patients&#8217; tumor, PDOs, PDOX and PDOX-O samples were characterized using immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and whole exome sequencing (WES). Organoids were treated with different concentrations of drugs and cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo 3D, after a 5-day long treatment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> P20-11 PDOs developed tumors in 2 out of 6 mice, 10 months after injection. IHC analysis highlighted a loss of PTEN expression, overexpression of ERG and P53, as well as strong AR and NKX3.1 expression in the tumor, PDOs, PDOX and PDOX-O samples. WES analysis uncovered mutations in <i>CTNNB1<\/i>, <i>PTEN<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> in all samples, and approximately 87% of shared non-synonymous mutations between the PDOX and the original patients&#8217; tumor. Similar to the original PDOs, P20-11 PDOX-O displayed androgen sensitivity <i>in vitro.<\/i> P20-23 PDOs formed tumors in 3 out of 3 mice 8 months following injection. IHC and IF analyses highlighted a strong expression of CK8, PSMA, AR and NKX3.1, as well as a loss of PTEN expression in the tumor, PDOs, PDOX and PDOX-O samples. WES identified a pathogenic mutation in the PCa-associated gene <i>ZMYM3 <\/i>in<i> <\/i>all samples, associated with loss of protein expression. The activating <i>AR<\/i> point mutation L702H, previously linked to AR signaling inhibitors resistance, was detected in the tumor and in 2 out of 3 PDOX and their derived organoids. Overall, an average of 80% of non-synonymous mutations were shared between the patients&#8217; tumor and PDOX. Finally, P20-23 PDOX-O did not respond to docetaxel or enzalutamide but exhibited sensitivity to the PI3K\/AKT inhibitor ipatasertib.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We have successfully generated two novel PDOX models, which highly resemble the original patients&#8217; tumor and can be further cultured as organoids. These models are representative of relevant clinical and molecular subtypes of advanced PCa, providing further opportunities for translational studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/914894cb-6164-404a-a228-77bc86de585f\/@v03B8ZMC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Organoids,Xenografts,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14474"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Raphaëlle Servant<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoi Diamantopoulou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Garioni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Roma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tatjana Vlajnic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arnoud J.

When organoids include clinical annotation, they become a useful, renewable tool for clinical correlation studies, but to be truly predictive the drug profiling assays utilized to screen organoid response must have measurable correlation with patient response. 3D Predict&#8482; is a highly accurate assay that is 89% and 85% predictive of response in first-line ovarian cancer and high-grade gliomas (HGG) respectively. We have developed a panel of organoids that are clinically annotated, include correlative primary tissue 3D Predict&#8482; drug response data, and have been assessed for the recapitulation of primary tissue histology and genomics. Additionally, our organoid models incorporate matched immune cells, a key component of the tumor microenvironment, making them an ideal model for immune-oncology studies. Here we present data on 15 available organoid models across HGG, breast, colorectal and bladder cancer. We have applied these models to drug response studies, including checkpoint inhibitors and shown correlation to primary patient response. The assurance of predictive capacity is unique to KIYATEC&#8217;s organoids and is significant because it avoids the pitfalls of comparing drug responses across non-concordant assay platforms while providing assurance that the models are reflective of individual patient response and outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/92267bc5-48b0-4dc4-a811-39eee8d593a6\/@v03B8ZMC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,3D models,Preclinical testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14475"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melissa Millard<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie A.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common neoplasm worldwide and has the third highest mortality rate. However, the longtime gold-standard FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen, consisting of 5-FU and Oxaliplatin, results in only 70% survival rates in Stage 3 CRC patients, worse in Stage 4. More recent targeted therapies have marginally improved on this number, but the fact remains that CRC represents a highly heterogeneous neoplasm and resistance to standard chemotherapeutic regimens poses a significant barrier in treating this devastating disease.<br \/>There is an immediate need to better understand how this resistance arises. We hypothesize that a small number of cells with high phenotypic plasticity (HPP) are able to remain dormant during the initial chemotherapy treatment then reenter the cell cycle to cause recurrence and metastasis months or even years after treatment has concluded. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are a recently developed <i>ex vivo<\/i> model that allows for the study and extensive characterization of such HPP cell populations that may be found in patient tumors. We are developing and expanding various PDO populations to examine them genotypically and phenotypically on the single-cell level through RNA sequencing and high throughput imaging, respectively. By identifying these HPP cell populations, we then discover drugs that prevent the development of drug-resistant subpopulations. In the long term, we use our tumor heterogeneity profile to develop models that predict the responsiveness of tumors, including their drug-resistant HPP subpopulations, to well-documented and clinically used oncology drugs, streamlining treatment and improving survival outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/51bd3b8a-ae6e-40f1-a733-52d3ae32acc4\/@v03B8ZMC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Colorectal,Chemotherapy response,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14476"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia M.

However, the clinical\/histopathologic, biomarker, and genetic heterogeneity of breast cancer has not been well represented in the current breast cancer cell model collection. While published breast cancer model generation protocols have been helpful, their high failure rates indicate the urgent need to improve model derivation efficiency. Here, the Broad Cancer Cell Line Factory (CCLF) project presents a novel model derivation technology to generate breast and ovarian cancer organoids with a high success rate by leveraging the paracrine support from historical cancer cell lines.<br \/>We observed that most established breast cancer cell lines can grow in a simple basal media with 10% fetal bovine serum; We hypothesized that historical cell lines may secrete vital growth factors that support breast cancer cells' survival and growth. To test this, we randomly selected a pool of 20 breast cancer cell lines, collected its conditioned media (CM20) and incorporated the CM20 as a supplement into our empirical rich media matrix (HYBRID, 16 mixed media conditions) with a Matrigel culturing system. Three-dimensional (3D) structures formed at Day 14-21 in the CM20 supplementary conditions compared to conditions without CM20 and only organoids with the CM20 supplement could be propagated to passage 5 and beyond. We performed pan-cancer targeted sequencing to evaluate tumor content of these organoids at passage 5 with paired tumor tissues. In our first 10 attempts, 95% of organoid cultures were genomically verified as high purity tumor models, indicating the CM20 is essential to enrich breast cancer cell growth in an in vitro culturing setting.<br \/>We applied the CM20 to ovarian cancers and observed a similar success rate suggesting a tissue-specific supporting manner. We tested conditioned media collected from other historical cancer cell lines but the breast\/ovarian cancer organoid growth effect was not recapitulated. Importantly, when testing the individual breast cancer cell lines from the pool of 20, we discovered one cell line to be supporting the effect. More biochemistry work is needed to dissect the possible factors secreted by the line and molecular mechanisms of cancer cell survivors but preliminary data suggests the secretion factors are most likely proteins.<br \/>We generated 27 breast\/ovarian cancer cell models using this technology and RNAseq data shows the breast cancer organoids still express their expected molecular subtype markers. 22 breast\/ovarian cancer organoids have been propagated long-term with 17(out of 22) deposited to ATCC. Overall, this method provides an efficient model generation rate for female cancers. We anticipate that this method will not only allow us to quickly increase breast cancer cell model diversity but shed light on a new direction for breast cancer dependencies","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ec7f6fa-652f-4bcc-884c-13be41bc4527\/@v03B8ZMC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell lines,Paracrine,Modeling,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14477"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rebecca Deasy<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pierre Michel Jean Beltran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adel Atari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madison Liistro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheryl Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Avril<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Boerner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Payal Pradhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Klempner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keith Ligon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Sellers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Carr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Todd Golub<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuen-Yi (Moony) Tseng<\/i><\/presenter>.

These patients undergo multimodality treatments including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. For some patients this is likely over-treatment, while other patients require further treatment escalation. To date there is no clinical tool to know the potential benefit of these individual therapies. Patient-derived cancer organoids (PDCOs) are beginning to be evaluated for use as a means to predict individual patient response to clinical therapies. Here we use PDCOs from patients with LARC to compare the PDCO response to the individual clinical response.<br \/>Methods: Fresh LARC tissues from patients undergoing an endoscopy and tattooing procedure were obtained following consent on an IRB-approved protocol. PDCOs were cultured in using Matrigel and our previously published CRC organoids media. Following culture maturation, PDCOs were treated with control media, 5uM 5FU, 10uM Oxaliplatin, Combination (FOLFOX), XRT (2Gy) or 5FU and XRT. Brightfield imaging was performed at baseline and following 96 hours of treatment. Glass&#8217;s delta is used as a measure of the organoid treatment effect. A Glass&#8217;s delta of 1.25 was used as a threshold of treatment response based on prior studies. Clinical imaging was evaluated using standard RECIST v1.1 criteria of the objective response.<br \/>Results: Endoscopic LARC biopsy samples were obtained from 22 patients. 11 of the 22 samples were able to be grown as PDCOs. To date 9 cultures have been treated with FOLFOX and 9 have been treated with 5FU and XRT. For those treated with FOLFOX, 3\/9 had a Glass&#8217;s delta greater than 1.25 and all of these patients has a clinical partial response (PR). None of those patients&#8217; whose PDCOs did not achieve a Glass&#8217;s delta of at least 1.25 had a PR to FOLFOX clinically. No PDCO&#8217;s treated with 5FU and XRT achieved a Glass&#8217;s delta of &#62;1.25. 3\/9 PDCOs had a Glass&#8217;s delta &#62;1.0. All of these patients had a PR. Of the 7 patients whose PDCOs did not achieve a Glass&#8217;s delta of 1 in response to 5FU and XRT, none had a clinical PR (Glass&#8217;s delta range 0.6-0.93).<br \/>Conclusion: PDCOs hold great promise as a tool to predict clinical outcomes for patients with LARC. Further evaluations need to establish improved methods of PDCO generation from biopsy samples and confirm the optimum response thresholds for prediction of treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e668ac5d-35f3-496d-9281-3af0e4eb01ae\/@v03B8ZMC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Organoids,Chemotherapy response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14506"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shirsa Udgata<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aishwarya Sunil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca L.

Numerous studies suggest the <i>in vitro <\/i>drug responses of tumor organoids align with <i>in vivo<\/i> responses. In this study, we evaluated fourteen anticancer agents against a cohort of PDOrgs from three disease histologies: colon, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma. The PDOrgs were obtained from the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Patient-Derived Models Repository (https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov): a resource that offers clinically annotated and molecularly characterized models. The PDOrg models were selected for specific genetic variants of KRAS and BRAF, or different RNA levels of ABCB1, an ATP-dependent efflux pump. The approved and investigational agents were selected to target specific genetic variants and pathways: KRAS G12C covalent inhibitors (sotorasib and MRTX-1257), RAS pathway inhibitors (BAY-293, BI-3406 and TNO-155), BRAF V600E\/K inhibitors (dabrafenib and encorafenib), ABCB1 substrates (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, 5-FU, AZD-1775, and SN-38), and ABCB1 non-substrates (gemcitabine and trametinib). The goal of the study was to assess whether the sensitivities of PDOrgs to therapeutic agents matched these genetic profiles under standard in vitro conditions. PDOrgs were seeded into 384-well microplates, in a semi-automated fashion, and exposed to nine concentrations of each anticancer agent for six days followed by cell viability assessment by CellTiter-Glo 3D. Data analysis was performed using GRmetrics, an R package for calculation and visualization of concentration-response metrics based on growth rate inhibition (https:\/\/git.bioconductor.org\/packages\/GRmetrics). These data demonstrated that PDOrgs harboring a KRAS G12C variant were uniquely sensitive to sotorasib and MRTX-1257 and were, overall, more sensitive to the other RAS pathway targeting agents. Conversely, PDOrgs harboring wild type RAS and other KRAS variants were largely unresponsive to these targeted agents. Likewise, only PDOrgs harboring the BRAF V600E variant were sensitive to dabrafenib and encorafenib. For the majority of PDOrgs, the pharmacological responses to agents that are ABCB1 substrates inversely correlated with ABCB1 RNA expression. This study demonstrates the ability of organoids to serve as useful models for evaluating therapeutic responses to anticancer agents, including identifying known target-drug associations. Moreover, the technical conditions, as well as the selected PDOrgs and therapeutic agents, may be used as a reference set for the validation of a fully automated PDOrg screening system.

A key variable that contributes to poor patient outcomes lies in our inability to predict therapeutic response due to the molecular heterogeneity of MIBC tumors. There is, therefore, a significant unmet clinical need to accurately predict effective drug combinations and therapeutic doses in individual patients with MIBC. Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) have the potential to serve as an <i>ex vivo<\/i> model of urothelial carcinoma (UC) capable of functionally predicting patient-specific treatment responses. However, current culture procedures typically rely on the expansion of UC organoids from resected tumors or biopsy specimens, which is inherently invasive and hence limits clinical application. We hypothesized that culture of MIBC PDOs can be achieved from urine samples, as is the case in dogs with MIBC, since histopathological features, tumor heterogeneity and subtypes, metastatic activity, and gene expression profiles of canine MIBC mimic those of human MIBC. Herein, we successfully cultured MIBC organoids from both human and canine patients <i><u>using first-catch urine<\/u><\/i>. Briefly, after centrifuging urine samples to pellet cells, the cells were washed with basal culture media containing FBS and Pen\/Strep before being cultured in canine or human culture media containing essential growth factors based on their species of origin. Paraffin-embedded samples were used for molecular characterization by RNA <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization or immunohistochemistry. Organoids from canine MIBC patients were analyzed for expression of the urothelial differentiation marker (FOXA1) associated with high grade bladder cancer, CD44, a non-kinase transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in UC cancer stem cells, and CK7, an epithelial cell marker that is upregulated in neoplastic UC cells. FOXA1 expression was undetectable in canine MIBC, although CD44 expression was enhanced compared to healthy dog bladder organoids. All canine MIBC organoids had significantly enhanced CK7 expression. Similarly, in human-derived UC organoids, GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), transcription factor paired box 8 (Pax8), and tumor protein p63 were utilized as markers, with a Pax8-\/p63+\/GATA3+ profile indicating UC origin of the organoids. Functional response to chemotherapy (cisplatin and gemcitabine) was further assessed using cell viability assay in canine and human UC organoids. Our data suggest that organoids cultured from the urine of patients with MIBC can recapitulate organ structures and maintain marker expression profiles of the original tumor tissues. 3D organoids may provide novel insights to predict therapeutic response to chemotherapy and serve as early diagnostic biomarkers of bladder cancer in both canine and human patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e196cfb1-5add-4285-9d7d-d54416fd63c6\/@v03B8ZMC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Urine,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21208"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Dipak Kumar Sahoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison P.
