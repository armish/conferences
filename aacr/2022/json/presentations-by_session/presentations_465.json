[{"Abstract":"Lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) represent the most common lung cancer subtype and frequently harbor somatic mutations in the <i>KRAS<\/i> oncogene (KM-LUADs). While enhanced screening has improved early diagnosis of KM-LUAD, patient prognosis remains moderate to poor. Decoding the earliest events driving KM-LUADs can inform of ideal targets for its interception. Previous work showed that tobacco carcinogen (NNK) exposure leads to a pervasive <i>field of injury<\/i> comprised of molecular (e.g., <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations) and inflammatory changes that are shared between LUADs and their adjacent normal-appearing ecosystem. We and others have also shown that early immune and inflammatory alterations are implicated in the progression of normal lung (NL) epithelia and premalignant lesions (PMLs) to KM-LUAD. Yet, we still do not know the identities of specific epithelial subsets or how they promote a field of injury and inspire KM-LUAD pathogenesis. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of lungs from a human-relevant mouse model that develops PMLs and somatic KM-LUADs following NNK exposure. Analysis of 203,991 cells including 19,513 epithelial subsets after NNK cessation and at the onset of KM-LUADs revealed a unique population of alveolar cells that closely associated with tumor inception. These cells were highly evident in NNK- but not in control saline-exposed animals. Trajectory analysis showed that tumor clones developed through these transitionary cells, henceforth referred to as alveolar intermediate cells (AICs). Notably, AICs persisted for months after NNK cessation and acquired the same driver <i>Kras<\/i> mutations found in the resultant LUADs, thus supporting a role for AICs as KM-LUAD progenitors. Intriguingly, AICs harbored elevated expression of key components of p53 signaling (<i>Trp53, Cdkn2a<\/i>) and pro-inflammatory responses (IL-1&#946; receptor <i>Il1r1<\/i>, NF-&#954;B), and augmented cell-cell communication with Il1b+ macrophages which were enriched in LUAD-bearing lungs. Indeed, targeting IL-1&#946; attenuated KM-LUAD development and increased anti-tumor immunity. In parallel, murine AIC expression profiles were significantly enriched in transcriptomes of human PMLs and LUADs. We thus probed our in-house and expanding scRNA-seq cohort of enriched (by sorting) epithelial subsets from human LUADs and NL, including 191,491 alveolar cells. AICs were not only evident in human lung tissues, but their fractions were also significantly increased in LUADs relative to NL. In conclusion, we identified a unique alveolar cell state that typified KM-LUAD progenitors, associated with inflammatory cues, and progressed along the pathologic continuum of damaged epithelium to KM-LUADs. Ongoing studies are evaluating whether AICs, in concert with tumor-initiating inflammation, trigger a field of injury that may underlie early phenotypic initiation and development of KM-LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eda52576-a75a-4edd-bdf5-dc9ffcbc2b61\/@x03B8ZMP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Single-cell sequencing,Heterogeneity,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14096"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ansam Sinjab<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangchun Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Warapen Treekitkarnmongkol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dapeng Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enyu Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luisa M.

Therefore, in ccRCC, HIF is constitutively active and drives a gene expression program that is central to tumorigenesis. Whilst this is necessary for ccRCC formation, it is not sufficient, and other mutations must also occur in combination with VHL inactivation to drive ccRCC tumorigenesis. The mechanisms underlying their synergy with VHL inactivation remain poorly understood. These secondary driver mutations are often subclonal in nature, suggesting the presence of phenotypically distinct malignant cells within an individual tumor. This intratumor heterogeneity renders it difficult to study the functional impact of driver mutations in ccRCC by conventional &#8216;bulk&#8217; analyses such as RNA-seq. Consequently, the molecular mechanisms underlying ccRCC initiation are not known. Furthermore, non-malignant stromal cells (including the vasculature and immune response) can support tumor growth, and little is known as to how they interact with malignant cells in ccRCC. This is particularly important since current therapeutic strategies in kidney cancer target the stromal compartment. Therefore, there is an unmet need to better-understand transcriptional heterogeneity and cellular diversity in ccRCC. To that end, we have sampled multiple regions from ccRCC tumors (and tumor-adjacent kidney tissue) and performed single cell RNA-seq (10x Genomics) on approximately 150,000 individual cells. These encompass malignant cells as well as non-malignant cells (including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes and immune cells), both of which exhibit pronounced transcriptional heterogeneity within and between tumors. Analysis of these transcriptomes has identified evolutionary gene expression programs underlying cancer cell dedifferentiation. In addition, we observe concurrent heterogeneity in angiogenic signaling between malignant cells and non-malignant blood vessel cells within these tumors. Lastly, we have explored the effect of microenvironmental hypoxia across different ccRCC tumor cell types. In summary, we present a single cell atlas derived from multi-region heterogenous ccRCC samples. This sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tumor evolution and progression, as well as angiogenic heterogeneity (which may contribute to the variable response to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition) and the effect of hypoxia on ccRCC biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2a71b29-c564-42df-aeab-e8ab6d9da2f0\/@x03B8ZMP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor evolution,Single cell,Gene expression,Hypoxia-inducible factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14097"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Olivia Lombardi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ran Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Browning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter J.

We sought to assess discordance of HER2 status in patients with HER2-amplified\/expressing solid tumors who underwent a repeat biopsy for pre-trial screening.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Consenting patients with solid tumors and documented HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization\/next generation sequencing (FISH\/NGS) on historical local testing underwent a new biopsy for central reevaluation of HER2 status. Samples were assessed for HER2 expression by IHC and <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification by FISH. Specimens were reviewed by a central laboratory. Patients with HER2 overexpression by IHC (3+) or <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification by FISH\/NGS on local testing were assessed for HER2 discordance on central testing (not amplified by FISH and\/or not 3+ by IHC on central reevaluation).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>56 patients with HER2 expression\/amplification on local testing with a median age of 59.5 years and 30 (53.6%) females underwent biopsy and repeat HER2 testing. Median time between consent and treatment for those enrolled was 26 days (range 8-83 days). Twelve cancers were represented, including 12 breast (21.4%), 6 gastroesophageal (10.7%), and 6 biliary tract (10.7%). 31 patients (55.4%) received HER2-targeted therapies between local and central testing. Local assessment of HER2 status on archival tissue was performed in 36 (64.3%) patients by IHC, 27 (48.2%) by FISH, and 18 (32.1%) by NGS. There were 23 patients who were IHC 3+ on local testing and of these, 15 (65.2%) were 3+, 4 (17.4%) were 2+ (3 FISH +), 2 (8.7%) were 1+ (FISH-), and 2 (8.7%) had 0 HER2 expression on central IHC. Of 4 patients that were 2+ without amplification on local testing, 3 were 2+ and 1 was 1+ on central IHC. In 18 patients with <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification on local NGS, 14 (77.8%) were 3+ on central IHC and 17 (94.4%) were <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplified by FISH. Of the 51 patients who were 3+ by IHC or amplified by FISH\/NGS on local testing, 14 (27.5%) were discordant on central reevaluation. Discordance in HER2 status was found in 5\/12 (41.7%) gastroesophageal, 2\/9 (22.2%) breast, and 1\/7 (14.3%) colorectal tumors. Discordant HER2 status was observed in 9 (30.0%) of 30 cases who received intervening HER2-targeted therapy and in 5 (23.8%) of 21 patients who did not. Of 14 patients with HER2 discordance, 7 were potentially eligible for trial enrollment based on local testing but ineligible based on central HER2 testing.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Discordance in HER2 status on repeat biopsy is not infrequent in patients with tumors previously identified as HER2-positive\/expressing. Discordance is not limited to patients with prior HER2-targeted therapy and could have therapeutic implications. Biomarker reevaluation may be warranted when considering HER2-targeted therapies but needs to be balanced with a slight delay in treatment initiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/54e59ecf-a5d6-4738-b514-22126ab1bb95\/@x03B8ZMP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,ErbB2,Immunohistochemistry,In situ hybridization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14098"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy D.

Chromosomally unstable tumors often contain rupture-prone micronuclei, which harbor mis-segregated chromosomes. Rupture of micronuclear envelopes represents a critical event in the evolution of chromosomally unstable tumors given its ability to catalyze the formation of genomic rearrangements known as chromothripsis, and to trigger the cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING inflammatory pathway, whose aberrant and chronic activation was found to promote metastatic progression [1]. Despite its central role in tumor progression, how micronuclear membranes collapse and why membrane repair mechanisms, which are functional at the primary nucleus, fail to restore micronuclear integrity, remains poorly understood. Here we show that the answer to these fundamental questions lays in mitochondria proximity to micronuclei: by means of advanced microscopy and cellular and molecular biology techniques, our results demonstrate that ruptured micronuclei are more heavily embedded in the mitochondrial matrix than the intact ones, and that ROS are the main cause of micronuclear rupture. We used a combination of ROS-inducing drugs on a variety of cell lines to show an increase in collapsed micronuclei, while using ROS-scavengers we reduced the physiological basal amount of micronuclear rupture.<br \/>Nuclear membrane catastrophe has recently been identified as the main outcome of unrestrained activity of the ESCRT-III nuclear membrane repair complex, of which CHMP7 is the scaffolding protein [2]. We showed that cells under oxidative stress display an increase in CHMP7 content in micronuclei whose membrane is not yet collapsed, implicating a causative role of CHMP7 in micronuclear envelope rupture. Furthermore, by means of genetic manipulation we demonstrate a central role for CHMP7 in ROS-induced rupture, with evidences pointing towards a non-canonical role for CHMP7 in this process. We thus provide a mechanistic insight into a fundamental hub in advanced cancers metastatic onset: by understanding the players involved into micronuclear collapse, this work can bring to light new untapped drug targets that are specific for those cells that will undergo metastatic transformation. In conclusion, our study has the potential to develop new and more effective therapies for the treatment of aggressive chromosomally unstable cancers.<br \/>1.

In chronic infection and cancer, exhausted T cells with impaired effector function and narrow TCR repertoires must respond to vast and diverse antigenic landscapes, favoring immune escape. Here we test whether T cell exhaustion and antigenic diversity converge to drive fatal immune failure in chronic infection and cancer. We leveraged over 600 primary longitudinal samples from the Protocol C (IAVI) and TRACERx (CRUK) studies to track the natural course of HIV-1 infection and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), respectively, using high parameter flow cytometry, genome sequencing and TCRseq, complemented with focused scRNAseq and antigen specific profiling. In both diseases systemic Tcf1-Tox+Eomes+PD1+ T (Tex) cells track antigen burden and predict adverse outcome, independent of host clinical status. In HIV-1 infection, Tex cells are clonally restricted and rapid Gag RNA sequence divergence accompanies higher viral loads and lower CD4 counts. Similarly, in lung cancer peripheral Tex cells harbor hyper-expanded TCRs, contract after resection and reconstitute at recurrence with strikingly preserved clonal hierarchies, creating a &#8216;specificity gap&#8217; that could be exploited by subclonal evolution. Commensurate with this model, we discover that a high level of systemic Tex cells coupled with either elevated Gag diversity in HIV-1 infection, or higher mutational or copy number heterogeneity in lung cancer defines patients with the poorest clinical outcome. We propose a unifying model of immune failure in chronic infection and cancer where genomic diversity and T cell exhaustion co-ordinately diminish human immune protection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a09deec-e6ba-4ab2-b9d6-ea63fb86fd41\/@x03B8ZMP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,T cell,Antigen,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14124"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James L.

Myc expression heterogeneity has also been linked to cancer drug resistance; however, the source of this heterogeneity remains poorly characterized. Even in isogenic cancer cell lines, we found that Myc is one of the most heterogeneously expressed transcription factors at the single-cell level. This heterogeneity is independent of cell cycle progression, local cell density, and p53\/p21 signaling. To elucidate the source and duration of Myc heterogeneity, we endogenously tagged Myc with a fluorescent protein and used long-term live-cell imaging techniques to monitor Myc expression over time at single-cell resolution. Surprisingly, we found that Myc expression is pulsatile, explaining why Myc expression appears heterogeneous at a given point in time. Furthermore, we found that Myc dynamics are heterogeneous, and the dynamics are not always heritable. Additionally, Myc pulse amplitude is correlated with the duration of G1 and the overall cell cycle, suggesting that the pulses may be a mechanism for escaping many chemotherapy agents. Finally, we show that Myc pulses are primarily transcription-driven and controlled by at least one negative feedback loop. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that Myc expression is pulsatile, and provide insights into Myc regulation in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8cb4c870-5aeb-4fb5-90c4-41b8db16acf6\/@x03B8ZMP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Myc,Single cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14125"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chad Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen Gascoigne<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, a subset of MSS CRCs contains variable fractions of MMRd cells. How the presence of MMRd cells in tumors classified as MSS impacts cancer immune surveillance is largely unknown. It is also unclear whether the pharmacological modulation of MMRd cells percentage in MMR heterogeneous tumor can occur and if this might result in the improvement of tumor immune control.To shed light on these aspects we studied isogenic mismatch repair proficient and deficient mouse tumor cells, generated by genetic inactivation of MLH1, a key component of the MMR machinery. We mixed MLH1<sup>+\/+<\/sup>and MLH1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>cells at different ratios, injecting the resulting heterogeneous populations in mice. In the presence of a competent immune system, the tumorigenic potential and immune surveillance of MSS\/MSI (MLH1<sup>+\/+<\/sup>\/MLH1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) heterogeneous tumors was dependent upon the MMRd fraction. Tumor rejection was observed when at least 50% of the cells were MMRd, but tumor growth delay was also evident when as low as 20 % of MMRd cells were present in the mixed population and this was paralleled by immune infiltration of the tumor. Molecular profiles of samples from MSS\/MSI heterogeneous tumors that evaded immune control, showed enrichment of the MSS fraction. Treatment of MSS\/MSI mixed populations with the antimetabolite 6-Thioguanine (6TG) greatly enriched the MMRd fraction and improved immune response. Overall, these results suggest that genetic and\/or pharmacological modulation of the DNA mismatch repair machinery can foster immune surveillance of MMR heterogeneous tumors and modulate the cancer immune environment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63aa02d7-0ed1-4f0a-9640-95c744dcc91e\/@x03B8ZMP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mismatch repair deficiency,Pharmacological selection,Immune response,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14126"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vito Amodio<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Germano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benedetta Mussolin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simona Lamba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosaria Chilà<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppe Rospo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caterina Marchiò<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Marsoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianluca Mauri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Di Nicolantonio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Bardelli<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here we investigate the root cause of this lineage plasticity in a primary murine prostate organoid model that mirrors the lineage transition seen in patients. These cells lose luminal identity within weeks following deletion of <i>Trp53<\/i> and <i>Rb1<\/i>, ultimately acquiring an Ar-negative, Syp+ phenotype after orthotopic <i>in vivo<\/i> transplantation. We performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of a time-course experiment on the prostate organoid following <i>Trp53 <\/i>and <i>Rb1 <\/i>deletion. Critical to this study, we developed SEACells, a method that enumerates distinct, highly granular cell states, allowing for robust transcriptomic quantification. Leveraging the SEACell platform, we developed several graph-based computational approaches based on Markov absorption, diffusion maps, and attributed stochastic block models to quantify dynamic changes in plasticity. These quantitative models independently confirmed rapid collapse of cell-type fidelity in the form of a mixed luminal-basal phenotype following tumor suppressor gene deletion. These methods compute metrics for plasticity that we correlated to candidate driver gene programs. Among the strongest plasticity correlates, Jak-Stat and Fgfr signaling stood out as gene programs activated early in the time-course prior to any corresponding morphological changes. We further developed a regression-based approach to nominate ligand-receptor interactions that activate downstream Jak-Stat signaling, which identified Fgf-Fgfr interactions that were functionally validated with growth factor addition and pharmacological inhibition. Most strikingly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Jak1\/2 in combination with Fgfr blockade not only reversed the plastic state and restored organoids to their wild-type morphology, but also re-sensitized drug-resistant cells to antiandrogen therapy in models with residual AR expression. We additionally confirm early activation of Jak\/Stat transcriptional programs in an <i>Rb1\/Trp53\/Pten<\/i>-deleted genetically engineered mouse model undergoing substantial cell-type diversification under plasticity in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Collectively, we show that lineage plasticity initiates quickly as a largely cell-autonomous process that is further increased in the <i>in vivo <\/i>setting, and through newly developed computational approaches, we identify a pharmacological strategy that restores lineage identity using clinical grade inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c038f535-86fa-4eab-bcb0-4d9dd11d5414\/@x03B8ZMP\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Organoids,JAK,Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14127"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joseph M.

Phenotypically diverse breast tumor and stroma subpopulations, and interactions between them that alter tumor cell biology, represent unique and spatially distinct niches.<b> <\/b> We hypothesize that localized neighborhoods of breast tumor cells possess specialized phenotypes that mediate chemoresistance and represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. In order to assess these potential phenotypes, we utilized imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a highly multiplexed imaging modality that allows simultaneous measurement of 30-40 antigens while retaining the spatial architecture of the cancer tissue. We constructed an IMC antibody panel that combines markers for tissue architecture, tumor and stromal cell phenotyping, and signaling pathway activation. IMC was applied to patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).Our TNBC PDX collection was established from tumors obtained before and after neoadjuvant Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC). IMC analysis of 18 PDX models representing eight patients revealed that stromal cell phenotypes were generally shared between all models, but tumor cell phenotypes were largely patient-specific. While every model was comprised primarily of a few major tumor cell phenotypes, we noted that each case also harbored several minor, unique populations, suggesting that specialized neighborhoods may exist within the tumor mass. Comparison of paired PDX models showed a wide range of phenotypic responses to chemotherapy, ranging from stable tumor composition to widespread changes in tumor phenotypes. These phenotypic changes arose despite relatively consistent genomic architecture. Vimentin<sup>hi<\/sup> fibroblasts were present more often in post-AC models, while SMA<sup>hi<\/sup> fibroblasts were unchanged after treatment. Comparison of pre-\/post-AC PDX pairs revealed spatially constrained MAPK activation emerged after treatment. To capture acute changes in tumor phenotype, we treated treatment-na&#239;ve PDX models with AC and evaluated tumors by IMC. As tumors regressed and then regrew, we identified novel phenotypic shifts, again including increased MAPK signaling localized to discrete neighborhoods, suggesting this property may be a common feature of chemoresistant TNBC. Analysis of adjacent cells revealed seven distinct neighborhoods, and ongoing work is aimed at determining whether these neighborhoods are altered in response to chemotherapy treatment. Taken together, our findings suggest that distinct tumor phenotypes arise following treatment. Our goal is to determine whether these unique phenotypic niches functionally contribute to chemoresistance and if disruption of these niches enhances chemosensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1fb67256-d6fa-4d31-8272-c87b7a7b247b\/@x03B8ZMP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Heterogeneity,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14128"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda L.

However, tumor molecular profiles are not static, and cancers continually evolve because of ongoing mutagenesis and clonal selection, with actionable genomic alterations potentially gained or lost during disease progression.<br \/>Methods: To define the concordance of potentially actionable genomic alterations between primary and metastatic disease sites in patients with urothelial cancer and to identify drivers of metastatic disease progression, we performed an integrated analysis of clinical and genomic data from 2,199 urothelial carcinoma patients (2,732 tumor and 331 plasma cfDNA samples) prospectively profiled at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 2014 to 2021. Paired primary and metastatic tumor samples from individual patients were sequenced with MSK-IMPACT and\/or whole-exome sequencing (WES). Plasma samples were analyzed using the MSK-ACCESS cfDNA platform.<br \/>Results: Among potentially actionable mutations (defined as OncoKB level 1-4), <i>ERBB2<\/i> and <i>ARID1A <\/i>were associated with higher tumor grade and stage (p-value &#60;0.001, p-value = 0.03 respectively). WES analysis of primary and metastatic tumor sites was consistent with early branched evolution with on average 42% of mutations shared between disease sites. Among chromatin-modifying genes, <i>ARID1A<\/i> has a discordant rate of 15.8%. In the 6 discordant cases, <i>ARID1A <\/i>mutation was seen exclusively in the metastatic tumor samples. This suggests a role for <i>ARID1A<\/i> mutations in metastatic disease progression. While known and likely oncogenic mutations were more likely to be concordant than variants of unknown functional significance, we observed a high degree of mutational discordance among potentially actionable genomic alterations with 23% discordant between primary and metastatic disease sites. 24% of mutations were exclusively identified by plasma cell-free DNA sequencing. Actionable mutations in cell-free DNA were more likely to be concordant with metastatic tumor biopsies than tumor tissue collected from the primary tumor site.<br \/>Conclusions: In sum, our analysis of patient-matched primary and metastatic urothelial carcinomas revealed a high degree of lesion-to-lesion genomic heterogeneity that may be a barrier to precision oncology approaches for this disease. Our data also provide a rationale for the use of cell-free DNA sequencing to guide targeted therapy selection in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2aa842b6-3cb1-4d54-9d7d-7d1b9d58180e\/@x03B8ZMP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Cell-free DNA,Genomic Heterogeneity,ARID1A,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14129"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ziyu Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy N.

We generated more than 20,000 single-cell whole genomes from 25 high-grade serous ovarian and triple-negative breast cancers across a range of mutational subtypes. Through the development of new computational methods, we resolved alterations into cancer haplotypes, providing fine-grained resolution of genomic events in single-cells and exposing extensive cell-to-cell genomic variation. We identified 3 key processes that contribute to this diversity. Firstly, we observed that parallel copy number events - whereby different cancer cells harbor chromosomal aberrations with identical total copy number but different combinations of maternal and paternal alleles - were present in &#38;gt; 80% of the tumors. This is consistent with extensive convergent evolution in these tumors. Secondly, we identified considerable cell-to-cell variability in the amplitude of high-level amplifications, often impacting oncogenes. Single-cell transcriptomes and immunohistochemistry from the same samples showed that this genomic diversity led to phenotypic differences between cells. Finally, we observed copy number break-point variability consistent with progressive genomic diversification, which we termed serriform structural variation (SSV). Both SSV&#8217;s and variable high-level amplifications were enriched in foldback inversion (FBI) bearing tumors relative to homologous recombination deficient tumors, highlighting that FBI tumors have greater levels of structural instability. Our study sheds new light on the evolution of genomically unstable tumors with implications for cancer evolution, therapeutic targeting, and patient stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e1bad6a1-1f9f-4440-873f-7322513d7219\/@y03B8ZMQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Intratumoral heterogeneity,Cancer evolution,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14130"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marc J.

Treatment resistance is a significant concern in SCLC and a major factor regulating resistance is an emergence of unique cellular populations and an increase in intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH). We hypothesize that these emerging populations expressing various resistance-associated pathways, represent multiple, unique drug-resistant persister cell populations that underlie increased ITH and promote therapeutic resistance and, eventually, relapse, despite the initial response to therapy. Persister cells represent a unique population of cancer cells that are resistant to therapeutic pressure. While most persister cells remain arrested under treatment, a rare sub-population exists that can reverse state and re-enter the cell cycle. We performed single cell RNAseq of relapsed, extensive stage SCLC patient paired core biopsies collected 1) following relapse to standard of care (SOC) platinum chemotherapy plus immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and 2) after six weeks of further therapy. Unlike what we found in platinum-sensitive disease, there is not a meaningful change in ITH score between cancer cells in the first and second biopsy. Presumably, maximum heterogeneity developed along with relapse to SOC treatment. Biopsies represent SCLC across subtypes (SCLC-A\/N\/P\/I) with a modest loss of transcription factor expression following treatment (e.g., 76.8% to 57.9% <i>NEUROD1<\/i>). Cancer cells were classified as cycling or non-cycling to identify potential persister cell populations in paired patient core biopsies. Molecular subtype marker <i>ASCL1<\/i> was reduced in non-cycling cells, but there was no change in NEUROD1 or <i>POU2F3<\/i>. Cycling cells demonstrate increased expression of NE genes (<i>SYP, INSM1, UCHL1<\/i>), biomarkers of response (<i>SLFN11<\/i> and <i>CDH1)<\/i>, but also genes associated with resistance (<i>EZH2, NFIB<\/i>). Non-cycling cells exhibit some common resistance mechanisms (e.g., EMT and <i>MYC<\/i>, <i>AXL<\/i>, <i>ZFP36L1<\/i>, and <i>REST<\/i> overexpression) and increased expression of inflammatory genes (e.g. HLA family) compared to cycling cells, reminiscent of the SCLC-Inflamed (SCLC-I) subtype. These data suggest that non-cycling persister cells may be more sensitive to ICB, AXL and\/or AURK inhibition, while cycling cells may be more responsive to platinum chemotherapy, epigenetic modifiers or DNA repair targeted therapies. Clinically, these data underscore the importance of maximizing and maintaining the initial response in platinum-sensitive SCLC tumors, while highlighting the transcriptional complexity underlying SCLC&#8217;s profound treatment resistance following SOC and address the major need to develop combination therapies to target these distinct cell populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e52ad47-6dce-4ee8-b98d-4a323ea1b7da\/@y03B8ZMQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Resistance,Single cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14131"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>C.

Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP or PEBP1) effectively suppresses metastasis in TNBC but is lost in many patients. We hypothesize that RKIP works in part by reducing the variability of gene expression in TNBC cells. To test whether RKIP reduces overall transcriptional heterogeneity, we compared the variation in gene expression between individual cells in metastatic (low RKIP) versus non-metastatic (high RKIP) TNBC tumors. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed transcriptional heterogeneity was decreased with RKIP overexpression. Many cancer regulatory genes were more homogeneous and up-regulated in the RKIP-expressing cells. Among these enriched and homogenously expressed genes is KMT5C, a histone methyltransferase that facilitates epigenetic transcriptional repression. Cell, mouse, and clinical<i> <\/i>studies suggest KMT5C expression blocks invasion, extravasation, and colonization of tumor cells, consistent with a role as a novel suppressor of metastasis.

However, IFN&#947; is also important in limiting tissue destruction due to inflammation, taking on an immunotolerant role and allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. We previously identified an interferon response cell state across diverse cancer types, as defined by the relative expression of <i>IFIT1<\/i>, <i>HLA-A<\/i>, <i>HLA-DRA<\/i>, <i>STAT1<\/i>, and <i>IRF1<\/i>. The interferon response cell state is heterogeneously expressed in cancer cells and appears to function both by cancer cell extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms. Several clinical trials have tested the efficacy of IFN&#947; as a therapeutic for immune system stimulation in patients with melanoma. However, these have failed to detect effective outcomes, and have even noted some pro-growth actions, perhaps consistent with IFN&#947;&#8217;s immunotolerant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis. We are interested in identifying cell populations that are vulnerable to the antitumor functions of IFN&#947;, as well as cell populations that may be susceptible to IFN&#947;&#8217;s pro-tumor actions. To test this, we treated a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line with three doses of IFN&#947; in vitro every day for five days and analyzed expression of proteins associated with IFN&#947; signaling by flow cytometry each day. Distinct doses of IFN&#947; have been shown to affect varying degrees of antitumor and pro-tumor responses. For example, growth inhibition has been seen upon treatment with high dose IFN&#947;, while treatment with low dose IFN&#947; is consistent with increased metastatic capability such as increased resistance to cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells despite the upregulation of MHC-I. We thus treated cells with three doses of IFN&#947;: low, normal, and high. Preliminary results have shown a dose dependent effect of IFN&#947; including the upregulation of MHC-I and PDL1. Ongoing work includes identifying changes in cell states using single-cell RNA-sequencing to uncover how cancer cells respond to varying intensities of IFN&#947; exposure. Additionally, we are analyzing how release of IFN&#947; from cancer cells changes following treatment of IFN&#947; at different doses. This work will provide insight into the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade immune surveillance and how cell states can describe a tumor&#8217;s vulnerability to IFN&#947;&#8217;s antitumor and pro-tumor effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5fe614c8-3a11-4d9e-8226-4bef05f134d3\/@y03B8ZMQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Antigen presentation,Cancer cell states,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14134"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Deborah A.

Recently, genome analysis has revealed that multiple clusters exist in one tumor, and it has been reported that intratumor heterogeneity causes treatment resistance even in lung cancer. However, the mechanism of intratumor heterogeneity has not yet been clarified. Previous studies of intratumor heterogeneity have mainly focused on analyzing cancer cells from patients, classifying clusters of different properties, and identifying factors that define their characteristics. Multiple clusters are present in the tumor tissue of a single patient, and analysis of multiple patients classifies them into even more clusters, but it is difficult to research all of them. To solve this problem, an early model of intratumor heterogeneity in which homogeneous cells become heterogeneous is needed.We hypothesized that intratumor heterogeneity cell model could be found in resistant strains.Alectinib was exposed in vitro to an ALK-positive lung cancer cell line (H2228) to create an alectinib-resistant cell line (H2228-AR1S). H2228-AR1S has two subpopulations that look different. Of the two subpopulations, the smaller cells have high CD47 expression (CD47 high subpopulation), and the scattered spindle-shaped cells have low CD47 expression (CD47 low subpopulation). Using flow cytometry, each subpopulation was isolated, and its properties were investigated. There was no difference in sensitivity to alectinib between the CD47 high subpopulation and the CD47 low subpopulation. In the low subpopulation of CD47, epithelial markers were decreased, and mesenchymal markers were increased using immunoblotting. It suggests that CD47 low subpopulation has undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The CD47 high subpopulation had high sphere formation ability in vitro, and high tumorigenicity using Xenograft model. <i>CD47 <\/i>gene inhibition using siRNA reduced the sphere formation ability of the CD47 high subpopulation. This suggests that CD47 is involved in sphere formation.There have been no reports of CD47 being involved in the characteristics of intratumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, using intratumor heterogeneity cell model, we are exploring the mechanism that regulate division into two subpopulations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a5a607b-78a4-4e3a-af37-805f83b00f43\/@y03B8ZMQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Adenocarcinoma,Resistance,CD47,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14135"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tomoko Y.

Patients with luminal-like, Estrogen Receptor (ER)-expressing tumors have better prognosis than patients with more aggressive, triple-negative or basal-like tumors. There is, however, a subset of luminal-like tumors that express lower levels of ER, which exhibit more basal-like features. Previous studies have suggested that triple negative, basal-like tumors may arise from a luminal cell-of-origin, but there are no definitive studies that identify the cell-of-origin of these low ER tumors.<br \/>Analysis of 2208 invasive breast carcinomas from 2012-2020 revealed that 2% of tumors have low ER expression (less than 10% ER positive cells), which are mostly high-grade carcinomas and exhibit basal-like features. TCGA analysis revealed that tumors with lower ER expression (lowest quartile of ER expression) expressed higher basal signature genes as compared to tumors with higher levels of ER expression. This variation within the ER+ subtype and the emergence of basal-like characteristics within low ER tumors suggest that some luminal tumors may evolve into a more basal-like or triple-negative subtype.<br \/>The luminal mouse mammary tumor, MMTV-PyMT, was used to model low ER human tumors and, similar to the patient tumor samples, basal-like tumor cells were also found within these tumors. Lineage tracing using tissue-specific and inducible <i>Cre<\/i> recombinase-based labelling was performed to elucidate the lineage-of-origin of these basal-like cells, revealing that these basal-like cells were derived from normal luminal epithelial cells, not basal cells.<br \/>Our study uncovers the existence of luminal-basal plasticity within tumors of a low ER subtype that enables these cells to transition into a more basal-like state. Understanding the factors that enable this plasticity to occur may reveal opportunities to curb the evolution of more aggressive traits, potentially improving the way breast cancer is currently managed and treated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2c2a293c-590e-4da6-ab4b-12dd06ba2c00\/@y03B8ZMQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Tumor evolution,Breast cancer,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14136"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gadisti Aisha Nurulhijjah Binti Mohamed<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nevena B.

Emerging evidence implicates the transcriptome as a source of important variation that impacts tumor phenotype. Here, we perform a genomic-transcriptomic analysis of intra-tumor transcriptomic diversity upon 941 tumor regions taken from 357 TRACERx non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) across primary and metastatic disease subjected to high-depth bulk DNA and RNA sequencing, as well as 91 tumor-adjacent normal tissue samples.<br \/>Results: Genomic and transcriptomic diversity are linked across primary and metastatic disease, with expression signatures of proliferation being enriched in the metastasis seeding subclone of the primary tumor relative to non-metastasis seeding subclones. Copy-number independent allele-specific expression (CN-independent ASE), a source of transcriptome-specific diversity, affects 1% (&#177; 0.5%) of genes and is underpinned by aberrant allele-specific methylation (OR=7.58, p&#8804;2.2x10-16), thus providing a window to the NSCLC epigenomic landscape. Driver mutations in chromatin remodellers and histone modifiers, in particular SETD2 and KDM5C, are associated with increased global levels of CN-independent ASE (p=0.0001). In genomically stable tumors, high levels of CN-independent ASE are linked to expression signatures consistent with genomic instability and proliferation (R=0.58, p=0.001), highlighting convergence between the genome and transcriptome in tumor evolution. For the first time, we uncover mutational signatures of RNA editing. Analysis of their activity links the expression of ADAR and APOBEC enzymes to editing processes revealing otherwise hidden APOBEC activity within tumors at sampling (RNA APOBEC activity identified in 188 tumor regions (32%) without evidence of DNA APOBEC activity). RNA editing activity is shared between primary tumors and paired metastasis, but not paired tumor-adjacent normal tissue, suggestive of heritability of this somatic transcriptional process. Finally, we combine multiple measures of genomic and transcriptomic variation in a multi-region approach to define important variation within cancer genes. We illustrate examples that would be missed with a purely genomic focus and demonstrate genomic-transcriptomic parallel evolution, converging on disruption to single cancer genes, such as FAT1 and APC, in different regions of a tumor.<br \/>Conclusions: This work highlights the importance of the transcriptome during tumor evolution, as well as the power of integrative multi-omic assessments of ITH, and provides novel insight into the role of transcriptomic variation in lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5ae8fc5d-fbf1-46ae-bfc7-c9db0d55142b\/@y03B8ZMQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Epigenetics,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14137"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James R.

However, the majority of melanoma patients eventually acquire therapy resistance. The emergence of resistant metastases likely results from <i>de novo<\/i> somatic mutations secondary to inherent tumor genetic instability. We hypothesize that intertumoral genetic differences introduce immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as inducing myeloid-derived suppressor cell differentiation, that dampen existing antitumor immune responses. As all metastases share one host immune system, we investigated the local and systemic effects of intertumoral heterogeneity on antitumor immunity and PD-1 immunotherapy response in mice with multiple, synchronous melanoma metastases. To recapitulate intertumoral heterogeneity, we simultaneously injected PD-1 blockade-resistant YUMM 1.7 and its UVB-irradiated, PD-1 sensitive, derivative YUMM<u>ER<\/u> 1.7 melanoma cell lines into opposite flanks of the same C57BL\/6J mouse. We previously demonstrated that tumor-specific <i>de novo<\/i> somatic mutations, in combination with the host immune response, generate distinct microenvironments in synchronous YUMM<u>ER<\/u> (immunologically active) and YUMM (immunologically inactive) tumors. Our novel murine synchronous melanoma model demonstrated that the presence of immunologically inactive YUMM tumors changes systemic antitumor immunity, including the induction of host splenic myelopoiesis. This phenomenon is accompanied by an increase in YUMM<u>ER<\/u> intratumoral M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor) concentration and an influx of immunosuppressive PD-L1+ (PD-1 ligand) macrophages into YUMM<u>ER<\/u> tumors as assessed by flow cytometry and Luminex analyses. Furthermore, compared to control CD8 T cells, synchronous YUMM<u>ER<\/u>-infiltrating CD8 T cells exhibit reduced functionality, with increased surface PD-1 persistence and failure to respond to PD-1 blockade. As a result, the presence of YUMM tumors are able to confer PD-1 blockade resistance to the normally PD-1 sensitive YUMM<u>ER<\/u> tumors. Our results suggest that intertumoral heterogeneity leads to a &#8220;reverse abscopal effect,&#8221; where immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors can alter systemic myeloid immune responses to suppress antitumor CD8 T cell function in immunologically &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors. As such, the addition of myeloid-altering agents to PD-1 immunotherapy are likely to improve treatment efficacy and prevent acquired therapy resistance in patients with metastatic melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/635df443-83cc-4d3d-bc3b-364ea44d9780\/@y03B8ZMQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint blockade,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14139"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shuyang S.

Previous studies, although limited in scale and depth, have shown that these tumors are typically genomically complex, with a moderate burden of single nucleotide variants but extensive copy number aberrations (CNAs).<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We applied a multi-omics approach to scrutinize the evolution and heterogeneity of a primary MPNST and five recurrence regions from one patient with an NF1 phenotype. Techniques utilized included bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS), single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), simultaneous genome and transcriptome sequencing (G&#38;T-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and laser capture microdissection (LCM)-based spatial genomics.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>We find significant heterogeneity in copy number profiles, suggestive of ongoing chromosomal instability and evolution. We perform in-depth tumor phylogenetic reconstruction from bulk WGS data. scDNA-seq revealed further CNA heterogeneity across and within regions, allowing us to refine the tree down to single-cell resolution. <i>De novo<\/i> somatic variant calling in scDNA-seq data confirms the reconstructed tree and identifies additional subclonal mutations.<br \/>We also profile different populations of tumor and non-tumor cells and confirmed this with a genotyping approach. CNA profiles inferred from scRNA-seq reflect the within-region heterogeneity seen in scDNA-seq. We find tumor cells with similar CNA profiles typically cluster together by their gene expression profiles as well, implying that the majority of gene expression heterogeneity in this tumor is underpinned by copy number changes. By using CNA profiles as a native barcoding system, we link genetic subclones to clusters of cells and their transcriptomes to characterize the effects of gene dosage.<br \/>Finally, we explore the spatial relationships between tumor subclones using LCM. We detect heterogeneity within tissue sections evidencing local clonal expansions and CNA events that follow spatial distributions. Using spatial transcriptomics, we show tumor cells are homogeneously admixed with tumor microenvironment populations.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b><b>s <\/b>Our work demonstrates the power of combining spatial multi-omics at the single-cell and bulk levels to study cancer evolution. This enables a spatio-temporal representation of a tumor&#8217;s development with annotation of genetic and transcriptomic events.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09167a99-3836-40f5-9d19-3f1e30838471\/@y03B8ZMQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Multiomics,Copy number alterations,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14157"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haixi Yan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonas Demeulemeester<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annelien Verfaillie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Cotobal Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Kaufmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roland Schwarz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thierry Voet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Zaccaria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrienne Flanagan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Tarabichi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Van Loo<\/i><\/presenter>.
