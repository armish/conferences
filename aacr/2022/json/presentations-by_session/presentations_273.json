Studies have implicated that efficient anti-PD1 therapy relies specifically on intact CD28\/B7 signaling. We have previously shown that membranal CD28 is actively shed by MMP-2 and MMP-13 upon T cell stimulation in humans, and that soluble CD28 can counteract the efficacy of anti-PD1 blocking antibodies in-vitro. Here we describe that CD28-shedding process is a potential novel resistance mechanism to PD-1 therapies in cancer patients, by using several ex-vivo and in-vivo methodologies. The prominent unfavorable effect of CD28-shedding on PD-1 blockade prompted the generation of BND-67, an agent that can selectively and efficiently block CD28 shedding.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Soluble CD28 detection in plasma of cancer patients and in the culture media of stimulated T cells was achieved using a proprietary in-house ELISA. Cancer patient processed tumors and PBMC were used ex-vivo to identify membrane\/soluble CD28 by ELISA and flow-cytometry. MC-38 challenged human CD28 transgenic mice (CD28-shedding permissive model), and WT mice (non-permissive CD28-shedding model) were compared for efficacy to anti-PD1 blocking antibody. BND-67 was isolated by screening a VHH library for binding to the CD28-shedding prone region and blocking of CD28 shedding. The lead clone was further affinity-matured and reformatted into a half-life extended construct.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> CD28 receptor density was found to be lower on tumor-resident T cells then their matched counterparts in the periphery. Evaluation of plasma samples from patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy demonstrated an association of diseases relapse with elevated plasma levels of soluble CD28. Correspondingly, relapses from response to anti-PD-1 therapy were significantly higher in CD28-shedding permissive mice vs non-permissive mice. To overcome this novel regulatory mechanism, we generated BND-67, which is an affinity-matured VHH that can effectively bind CD28, block CD28 shedding and has no agonistic activity. In addition, an optimal approach for increasing the half-life of the agent was identified by fusing the VHH to human Fc.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We report here the discovery of a potential novel resistance mechanism to anti-PD1 blockade involving the shedding of the CD28 receptor. This process occurs in the setting of cancer and was further reinforced by results observed in transgenic mice. Biond has generated BND-67, a therapeutic drug candidate for the inhibition of this novel regulatory mechanism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Resistance,Transgenic mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Motti Hakim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Fridman Dror<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tal Shahar Gabay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dror Alishekevitz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edna Meilin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilana Mandel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yair Sapir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avidor Shulman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tehila Ben Moshe<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite excellent initial responses, ultimately these tumors develop resistance to targeted therapy. While several cancer cell intrinsic mechanisms of targeted therapy resistance are well known, they do not account for all cases of resistance. Based on our previous observations, we hypothesized components of the tumor microenvironment, specifically monocytes and macrophages, also contribute to the development of targeted therapy resistance. We generated bone marrow derived macrophages from C57BL\/6 mice and polarized them to an M0, M1, or M2 phenotype over the course of 6 days. At day 7, cells were plated in fresh media and after 2 days, the conditioned media (CM) was collected. Macrophage polarization was verified via qPCR. Murine cell lines, EA-1, EA-2, and EA-3 are unique, murine lung adenocarcinomas bearing an oncogenic ALK fusion derived from C57BL\/6 mice. These murine cell lines were then cultured in the macrophage CM prior to exposure to ALK fusion specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), alectinib or crizotinib. We observed that culture in M2-CM resulted in at least a 10-fold increase in alectinib resistance across all 3 murine cell lines when compared to the same cell lines cultured in M1 or M0-CM. We next tested for the activity of known, clinically relevant bypass signaling pathways as mediator of M2-CM protection. Aftatinib, an inhibitor of EGFR and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) family of proteins, did not alter M2-CM protection in the presence of alectinib. M2-CM did not impart TKI resistance to the murine cell lines in the presence of crizotinib, a TKI which inhibits ALK fusion activity and MET receptor tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting bypass signaling through MET drives the M2-CM resistance. Ongoing animal model studies demonstrate a clear role for innate immune cells in decreasing tumor responsiveness to TKI. In summary, our work demonstrates TKI therapy may be modulated by the presence of and interaction with specific immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. These data support exploring macrophage targeting therapies to improve TKI responsiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Targeted therapy,Resistance,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Melanie Mandell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Priest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anh Le<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynn Heasley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raphael Nemenoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erin L.

Identification of drug-tolerant cells (DTC) vulnerabilities thus represents an attractive strategy to prevent relapse in patients. We observed that EGFR-TKI-derived DTC displayed an increased level of DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSB), raising the hypothesis that genomic instability in these cells could favor the onset of resistance mechanisms. We tested AsiDNA, a small molecule that interferes with the DNA repair machinery, to prevent the emergence of resistances<br \/><b>Experimental design: <\/b>AsiDNA is a double stranded DNA molecule (decoy oligonucleotide) that mimics DNA DSB to interfere with DNA repair, by over-activating a false signaling of DNA damage through DNA-PK and PARP enzymes. We used EGFR-mutated (PC9 and HCC827) or ALK-translocated (H3122) lung tumor cells as well as a PC9 xenograft model, to assess whether a long-term combination of AsiDNA and TKI (erlotinib or osimertinib for EGFR-mutated and alectinib for ALK-translocated cells) could prevent the emergence of resistances arising from DTC. We also performed RNAseq to identify molecular mechanisms underlying AsiDNA effect on TKI-derived DTC.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b>Concomitant<b> <\/b>treatment of TKI with AsiDNA strongly prevented the emergence of TKI-resistant clones in the three cell lines tested, whereas AsiDNA alone did not display cytotoxic activity. Interestingly, AsiDNA didn&#8217;t increase the apoptotic activity of TKI but rather prevented the re-entry of drug-tolerant &#8220;dormant&#8221; cells into a proliferative state, ultimately resulting in DTC death. RNAseq data revealed a strong downregulation of gene signatures associated with cell cycle, DNA repair but also several pathways known to promote DTC survival such as Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) or Interferon pathway in AsiDNA+osimertinib vs osimertinib alone. <i>In vivo<\/i>, AsiDNA strongly interfered with the emergence of resistances in a PC9 xenograft model treated with erlotinib, resulting in a delayed relapse for the majority of tumors and a complete tumor regression for 20% of them, with no evidence of toxicity for mice.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Inhibition of the DNA repair machinery using AsiDNA efficiently prevented the emergence of resistances to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and point to the therapeutic opportunity of combining AsiDNA and TKI to overcome resistance in clinical situation.

Although many drivers of acquired drug resistance have been identified, the underlying molecular mechanisms shaping tumor evolution during treatment are incompletely understood. We have seen that lung cancer targeted therapies commonly used in the clinic induce the expression of cytidine deaminase APOBEC3A (A3A), leading to sustained mutagenesis in drug tolerant cancer cells persisting during therapy. Preventing therapy induced A3A mutagenesis by gene deletion delayed the emergence of drug resistance. Here, we show that therapy induced A3A mutagenesis contributes to tumor evolution in NSCLC. Whole genome sequencing revealed that resistant clones that evolved from persistent drug tolerant cells (late clones) harbored more A3A mutations compared to the parental cell population than pre existing resistant clones (early clones). In a subset of NSCLC patients who received targeted therapies, we observed A3A mutations accompanied clonal evolution during treatment. Comparison of APOBEC mutation fractions in short vs long term responders suggests that short responders with acquired resistance mechanisms that evolved from pre existing resistant clones have less accumulation of APOBEC mutations. Collectively, these findings insist that an increase in mutagenic processes drives tumor evolution during targeted therapy treatment and leads to acquired resistance. Thus, suppressing expression or enzymatic activity of A3A may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to halt the evolution of resistant clones and prevent acquired resistance to lung cancer targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Targeted therapy,Resistance,Mutagenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hideko Isozaki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ammal Abbasi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naveed Nikpour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcello Stanzione<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramin Sakhtemani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susanna L.

In lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs), this phenomenon drives neuroendocrine (NE) and squamous cell (LUSC) histologic transdifferentiation in the context of acquired resistance to targeted inhibition of driver mutations, with up to 14% and 9% incidences in <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant tumors relapsed on EGFR inhibitors, respectively. Notably, survival of patients with NE- or LUSC-transdifferentiated tumors is lower than that of either LUAD or <i>de novo<\/i> LUSC patients. To date, little is known about the molecular effectors enhancing lineage plasticity and driving histological transdifferentiation due to the paucity of well annotated pre- and post-transdifferentiation clinical samples amenable for molecular analyses. Currently no specific therapies for LUSC or NE transdifferentiation prevention are available for patients at high risk of transformation.<br \/>We performed multi-omic profiling of transdifferentiating clinical samples, as well as control never-transformed LUAD and <i>de novo<\/i> LUSC and small cell carcinomas, including comprehensive and integrative genomic (whole exome sequencing), epigenomic (bisulfite sequencing), transcriptomic (RNAseq) and protein (antibody arrays) characterization. Findings were validated in preclinical models including cell lines as well as LUSC- and NE-transdifferentiation patient-derived xenograft models.<br \/>Our data suggest that histological transdifferentiation is driven by epigenetic -rather than mutational- events, and indicate that transdifferentiated tumors retain molecular features of their previous LUAD state. Integrative analysis revealed biological pathways dysregulated specifically for distinct histological outcomes, including downregulation of RTK signaling and Notch-related genes in NE-transformed tumors, and upregulation of genes involved in Hedgehog and Notch signaling and MYC targets in LUSC-transdifferentiated tumors.

Allosteric SHP2 inhibitors (SHP2is) stabilize auto-inhibition mediated by N-SH2\/PTP interactions and prevent its activation by upstream stimuli. SHP2is impair the proliferation of oncogenic RTK- or cycling RAS mutant-expressing tumor cells and can overcome adaptive resistance to single agents targeting the RAS-MAPK-ERK pathway (e.g., EGFR, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>, MEK inhibitors). Multiple SHP2is are in clinical trials as single agents or in various combinations. As resistance to targeted therapy is universal, we sought to prospectively identify potential SHP2-extrinsic resistance mechanisms by performing genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout screens on two SHP2i-sensitive human FLT3-ITD driven AML cell lines, MOLM13 and MV4:11. We identified several expected &#8220;hits&#8221; based on known signaling pathways, including tumor suppressor (<i>NF1<\/i>,<i> PTEN<\/i>,<i>CDKN1B<\/i>) and &#8220;RASopathy&#8221; (<i>LZTR1<\/i>,<i> RASA2<\/i>) genes, as well as novel targets including<i> INPPL1<\/i>,<i>MAP4K5,<\/i> and some epigenetic modifiers. To test the generality of these findings, we built a&#8220;mini-CRISPR library of ~30 hits common to MOLM13 and MV4:11 cells and screened 15 SHP2i-sensitive lines.<i> LZTR1<\/i> deletion conferred resistance in 14\/15, followed by<i> MAP4K5<\/i> (9\/15),<i>SPRED2<\/i> (6\/15),<i> STK40<\/i> (6\/15),<i> INPPL1<\/i> (5\/15),<i> NCOA6<\/i> (4\/15),<i> NCOR1<\/i> (4\/15), and<i> ELAVL1<\/i> (4\/15). <i>LZTR1 <\/i>has been reported to regulate RIT or RAS stability. Notably,<i> LZTR1<\/i> knockout universally increased RIT1, but in some lines, also increased RAS.<i> INPPL1<\/i> encodes SHIP2, a 5&#8217;-inositide phosphatase that negatively regulates AKT activation in insulin signaling. However,<i> INPPL1 <\/i>deletion also increased RAS and ERK activity and activated ERK-dependent genes in FLT3-ITD AML lines. Experiments with<i> INPPL1<\/i> mutant showed that SHC binding and an N-terminal region, but not the SH2 domain or phosphatase activity, is required for negative regulation of RAS. Interestingly,<i> INPPL1<\/i> deletion also promoted resistance to SHP2 inhibition in several EGFR mutant cell lines. <i>MAP4K5<\/i> deletion also increased ERK-dependent gene expression. Kinase activity, but not JNK activation, was required for <i>MAP4K5 <\/i>action. Our results predict multiple mechanisms of SHP2i resistance, emphasizing the need for detailed understanding of the resistance landscape to arrive a combinations that provide long term disease control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Ras,Resistance,Signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wei Wei<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Geer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyi Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neville Sanjana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin G.

While type II tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionized the treatment of KIT-mutant GIST, they are thought to be ineffective for many PDGFRA-mutant GIST cases. Over 80% of PDGFRA mutations in GIST occur in exon 18 and patients with the most common mutation, D842V, are resistant to imatinib and other type II TKIs, leading to poor outcomes. However, beyond D842V, numerous other PDGFRA exon 18 mutations have been observed. From curated data of a large cohort of PDGFRA-mutant GISTs, we have identified nearly 50 unique PDGFRA exon 18 mutations, including both point mutations and complex indels. Although it is largely unknown how these mutations respond to imatinib, currently most, if not all, PDGFRA exon 18 mutations are assumed to be imatinib resistant. Using cell models, we tested some of the most commonly observed mutations in this cohort. Contrary to dogma, we observed that some exon 18 mutations tested were imatinib sensitive. We also observed that imatinib sensitivity seemed to be dependent on the properties of the residue in the 842-codon position, which encodes a key auto-inhibitory residue. We then hypothesized that imatinib sensitivity of every known or future reported PDGFRA exon 18 mutation might be predicted based on the 842 residue. To test the predictive potential of the 842 residue, we created mutagenic libraries that included every amino acid substitution at the 842 position. We expressed each mutation in Ba\/F3 cells and assessed imatinib sensitivity via immunoblotting for phosphorylated-PDGFRA. Overall, 40% of tested mutations were sensitive to imatinib, further debunking the belief that all PDGFRA exon 18 mutations are imatinib resistant. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that any hydrophobic residue at the 842 position conferred imatinib resistance (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 100nM), and all other amino acids tested to date were imatinib sensitive (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 100nM). Based on these data alone, over 55% of the 50 unique mutations identified from our PDGFRA-mutant GIST patient cohort would be predicted to be imatinib sensitive, demonstrating the importance of understanding the biochemical properties of various exon 18 mutations to predict treatment outcomes. Our predictive model would help identify patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutations that could benefit from using front-line imatinib as an alternative to avapritinib, which has been recently approved for first-line treatment for all PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST. Imatinib, which has been used clinically for over 20 years, has a superior safety and tolerability profile compared to avapritinib. This paradigm shifting approach has the potential to transform patient care and outcomes by optimizing the sequencing of TKIs for PDGFRA-mutant GIST patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Homma M.
