[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Whether social determinants of health (SDOH) affect US breast and colon cancer screening rates remains unclear. That said, in 2011 the CDC began recording a social vulnerability index (SVI) for all US counties. SVI was designed to capture four SDOH: socioeconomic status (SES), household composition and disability, minority status and language, and housing type and transportation. This retrospective study sought to determine the association of county-level SVI with breast and colon cancer screening rates.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used publicly available data from the CDC 2018 SVI database to collect SVI scores for every US county. SVI scores range from 0.1 to 1. A lower score indicates low vulnerability, while a higher score suggests high vulnerability. SVI scores were merged with publicly available data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) containing county modeled estimates for breast and colon cancer screening rates. Counties were then divided into &#60; 50th percentile and &#62;= 50th percentile for breast and colon cancer screening. SVI scores and their four SDOH were compared between groups. Statistical significance between groups was assessed at an alpha less than 0.5. Linear regression was used to identify the association between high county-level SVI and the probability of being &#62;= 50th percentile in breast and colon cancer screening.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> This study involved 3,109 counties. Compared to counties &#62;= 50th percentile in breast cancer screening (n = 1543), those &#60; 50th percentile (n = 1566) were significantly worse off in SES (0.60 &#177; 0.27 vs. 0.41 &#177; 0.27), household composition and disability (0.58 &#177; 0.28 vs. 0.42 &#177; 0.28), minority status and language (0.51 &#177; .30 vs. 0.49 &#177; .28), housing type and transportation (0.53 &#177; 0.29 vs. 0.46 &#177; 0.28), and overall SVI (0.58 &#177; 0.28 vs. 0.42 &#177; 0.27) (p &#60; .0001). Likewise, compared to counties &#62;= 50th percentile in colon cancer screening (n = 1548), those &#60; 50th percentile (n = 1561) were also significantly worse off in SES (0.63 &#177; 0.27 vs. 0.38 &#177; 0.25), household composition and disability (0.59 &#177; 0.27 vs. 0.41 &#177; 0.27), minority status and language (0.54 &#177; .30 vs. 0.45 &#177; .27), housing type and transportation (0.54 &#177; 0.29 vs. 0.46 &#177; 0.28), and overall SVI (0.61 &#177; 0.28 vs. 0.39 &#177; 0.27) (p &#60; .0001). High SVI counties compared with low SVI counties were significantly less likely to be &#62;= 50th percentile in breast cancer and colon cancer screening, OR 0.24 (95% CI 0.20 - 0.29) and 0.14 (95% CI 0.12 - 0.18). Finally, county-level SVI percentile correlated negatively with breast and colon cancer screening rates, Pearson coefficient -0.35 and -0.46.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This study highlights the significant impact of US county-level SVI on breast and colon cancer screening rates, signaling the need for more effective intervention strategies and allocation of resources to help improve SDOH for our country's most vulnerable citizens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f8e59995-9933-450c-b341-12cd87ffc845\/@B03B8ZCT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,,Breast cancer,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13406"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akhil Mehta<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Lau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gayathri Nagaraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hamid Mirshahidi<\/i><\/presenter>.

An AL index included 9 biomarkers (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, BMI, albumin, eGFR, creatinine, glucose, and use of medications for hypertension, diabetes, or hypocholesteremia) with 1 point assigned for each biomarker meeting a pre-determined cutoff. AL was dichotomized between AL-high (5-9) and AL-low (0-4) with median progression-free survival of first-line therapy (mPFS1) and median overall survival (mOS) estimated for both groups with Kaplan-Meier curves. Rates of clinically actionable driver mutations (driver-POS), including EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF V600e, RET, MET, NTRK, and KRAS G12C, were compared for both groups using chi-squared test. Mean AL was compared between those who were driver-POS and those who did not have a clinically actionable driver mutation (driver-NEG) using independent samples t-test.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 61 patients were identified with 56% female and 74% former or current tobacco users.

Between AL-high and AL-low cohorts, there was no statistically significant difference in mPFS1 (15 vs. 13 months, P = 0.98) and mOS (34 vs. 18 months, P = 0.33). Rates of driver-POS were lower in AL-high compared with AL-low (25% vs 69%, P &#60;0.01). Mean AL was higher in the driver-NEG population compared with driver-POS population (3.79 vs 3.03, P = 0.04).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Patients whose tumors did not have a clinically actionable driver mutation were associated with a higher AL, suggestive of higher chronic stress playing a role in more aggressive tumor biology. No statistically significant survival difference was observed in AL-high versus AL-low populations for mPFS1 and mOS. Larger, prospective trials are planned to correlate AL at diagnosis with clinical and biomarker data. AL, which serves as a measure of physiological dysfunction due to chronic stress associated with social disadvantage, may have implications for tumor biology and clinical outcomes in lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5d6f96c1-b7b3-4b80-938b-0d3775318170\/@B03B8ZCT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stress response,Genomics,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13402"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan H.

Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) is a summary score derived from statistical modeling that ranks an individual&#8217;s dietary intake of antioxidants in relation to the overall mean of the study population. Antioxidants may offer a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of pancreatic cancer. No prospective epidemiological study has investigated the association between food-based CDAI (fCDAI) and pancreatic cancer risk.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. The fCDAI score was calculated based on dietary intakes of vitamins A, C, and E, manganese, selenium, and zinc from food but not from dietary supplements, for each participant of the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based prospective epidemiological cohort study consisting of 61,321 Chinese men and women in Singapore aged 45-74 years at baseline enrollment during 1993-1998. Intake of antioxidants was derived from self-reported consumption of food items using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and the Singapore Food Composition Table. Incident cases of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, and death were identified through the linkage analysis with the nationwide Singapore Cancer Registry and the Singapore Registry of Birth and Death, respectively. The Cox proportional hazard regression method was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of pancreatic cancer associated with higher quartiles of fCDAI relative to the lowest quartile with adjustment for multiple potential confounders, including age, sex, dialect group, level of education, smoking status, alcohol consumption, a history of diabetes, sleep duration, physical activity, year of enrollment, and total energy intake.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. Overall, 311 participants who were free of cancer at baseline developed pancreatic cancer during an average of 17.7 years of follow-up after baseline assessment of food consumption. Compared with the lowest quartile, the multivariable-adjusted HR of pancreatic cancer for the highest quartile of fCDAI was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.31-.91, <i>P<\/i>=0.02). This inverse association between the fCDAI and pancreatic cancer risk was more apparent in overweight\/obese subjects (HR<sub>Q4vsQ1<\/sub>=0.28, 95% CI: 0.13-0.60, <i>P<sub>trend<\/sub><\/i>=0.02), or those without a history of diabetes (HR<sub>Q4vsQ1<\/sub>=0.50, 95% CI: 0.29-0.88, <i>P<sub>trend<\/sub><\/i>=0.04). No association was observed between CDAI derived from dietary supplements and the risk of pancreatic cancer.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. The inverse association between fCDAI and pancreatic cancer risk supports the notion that overall dietary antioxidants may provide a beneficial effect against the development of pancreatic cancer, specifically overweight\/obese individuals and those free of diabetes who may have a long-term persistent dietary pattern.

Here we apply an area-level SES measure to an EHR-derived database to evaluate representativeness according to SES. We then examine socioeconomic disparities in the timeliness of healthcare utilization (biomarker testing and systemic treatment) and overall survival (OS) in 3 common cancers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This retrospective study uses the nationwide Flatiron Health EHR-derived de-identified database of cancer patients who have clinical activity between January 2011-August 2021. Census block group data from the American Community Survey (2015-2019) was used to measure SES per the Yost Index (incorporating income, home values, rental costs, poverty, blue-collar employment, unemployment, and education information). SES quintiles were determined from the US population and then applied to patients based on their residential addresses. Our database included 2,067,644 cancer patients from community practices. Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC, n=51,596), metastatic breast cancer (mBC, n=18,268), and multiple myeloma (MM, n=8,246) were sampled and followed from advanced, metastatic, or initial diagnosis date, respectively. Differences were evaluated using &#935;2 tests for categorical variables and log-rank tests for Kaplan-Meier survivor functions.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Compared to the US population, our database of cancer patients has a similar SES distribution (differences &#60;3%), capturing cancer patients living in the most (Q1) and least affluent areas (Q5) of the country. Yet, among the 1.5% of cancer patients who participated in clinical trials, only 15.2% lived in the least affluent areas. aNSCLC and mBC patients living in the least affluent areas were less likely to receive biomarker testing within 30 days of index diagnosis than those in the most affluent areas (59.4% vs. 68.7%; 74.9% vs. 81.0%, both p&#60;.01). Similar patterns were observed in receipt of systemic treatment within 60 days of index diagnosis (aNSCLC: 58.9% vs. 64.9%; mBC: 76.0% vs. 80.1%, both p&#60;.01). No differences in healthcare utilization were observed among MM patients. Patients in the least affluent areas had lower median OS (months) than those in the most affluent areas (aNSCLC: 10.8 [95% CI: 10.4-11.3] vs. 12.2 [95% CI: 11.8-12.7]; mBC: 28.0 [95% CI: 26.6-29.5] vs. 34.5 [95% CI: 33.1-36.9], MM: 57.4 [95% CI: 53.5-61.5] vs. 67.5 [95% CI: 62.5-76.4]; all p&#60;.01).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Lower SES was associated with reduced clinical trial participation, less timely healthcare utilization, and worse OS.

BMAs reduce the frequency of fractures and skeletal-related pain, and some evidence suggests that more recently approved agents (i.e., denosumab) confer greater progression-free survival benefits than older agents (i.e., bisphosphonates). Here we describe disparities in the initiation of BMA use and uptake of denosumab among newly diagnosed MM patients by race\/ethnicity.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the nationwide Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived de-identified database. This analysis included adults (&#8805; 18 years) newly diagnosed with MM between January 2018 and September 2021 who initiated first-line therapy. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were determined using structured and unstructured data, curated via technology-enabled abstraction. Cumulative incidence functions accounting for competing risks were used to estimate the initiation of BMA use within 90 days before the start of first-line MM therapy and 30 days post. We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for differences in the receipt of denosumab versus bisphosphonates alone (zoledronic acid or pamidronate) among patients who initiated BMA use.<br \/>Results: Among 4460 newly diagnosed MM patients, 52% were White, 17% were Black, 7% were Latinx, and 2% were Asian. Overall, 2208 (50%) initiated BMA treatment, and utilization differed across racial\/ethnic groups with higher rates observed among Asian (55%), White (51%), and Latinx (50%) patients compared to Black patients (44%) (P=0.023). Among patients that initiated BMAs, 53% received denosumab and 47% received bisphosphonates alone. Compared to White patients, Black (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83-1.36) and Asian (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44-1.53) patients had similar odds of receiving denosumab, whereas Latinx patients had significantly lower odds of receiving denosumab (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.79).<br \/>Conclusion: Among newly diagnosed MM patients, approximately half initiated BMAs. Substantial racial\/ethnic disparities exist. For example, Black patients were less likely to receive any BMAs, and, even when treated, Latinx patients were less likely to receive denosumab. Future research should determine whether these treatment disparities impact progression-free and overall survival in real-world MM data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68f5a98a-07ed-444d-b7cf-c1566af11bbf\/@C03B8ZCU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Multiple myeloma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13409"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jenny S.

Most studies have been conducted in women of European descent, and an expanding body of literature in other populations suggests differences by race\/ethnicity. Clarifying whether associations between risk factors and disease subtypes are consistent across racial\/ethnic populations has important implications for understanding disease etiology and for improving risk prediction models. To address this question, we conducted a qualitative literature review to investigate the consistency in associations between multiple breast cancer risk factors and risk of tumor subtypes in women of African, Asian, Hispanic, and European descent.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We searched PubMed for publications between January 1, 1990 and June 8, 2021 that reported associations between breast cancer risk factors and risk of subtypes of the disease. We evaluated 19 risk factors, including reproductive, anthropometric, lifestyle, and diet factors, as well as medical history and use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Subtypes were defined as ER positive or negative (specifically triple negative when available). We prioritized review studies (i.e., meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and pooled analyses) and included individual studies with populations not included in the reviews. The number of publications per risk factor ranged from 3 for calcium intake to 28 for parity, with up to 7 reviews per risk factor. Most publications reported estimates for women of European descent, followed by Asian, African, and Hispanic. Evidence of subtype heterogeneity was determined by expert review.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: There was strong evidence of association between reproductive factors and MHT with risk of ER positive but not ER negative disease. Parity, younger age at first birth and older age at menarche were associated with lower risk of ER positive disease, while MHT use was associated with higher risk of ER positive disease. For these risk factors, we did not find evidence that risk associations or etiologic heterogeneity varied by race\/ethnicity. For the other risk factors, there was limited or no evidence of heterogeneity in risk associations by subtype, which was consistent across racial\/ethnic groups. Few publications, however, specifically studied women of non-European ancestry.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: For most breast cancer risk factors, evidence is insufficient to evaluate differences in ER-specific risk associations by race\/ethnicity. More studies are needed to evaluate subtype-specific breast cancer risk factors in diverse populations, which will be important for informing the development of multi-ethnic\/racial BC risk prediction models that account for subtype heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30540761-cb5e-4db1-acc3-01358c6d4d2c\/@C03B8ZCU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Risk factors,Heterogeneity,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13417"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amber N.

We have demonstrated that Hispanic enclaves - neighborhoods with high proportions of Spanish-speaking residents, recent immigrants, and ethnic-specific businesses - are associated with inferior overall survival in children with ALL. However, associations of enclaves with other outcomes remain poorly understood. In the present study, our objective was to determine whether residence in an enclave was associated with end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD), a strong predictor of ALL mortality.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This was a retrospective study of N=142 children aged 0-18 years, treated at Texas Children&#8217;s Hospital (Houston, TX) from 2007-2018. MRD was defined as &#8805;0.01% leukemic blasts in bone marrow at day 29 of therapy. We used the 2010 census tract geography and a modified version of the Hispanic enclave index to identify enclaves. We assigned an enclave index score to each census tract, computed quartiles based on the statewide distribution, and mapped children to quartiles based on address at diagnosis (Q1: least ethnically distinct neighborhoods; Q4: most ethnically distinct neighborhoods). Data on sex, self-reported race\/ethnicity, National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk group, primary language, and ALL cytogenetics were abstracted from electronic health records. Cytogenetics were considered either unfavorable (<i>BCR-ABL1 <\/i>fusion, <i>KMT2A<\/i> rearrangement, hypodiploidy, or intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21) or favorable (<i>ETV6-RUNX1<\/i> fusion, double trisomies of chromosomes 4 and 10)\/neutral (neither favorable nor unfavorable). We estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of MRD according to enclave index score using logistic regression.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Neither individual ethnicity nor primary language varied by MRD status, but a greater proportion of MRD-positive children lived in the most ethnically distinct neighborhoods (53% vs. 36%, p=0.04). Enclave index score was associated with MRD after adjusting for sex, NCI risk group, and cytogenetics (OR 1.57 per quartile increment, 95% CI 1.09-2.33).

The mortality disparity varies geographically and has persisted despite improvements in survival. Georgia is one of six states where breast cancer recently surpassed lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among Black but not White women, is a large and diverse state, and thus, an ideal setting to study race disparities. Our work in the Atlanta Metro area has shown that the mortality disparity is pronounced among patients with clinically favorable subtypes, low Oncotype DX&#174; recurrence scores, guideline-concordant care, and similar access to surgical facilities. The disparity also persists among patients with private insurance and those living in areas of low poverty, suggesting clinical and sociodemographic differences do not fully account for the observed disparity. Recent evidence suggests area-level factors may contribute to the disparity. Our group reported that neighborhood-level redlining (i.e., mortgage denial based on place) is associated with an increase in breast cancer mortality while neighborhood-level lending bias (i.e., mortgage denial based on race) is associated with a decrease in breast cancer mortality. In Atlanta, Black patients are more likely to live in redlined areas and less likely to live in areas with lending bias, than White patients, further suggesting place is an important driver of disparities. We investigated the role of other area-level factors on race-specific mortality in Georgia. Race-specific standardized mortality ratios were computed for each county in Georgia. Observed breast cancer deaths among non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women within 5 years of a stage I-III breast cancer diagnosis (2005-2013) were obtained from the Georgia Cancer Registry. County-level characteristics were derived from the American Community Survey and Georgia Department of Public Health. A Bayesian model-based approach was used to stabilize local estimates and estimate associations with area-level factors. Smoothed estimates of relative disparity ranged from 1.2 to 1.7, with pronounced disparity for counties surrounding the Atlanta and Savannah metropolitan areas and least pronounced disparity in Metro Albany counties. Among NHB women, living in a rural (versus non-rural) county was associated with a nearly 20% increase in breast cancer mortality (RR=1.19, 95% credible interval (CI): 0.96, 1.48); an association not observed in NHW patients (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.07). In contrast, a 10-point increase in the percent of adults with &#8804;high school education was associated with a 10% increase (95% CI: 1.05, 1.17) in mortality for NHW patients only. The race disparity in Georgia is not evenly distributed across counties. We identified area-level characteristics associated with race-specific mortality. Identifying other area-level drivers of breast cancer mortality is an important area of inquiry.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9b4a31c5-3501-4067-a5e1-2ffac01b2da5\/@C03B8ZCU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mortality,Breast cancer,Epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13411"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rebecca Nash<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsay J.

We evaluated 20 patients with gastric carcinomas, 10 of which were classified as low SE status (LSE) and 10 as medium\/high SE status (MHSE), according to the Peruvian Association of Market Intelligence Companies (APEIM) classification system. We conducted a comprehensive genomic profiling of gastric tumors with the FoundationOne CDx platform. We compared rates of alterations in single nucleotide variants, copy number variations, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, and pathways altered.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In our cohort, the mean age at diagnosis was 67.5 yo vs 61 yo, while 40% vs 55.6% were male patients, for LSE vs MHSE, respectively. We found alterations in driver genes in 19 patients (10 LSE and 9 MHSE). Histological analysis of the tumor samples revealed a higher proportion of intestinal histology in the LSE group (80%) compared to MHSE (55.6%). On the other hand, the diffuse subtype pattern was more prevalent in the MHSE group (33%) compared to LSE (20%). One case of mixed histology was observed in the high SE group. Both LSE and HMSE showed a similar distribution of Bormann Classification\/type, where most of the samples were of class III\/IV (75%) followed by class I\/II (25%). Furthermore, genomic profiling analysis showed 45 driver alterations in LSE, while only 25 alterations were detected in MHSE. the most frequently altered genes were TP53 and KRAS in both SE groups, but with a higher incidence in LSE (60% and 20%, respectively). Components of the MAPK pathway were altered in 50% vs 33.3%, while the DNA repair pathway was altered in 20% vs 11%, in LSE vs MHSE, respectively. The PI3K\/Akt pathway was altered in only one case of LSE. Median of tumor mutation burden was 6.1Mut\/Mb in LSE vs 5.3Mut\/Mb MHSE. Only one case with microsatellite instability was found in LSE.<br \/><b>C<\/b><b>onclusions: <\/b>Despite the limitations of this preliminary study, we observed some differences in the genomic background between patients from different socioeconomic groups.

Stress-survival pathways have been implicated in tumorigenesis of CRC and in providing resistance to chemotherapy-induced cell-death by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS), repairing DNA damage, and by regulating cell signaling pathways. However, studies related to the role of these pathways in CRC from the Hispanic health disparities perspective, are limited. Essential to improving treatment, prognosis, and detection strategies is the identification and validation of new ethnicity-specific transcriptomic markers within the stress-survival pathways as effective predictors of CRC. In this study, we have explored the role of stress-survival pathway genes in Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) CRC tissues. We have used microarray and RNA-seq datasets obtained from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) to identify 28 genes associated with CRC. These genes were screened for transcript level expression in one normal colon and two CRC cell lines, and in cDNA arrays containing tumor (n=40) from different stages, and control (n=8) samples. The protein level expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in CRC tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing different stages of tumor (n = 108) and control (n = 12) tissues. All 28 genes were also analyzed for their transcript level expressions in Hispanic and NHW tissues. Genes related to apoptosis like <i>FOXM1, CDK1, CDK4, Chek1, <\/i>and<i> MCM10 <\/i>showed consistent upregulation in CRC cell lines, cDNA arrays and TMAs when compared to normal samples. We could also detect a correlation between the differential expression of these genes and the tumor stages. <i>CDK4, Chek1, FOXM1<\/i>, and <i>CDC25,<\/i> were observed to be downregulated in the Hispanic CRC tissues. On the other hand, oxidative stress markers were not seen to be differentially expressed in the two CRC cell lines when compared to the normal cell line. However, some of the known oxidative stress markers like <i>PRDX4<\/i>, <i>GPX1<\/i>, and <i>SOD2<\/i> were found to be upregulated in Hispanics when compared to NHW tissues. Our results suggest that some of these stress-survival pathway genes could be explored as interesting candidates for ethnicity-specific CRC biomarkers and as novel therapeutic targets in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/253ee7ee-6fe3-4839-898d-934aba67d527\/@C03B8ZCU\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Hispanic health disparities,Oxidative stress,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13418"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aditi Kulkarni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Urbashi Basnet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhijeet R.

But the relationship between this phenomenon and epigenetics, and how this relationship explains PCa racial and ethnic health disparities are controversial. The purpose of this study was to expand on the knowledge regarding epigenetic differences in terms of DNA methylation to enable risk stratification and treatment selection in this genetically admixed population. In addition, we aim to assess differential DNA methylation patterns associated with drug resistance in PCa in PR Hispanic\/Latino men. Since epigenetic changes and modifications represent critical components of carcinogenesis and progression, we are expecting differential methylation levels between aggressive vs. indolent, and resistant vs. non-resistant cases. Prostate tumors from PR men were stratified based on Gleason score. Methylation levels were measured by Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip DNA methylation platform, and bioinformatic analyses. In parallel, DNA methylation profiles were also analyzed using genomic DNA from PCa cells selected for resistance to androgen depletion, enzalutamide resistance, or docetaxel resistance. We identified 1,225 differentially methylated genes in prostate tumors compared with normal adjacent tissues, and 141 differentially methylated genes between aggressive vs. indolent tumors. Additionally, 723 differentially methylated genes were found in therapy resistant cell lines compared to parental controls. Analysis of the methylated genes obtained from aggressive prostate tumors from Puerto Rican patients and therapy-resistant PCa cell lines revealed four overlapping methylated genes: <i>RNF220, FAM65B, PRDM16, and DGKH<\/i>. Further analysis of PCa cells resistant to androgen depletion, enzalutamide, or docetaxel demonstrated impaired cellular migration of resistant phenotypes upon DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibition using 5-azacytidine or zebularine compared to parental cell lines. DNMT1 was associated with resistance in PCa cell lines, and future studies will include silencing of methyltransferases will evaluation of drug re-sensitization. These findings provide critical insight into the epigenetic landscape of aggressive prostate tumors among PR men and highlight several candidate methylation biomarkers for assessing risk in this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ebb3030a-b9d6-49d9-a534-f4db30a74edd\/@C03B8ZCU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Methylation,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13408"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Carlos J.

Black women with BrCa, on average, have an earlier age of onset, more aggressive subtypes and experience higher mortality compared with White women. Although the underlying causes remain unknown, genetic and lifetime exposures are hypothesized. Here, we utilize blood-based whole-genome methylation arrays to: (1) discover CpG probes related to BrCa receptor status, (2) identify biological pathways driving BrCa subtype disparities, and (3) quantify epigenetic age acceleration differences by race and receptor status.<br \/>DNA methylation levels were generated for 95 blood samples from women diagnosed with BrCa using the Illumina EPIC array. After quality control, M-values for 91 samples and 808,329 methylation probes were evaluated using a modified Student t-test. BrCa estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status were collected from health records. Stratified analyses by race adjusting for age were applied. We calculated the association of age acceleration, based on Horvath&#8217;s epigenetic clock, by race and receptor status. Statistical significance, corrected for multiple testing, was defined as a p-value<sub>adj<\/sub> &#60;0.05.<br \/>Among the 91 BrCa samples, nearly half were Black women (40.7%) and the overall mean age at diagnosis was 56.5 years &#177;11.3. The majority of BrCa tumors were ER-, 60.4% (N=55), and HER2-, 76.9% (N=70). Overall, two methylation probes significantly differentiated ER+\/- BrCa. The most significant methylated gene was <i>FOXK2<\/i> (p-value<sub>adj<\/sub>=0.03, logFC=0.63). The race-stratified analysis identified 188,398 probes for ER+\/- and five probes for HER2+\/- among White women as marginally significant (p&#60;0.05). Two genes (<i>FAM107B, PRKCZ<\/i>) for ER+\/- BrCa and four genes (<i>ZNF430, TTC27, SEC1 and NOS1AP<\/i>) for HER2+\/- BrCa remained statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (p-value<sub>adj<\/sub> &#60; 0.05; |logFC| &#62;1). The mean age acceleration is estimated as 3.7 years greater for Black women compared to White women. Among White women, the mean age acceleration was 1.9 years greater for ER+ than ER- subtypes, and those HER2- were 2.2 years older than HER2+. Similarly, among Black women the mean age acceleration difference for ER- was 3.2 years greater than ER+, and HER2- was 3.8 years older than HER2+.<br \/>Our study confirmed (e.g. <i>FOXK2<\/i>) and identified several novel methylation sites associated with BrCa subtypes. Furthermore, we demonstrated in our study that epigenetic age acceleration of BrCa varies by race, with Black women biologically aging faster than White women. Although this is a limited sample size, stratified analyses revealed<b> <\/b>biological age differences by race and receptor status. In-depth pathway analyses and measuring additional samples are underway. Lastly, differential methylation profiles for known risk factors of aggressive tumors will be evaluated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f258e9f-bdd0-48ff-b05e-a9adeb7d9e86\/@D03B8ZCV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Aging,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13420"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanning Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheryl L.

Multilayered influences of Societal Determinants of Health (SDH), social risks, environment, role of stress and perceived levels, tobacco addiction and behaviors are complex. Effective identification of social risk factors and unmet social needs of individuals can enhance tobacco treatment quality, and care coordination across the healthcare continuum. Integrating SDH and Implementation science into electronic health record (EHR) can provide both value and principles that promises to enhance patient and community responsiveness to address Catchment Area cancer burden and health disparities.<br \/>Methods: We included a 33 item SDH measure to our tobacco use assessment (TUA) instrument and applied implementation science with tobacco cessation program at City of Hope (COH). Our SDH assesses patients&#8217; appraisal of their contextual distress including access to primary and cancer related medical care, technology and digital access and proficiency, food insecurity, career\/job, income, education distress; housing, living situation and social network\/isolation and racism and discrimination stress. The measure follows a 5pt likert scale ranging from extreme stress to no stress.<br \/>Results: This study compared 173 self-reported TUA. The mean age of first smoked a cigarette was 16 y.o. The mean age of first began smoking cigarettes regularly was 18 y.o. The mean total years of smoking was 36 years. Most participants were everyday smokers and on average, participants smoked I pack\/day. &#62;50% of the patients lived in a place where other people smoked cigarettes indoors. 55% of the patients tried to quit in the past 30 days. 60% of the patients indicated that it is EXTREMELY important for them to quit smoking\/tobacco and indicated interest in tobacco cessation. Half of the patients indicated they are NOT SO confident in their ability to quit smoking\/tobacco. Below are the items commonly endorsed as extreme stressful: Health and cancer outcomes, using telehealth (e.g., using a smartphone or tablet for tele\/virtual clinical visits, patient portal, completing online forms, virtual classes), money or finances, and functional strain (e.g., family demands).<br \/>Conclusions: SDH is complex and multilayered as well as understudied. The results support the small body of research documenting the necessity and utility of measuring and addressing SDH to correct health disparities. Increased prioritization including assessing and intervening with strategic planning and IT integration is required to better understand and address the cancer impact including tobacco cessation relevant to SDH. Successful tobacco control programs can benefit from IT integrated, culturally and community informed SDH assessments using implementation science principles.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86ab161c-3e42-4a32-b86f-0bc3833df052\/@D03B8ZCV\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tobacco,Smoking,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13419"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kimlin T.

Women residing in high-poverty or rural areas or who are non-Hispanic Black (NHB) experience higher rates of BC mortality relative to their counterparts. Although mortality disparities among late-stage BC patients are well-documented, few studies have examined the drivers of these disparities, which are likely multifactorial. We sought to identify tumor, treatment, and patient characteristics that may contribute to differences in BC mortality by race, rurality, and SES among women diagnosed with a first primary stage IIIB - IV BC in Georgia.Using the Georgia Cancer Registry, we identified 3085 patients with an initial diagnosis of stage IIIB-IV primary BC between January 2013 and December 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare NHB vs. non-Hispanic White (NHW), rural vs. urban residents, and residents of low- vs. high-SES neighborhoods by tumor (stage, grade, ER status, and molecular subtype), treatment (surgery type, receipt of chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal, neoadjuvant, and immunotherapy), and patient (race, insurance, age group, marital status, region, SES) characteristics. Using an extension of the counterfactual framework, we estimated the mediating effects of subtype, stage, SES, rurality, and insurance on the association between race and BC mortality. Among the study population, 41% were NHB, 21% resided in rural counties, and 72% resided in low SES neighborhoods. Overall, we observed mortality disparities by race (HR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.41) and rurality (HR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.30), but not by SES (HR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.19). In the stratified analyses, racial disparities were the most pronounced among women with HER2 overexpressing tumors (HR=2.30, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.45). Residing in a rural neighborhood was associated with increased mortality among uninsured women (HR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.31, 3.86) or receipt of breast-conserving surgery (HR=2.21, 95 CI%: 1.32, 3.71). The most pronounced socioeconomic disparities were among younger women (&#60;40 years: HR=1.46, 95% CI: 0.88, 2.42) and patients who received neoadjuvant therapy (HR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.05). The mediation analysis demonstrated that 48% of the effect between race and BC mortality was mediated by subtype.There is considerable variation in racial, regional, and socioeconomic disparities in metastatic BC mortality by tumor, treatment, and patient characteristics. For each, we&#8217;ve identified patient groups where disparities are most pronounced. Understanding specific barriers within these patient groups will inform future interventions aimed at reducing disparities in metastatic BC mortality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7f0922b-9227-4e24-a7f8-68b55ee35264\/@D03B8ZCV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,Mortality,Disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13424"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leah Moubadder<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lindsay J.

While research involving these genetic mutations continues to emerge, there remains unanswered questions regarding prophylactic experiences and subsequent impacts on mental health within subgroups of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>-positive women. The purpose of this analysis was to explore the impact of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i><i> <\/i>mutations, prophylactic surgeries, and surveillance regimens within the scope of everyday life within a sample of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> positive women from medically-underserved backgrounds living in the United States (US). A sample of 211 US adult women who have tested positive for <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> mutations within the past 5 years and who identify with one or more medically-underserved populations (racial, ethnic, or sexual minority, person with a physical disability, chronically-ill, those in poverty, immigrant populations) elucidated compelling qualitative data. A total of 169 (80.1%) women completed open-ended questions at the end of the online survey. Thematic analysis was utilized to identify themes and subthemes concerning mental health, sources of stress, and methods of stress relief. The focus of the current analysis is on the sources of stress identified by the respondents. Fourteen subthemes were identified. The four most common stressors were concerns about post-treatment recovery (19% of respondents), recurrence of a new cancer (15%), medical unknown of having a genetic mutation that increases the risk of cancer (14%), and having to schedule and plan for continual surveillance (12%). The next five subthemes ranged from 7-9% and include waiting for medical results, personal finances and covering medical expenses, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, pre-operative anxiety, and worrying about insurance coverage. Our findings support previous research on cancer stressors for women while adding important qualitative elements for a richer understanding. Furthermore, since much of the research on the lived experiences of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i><i> <\/i>has been on highly-educated, non-Hispanic white women, few studies have focused entirely on medically-underserved populations, which was the entirety of our sample.

However, recent studies have shown increasing evidence that there is a higher risk of biochemical recurrence, PCa mortality, and metastasis among current smokers, presenting an urgent need in re-evaluating the association between smoking and aggressive PCa. This study aimed to determine whether smoking increase the likelihood of developing a more aggressive prostate cancer.<br \/>Methods: Equal numbers of African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) by smoking status (never\/former\/current) matched with PCa aggressiveness, BMI, 5-year age group, and year of baseline recruitment, totaling 480 participants, were included in the metabolomics study. For metabolomics analysis, fold change and BH-adjusted p-value from t-test adjusted for age for univariate analysis, and PCA adjusted for age and PLS-DA supervised statistical analysis for multivariate analysis were employed to decipher the underlying metabolomic patterns, and identify significantly dysregulated metabolites for the variables of interest.<br \/>Results: AA participants were significantly younger (mean=61.4, SD=7.7) compared with EAs (mean=63.5, SD=7.5). Current smokers had a 2.4 times higher risk of high aggressive PCa. When stratified by race, the risk diminished for EAs but increased for AAs. Global metabolic profiles detected a total of 1,487 compounds of known identity. After excluding metabolites with missing values in more than 20% of the samples and with small standard variation, we observed a distinct cluster of participants from AA aggressive PCa patients and current smokers that were separated from EAs and never smokers. With BH-adjusted p-value &#60; 0.05 and fold change &#62; 2, we identified 10 significantly dysregulated metabolites between AA and EA among high aggressive PCa and current smokers. Further, 36 metabolites between current and never smokers among AA high aggressive PCa were significantly dysregulated, but none of them are annotated as tobacco metabolites.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study presented distinctive metabolomics profiles specific to AA current smokers who had high aggressive PCa. Furthermore, the distinctive patterns were not driven by the tobacco metabolites, with the potential to identify metabolites that might help to understand the relationships between smoking and aggressive PCa in AA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/42f2e6e6-857c-48bb-866c-7119d20d731a\/@D03B8ZCV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Tobacco,Prostate cancer,African American,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13422"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Se-ran Jun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>L.

This subset of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been described as unique to African American (AA) women and represents about 67-90% of all TNBC. Yet, there are limited clinical and therapeutic studies focused on this new subset of breast cancer (BCa) that is highly aggressive and portends a worse survival compared to AR positive Bca subtypes. The objectives of our study were to 1) determine the molecular and clinical characteristics of QNBC and compare them with other BCa subtypes and 2) determine the association of QNBC with clinicopathological factors and prognostic markers.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Tissue arrays were constructed from FFPE tumor blocks of invasive ductal breast carcinomas in 202 AAs, diagnosed at Howard University from 2000 to 2010. Two separate tissue cores of IDC represented each surgical case in the TMA and was linked to an Institutional Review Board-approved database of demographic and clinical data. Using a microtome, 5-&#181;m sections were cut from the TMA blocks and mounted onto Superfrost Plus microscope slides. Sections were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against AR (Clone AR 441, DAKO). Immunohistochemistry for AR was considered positive if &#8805;10% of tumor cells showed nuclear staining. Bivariate analysis was performed via &#967;2 analysis and survival data was calculated via Kaplan-Meier curves (SPSS v28.0.0).<br \/>Results: The most prevalent breast cancer subtype was luminal A (ER+ or PR+, HER2&#8722;; 43.5%), followed by TNBC (33.7%). Of the 67 TNBCs on the array, 63 had AR data; 33 (52%) of the TNBCs were AR negative. Greater than 70% of all tumors were stage I and II; and Grade 3 comprised 67.4% of the tumors. QNBC tumors were more likely to be higher grade (p&#60;0.001) and larger in size (p=0.05) compared to other subtypes. There was also a trend for increased metastases in QNBCs (Luminal and HER2 tumors=11.2%; TNBC=13.3%; AR negative= 18.8%; and QNBC=20.8% (p=0.15)). Compared to TNBCs, QNBCs were larger (p=0.048), more likely to express markers associated invasion (Fascin, p=0.004) and reduced survival (Vimentin, p=0.014). There was a trend for increased expression of markers associated with metastases: Mammaglobin (expressed in 30.8% of TNBCs compared to 52.1% of QNBCs; p=0.17) and CD105 (expressed in 6.7% of TNBCs compared to 27.1% of QNBCs; p=0.097). There was no association between QNBC and stage, recurrence-free survival, or overall survival.<br \/>Conclusion: In our study of AAs, a statistically significant association was noted between QNBC tumors and poorer prognosis. The high prevalence of AR negativity of TNBCs in AAs could explain observed worse outcomes and supports the existence of a unique subtype of Bca known as QNBC, worthy of scientific attention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1f19415b-0a5d-49af-82c5-4d0e7123c4c3\/@D03B8ZCV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),African American,Androgen receptor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13400"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Oluwadamilola Oladeru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasmine Kanaan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tammy Naab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Luisel J.

The remaining proportion is explained by multiple common variants of relatively small effect. A subset of these variants has been identified mostly in Europeans and Asians; and combined into polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict breast cancer risk. Our aim is to identify a subset of variants to improve breast cancer risk prediction in Hispanics\/Latinas (H\/Ls).Breast cancer patients were recruited at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl&#225;sicas in Peru, to be part of The Peruvian Genetics and Genomics of Breast Cancer Study (PEGEN). Women without a diagnosis of breast cancer from a pregnancy outcomes study conducted in Peru were included as controls. After quality control filters, genome-wide genotypes were available for 1,809 cases and 3,334 controls. Missing genotypes were imputed using the Michigan Imputation Server using individuals from 1000 Genomes Project as reference. Genotypes for 313 previously reported breast cancer associated variants and 2 Latin American specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted from the data, using an imputation r2 filter of 30%. Feature selection techniques were used to identify the best subset of SNPs for breast cancer prediction in Peruvian women. We randomly split the PEGEN data by 4:1 ratio for training\/validation and testing. Training\/validation data were resampled and split in 3:1 ratio into training and validation sets. SNP ranking and selection were done by bootstrapping results from 100 resampled training and validation sets. PRS were built by adding counts of risk alleles weighted by previously reported beta coefficients. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was used to estimate the prediction accuracy of subsets of SNPs selected with different techniques. Logistic regression was used to test the association between standardized PRS residuals (after adjustment for genetic ancestry) and breast cancer risk. Of the 315 reported variants, 274 were available from the imputed dataset. The full 274-SNP PRS was associated with an AUC of 0.63 (95%CI=0.59-0.66) in the PEGEN study. Using different feature selection methods, we found subsets of SNPs that were associated with AUC values between 0.65-0.69. The best method (AUC=0.69, 95%CI=0.66-0.72) included a subset of 98 SNPs. Sixty-eight SNPs were selected by all methods, including the protective SNP rs140068132 in the 6q25 region, which is associated with Indigenous American ancestry and the largest contribution to the AUC.We identified a subset of 98 SNPs from a previously identified breast cancer PRS that improves breast cancer risk prediction compared to the full set, in women of high Indigenous American ancestry from Peru. Replication in women from Mexico and Colombia, and H\/Ls from the U.S will allow us to confirm these results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2186a5b7-0f64-424d-8b2b-6e02645859aa\/@v03B8ZCW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Epidemiology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13412"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Valentina A.

Investigators explore health behaviors and sources of health disparities and equity among Micronesian and Filipino community members in Hawai&#8216;i, Guam, and the neighboring U.S. Associated Pacific Islands (USAPI) through the Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE). The Community Outreach Core of the partnership works towards objectives that include assisting and promoting PIPCHE research, ensuring inclusion PIP and Filipino community perspectives in research, and building healthcare providers&#8217; competencies. This work aims to directly address the disproportionately high rates of cancer incidence and mortality found amongst these groups in Hawai&#8216;i and Guam. Currently, few cancer control initiatives are designed to specifically address Micronesians and Filipinos, which comprise 40% of Hawai&#8216;i&#8217;s population and 70% of Guam&#8217;s population. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death for men and the third leading cause of death for Filipinos in Hawai&#8216;i. Also, Micronesians and Filipinos are highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals; culturally-grounded approaches to achieve parity in cancer control are sorely needed which remains a focus of the COC. To address the needs of the Filipino community in Hawai&#8216;i, we conducted five semi-structured interviews with Filipino community members to facilitate community engagement, build relationships, and direct future areas for cancer control. Another goal was to establish a relationship-building process to recruit members for the COC Outreach Advisory Council to guide future community efforts. Participants ranged in age; however, all five identified as female were born in various parts of the Philippines, and migrated to Hawai'i at different ages. Some findings from the interviews included the need for culturally tailored and translated cancer materials and resources, a charge to focus on colorectal and breast cancer initiatives, and provide translated health communications utilizing local radio and faith-based organizations. These members were then asked to serve on our Outreach Advisory Council for a period of 5 years to help shape the COC&#8217;s efforts towards community engagement with the Filipino community. These planned community-focused efforts should be modeled to ensure shared community-based decision-making for this minority population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f46bf54-3acb-4a8c-8746-eba64ff1212e\/@v03B8ZCW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Race,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13416"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mark Lee Willingham Jr.<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Cassel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Sy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Munirih R.

Studies suggest that patient ethnicity is associated with differences in disease presentation, response to treatment, and outcomes. There exists a paucity of literature on the presentation and outcomes of NAC for breast cancer in Hispanic women.<br \/>Methods: This is an IRB-approved retrospective study of breast cancer patients who underwent NAC at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center from 2005-2020. We reviewed demographics, disease presentation, response to treatment, and outcomes. ER and PR status were categorized as low positive (1-9%), positive (&#8805; 10%) and negative. Treatment factors reviewed included completion of chemotherapy and type of surgery performed. Treatment response was noted as percent residual cellularity (0%, &#60;10%, 10-30%, &#62;30-80% and &#62;80%) in the surgical specimen and pathologic stage. Outcomes were assessed as overall survival (OS) and recurrence.<br \/>Results: 365 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 2005-2020, and 196 (53.7%) self-identified as Hispanic. Median follow-up was 13.65 years. Highest clinical stage at diagnosis was most frequently IIA (31.2%), followed by IIB (32.3%), with non-significant Hispanic ethnicity differences, although Hispanic patients presented with higher clinical prognostic stages: IIIA or higher (40.5% vs. 24.0%).<br \/>Hispanics more frequently had grade 3 tumors (60% vs. 48%), ER low positive (10% vs. 7%) and ER negative (48% vs. 36%) (p=0.02). No significant differences were noted in triple negative disease or HER2 positive disease. Hispanics were diagnosed at younger average ages (48.9 vs. 53.0 years, p=0.001). No statistically significant differences were noted in time from diagnosis to NAC initiation, completion of chemotherapy, or surgical treatment received (lumpectomy vs. mastectomy, and sentinel node biopsy vs. dissection). Mastectomy was more likely for late-stage disease (OR=2.73, 95% CI: 1.66-4.49, p&#60;0.001); Hispanic women with late-stage disease had 1.09-fold higher odds of receiving mastectomy, but this was non-significant (95% CI: 0.66-1.79). No significant ethnic differences were noted in pCR (p=0.69) or residual tumor cellularity (p=0.63). There was no significant association between residual cellularity and OS. OS rates were similar for Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic women (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.64-2.08, p=0.63). No difference was noted in ethnicity-based recurrence rates (21.4 vs. 20.1%).<br \/>Conclusion: Self-identified Hispanic patients were diagnosed at a younger age, presented with higher ER negative and low-positive disease and worse prognostic clinical stage. However, given standard of care chemotherapy, there were no significant differences in their treatment response or outcomes compared to non-Hispanic patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f831d84d-dfce-4ce3-bbbd-a95bd709cbe5\/@v03B8ZCW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hispanic,Chemotherapy response,Cancer Disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13410"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sangeetha Prabhakaran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher McNicoll<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vernon S.

Among many contributing factors, lack of socioeconomic advancement and inequality in resource distribution is closely associated with prostate cancer occurrence. The State of Alabama has one of the highest rates of prostate cancer in the nation and the third cancer epidemic at the state level. Due to widespread disparities in infrastructure development, political willpower, equal healthcare, and education opportunity, Alabama's Black Belt region has been further divided by socioeconomic statuses among the majority (Whites) and minority (African American) populations. The purpose of this research is to recognize Alabama's health burdens and socioeconomic status using geo-spatial technology (GIS) to examine prostate cancer health disparity. GIS has become a valuable decision-making tool in understanding the public health care sectors, including prostate cancer prevalence. GIS supports assembling spatial and non-spatial data, displays the spatial distribution of health disparities, and underlines further interconnectivity of policy-related questions. This research incorporates county-level prostate cancer data using GIS and outlining the correlation between prostate cancer prevalence and socioeconomic factors to understand Alabama's cancer health disparity and equity. A combination of socioeconomic factors and state and federal-level cancer epidemic data sources underline Alabama's black belt region (predominantly African American) prostate cancer prevalence is higher than the non-black belt. The GIS analysis demonstrated that effective cancer prevention programs are needed to eliminate health disparities and enhance health equity among underserved populations of Alabama.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/329a04a8-7483-44b4-82b8-1afda052737b\/@v03B8ZCW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13609"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"22751a52-9be7-4547-a160-bf64c4043195","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/22751a52-9be7-4547-a160-bf64c4043195\/@v03B8ZCW\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ram Alagan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seela Aladuwaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajesh Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Upender Manne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manoj K.

However, the effect of RT among older women with multimorbidity is not clearly understood.<br \/><b>Objective: <\/b>We examined the effect of adjuvant RT on survival outcomes among older women. We also assessed whether the association between RT and survival is modified by comorbidity burden.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A total of 1105 older women (65+) diagnosed with low-risk breast cancer in 1998-2012 and who received BCS were identified from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS) data resource. A propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) was calculated with weighting applied to Cox regression models to obtain hazard ratios for the association of RT with survival outcomes. Stratified analysis was conducted to examine differential effects according to the comorbidity burden class, which was identified using the latent class analysis.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Over a 5-year follow-up period, a total of 117 deaths occurred (25 cancer-related and 92 noncancer-related). The IPTW-adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that RT omission did not significantly increase the risk for 5-year cancer-specific deaths (P=0.202). However, RT omission increased the risk for 5-year noncancer death by 1.84-fold (95% CI=1.35, 2.51) and all-cause death by 1.49-fold (95% CI=1.41, 1.95). The stratified analysis showed that the effect of RT omission on the risk of breast cancer-specific deaths was similar across the different comorbidity groups. For noncancer and all-cause deaths, the effect of RT omission varied by comorbidity burden. In Class 1, RT omission was not associated with an increased risk of noncancer and all-cause deaths. However, in Classes 2 and 3, RT omission is significantly associated with an increased risk of 5-year all-cause deaths in a dose-response manner: by 1.66-fold (95% CI=1.07, 2.56) in Class 2 and 1.96-fold in Class 3 (95% CI=1.13, 3.41). Similar results were observed for 10-year survival.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>RT omission does not increase the risk of cancer-specific death and appears to be a valid clinical decision for older women with low-risk breast cancer and multimorbidity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/98e203ca-4394-4e74-8f82-25fcf970662d\/@v03B8ZCW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer health disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Radiation therapy,Comorbidity,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20879"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eunkyung Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert B.
