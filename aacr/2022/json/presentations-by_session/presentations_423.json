[{"Abstract":"Background: DNA methylation is the most recognized epigenetic mark that leads to a massive distortion in cancer cells. It has been observed that a large number of DNA hypermethylation events co-occur in groups of genes, thus providing a growth advantage to the cell in promoting cell differentiation and neoplastic transformation. Here we designed and performed a first step of validation of a novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeted methylation panel that can simultaneously evaluate the methylation levels of multiple cancer-related genes.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>The WG00446_MET_A AmpliSeq&#8482; Methylation Panel for Cancer Research was designed using the Ion AmpliSeq technology to amplify 152 regions with an amplicon size range of 125-175bp, that covers a total of 1107 promoter and intragenic CpGs of 18 cancer-related genes. The performance of the panel was assessed by running in duplicate commercially available fully methylated and unmethylated control human gDNA samples and a variable mixture of them to simulate 10%, 25%, 75%, and 90% of global methylation. The libraries (manual preparation using the Ion AmpliSeq Plus Library Kit) were loaded on 530 chips and run on the GeneStudio S5 Sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sequencing output was analyzed using the methylation_analysis plugin, available on Ion Torrent Suite v5.16 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>The WG00446_MET_A panel allowed to run 6 samples per 530 chips to reach an observed mean target depth &#62;2,000X (observed reads on-targets: &#62;80%; average number of mapped reads: &#62;450,000\/sample). The conversion efficiency, determined by spiking-in Unmethylated Lambda DNA into each sample before the bisulfite conversion process, was &#62;97% for all samples. The observed % of global methylation for all CpGs were &#62;98% and &#60;2% for fully methylated and unmethylated gDNA samples, respectively. The observed results for the variable mixtures were in agreement with what expected.<br \/>Conclusions: The methylation-specific NGS analysis using the WG00446_MET_A panel represents a feasible method for a fast and multiplexed screening of cancer patients by a high-throughput approach. It will offer the opportunity to design a more robust algorithm for disease prediction for those cancer patients with a low quantity of biological material available. The orthogonal testing on DNA extracted by FFPE and frozen samples is ongoing with a subset of amplicons from the WG00446_MET_A panel.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),DNA methylation,Cancer markers,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17288"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Federico Pio Fabrizio<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefano Castellana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelo Sparaneo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tommaso Mazza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Flavia Centra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Domenico Trombetta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vito Michele Fazio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucia Anna Muscarella<\/i><\/presenter>.

Until now, this aggressive phenotype is untreatable. Therefore, it is urgent to study the molecular mechanism of NE development to reveal therapeutic strategies.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Data were downloaded from CCLE, cBioPortal, and GEO and analyzed by R. RT-qPCR, western-blot, Immunohistochemistry, and Immunofluorescence were used to assess gene expression.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPCa) develops from prostate adenocarcinoma (AdPCa). We screened and identified the consensus differentially expressed genes across all public NEPCa transcriptome datasets. We found several HOX genes are included. HOXB13 is deceased but HOXB3, HOXD8 are increased in NEPCa. Based on the HOX code (total 39 HOX genes expression) theory, different cell lineages have distinct HOX codes and HOX codes can represent tissue identities, we established 42 HOX codes for 42 cells lineages including prostate through bioinformatics analysis of 1019 cancer cell lines transcriptome. We found NEPCa samples have changed prostatic HOX code. We also found YAP1, a previously characterized oncogene, is decreased in mRNA level in NEPCa than AdPCa. We confirmed the YAP1 protein is not detected in NEPCa human\/ mouse samples, PDX samples, and cell line samples (NCI-H660). We used YAP1 as a model. We hypothesized that the signaling involved in silencing YAP1 expression can also contribute to NE development. We first confirmed the loss of YAP1 expression in NEPCa cells is under epigenetic control by inducing YAP1 mRNA expression in primary mouse NEPCa cells through epigenetic inhibitors treatments (HDACs\/ DNA methyltransferase inhibitors). We characterized the YAP1 promoter through data mining chromatin ChIP-seq data and DNA methylation-seq data. We identified and cloned a 3kb DNA fragment across the YAP1 transcription start site as YAP1 regulatory element. We then built a YAP1-promoter-luciferase reporter using this fragment. We also generated a list of transcription factors that can bind the YAP1 regulatory element. We will then confirm the roles of these transcriptional factors in both regulating YAP1 and NE development. We also found YAP1 expression is co-expressed with many HOX genes in human samples. This suggested the potential regulatory function of HOX code to YAP1 expression. <b>Conclusion<\/b>: We proposed 2 critical events during NE development, changed prostatic HOX code and loss of YAP expression. We identified HOX code change as one of the potential regulatory mechanisms of YAP1.

The results show the presence of two characteristically distinct 5hmc groups: Tier 1 Group with 3 to 8-fold more 5hmcs detected in tumor-cells than in normal-cell derived DNA (as observed in 6 of 11 CpG sites). Tier 2 group with equal allele frequency of 5hmc among normal and tumor-cell derived DNA at 5 CpG hotspot sites as well as 5 non-CpG hotspots. Thus, detection and quantification of the Tier 1 group of 5hmc sites or its prevalence at or near cancer mutation hot spots in cells may enable early detection, screening and potentially prediction of the likelihood of cancer occurrence or the severity of the cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad28719b-8d6e-4c1d-9501-b5919d66c0b6\/@B03B8ZJW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Cancer markers,Mutations,Diagnostic marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17293"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yabin Lu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Lu<\/i><\/presenter>.

One tumor can harbor multiple histologic subtypes and multifocal or bilateral disease is common occurring in up to 10% of patients. Several molecular features have been associated with Wilms tumors and some are used for risk stratification. However, it is unclear which, if any, features are consistent throughout a single tumor or shared between tumors in cases of bilateral disease. To answer this question, we generated genomic and epigenomic data from multiply sampled Wilms tumors from 10 patients - 3 with unilateral disease and 7 with bilateral disease. Multiple samples from each tumor as well as matched normal tissues were included when available. All tumors and matched normal tissues had DNA methylation array data available. Segmental chromosomal aberrations (SCAs) were inferred from methylation array data. Sequencing data were available for all bilateral patients but not for unilateral patients. We found that SCAs were discordant both between pairs of bilateral tumors and within multiply sampled unilateral tumors. This discordance included SCAs used for clinical risk stratification (chromosome 1q gain, 1p loss). Sequence variants were also rarely shared between pairs of bilateral tumors. On the other hand, DNA methylation patterns were concordant across all samples for each individual. We previously described 3 distinct DNA methylation patterns in Wilms tumors and found that all samples from each patient classified into the same subgroup. Furthermore, DNA methylation at Wilms tumor-specific and subgroup-specific differentially methylated regions had high (&#62;0.8) correlation in all samples from all cases. Our data demonstrate that, in contrast to genomic changes such as SCAs and sequence alterations, DNA methylation patterns in Wilms tumors are frequently shared between paired tumors in bilateral disease and in multiple regions within individual tumors. This is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that gain of methylation at the <i>H19<\/i> imprinted region is often the earliest event in Wilms tumors and in some cases likely occurs in the embryonic intermediate mesoderm prior to the development of individual kidneys. Our findings demonstrate the utility of Wilms tumor DNA methylation patterns in overcoming tumor heterogeneity for risk stratification in cases of bilateral or multifocal Wilms tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/43e9fd61-c65a-4a45-8762-be789c557c38\/@B03B8ZJW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Tumor heterogeneity,Molecular profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17296"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jack Brzezinski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanaa Choufani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheryl Shuman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodrigo Romao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Armando Lorenzo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosanna Weksberg<\/i><\/presenter>.

More recently, its application has broadened to include assessment of early response to therapy (i.e. molecular response) and in the early-stage settings, detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) and early disease recurrence1. While circulating tumor fraction (cTF) estimated by somatic mutations is well associated with the tumor progression and prognosis, interference can occur from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), and for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples that lack detectable somatic mutations, somatic tumor fraction cannot be estimated. In this analysis, we demonstrate that epigenomic signatures accurately measure cTF using orthogonal analytes to somatic mutations and enable cTF estimation even in cases without detectable tumor driver variants.<br \/>Methods: To capture tumor-associated methylated cfDNA, we designed a custom assay of a broad genomic panel (15.2 Mb) targeting unmethylated regions in plasma cfDNA from healthy individuals. We profiled plasma samples from cancer patients with this panel, and utilized machine learning to integrate methylation signals into an estimate of cTF. We benchmarked the accuracy of methylation cTFs on real plasma samples, as well as in-vitro and in-silico titration datasets. Both titration data sets were generated by mixing cfDNA from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) into the plasma from cancer-free donors, either via titration of CRC cfDNA into cfDNA from cancer-free donors for the in-vitro data, or via computationally mixing reads from CRC patients with those from cancer-free donors for the in-silico data.<br \/>Results: Our methylation cTF quantified a similar cTF to those derived from well-calibrated genomic tumor driver mutations; across the 670 stage I-IV CRC samples, a strong correlation (Pearson r=0.85) was observed between methylation logit(cTF) and genomic logit(cTF). The methylation cTF was capable of quantifying low cTFs: it quantified a cTF over 0.1% in &#62;99% of the 270 in-vitro and 1,000 in-silico titration samples with true cTFs &#62;0.1%. In contrast, when applied to 2,037 cancer-free samples, less than 5% of the samples resulted in estimated cTFs of &#62;0.1%. Our methylation cTF was more robust than genomic cTF on the 62 in vitro titration samples with true cTFs between 0.3-1%, with a five fold lower coefficient of variation across methylation cTFs compared to genomic cTFs.<br \/>Conclusions: cTFs from methylated cfDNA may overcome the current limitations of somatic mutation based methods. Our methylation approach is capable of accurately detecting cTFs in tumor-driver positive and negative cases. As we estimate tumor-negative cases to be 30-50% of patients with stage I-III cancer and 15-20% of patients with stage IV cancer, our methylation approach may hold promise for providing better evaluation for patient care and management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/52814fb5-5912-42a1-8fbd-2b146ce34140\/@B03B8ZJW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Methylation,Cell-free DNA,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17300"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William W.

Bladder, Colon, Kidney, Liver, Lung and Prostate datasets were selected. At least 30 independent tumor and at least 5 normal tissue samples for each tumor site were analysed. The tumor and normal tissues were paired in each specific cohort. Transcriptome profiling was analysed only in datasets where both tumor and normal counterparts were available. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA with a Sidak&#8217;s post hoc test for methylation analysis and multiple t-test with Holm-Sidak&#8217;s post hoc test for expression analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> SPG20 &#946;-values ranging from 0.19 to 0.96 among the different tumor samples were observed in the promoter region covered by the 9 probes that we previously identified (Illumina 450k platform). In the normal group, the &#946;-values were higher than 0.63. Statistically significant differences between the tumor and normal counterpart were observed in colon, liver and prostate and mainly in the probes closest the TSS. The heterogeneity in the methylation status of SPG20 was a common characteristic among the different tumor groups. The variability range of &#946;-values between tumor and normal groups was significantly different with a p value &#60;0.05. Differential expression was observed between tumor and normal counterpart in almost all sites. SPG20 was more expressed in normal than in tumor tissues and the differences were significant in bladder, lung and colon.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our analysis unveils that the methylation heterogeneity of SPG20 is a common hallmark in all the tumor samples, while the normal counterpart results homogenously distributed. In tumor samples there is an inverse correlation between SPG20 promoter methylation heterogeneity and gene expression. SPG20 is down-regulated in almost all the tumors of different histological origins. SPG20 could have a relavant but still undefined role in cancer as a tumor-suppressor gene.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6467ef89-7cea-4419-8dfa-581c8005b24f\/@B03B8ZJW\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Differential gene expression,Gene regulation,DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17301"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vincenza Ylenia Cusenza<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raffaele Frazzi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Studies have shown that the blood from cancer patients contained more tumor-derived cfDNA compared to the healthy controls. DNA methylation, the most well-studied epigenetic marker, has been validated as one of the key drivers in the development of many diseases including cancer. cfDNA methylation thus holds great potential to become a biomarker that will enable early detection of cancer. However, cfDNA is also a challenging input for library preparation as cfDNA is mostly highly fragmented, and the amount of cfDNA from blood plasma is comparatively low. Therefore, multiple library preparation protocols were evaluated for profiling DNA methylation patterns at single nucleotide resolution from ultra-low amount of blood plasma cfDNA. These methods included two bisulfite conversion-based protocols and an enzymatic based protocol. The bisulfite conversion reaction was optimized allowing a milder treatment for less nucleic acid damage. One of the bisulfite conversion based protocols also contained a further optimized adapter ligation step, allowing a simpler procedure. Circulating cfDNA were extracted from blood plasma of a healthy control, a non-small cell lung cancer patient, and an adenocarcinoma lung cancer patient. 5-ng cfDNA was used as input and the libraries were successfully prepared using all three methods. Each library was sequenced to 300 - 600 million read pairs at a read length of 150 bp, enabling a mean coverage of about 10X per detected CpG, and over 90% of the CpG sites in human genome were detected. Unique alignment rate among all libraries were about or above 80%. The comprehensive coverage of the CpG sites across the entire human genome illustrated that the optimized bisulfite conversion reaction was compatible with fragmented cfDNA, proving the satisfactory efficacy in this simple and classic method for DNA methylation profiling of such a challenging sample type. This opens the door to apply the streamlined and simple Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) protocol for cfDNA methylation profiling, which in turn shall facilitate further understanding in cfDNA epigenetic variations and advance the development of a cancer biomarker from the non-invasive, liquid biopsies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),DNA methylation,Liquid biopsies,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17313"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Caila Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanjun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenguo Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Bhasin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingda Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Xiaojing Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Because these changes occur early in carcinogenesis, they can be used for early cancer detection when genomic technologies fall short due to lower sensitivity, and in the early and late-stage cancer setting for minimal residual disease detection, disease monitoring and therapy selection. In this analysis, we demonstrated our detection of differential methylations that classify cancer from healthy normals, as well as the quantification of promoter methylation, using a highly sensitive targeted assay that simultaneously captures both genomic alterations and methylation signatures in cell-free DNA (cfDNA).<br \/>Methods: Methylation signals were profiled with a broad genomic panel (15.2 Mb) targeting regions that are unmethylated in plasma cfDNA from cancer-free donors. The panel covers the promoter regions of 925 out of 1,217 known tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) (e.g. TP53, APC, RB1, PTEN), homologous recombination and repair (HRR) genes (e.g. ATM, BRCA1\/2, CDK12, RAD51C\/D). We applied our genomic and epigenomic assay on cfDNA from 1,968 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, 480 patients with other 6 common cancers, and 2,037 cancer-free donors. To test the sensitivity of our epigenomic assay, we generated an in-silico dataset by computationally mixing reads from the cancer patients with those from cancer-free donors at a low tumor fraction (TF) of 0.1%.<br \/>Results: Among 62 clinically relevant TSG and HRR genes, 56 (90%) were differentially methylated (Wilcoxon p&#60;0.05) between the 2,448 cancer vs. 2,037 cancer-free donor samples. In the in-silico dataset, 51 of the 56 differentially methylated genes remained statistically significant (Wilcoxon p&#60;0.05) at 0.1% TF. In the 1,968 CRC patients, we observed a significant association (Fisher&#8217;s p&#60;1e-05) between MLH1 promoter methylation and microsatellite instability (MSI-H): 70% of MSI-H samples has MLH1 promoter methylation above a predefined &#8220;high methylation&#8221; threshold, while only 7% of microsatellite-stable samples has MLH1 promoter methylation above this threshold. Our result is consistent with previous studies that 54-100% of CRC patients with MSI-H tumors harbor MLH1 promoter methylation.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate that our assay can accurately detect cancer-driven DNA methylation across the genome in clinical plasma samples. Detection of differential methylation in cancerous versus non-cancerous tissues could allow for early cancer detection, leading to better survival and prediction of recurrence prior to imaging. The highly sensitive detection of promoter methylation shown with TSG, HRR, and MLH1 genes may provide orthogonal information to oncologists in therapeutic selection with high confidence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e03ff7ec-f979-41e5-81ce-90207b4d02e7\/@C03B8ZJX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Epigenomics,Cell-free DNA,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17314"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sai Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shile Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tingting Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Yen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yupeng He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ariel Jaimovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yvonne Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dustin Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giao Tran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel P.

However, investigation of this association has not been conducted in survivors of childhood cancer, a population with a much higher burden of dyslipidemia and other cardiometabolic conditions due to exposures of genotoxic cancer therapies. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to identify blood DNA methylation (DNAm) 5&#8217;-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3&#8242; (CpGs) associated with lipid concentrations, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG), for childhood cancer survivors from the St. Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) cohort. DNAm was generated with blood derived DNA using Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Adjusted M-value of DNAm for each CpG was calculated based on a linear regression of M-value against a set of covariates, including sex, age at DNA sampling, leukocyte subtype proportions, top four significant genetic principal components, and top four methylation principal components. In the exposure EWAS, a linear regression model was used for lipid levels prior to DNA sampling as an exposure variable and DNAm as an outcome variable, adjusting for cancer treatments, age at lipid measurement, BMI, cigarette smoking and lipid lowering medicine use. In the outcome EWAS, a linear regression model was used for DNAm as an exposure variable and lipid levels after DNA sampling as outcome variables, adjusting for cancer treatments, age at lipid measurement, BMI, smoking, lipid lowering medicine use, lipid levels measured at DNA sampling, age at DNA sampling, and polygenic risk score for specific lipid levels. Among survivors of European ancestry (N=2052), we identified 43 significant CpGs (<i>P<\/i>&#60;9&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>) associated with HDL (n=7), TC (n=3) and TG (n=33) as exposures; and 106 CpGs associated with HDL (n=5), LDL (n=3), TC (n=4), and TG (n=94) as outcomes. Among survivors of African ancestry (N=370), we identified 3 CpGs associated with TG as an exposure, and 5 CpGs associated with LDL (n=1) and TC (n=4) as outcomes. A comparison of effect sizes of significant CpGs between survivors of European and African ancestry suggests moderate to substantial racial differences in epigenetic associations with lipid exposures (14\/46 with I<sup>2<\/sup>&#62;50) and lipid outcomes (106\/111 with I<sup>2<\/sup>&#62;50). Additionally, no overlap between CpGs associated with lipid exposures and lipid outcomes suggests that the DNAm levels of these CpGs could be either the cause or consequence of lipid levels. Examination of the EWAS catalog and recent literature, suggests that most of the lipid associated CpGs identified in our study are novel. Blood lipid associated CpGs may be epigenetic biomarkers for identification of survivors with higher risk of dyslipidemia and may inform potential drug targets for future interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec8368a4-eec3-4737-ac5d-479524a14a99\/@C03B8ZJX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Lipids,Survivorship,Childhood cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17315"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qian Dong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nan Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenghong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Easton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather Mulder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinghui Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoffrey Neale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Walker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>I-Chan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirsten K.

In addition, these information hold immense potential for accurate identification of disease biomarkers, cell of origin, and targets for epigenetic therapy. However, existing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) workflows require significant cellular material and are very time-consuming, requiring cumbersome optimization. Moreover, cellular heterogeneity can influence the accuracy of results from the perspective of sample preparation efficiency and also population-biased effects. Both normal and malignant bone marrow are heterogeneous in cell type and stage of differentiation that leads to imprecise results with regard to epigenetic determinates.In our study, we implemented Covaris&#8217; Adaptive Focused Acoustics&#174; (AFA&#174;) technology to miniaturize sample volumes for both chromatin shearing and immunoprecipitation in a 96-well format. This approach enables a standardized, robust, automatable, half-day workflow for both ChIP and Hi-ChIP applications. Additionally, we evaluated low input <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> samples, where we utilized a range of epitopes including major histone modifications (H3K27ac) and factors (CTCF). AFA was applied to flow-sorted stem and progenitor populations from individual mice. The low cell input capability permitted deconvolution of dynamic epigenetic changes in protein binding and chromatin structure during normal lineage specification of hematopoietic stem cells. Epigenetic remodeling of these sites were consistent with established gene programs essential for myeloid differentiation. Data were found to be in alignment with standard ChIP-seq and Hi-C datasets generated from similar cell populations.The simplified and significantly shortened (Hi)ChIP-seq processes showcased in this study will be highly beneficial for both research and clinical diagnostic applications owing to their requirements for using 96-well plate format and their ability to become integrated into automated workflows. Taken together, this technology and workflow represent a high throughput epigenetic system for small cell numbers of cells with a multitude of applications enabling laboratories focused on cell biology and translational research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4564c2f3-69ce-4e4b-965f-f6032713d896\/@C03B8ZJX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Chromatin immunoprecipitation,Leukemias: acute myeloid,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17316"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Besmira Alija<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Braunstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jane Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom O'Hare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Garding<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Viny<\/i><\/presenter>.

The main regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia is the transcription factor HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor). In addition, several histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) are 2-OG dependent dioxygenases and require oxygen for their activity. When oxygen availability is limited, the activity of these KDMs is inhibited leading to global histone hypermethylation, potentially altering gene expression. However, some KDMs are also known to be direct transcriptional targets of HIF, increasing their expression in hypoxia and counteracting this histone hypermethylation. Furthermore, HIF can facilitate recruitment of histone methyltransferase activity to chromatin in cis, leading to local increases in methylation status. Histone methylation can be associated with both gene activation and gene repression, and it remains unclear how the balance of these widespread changes relates to locus-specific regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, previous attempts to analyze regulation of histone methylation by ChIP-seq in hypoxia have not employed normalization methods that take into account global changes in histone modification. We have performed ChIP-seq analysis of histone trimethylation (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3) in PC3 prostate cancer cells incubated in normoxia or (16hrs, 1%) hypoxia. We have then examined the effects of the HIF-transcriptional pathway on these marks using the same cell line following deletion of HIF-1b to block the HIF response. We employ an integrated spike-in with drosophila chromatin to provide a normalization control. We then relate our findings to changes in gene expression using RNA-seq analysis, again normalized to a spike-in control. We observe global increases in all 4 histone trimethylations across the genome in hypoxia. In particular, we observe hypoxic increases in histone trimethylation at all gene loci. However, while basal levels of histone trimethylation correlated with basal transcript levels as previously reported, hypoxic increases in promoter-associated histone H3K4me3 trimethylation bore no relation to either the direction or magnitude of gene regulation in hypoxia. Although, more subtle increases were observed across the gene body at gene loci induced by hypoxia. These findings question the currently accepted model that changes in H3K4me3 instruct changes in transcription in hypoxia and suggest that the overall effect of histone trimethylation is a more subtle balance of competing effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d169a328-a34c-44a0-993b-befd52ec0dbe\/@C03B8ZJX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Histone methylation,Epigenetics,Differential gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17322"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jessica D.

To elucidate molecular mechanisms of maintenance of the silenced status of the<i> p16INK4a<\/i> gene, we applied the insertional chromatin immunoprecipitation (iChIP) method. The promoter region of the transcriptionally active and silenced alleles of the <i>p16INK4a<\/i> gene were tagged with a bacterial DNA-binding protein LexA and its binding elements. Subsequently, the promoter regions were affinity purified with antibody against a tag fused with LexA. Proteins more or less abundantly associated with the silenced promoter were identified by stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), one of quantitative mass spectrometry methods. Knock-down experiments of the identified enzymes revealed essential components of maintenance of epigenetic silencing. The essential enzymes can be good targets of development of drugs reactivating expression of the silenced tumor suppressor genes in cancers. We are currently performing drug discovery research to identify small molecules that bind and inhibit those candidate drug target enzymes. Our locus-specific ChIP technology consisting of iChIP and the engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated ChIP (enChIP) method is a powerful tool to identify novel drug targets for development of drugs regulating gene expression in intractable diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2295120-092b-4dd0-8079-57d3ad91d575\/@C03B8ZJX\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-05 Gene silencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,CDK inhibitor,p16INK4a,Gene silencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17337"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Toshitsugu Fujita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hodaka Fujii<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Here we show that missegregation of mitotic chromosomes, their sequestration in micronuclei, and subsequent micronuclear envelope rupture profoundly disrupt normal histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), a phenomenon conserved across humans and mice as well as cancer and nontransformed cells. Some of the changes to histone PTMs occur due to micronuclear envelope rupture whereas others are inherited from mitotic abnormalities prior to micronucleus formation. Using orthogonal techniques, we show that micronuclei exhibit extensive differences in chromatin accessibility with a strong positional bias between promoters and distal or intergenic regions. Finally, we show that inducing CIN engenders widespread epigenetic dysregulation and that chromosomes which transit in micronuclei experience durable abnormalities in their accessibility long after they have been reincorporated into the primary nucleus. Thus, in addition to genomic copy number alterations, CIN can serve as a vehicle for epigenetic reprogramming and heterogeneity in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2fa09d34-f365-4a23-93dd-965ca272ae39\/@C03B8ZJX\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Epigenetics,Histone modification,Histone acetylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17305"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Albert S.
