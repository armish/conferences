[{"Abstract":"Cxcr3 is a G-protein coupled receptor expressed on various cell types including cancer cells. Cxcr3 is activated via binding of the chemokine Cxcl10, which mediates immune cell migration during normal immune response. Pharmacological inhibition of Cxcr3 was shown to mitigate metastasis in a murine breast cancer model, suggesting it is critical for cancer metastasis, but the mechanism is not well understood. We have previously shown that exogenous Cxcl10 induced migration of ING4-deleted breast cancer cells, but not of ING4-intact cells. Cxcl10 signaling required the growth factor receptor Egfr, suggesting a crosstalk between Cxcr3 and Egfr. Confocal immunofluorescent (IF) colocalization assays showed that Cxcr3 and Egfr rapidly and transiently colocalized upon Cxcl10 treatment, which recurred only in ING4-deleted cells, suggesting that the recurrent receptor association may drive Cxcl10-induced cell migration. Here we characterized the temporal dynamics of the Cxcl10-induced Cxcr3\/EGFR receptor associations and migration using IF and transwell migration assays, respectively. We also used inhibitors of Cxcr3 (AMG-487), Egfr (erlotinib and SAH-EJ1), and G&#946;&#947; (gallein) in order to delineate the signaling mechanism. The IF results demonstrated that, the first Cxcr3\/EGFR association occurred rapidly within 10 minutes of Cxcl10 treatment, which disappeared by 1 hour post Cxcl10 treatment. The Cxcr3\/Egfr complex formation recurred again transiently at 8 hours post Cxcl10 treatment. This transient receptor complex formation repeatedly occurred at 8-hour intervals up to 24 hours, suggesting a cyclic complex formation. 1 hour treatment of cells with Cxcl10 induced the cyclic formation of the Cxcr3\/Egfr complexes, indicating that continuous presence of Cxcl10 was not required for recurrent Cxcr3\/EGFR association. Likewise, 1 hour Cxcl10 treatment of cells induced cell migration, indicating that the initial binding of Cxcl10 to Cxcr3 was the critical event in the subsequent recurrent receptor colocalization and cell migration. Inhibition of the early Cxcr3\/Egfr complex formation by AMG-487 or SAH-EJ1 blocked subsequent receptor association and cell migration, corroborating the idea that the initial receptor complex formation is the critical event. Erlotinib did not block the receptor colocalization, but inhibited cell migration when added for the initial 1 hour time duration of Cxcl10 treatment, but not when added after 4 hours. These results indicated that the early Cxcr3\/Egfr complex signaled via the Egfr kinase. In contrast, gallein inhibited cell migration irrespective of when it was added, indicating that G&#946;&#947; was a required signaling component downstream of Cxcr3\/EGFR. These findings present the Cxcl10\/Cxcr3\/Egfr\/G&#946;&#947; signaling axis as the potential therapeutic targets for ING4-deficient aggressive breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/04e7c923-ce55-46b0-a820-d1620d8b9278\/@D03B8ZHT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokine receptor,CXCL10,ING4,CXCR3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13166"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emily Tsutsumi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suwon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

It has been shown that body stress hormones, such as norepinephrine, and opioid peptides interact to control the growth and progression of this cancer. Opioid and beta-adrenergic receptors are recently shown to cross talk via formation of receptor heterodimers to control cellular functions in various cell systems. However, the underlying cell signaling mechanism remains unclear. To determine the effect of the interaction of the two systems in breast cancer, we employed triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, CRISPR, chemical inhibition or activation and, PCR Array technology to study aggressive tumor phenotype and signaling cascades. We found that knock down of the beta-adrenergic (B2AR) or mu-opioidergic receptor (MOR) system via the CRISPR technique or pharmacological agents induces a less aggressive phenotype in triple negative breast cancer cells both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, with the effect being potentiated when both receptor systems were inhibited together. The mRNA expression study using a PCR Array targeting Cancer Stem Cell genes shows that B2AR or MOR activated the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling cascade. The GSK3 inactivation in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells induced similar phenotypic changes as was done by the inhibition of B2AR and\/or MOR, while a GSK3 activation by wortmannin reversed the effects of B2AR and\/or MOR knockdown on these cells. GSK3 inactivation also prevents B2AR agonist norepinephrine or MOR agonist DAMGO from affecting MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell proliferation. These data identify a role of B2AR and MOR interaction in the control of breast cancer cell growth and establish a possible role of the GSK3 signaling system in mediation of these two receptors&#8217; cross talk.

Despite multimodal treatment strategies, the prognosis is poor with a median survival of approx. 15 months. Although neurotrophic factors are of major importance in the nervous system, their role in brain cancer is still not fully understood. We focused on the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which has been shown to play a role in growth and migration in glioblastoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of GDNF and it primary receptor GFRA1, as well as the other GDNF family receptors GFRA2-4 and RET.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tissue sections from 10 glioblastoma patients were stained with antibodies against GDNF and each of the receptors. GDNF stainings were performed on frozen tissue slides, while receptor stainings were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The area fractions of positive staining were quantified with a software-based classifier. Double immunofluorescence stainings with the different markers and Iba1 as well as GFAP were performed to assess expression in microglia\/macrophages and tumor cells, respectively.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> GDNF staining was observed in five of ten patient specimens, whereas GFRA1 and GFRA2 staining was observed in all samples. GFRA1 and GFRA2 staining was seen in the membrane and cytoplasm with a mean area fraction of GFRA1 staining at 31 % (range: 7-56%), and a mean area fraction of GFRA2 staining at 3 % (range: 0.2-7 %). GFRA3, GFRA4 and RET were not expressed in glioblastoma tissue. Double immunofluorescence stainings demonstrated co-expression of GFRA1 and GFAP, while co-expression of GFRA1 and IBA1 was limited.<br \/><b>Conclusion and perspectives:<\/b> Our results suggest that GDNF and GFRA1 are widely expressed in glioblastoma tumor tissue, but GFRA2 is also expressed and may play a role in glioblastoma biology. Additional stainings are being established to clarify cellular expression and expression levels of GDNF and its receptors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5784383b-a21d-42ff-8baa-06d96e8a9daf\/@D03B8ZHT\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-03 Growth factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Growth factor,Immunohistochemistry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13169"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jesper D.

These findings originated from our <i>in vitro <\/i>3D type I collagen cultures of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line HCA-7 derivatives CC, SC, and CC-CR. CC are sensitive to cetuximab, while SC and CC-CR are resistant. Both <i>de novo <\/i>and acquired<i> <\/i>modes of cetuximab resistance in SC and CC-CR, respectively, could be overcome by crizotinib, a multi-RTK inhibitor that also targets MET and RON. Conversely, exogenous administration of MET ligand, HGF could transiently induce cetuximab resistance which could be further overcome by crizotinib addition. HGF\/HGFL are synthesized as inactive precursors and require cleavage by proteases (HGFA, Matriptase, and Hepsin) to be biologically active. To inhibit HGF\/HGFL cleavage in cetuximab-resistant cells, we employed inhibitors of HGF\/HGFL proteases (ZFH7116 and VD2173) and were able to overcome both <i>de novo<\/i> and acquired cetuximab resistance. A survey of TCGA datasets indicated that HGF\/HGFL were overexpressed in several CRC CMS subtypes. We next expressed human HGF in cetuximab-sensitive CC cells and observed that HGF overexpression imparts cetuximab resistance. Moreover, cetuximab resistance induced by HGF overexpression could be overcome by the downstream MET inhibition (with crizotinib) and we are now testing if the upstream inhibition of HGF proteases (with ZFH7116\/VD2173) also overcomes cetuximab resistance. Combined these results indicate that inhibition of HGF cleavage and maturation may be a novel way to overcome resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2e9d0c8d-7d9e-4429-a725-e986a1f3c930\/@D03B8ZHT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-03 Growth factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Colorectal cancer,Cetuximab,Hepatocyte growth factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13170"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ramona Graves-Deal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Galina Bogatcheva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vivian T.

It has been established that the inhibition of HDACs suppresses CaP proliferation by inhibiting AR signaling via multiple mechanisms, including AR degradation. Hence, the goal of this study was to develop small molecules that employ multiple mechanisms to inhibit AR expression and promote its degradation, which would effectively control the emergence and treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Several rationally designed antiandrogen equipped HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) were synthesized, and their efficacy on CRPC growth was examined both in vitro and in vivo models. Results demonstrated that these compounds' target (HDAC and AR) binding properties translated into potent anticancer activity against AR+ CRPC cell lines and to a lesser extent in AR- CRPC cell lines. In addition, among these compounds, we found that SB-146, a nontoxic agent, not only inhibited the growth of AR+ CRPC cells at nanomolar IC50s without sparing toxicity to healthy prostate epithelial cells. Molecular analysis confirmed SB-146 downregulated the expressions of both AR and AR-spice variants (AR-SV) in CRPC cells. Further analyses revealed downregulation of AR downstream (PSA, HOXB13 and FOXA1) targets as well as AR-SV&#8217;s (NUP210 and SLC3A2) in CRPC cells. SB-146 was also able to overcome DHT-induced AR and AR-SV signaling in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells. Assessment of SB-146&#8217;s therapeutic efficacy on in vivo models revealed that oral administration of this compound abrogated AR+ and AR-SV (C4-2B and 22Rv1) tumor growth in xenotransplanted nude mice models. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed SB-146&#8217;s target of both AR and AR-SVs on xenografted tumor tissues. Together these results confirm that SB-146 is a potent agent that inhibits AR signaling in CRPC cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ea9949a-6ab9-4280-a16e-c7818527fc8a\/@E03B8ZHU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Growth inhibition,HDAC inhibitor,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13172"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Uttara Saran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Balaji Chandrasekaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashish Tyagi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhasish Tapadar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bocheng Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oyelere Adegboyega<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Chendil Damodaran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

B-ALL characterized by cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) overexpression (CRLF2 B-ALL) has a survival rate of &#60;30% and is the highest risk sub-group of B-ALL in both adults and children. CRLF2 is a receptor component for the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP plays a role in the survival and proliferation of B-cell precursors, thus explaining the oncogenic role of increased CRLF2 signaling in CRLF2 B-ALL. To our surprise, we found that high-levels of TSLP eliminated leukemia cells in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of CRLF2 B-ALL. CRLF2 and IL-7 receptor-alpha (IL-7Ra) form the heterodimer type-I cytokine receptor for TSLP cytokine. Binding of TSLP to its CRLF2 receptor complex induces JAK-STAT5 and PI3K-AKT pathway signals. TSLP shares the IL-7Ra with Interleukin 7 (IL-7) which has a heterodimer receptor consisting of IL-7Ra and the common gamma chain. High-levels of IL-7 (50 ng\/ml) have been shown to induce IL-7Ra internalization and degradation in T-cells. We hypothesize that high-level TSLP induces internalization and degradation of IL-7Ra leading to CRLF2 signal inhibition, death of CRLF2 B-ALL cells and the anti-leukemia effects that we have observed in PDX mice. To test this hypothesis, we treated CRLF2 B-ALL cell lines with different TSLP concentrations to observe the effect of TSLP on its receptor and CRLF2 signaling. Flow cytometry data showed that continuous or a pulse of high-dose TSLP induced a loss of surface IL-7Ra expression for up to 24 hours. Phosphorylation assays showed that cells cultured with high-dose TSLP were unresponsive to subsequent TSLP-induced phosphorylation events (pSTAT5 and pRPS6), indicating CRLF2 signal inhibition. In conclusion, high-dose TSLP induces loss of (IL-7Ra) and inhibition of CRLF2 signaling. These results suggest that TSLP exerts its anti-leukemia effects by shutting down CRLF2-mediated signals possibly via the loss of the IL-7Ra receptor component.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6b426a8-ae4c-4d6c-bf8a-a10ca37f4bf0\/@E03B8ZHU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),TSLP,IL-7 receptor Alpha,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13174"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hossam Alkashgari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cornelia Stoian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caleb Ruiz-Jimenez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqueline Coats<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos A.

CRC is a major problem in veterans and every year ~4,000 veterans are diagnosed with CRC within VA facilities. Hence, there is a dire need to identify novel signaling pathways as targets for therapy. Based on a bedside discovery in CRC patients, we observed that CRC patients complained about dysgeusia or taste alterations. There are 25 bitter taste receptors (TAS2R1-50, TAS2R60). Taste receptors utilize G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and signal through calcium release. In preliminary studies, mining the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we have determined that TAS2R38 is upregulated in multiple cancers, including CRC. Moreover, the higher expression of TAS2R38 transcript in CRC compared to other cancers. Furthermore, we confirmed overexpression of TAS2R38 in CRC tissues and cell lines by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Moreover, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), a TAS2R38 agonist, treatment activated calcium mobilization in HCT116 and DLD1 cells suggesting the functionality of the receptor. OdDHL also enhanced mRNA of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels in the CRC cells. To determine whether expression of the receptor is affected in vivo, we conducted the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute colitis and colitis-associated cancer model (azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS) in C57BL\/6 mice. TAS2R138, the mouse homolog of human TAS2R38 is overexpressed in crypt epithelial cells in the colitis and tumor tissues. These observations suggest that TAS2R38 is overexpressed in the CRC and may play a critical role in disease progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Colon cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13175"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Krishan Jain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sangita Bhattacharyya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Afreen Sayed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Standing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathy Benich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shahid Umar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shrikant Anant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Weir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roy Jansen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Prasad Ravindra Dandawate<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Betulinic acid belongs to the group of pentacyclic triterpenoids and is well known for its antitumor activities. The library of about 1000 betulinic acid-derived triterpenes was collected and analyzed for cytotoxic activity on cancer and non-cancer cell lines (A549, CCRF-CEM, CEM-DNR, HCT116, K562, K562-TAX, U2OS, BJ and MRC-5) in our Institute over the last 20 years. Steroidal triterpenes are precursors of cholesterol, the precursor of testosterone, the fundamental ligand of the androgen receptor that is the key regulator in several physiological and pathological processes. Finding new modulators of androgen receptor is critical for the treatment of various androgen-dependent diseases, including prostate cancer or anabolic deficiencies. Betulinic acid and its derivatives showed structural similarity with steroids and therefore were selected to be tested for androgen receptor activity modulation.<br \/>METHODS The stably transfected cell line HEK 293T GFP-AR was used to determine the translocation activity of the androgen receptor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after the treatment with the derivatives. The high throughput fluorescent microscopy device and image analysis comprised the data, and compounds with the proved activity were selected for subsequent analysis. The luciferase reporter gene assay was further used to evaluate the effect of compounds on the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor. The MTS assay was performed to assess the cytotoxicity.<br \/>RESULTS Betulinic acid and its eight derivatives were identified to have 5-6 - fold higher translocation activity of AR (ratio cytoplasm GFP intensity\/nuclear GFP intensity) than the negative control. Validation on luminescence luciferase reporter assay confirmed 4-5 - fold induction for five derivatives, whereas three derivatives were not active. Interestingly only two of them showed substantial cytotoxicities (IC50&#60; 50 &#181;M) as they possess significant inhibitory activity against all tested cancer cell lines with favorable therapeutic index against the non-cancer cell lines.<br \/>CONCLUSION Derivatives of betulinic acid were proven to have modulatory activity on the androgen receptor pathway. The two derivatives of betulinic acid also displayed cytotoxicity towards almost all of the tested cancer cell lines. There could be not only AR modulation responsible for anticancer activity as the derivatives of betulinic acid are well know disruptors of mitochondrion functions as well. The synergy of these two mechanisms of action could potentiate the antitumor activity of the selected compounds.<br \/>This work was supported by ENOCH CZ.02.1.01\/0.0\/0.0\/16_019\/0000868, CZ-OPENSCREEN - LM2018130, EATRIS-CZ - LM2018133.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5614de43-2d27-4d83-aefc-c7db3750e61f\/@E03B8ZHU\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Target discovery,Androgen receptor,Cytotoxicity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13176"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alzbeta Srovnalova<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sona Gurska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Milan Urban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Sarek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiri Rehulka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petr Dzubak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marian Hajduch<\/i><\/presenter>.

The mechanisms by which CD146 conveys extracellular cues into malignant cellular outputs is not well understood, but its high-level expression in early development and normal mouse mammary stem cells, as well as expression in highly plastic adult pericytes (formerly known as mesenchymal stem cells) suggested to us that it may control cell state plasticity. We tested the role of CD146 in a plastic, stem cell-like mouse mammary tumor cell line derived from the MMTV-PyMT mouse (PY230). We identified domains in the CD146 cytoplasmic tail essential for controlling substrate utilization by upstream kinases in Akt, Mapk, Stat3, and integrin-related signaling pathways that alter cell state plasticity and tumorigenicity.
