[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> 10% of newly diagnosed prostate cancer presents with metastases. Known as <i>de novo<\/i> metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), it is disproportionally responsible for &#62;50% of prostate cancer deaths. Cancer genotyping can identify vulnerabilities exploitable by targeted therapies, and promises to help prognosticate. However, tissue from <i>de novo<\/i> mCSPC is scarce; neither prostatectomy nor metastatic biopsy is standard, and it is unknown if diagnostic biopsies are representative of synchronous metastases. The potential for plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to inform on tumor genotype is also unknown.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed comprehensive pathological and genomic assessment of all spatially or phenotypically-distinct tumor foci (n=523) in 43 patients with <i>de novo<\/i> mCSPC who underwent prostatectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and plasma collection.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>91% (478\/523) of tissue foci had evidence of prostate cancer by targeted DNA sequencing, with a median tumor fraction of 48%. When modeling random selection of a single primary foci (mirroring biopsy tissue availability in clinic), tumor fraction was &#60;20% in 19% of patients. Only 46% of plasma cell-free DNA samples prior to systemic therapy had a ctDNA fraction above 0.3% (limit of detection); median tumor fraction of 5% in samples with confirmed ctDNA. We observed recurrent alterations in major driver genes, including <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>FOXA1<\/i>, <i>PTEN,<\/i> and <i>RB1, <\/i>and<i> <\/i>the genomic landscape was very similar to published cohorts of castration-resistant prostate cancer (excluding AR). Primary site genomic heterogeneity was pervasive, including secondary (clonally distinct) prostate cancer populations in 14% of patients. Polyclonal seeding of metastases was detected in 26% of patients. Biallelic inactivation of <i>TP53, PTEN, <\/i>and\/or <i>RB1 <\/i>was observed in 63% of tumors, and was frequently found in synchronous metastases and ctDNA. The two patients with compound disruption of <i>TP53, PTEN, <\/i>and <i>RB1 <\/i>experienced rapid progression to castration-resistance and death within two years of diagnosis, despite initial low-risk clinical features. Across the cohort, biallelic disruption of <i>TP53<\/i> together with high-risk clinical features at diagnosis was associated with rapid progression (HR 4.64 (95% CI: 1.70-12.69); <i>P<\/i> = 0.003).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>One fifth of patients with <i>de novo<\/i> mCSPC have pervasive low tumor fraction in their primary tumor and blood plasma. Many tumors exhibit spatial heterogeneity within the primary site, with evidence of multiple clones seeding metastases. This data raises concerns about accurate tumor genotyping in routine clinical practice where needle biopsy specimens are the only available tissue for profiling. Nevertheless, some <i>de novo<\/i> mCSPC are marked by aggressive genomics and experience rapid progression to lethal disease, suggesting that tailored multi-focal genomic profiling can further segment the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5d29b27a-f7dd-43d8-9dba-fc6d2da3131f\/@B03B8ZHe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Tumor metastases,Tumor suppressor gene,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16346"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Evan Warner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim Van der Eecken<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew J.

With a purification instrument, an enhanced chip architecture, and downstream reporting, the Genexus System provides a convenient solution to enable oncology research. Here we highlight the oncology research applications and high-throughput NGS capabilities of the Genexus System with Oncomine Comprehensive Assay Plus (OCA Plus), an oncology research panel that can detect variants, fusions, and evaluate key oncology research endpoints. We demonstrate the ability of OCA Plus on Genexus to evaluate tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The high-throughput capabilities of the Genexus System enable it to support large oncology research panels such as OCA Plus, which comprises over 13,000 amplicons. The extensive per sample coverage allows for comprehensive DNA and RNA genomic profiling of relevant cancer biomarkers in over 500 genes including detection of over 1,300 fusion isoforms. We utilized high-molecular weight and FFPE samples, reference controls, and orthogonally tested research samples to evaluate DNA variant calling, RNA fusion calling, and key oncology research endpoints, including MSI, LOH, TMB, and HRD.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Commercially sourced reference control and research samples were sequenced using OCA Plus on the Genexus System. Sequencing data metrics showed &#8805;24 million reads per sample, with four samples supported per run. The high-throughput capacity of the Genexus chip architecture results in &#62;95% of amplicons achieving a minimum of 500X coverage with an average coverage uniformity of &#8805;95% when evaluated across all &#62;13,000 amplicons. Variant calling was assessed using the AcroMetrix Oncology Hotspot Control which has 328 hotspot variants covered by OCA Plus. Variant calling performance showed a hotspot and <i>de novo <\/i>variant sensitivity and PPV &#62;95%. MSI score and status were assessed using known MSI-High and microsatellite stable (MSS) research samples and FFPE samples of interest. Results show high concordance with data from OCA Plus on GeneStudio.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The increased throughput of the Genexus System combined with minimal touchpoints and a rapid turnaround time enables comprehensive genomic profiling for research assays such as OCA Plus where an increased number of sequencing reads leads to greater sensitivity for detecting rare variants and low-level fusion transcripts. Further, accurate characterization of key oncology research endpoints, such as TMB, MSI, LOH, and HRD, allow the Genexus System to accelerate research in the field of oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/951326c9-c253-4c1c-b1b7-f3526c31dd0b\/@t03B8ZHf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Microsatellite instability,Fusion genes,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16348"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kayla Zochowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Dinesh Cyanam<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoffrey Lowman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Kilzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sameh El-Difrawy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanaya Puranik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Phan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derek Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edith Kwong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Coleen Nemes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Casuga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frances Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eun Ji Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianjun Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vinay Mittal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Norris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shrutii Sarda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohit Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fan Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Roman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriel Vargas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annie Kraltcheva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amneet Gulati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin Rigby<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Hoff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Meade<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaine Wong-Ho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamsheed Ghadiri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Garcia-Viramontes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Myrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seth Sadis<\/i><\/presenter>.

There is no biomarker to predict which DCIS cases will recur but it has been suggested that a biomarker would allow de-escalation of the current paradigm of treating most patients with surgery and\/or radiotherapy. However, we hypothesize that not all recurrences are genetically similar to the primary DCIS (i.e. non-clonal) and therefore arise <i>de novo<\/i>. To test this we assembled a large recurrence cohort to explore the clonal relatedness of primary-recurrence tumor pairs prior to proposing a predictive biomarker (Gorringe <i>et al<\/i> Mod Pathol 2015).<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We microdissected and extracted DNA from 65 pairs of primary DCIS and recurrences. Half of these recurrences were IBC. We analyzed 21 pairs by targeted sequencing or low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (LCWGS, 2x depth) and 44 pairs with Whole Exome Sequencing (WES, average depth 95x). We similarly analyzed a set of non-recurrent DCIS cases (n=29) treated with wide local excision and with a minimum of 7 years follow-up. No matched normal samples were available. Several approaches were utilized to investigate clonal relatedness using copy number alterations and mutations (when detected), including the Clonality package (Mauguen <i>et al<\/i> Biometrics 2018), manual breakpoint inspection (Bollet <i>et al<\/i> JNCI 2008), and clonality indexes (Schultheis <i>et al<\/i> JNCI 2016). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out by MEDICC2 (Petkovic <i>et al<\/i> <i>bioRxiv <\/i>2021) on WES samples.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 62% of cases were clonal (40\/65), 28% were non-clonal. There were 7\/65 that were equivocal, although further validation will be performed. There was no significant difference in clonal relatedness whether the recurrence was IBC or DCIS. IBC recurrent cases showed a significantly higher ploidy than the DCIS recurrences. The final phylogenetic analysis with MEDICC2 will be presented, which will take into account any subclonal whole-genome doubling events. Furthermore, clonal primary DCIS showed a significantly higher number of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations compared to non-recurrent and non-clonal primaries (p&#60;0.001, Fisher Exact test) and a higher level of copy number events overall.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Detailed molecular analysis of a large cohort of matched DCIS primary and their recurrences using high sequencing resolution showed a substantial proportion of recurrences were not genetically related to the primary DCIS.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits complex mutational spectrum without common oncogenic drivers yet displays consistent loss of large chromosomal regions. Here, we characterize selection pressures that maintain a recurrently deleted region of chromosome 4p in TNBC. We used single cell and bulk WGS phylogenetic analysis of TNCB PT\/PDX panel to show that chr4p deletion is an early event in tumor evolution. We used scRNAseq gene expression and inferred copy number analysis to show that chr4p loss is associated with a proliferative state. This finding was confirmed by a combination of RNA <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization and immunofluorescence. We then tested the dosage sensitivity of genes residing within this region by individual and dual overexpression in TNBC PDX-derived cell lines and control normal cell line by assessing their effect on cell proliferation. The overexpression of genes within chr4p elicited a strong cell proliferation defect in cancer but not normal cell line models. We also characterized an unknown gene within chr4p region as a novel member of the STRIPAK complex. Genome-wide pooled ORFeome library screens identified a global pattern of background-specific dosage sensitive regions. Our study shows that large chromosomal deletions are maintained due to evolutionary early genetic network rewiring rendering multiple genes within such regions to be dosage sensitive.

Despite advances in treatments and personalised medicine for cancer, rare cancers are often left behind due to limited knowledge regarding molecular characterization, heterogeneity of the population and poor access to screening platform or interventional trials.To bridge this gap, EORTC, in collaboration with EURACAN, has developed a project within the EORTC-SPECTA platform to assess the molecular landscape of rare cancers in Europe and the actionability of the different findings.<br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b>The pan-European Arcagen project is prospectively analyzing tumor material or blood of patient with rare cancers, using Foundation Medicine NGS panels, while collecting baseline and follow-up clinical data.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>At the cut-off date of 10\/10\/2021, 629 patients were evaluable (baseline clinical data and successful molecular profiling performed by a Foundation Medicine test), molecular alterations were found in 620 patients, theoretically actionable ones in 421 patients. Importantly, approved treatment in the right tumor type was proposed in 58 patients (9.2%). Longer follow-up is needed to assess treatment adaptation and response. Most analyses were performed based on FFPE material (451 out of 629), but in case of low sample quality, low content of tumor cells, or old sample, rescue analysis was performed on liquid biopsy (177 out of 629). The main reason for switching to liquid biopsy was due to low FFPE tissue quality (90 out of 178). This rescue pathway was used on average in 28.1% of cases, ranging from 14.7% in salivary gland cancers to 48% for Cancer of Unknown Primary. Comparing per tumor type the molecular profile obtained either with FFPE or blood analysis, we noticed that SNVs are nicely detected in both compartments. However, copy number loss and amplifications are mainly detected when FFPE material is used. This is especially true for copy number loss of CDKN2A\/B (cholangiocarcinoma, mesothelioma and salivary gland), or MTAP (mesothelioma), and MYC amplification (brain and rare skin cancer).As expected according to other datasets, some clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) was observed on liquid biopsy, with DNMT3A being in the top ten mutations detected in the blood of patients with salivary gland tumors, endocrine tumors, Merkel cell carcinoma and uveal melanoma.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This project highlights the clear need for more collaboration, research and clinical trials on rare cancers, to improve the treatment accessibility for targeted therapy for these patients. The use of liquid biopsy, despite its limitations, is an ideal candidate to gain understanding of a patient tumor molecular profile, while being non-invasive and easily performed longitudinally.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/411d0152-ece2-4c9f-904c-ef6fa5e8f380\/@t03B8ZHf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Liquid biopsies,Screening,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16354"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marie Morfouace<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Stevovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julio Oliveira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Penel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Péron<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo G.

Previous high-throughput sequencing studies have shown that SI-NETs have a low somatic mutation rate. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 18 is the most frequent genomic alteration identified, occurring in ~60% of tumors, and the only recurrent mutations reported to date are loss-of-function mutations in <i>CDKN1B<\/i> in ~10% of tumors. Most previous studies have focused on sequencing a single primary tumor from each SI-NET patient, even though up to 50% of the patients are diagnosed with multiple synchronous tumors. Thus, the mechanisms by which multifocal SI-NETs arise remain elusive. A better understanding of their tumorigenesis is essential for the optimal treatment of the patients.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> We performed a comprehensive genomic profiling of 75 de-identified synchronous primary tumors, 15 metastases, and 18 normal ileal mucosa and\/or whole blood specimens from 13 patients with multifocal ileal NETs using whole genome sequencing.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We observed<b> <\/b>lack of shared somatic variation among the multifocal ileal NET patients and between the synchronous primary tumors within each patient, indicating that these tumors develop independently. Although recurrent copy-number alterations were identified, additional chromosome mapping revealed that tumors from the same patient can gain or lose different parental alleles. In addition to the previously reported <i>CDKN1B <\/i>loss-of-function mutations, we identified potential driver gene alterations in <i>TNRC6B<\/i> in a subset of ileal NETs. We also observed two different metastatic dissemination patterns among patients with multiple metastases. Metastases were either clonal or independent, originating from one or several primary tumors.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our study demonstrates notable genomic diversity among multifocal ileal NETs, which corroborates previous literature suggesting that these tumors originate independently. We identified potential loss-of-function mutations in <i>TNRC6B<\/i>, a candidate tumor suppressor gene in a small subset of ileal NETs. Identification of different metastatic dissemination patterns has an important clinical implication, highlighting the need to carefully remove all synchronous primary tumors of the entire jejunum and ileum at the time of surgery. Lastly, our results indicate that the tumorigenesis of multifocal ileal NETs is not exclusively driven by genomic alterations, suggesting that SI-NETs could be also driven by epigenetic mechanisms, or arise from morphologically normal small intestine as a result of field cancerization. Also, the tumor microenvironment in the ileum may play a role in the growth and development of SI-NETs.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c49429f0-7f20-4a94-867b-dcad45d48728\/@t03B8ZHf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole genome sequencing,Neuroendocrine tumors,Gastrointestinal cancers: other,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16355"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>NETTA MÄKINEN<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meng Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhouwei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yosuke Kasai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Perez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace E.

We previously showed that chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss is a frequently observed large copy number variant in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis. We also showed that chr4p deletion is an early event in tumor evolution and confers on cells a proliferative advantage. Here, we set out to uncover the genetic vulnerabilities associated with chr4p deletion in TNBC to identify novel therapeutic avenues for TNBC and enhance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms that maintain chr4p deletion in the genome. Whole genome sequence analysis of our TNBC Primary Tumor(PT)\/Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) panel identified samples with copy neutral and deletion status of chr4p. These deletion regions span a large fraction of the chr4p arm. RNAseq analysis revealed that chr4p deletion is functionally significant since gene expression of ~80% of genes was reduced upon chr4p deletion. Chr4p deletion was associated with global transcriptomic changes and differentially expressed genes were enriched for proliferation, DNA replication, cell migration, activation of the innate immune response and protein translation. PDX-derived cell models from these samples showed lentiviral infectivity based on a control lentivirus expressing GFP. Additionally, these PDX cell models were shown to be editable using CRISPR-Cas9 through the targeting of core essential genes. We will use a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 approach to systematically screen for genetic vulnerabilities in TNBC PDX-derived cell models harbouring chr4p copy neutral or deletion state. To further investigate the genetic mechanisms buffering chr4p loss, we have leveraged publicly-available CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide genetic screen data from the Cancer DepMap to identify putative synthetic lethal (pSL) partners with chr4p deletion in TNBC. This was accomplished by developing regression models and integrating them with results from established methods such as drugZ and MAGeCK. We identified pSL partners for chr4p at gene, segmental and arm levels. pSLs were enriched for mitochondrial, protein translation and proliferation pathways. We will validate the top candidates from these analyses in our cohort of chr4p deletion and chr4p copy neutral TNBC PDX-derived cell models and integrate them with the pooled CRISPR screens. Together, this work aims to reveal potential TNBC-specific therapeutic avenues for precision oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3c4a3ce8-9af1-41df-bfde-f75ca5501f45\/@t03B8ZHf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,CRISPR\/Cas9,Aneuploidy,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16356"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Schwartz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rohan Dandage<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lynn Karam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alain Pacis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hellen Kuasne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Marie Fortier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sidong Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guillaume Bourque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Traver Hart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Kuzmin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morag Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

Analyses included next generation sequencing of DNA (592 Gene Panel, NextSeq, or whole exome sequencing, NovaSeq), RNA (NovaSeq, whole transcriptome sequencing, WTS) and immunohistochemistry. MAPK activation was assessed using the MPAS gene expression signature. Wilcoxon, Fisher&#8217;s exact, or Dunnett&#8217;s tests were used to determined statistical significance (displayed as p value without and q value with multi-comparison correction). Overall survival was calculated from date of tissue collection to last contact from insurance claims data and used for Kaplan-Meier analysis. Comparisons were conducted between HRAS mutated tumors and the entire NSCLC general cohort (GC).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> HRAS mutations (Hm) were detected in 128 of 29767 NSCLC samples (0.4%) and were significantly enriched in older patients (median age, 71 vs. 69 years; q&#60;0.01) and squamous histology (57.8% vs 21.8%, q&#60;0.0001) compared to GC. Smoking status was not associated with HRAS mutational status (p=0.19). The most prevalent loci of hotspot mutations in Hm tumors were G13 (42.2%), followed by Q61 (33.6%) and G12 (21.1%). HRAS was not prognostic for overall survival (HR = 1.06, 95% CI [0.83-1.35], p=0.64), but for HRAS G13 mutant subset of NSCLC there was a trend towards worse prognosis (HR = 1.31, 95% CI [0.91-1.88], p =0.14). Hm-positive tumors harbored significantly more PIK3CA mutations (16.9% vs 5.5%, q&#60;0.05) but less KRAS (3.2% vs 27.4%, q&#60;0.05) and EGFR mutations (0.8% vs 11.9%, q&#60;0.05) compared to GC. In addition, Hm displayed dMMR\/MSI deficiency (2.6% vs 0.7%, p &#60;0.05) more frequently, but had a comparable percentage of TMB-H tumors (34.2% vs 40.2%, p = 0.16) and similar median PD-L1 expression (54.7% vs 60.3%, p = 0.21) when comparing to GC. Lastly, MAPK pathway activation score was relatively higher in Hm compared to GC (-0.26 vs -0.42) with Q61 being the highest group (0.04 vs -0.42, p = 0.37).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> HRAS mutations are detectable but uncommon events in NSCLC and significantly enriched in squamous histology. HRAS mutations often occur with PIK3CA co-mutations and trended towards higher activation of MAPK pathway and MSI-H frequency. This warrants further investigation on possible clinical applications of HRAS pathway inhibitors and utility of immune checkpoint inhibitors for this subset of NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a2c115b7-8685-41b7-8164-63e924ec6ce0\/@t03B8ZHf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Molecular profiling,H-Ras,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16357"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Asaad Trabolsi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Estelamari Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Alexander Kareff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Korn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanne Xiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Walker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirva Mamdani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Nieva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hossein Borghaei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chadi Nabhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Misako Nagasaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonam Puri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gilberto Lopes<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, HPV-associated tumors must accumulate additional genomic alterations as HPV oncoproteins alone are insufficient for tumor formation <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Experimental Design: Targeted sequencing was conducted with a panel of over 800 cancer related genomic regions and genes in a novel cohort of 525 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, including 252 HPV(+) and 273 HPV(-) tumors. Variant calling and filtering, followed by analysis with computational tools such as MutSig for somatic mutations and DiNAMIC.Duo for recurrent copy number alterations (CNAs), defined the catalog of driver alterations that are specific to HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors. Pathway analysis was then used to elucidate the functional role of somatic alterations in the context of previously described HNSCC perturbations and HPV pathophysiology.<br \/>Results: Integrative genomic analysis in one of the largest HPV(+) HNSCC cohorts to date revealed differential patterns of somatic mutations and CNAs in E6\/E7 targets between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors. Specifically, <i>EP300<\/i>, an activator of p53 and target of E6, and retinoblastoma (RB) family members <i>RB1<\/i> (pRb) and <i>RBL2<\/i> (p130), which are known targets of E7 mediated degradation, were selected as significantly mutated by MutSig in HPV(+) samples only (<i>EP300 <\/i>&#38; <i>RB1<\/i> P&#60;0.001, <i>RBL2<\/i> P=0.01), while <i>RBL1<\/i> (p107) was significant for both HPV(+) and HPV(-) samples (P&#60;0.001, P=0.02 respectively). Higher fractions of mutations in HPV(+) vs. HPV(-) tumors were observed for <i>EP300<\/i> (13% vs 6%, Fisher&#8217;s exact test P=0.006), <i>RB1 <\/i>(7% vs 3%, P=0.07), <i>RBL2 <\/i>(3% vs 1%, P=0.09), and <i>FOXM1 <\/i>(4% vs 1%, P=0.02), another cell cycle pathway target of E7, but not for <i>RBL1<\/i> (4% vs. 3%, P=1). Lower copy numbers were detected in HPV(+) tumors compared to HPV(-) for chromosome regions containing <i>RB1 <\/i>(P=0.03)<i>, RBL1<\/i> (P=0.08)<i>, RBL2 <\/i>(P&#60;0.001)<i>, <\/i>and for another inhibitory target of E6, <i>FADD <\/i>(P&#60;0.001), which is an activator of the proapoptotic protein caspase-8. Additionally, significant copy number gains were detected in HPV(+) vs. HPV(-) tumors within the genomic region containing <i>E2F1 <\/i>(P&#60;0.001), the transcription factor whose inhibition by RB family proteins is abrogated in the presence of E7, thus leading to abnormal cell cycle progression and proliferation.<br \/>Conclusions: Previous studies suggest HPV-associated tumors lack significant levels of somatic alterations in canonical tumor suppressor genes that are known targets of viral oncoproteins. Here, we show additional selective pressure exists for somatic alteration of E6\/E7 target genes in at least a subset of HPV(+) HNSCCs, which further deregulate cell cycle and apoptosis pathways in these tumors. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/55c45465-cf41-4d83-af5e-2deb5ecf048b\/@t03B8ZHf\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16359"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeremiah Holt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heejoon Jo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaobei Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyo Young Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vonn Walter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Little<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Wahle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Mazul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose P.

We aimed to examine a multi-omics profile of UM as compared to CM.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> A total of 277 UM and 1,297 CM metastatic or primary samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NextSeq, 592 genes and WES, NovaSeq, &#62;700 genes) and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS; NovaSeq) (Caris Life Sciences). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was measured by totaling somatic mutations per tumor (TMB-high cutoff &#62;10 mutations per MB). Immune cell fraction was calculated by QuantiSeq. T- cell inflamed score was calculated using gene expression data. Pathway gene enrichment analysis using WTS data was performed using GSEA. Biostatistical significance was determined using chi-square\/Fisher-Exact or Wilcoxon rank sum test and adjusted for multiple comparisons.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> For all cases (primary and metastatic), UM compared to CM had a higher rate of GNAQ\/11 (93.8% vs. 2.1% p&#8804;0.001), SF3B1 (20.4% vs 3% p&#8804;0.001), and BAP1 (52.9% vs. 1.5% p&#8804;0.001) mutations. UM also had higher levels of MYC (7% vs 0.9% p&#8804;0.001), NCOA2 (3.1% vs 0.1% p&#8804;0.001), and RUNX1T1 genomic amplifications (2.3% vs 0.2% p&#8804;0.001). Assessing only samples of liver metastases, UM was shown to have higher abundance of M2 macrophages (P&#8804;0.0001) and less abundance of M1 macrophages(P&#8804;0.0001), monocytes(P&#8804;0.0001), CD4 T-cells(P&#8804;0.0001), and regulatory T-cells (p = 0.0003) as compared to CM. GSEA comparison between liver metastases of UM and CM samples showed G2M checkpoint (NES score, 1.60 p&#8804;0.0001) and E2F targets (NES score, 1.58 p=0.002) to be higher in metastatic CM. When comparing T-cell inflamed, intermediate, and non-inflamed tumors from any site, CM or UM, the average Z scores for both G2M and E2F were highest for inflamed and lowest for non-inflamed, P&#8804;0.0001. A similar trend of higher Z score was seen for TMB high vs TMB low tumors, p&#8804;0.0001.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> UM and CM are characterized by significantly different genomic and transcriptomic alterations, and cellular composition of TME.

Currently, histologic subtype (epithelioid\/non-epithelioid\/biphasic) is the primary prognostic factor; other potential biomarkers to guide therapeutic strategies remain elusive. Even with multimodality therapies, recurrence is high in early-stage disease. In the unresectable\/metastatic setting, there are only two FDA approved regimens, both in the first line setting: cisplatin\/pemetrexed and ipilimumab\/nivolumab. Unfortunately, most who respond to first line treatment experience disease progression within a year. A few established MPM cell lines, with inherent limitations, provide minimal preclinical insight. The relative lack of model systems that accurately reflect MPM tumorigenesis is a barrier to therapeutic and diagnostic advances in MPM.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We developed a diverse library of 22 extensively annotated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from 22 patients with MPM. Multi-omic analyses including, targeted tumor next-generation sequencing by MSK-IMPACT, RNA-sequencing, and immunohistochemistry was performed. We deconvoluted the mutational landscapes, global expression profiles, and molecular subtypes of these MPM models and further compared the PDXs to MPM clinical specimens, including matched PDX and primary tumor pairs.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The mutational landscapes of PDX models strongly correlated with paired tumor samples. There were some differences in <i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i> mutations and relative enrichment of <i>NF2 <\/i>with fewer <i>BAP1<\/i> alterations, the significance of which is being investigated.

Niraparib is a highly selective PARP inhibitor, with activity against PARP-1\/2 DNA-repair polymerases, and the Resolution HRD assay is being developed as a companion diagnostic for niraparib. Detection of HRD in cell free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from blood is minimally invasive and is of special benefit to mCRPC patients, many without accessible lesions. The Resolution HRD assay identifies patients with substitutions, insertions, deletions, and homozygous deletions of the ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12 (except homozygous deletions), CHEK2, FANCA, HDAC2, and PALB2 genes by targeted NGS sequencing of cfDNA isolated from plasma. Analytical performance of the Resolution HRD assay was validated using cfDNA from mCRPC patient plasma, cfDNA from healthy donor plasma, and contrived samples with a wide spectrum of technically challenging genetic aberrations along with CRISPR-engineered human cell lines with ATM and BRCA2 gene deletions. The LOD95 was established for substitutions, insertions, deletions, and homozygous deletions for genes represented in the HRD panel with variant types including complex indels, long indels, and challenging genomic settings including homopolymeric and GC-rich regions. mCRPC specimens were used to confirm an acceptable level of precision near 1X LOD and 2-3X LOD concentrations for all 4 variant types. No false-positives were detected in any samples from healthy donors. Resolution HRD has been validated to give consistent results across the 15-30 ng input range. Studies to confirm accuracy of the Resolution HRD test results using a validated orthogonal method will be presented. The Resolution HRD assay offers highly sensitive, specific, and robust test results, and meets analytical requirements for clinical applications. It is intended as a companion diagnostic to niraparib in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP) for the treatment of mCRPC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/259c42e9-dbdc-44ae-9277-12e890011b7c\/@u03B8ZHg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,Prostate cancer,Diagnostic marker,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16364"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia Pollak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristy Potts<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>PuiYee Chan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chen-Hsun Tsai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Liao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carly Garrison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taylor Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Stull<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhen Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Baker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kavita Garg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ira Pekker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Farabaugh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Gormley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lesley Farrington<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Bell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Usha Singh<\/i><\/presenter>.

The large majority of patients present with advanced (stage IIIC or IV) disease with a median survival of only 3-4 years. By contrast, approximately 10% patients are diagnosed with early stage disease, confined to the ovary\/fallopian tube, of whom 90% are cured with surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Beyond TP53 mutation, classic activating oncogene mutations are rare in HGSC. Rather, HGSC is marked by extreme copy number (CN) abnormalities, and this complexity has prevented detailed understanding of the mutational processes underpinning outcomes in HGSC. We have used shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) to develop novel CN signatures that are able to deconvolute the complexity of HGSC genomes. However, nearly all genomics studies in HGSC have examined advanced stage disease, and little is known about the genomics of early stage HGSC - specifically, it is unclear whether these tumors are identified purely by chance or whether they represent a specific subset that does not metastasize.<br \/><b>Hypotheses: <\/b>We hypothesized that early stage HGSC has a distinct copy number landscape compared to stage IIIC\/IV disease.<br \/><b>Methods and results: <\/b>We have identified 43 cases of FIGO stage I-IIA HGSC from the pathology archives of three large London Gynaecological Cancer Centres and 52 late-stage (stage IIIC-IV) cases from BriTROC-1 cohort. Median age at diagnosis was 61.3 years vs 62.3 years respectively. There were no significant differences in mutation rates of TP53 and BRCA1\/2, and TP53 mutations were near-universal in both cohorts. We also did not find cohort-specific focal SCNA that could explain biological behavior. However, ploidy was significant higher in late-stage (median 3.0) than early-stage (median 1.9) samples. CN signature exposures were significantly different between early and late stage cohorts. Relative exposure of signature 3 was greater in early-stage and greater signature 4 in late-stage. Unsupervised clustering based on CN signatures identified three clusters that were prognostic.<br \/><b>Summary:<\/b>This project identifed that early stage and late stage HGSC have highly similar patterns of mutation and focal SCNA. However, genome-wide analysis indicates that the abnormalities seen in advanced disease are not present in early stage disease, which may represent a discrete subset with reduced metastatic potential. By identifying and characterizing the copy number signature changes, these data suggest that diagnosis at early-stage might reflect biological differences and not fortuitous chance. These data improve understanding of HGSC biology and may reveal potential new treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9086f424-72d3-42c4-9948-34fa2d7c3871\/@u03B8ZHg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number,shallow whole genome sequencing,High grade serous carcinoma,Copy number signatures,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16365"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zhao Cheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hasan B.

However, for many pediatric patients, gene panel based sequencing tests yield few actionable results. Given the complex genomic alterations present in many pediatric cancers, especially high-risk solid tumors, we hypothesized that an unbiased approach might reveal more actionable findings and lead to a more comprehensive understanding of these diseases. To accomplish this, we integrated whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with RNAseq in the analysis of a pediatric oncology cohort, with a focus on longitudinal cases to capture potential tumor evolution in metastatic or treated cases.<br \/>Our cohort consists of 269 high-risk pediatric oncology patients, including patients with relapsed\/refractory disease, metastatic disease at diagnosis, prior cancer history, a rare diagnosis, or an estimated overall survival &#60;50%. Solid tumors, CNS tumors, and leukemia\/lymphomas are all represented. In total, 391 samples were characterized using WGS (tumor ~60X; germline ~30X) and\/or RNAseq (tumor, polyA selected, &#8805;20 million reads). For 85 of these patients, multiple samples were collected at different time points (diagnosis, resection, relapse, etc.) to identify changes in the cancer over time. If panel testing was performed as part of their clinical care, a comparison to the integrated WGS\/RNA analysis was made. WGS was used to identify variants (SNVs), structural rearrangements (SVs), mutational signatures, and copy-number alterations (CNAs). RNAseq was used to identify gene expression outliers, gene fusions, and confirm the expression of variants identified using WGS. The combination of WGS and RNAseq was then used to identify and prioritize potentially actionable variants for each patient.<br \/>Our results show that the integration of WGS and RNAseq can provide more and higher-quality actionable information than either modality alone, whilst also capturing the majority of actionable variants detected by panel sequencing. RNAseq identified not only druggable fusions and expression outliers, but also many rare and novel fusions. WGS provided fusion validation but highlighted the limitations of WGS alone in identifying fusions resulting from complex SVs. Conversely, WGS was adept at capturing genome-wide patterns of CNAs and loss of heterozygosity that are missed by gene-centric panels. Further RNAseq integration enabled prioritization of expressed SNVs as well as CNAs and SVs that significantly alter gene expression. We also used WGS to extract mutational signatures and tracked their evolution across longitudinal samples. We found potentially biologically significant differences in therapy-induced mutations caused by platinum and alkylating agents. Our unbiased approach has enabled further discovery that advances our understanding of these rare and highly aggressive malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/adea92b1-43cd-4299-a947-bab5f7a69e26\/@u03B8ZHg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Whole genome sequencing,RNA sequencing,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16366"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Henry J.

However, repeat expansions have not been systematically examined in contexts beyond neurological disorders. In a specific form of cancer, termed microsatellite instability (MSI), mutations accumulate in short (&#60;50 bp) tracts of TRs, suggesting that cancer genomes may also harbor larger repeat expansions. Here, we developed a new method to systematically identify TR alterations and applied it to the analysis of 2,622 cancer genomes spanning 29 cancer types. We identified 160 recurrent repeat expansions (rREs) in 7 cancers; most (155\/160) rREs were cancer-subtype specific. Surprisingly, rREs were not correlated with MSI status, demonstrating that they arise by a distinct process. We also found that rREs are situated closer to candidate cis-regulatory elements than expected by chance, suggesting a role in gene regulation. Interestingly, an rRE in the intron of <i>UGT2B7<\/i>, detected in 34% of renal cell carcinoma samples, is associated with a decrease in gene expression. Our results demonstrate that rREs are an important and unexplored source of genetic variation in human cancer and provide a large catalog for further study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a9a2c44-c720-4aa7-8132-5c447c35bf32\/@u03B8ZHg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Gene regulation,Gene expression,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16367"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Graham S.

Here, we describe the preliminary validation of MSK-ACCESS Heme (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Analysis of Circulating cfDNA to Examine Somatic Status), a cfDNA assay that employs unique molecular indexing and ultra-deep sequencing to detect somatic alterations in 117 genes related to hematologic malignancies. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical-grade cfDNA assay developed specifically for hematologic malignancies.<br \/>Overall assay performance was assessed using 53 validation samples (26 normal samples and 27 cfDNA samples with somatic variants). Initial accuracy studies showed excellent correlation with the reference next-generation sequencing method (MSK-ACCESS Solid), detecting 32\/32 (100%) of expected variants with a variant allele frequency over 1%. The limit of detection was assessed using standard samples, with detection of variants down to 0.5% variant allele frequency. Results were highly concordant in both inter- and intra-assay reproducibility studies.<br \/>Overall, these data indicate that MSK-ACCESS Heme is a robust cfDNA-based assay that can be used to detect variants at low frequency with high reproducibility. Future work sequencing additional samples will be performed to further assess the performance of the panel.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4dabaf4a-e338-4604-92dc-e914bce14972\/@u03B8ZHg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Lymphoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16368"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara E.

We hypothesized that comparison of liquid biopsy (LB) versus tumor tissue (TT) from germline <i>ATM<\/i> pathogenic mutation carriers (gATM+) might offer additional insights into the role of <i>ATM <\/i>in CH.<br \/><b><u>METHODS<\/u><\/b> 34,825 LB samples and 384,847 TT specimens were sequenced for up to 324 genes during routine clinical care and analyzed for all classes of genomic alterations (Frampton 2013, Woodhouse 2020). Individual variants were assessed for germline versus somatic origin using the validated somatic-germline zygosity algorithm (Sun 2018).<br \/><b><u>RESULTS<\/u><\/b> Germline ATM mutations were observed in 0.9% (113\/12,217) of LB and 0.8% (3,029\/384,847) of TT (P&#60;0.001). Up to 27 <i>ATM<\/i> mutations were identified per gATM+ sample, with a range of 1-27 in LB and 1-8 in TT. Co-occurrence of 3+ ATM mutations in a single sample was 18-fold higher among gATM+ subjects undergoing LB versus TT (23.9% vs. 1.2%, P&#60;0.001). In LB, the incidence of 3+ <i>ATM<\/i> mutations increased with age for all groups, but the frequency in gATM+ subjects diverged as patient age advanced. In the age 80+ subgroup, 57.1% (28\/49) of gATM+ subjects had 3+ <i>ATM<\/i> mutations, compared to 3.3% (133\/4,055) of gATM&#8722; subjects (P&#60;0.001). A significant difference was maintained after correcting for the contribution of the germline <i>ATM<\/i> mutation to the total number of <i>ATM<\/i> mutations in gATM+ subjects. We hypothesized that multiple <i>ATM<\/i> variants per sample could be caused by high TMB or positive selection for multiple subclonal hits in the <i>ATM<\/i> gene. In TT, observation of 3+ <i>ATM<\/i> mutations was associated with high TMB in 80.5% (513\/637) of cases. In contrast, 88.5% (555\/627) of LB samples with 3+ ATM mutations had low TMB (Pdiff&#60;0.001), a pattern consistent with positive selection in LB. LB from gATM+ cases with 3+ <i>ATM<\/i> mutations all had one variant with ~50% variant allele fraction (VAF), while 80.0% (546\/682) of the co-mutations had VAF &#60;1%. Co-mutations included 32.0% (793\/2,485) truncating alterations and 68.1% (1,692\/2,485) missense alterations. Low VAF missense co-mutations were clustered in the FAT and PIKKc domains, which are known pathogenic missense mutation hotspots. This distribution suggests that some missense alterations within these hotspots that are currently classified as VUS are under positive selection and therefore warrant consideration for reclassification.<br \/><b><u>CONCLUSION<\/u><\/b> The finding of numerous <i>ATM<\/i> mutations under positive selection in gATM+ subjects was specific to LB, increased in incidence with age, and co-mutations tended to have low VAF. All these features are consistent with polyclonal hematopoiesis (polyCH) involving <i>ATM<\/i> co-mutations in gATM+ subjects. Additional investigation is needed to extend our understanding of this phenomenon.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/267d7a50-6d21-4ea1-8555-b2d9ca511151\/@u03B8ZHg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATM,Liquid biopsies,Cancer risk,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16369"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brennan Decker<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela A.

Current methods for fragmentation include mechanical shearing and enzymatic fragmentation for NGS library preparation. Mechanical shearing requires costly instruments, can be difficult to automate for high throughput labs, and results in sample loss. In comparison, enzymatic fragmentation methods do not require expensive instruments and are automation friendly. However, current enzymatic fragmentation methods on the market can remove DNA modifications such as methylation, cement DNA damage resulting from formalin fixation in final libraries and can introduce sequencing artifacts or bias. Therefore, while many fragmentation methods are commercially available, challenges remain for sequencing samples such as FFPE DNA or for detecting DNA modification (e.g., 5-methylcytosine).<br \/>We have developed a novel enzymatic fragmentation method that can be used upstream of library preparation for DNA methylation assessment or FFPE DNA. The novel enzymatic fragmentation method is quick and robust, taking as little as 20 minutes. It is automation-friendly and can be used to generate DNA fragments ranging from as small as 50 bp up to over 1000 bp.<br \/>Here we demonstrate the use of the novel enzymatic fragmentation method upstream of 5mC library preparation methods. This fragmentation method maintained the methylation marks. These libraries showed improvements in GC bias, library yield, library complexity and other sequencing metrics over libraries generated with mechanically sheared DNA.<br \/>The use of the novel enzymatic fragmentation method with FFPE DNA library preparation resulted in improvements in sequencing metrics (increased proper pairs, etc.). There was reduced FFPE-damage-derived mutations compared to mechanical shearing or other enzymatic fragmentation methods.<br \/>Fragmenting DNA to defined sizes for diverse applications and sample types remains a challenging aspect of NGS library preparation. This new, robust enzymatic fragmentation method overcomes the limitations of some traditional mechanical and enzymatic fragmentation methods and improves the library preparation and sequencing for both DNA modification assessment studies and FFPE DNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7415314b-396e-473d-9304-46d4b60cbe6a\/@u03B8ZHg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),Enzymatic Fragmentation,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16371"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brittany S.

Bulk sequencing of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been particularly problematic due to the high stromal content and resulting low tumor cellularity. Strategies to account for this have included laser capture microdissection yet this is a laborious process not amenable to high-throughput pipelines. We sought to develop and apply a high-throughput, high-depth, targeted single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) method to account for these issues, including the ability to extract high quality genomic information from low purity and archival samples.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures: <\/b>Bulk whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 29 biologically distinct samples. For single cell sequencing, we developed a custom panel containing 186 amplicons covering 93 genes that represent the most common germline and somatic targets reported in PDAC. Based on a commercially available system that enables automatic enzymatic and mechanical tissue disruption with integrated fluidic processes, we optimized a nuclei extraction workflow from frozen tissues that is highly compatible with downstream microdroplet-based single-cell encapsulation and library preparation. With it we generated scDNA-seq data from archival tissues of 15 PDAC patients at varying stages of the disease. Results were compared to that found in matched bulk sequencing data.<br \/><b>Summary of new, unpublished data and conclusions:<i> <\/i><\/b>42 samples were analyzed by single cell sequencing. Our nuclei extraction workflow generated on average 2867 single cell libraries per sample at &#62;80X read depth. The single-cell results aligned well with matched bulk data in terms of the detection of key genetic variants and their variant allele frequency (VAF). We also identified additional driver variants not seen by WES, some with direct clinical evidence. Benefits of this workflow over preexisting methods are its speed of sample preparation, efficiency of sample use (particularly for small samples), flexibility by allowing for storage of excess extracted nuclei, and economy of scale. Together, these features support preparation of large numbers of cancer samples in a relatively short period of time.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bfa89cf0-0622-4494-ad7a-3d60acbcfdbd\/@u03B8ZHg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Genomics,Evolution,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16372"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haochen Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elias-Ramzey Karnoub<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronan Chaligné<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignas Masilionis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alvin Makohon-Moore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jungeui Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue<\/i><\/presenter>.

The underlying functional drivers of treatment resistance and disease recurrence are unclear. By applying a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 library to patient-derived glioblastoma stem cell models, we systematically map genetic dependencies in patient-matched pre-treatment primary and post-treatment recurrent tumor cells. These insights reveal a large-scale remodelling of genetic dependency profiles at disease recurrence, arming recurrent tumor cells with newly-acquired genetic drivers and further loss of tumor suppressors. These analyses support parallel tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of treatment resistance which rely on acquisition of immunosuppressive capacity, including a defective mismatch repair pathway, ablation of PTEN activity, and a novel combination of de novo mutations in SWI\/SNF components. We map a multilayered genetic and functional response to drive tumor recurrence, identifying protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A2 (PTP4A2) as a novel driver of self-renewal, proliferation and tumorigenicity at glioblastoma recurrence. Mechanistically, genetic perturbation and a small molecule inhibitor of PTP4A2 results in greater survival and reduced tumor growth in patient-derived models of recurrent glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/559c4cba-c6cb-4b9b-9871-fab90989a94d\/@v03B8ZHh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Glioblastoma,Recurrence,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16373"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chirayu R.

Little is known about the concordance rates of pathogenic variants between cell free DNA (cfDNA) and solid biopsies, including how concordance varies over time, by cancer type, or by treatment. Here we examine the concordance of pathogenic variants identified in solid tissue biopsies to patient-matched cfDNA biopsies in one of the largest pan-cancer datasets.<br \/>Methods: De-identified records of cfDNA (xF) and solid (xT) biopsies were analyzed in 2418 stage 4 patients across 5 cancer types: breast (N=459), colon (N= 564), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (N=750), pancreatic (N=353) and prostate (N=292). Patients were required to have &#8805;1 pathogenic variant detected in the solid biopsy and a cfDNA biopsy occurring on the same day or after the solid biopsy. Pathogenic SNVs and indels within overlapping probe regions of xF and xT meeting assay limits of detection were included for analysis. Only one cfDNA and solid biopsy were analyzed per patient.<br \/>Results: Overall, the total number of pathogenic variants identified in solid tissue and cfDNA were highly similar within each cancer type (breast 881 vs 831; colon 1983 vs 1673; NSCLC 1672 vs 1470; pancreas 873 vs 703; prostate 480 vs 384; solid biopsy vs. cfDNA, respectively). Subsetting to patients with &#8805;1 pathogenic variant in both assays (77%), &#62;40% of patients had additional pathogenic variants identified in their cfDNA which were not found in their solid tissue profiling. Of these subsetted patients which also had cfDNA collected &#62;1 year after their solid biopsy, &#62;25% of NSCLC and &#62;20% of breast cancer patients had mutually exclusive variants (all solid tissue variants were undetectable while new pathogenic variants were found in cfDNA). When comparing samples taken between one week and over one year from each other, the percentage of solid tissue variants identified in cfDNA decreased in a time dependent manner (breast 73% vs. 48%; colon 76% vs. 55%; NSCLC 75% vs. 43%; pancreas 76% vs. 36%; prostate 72% vs. 42%; &#8804;1 week vs. &#62;1 year, respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest dataset of matched solid and cfDNA biopsies. &#62;40% of patients with &#8805;1 pathogenic variants in both assays had additional pathogenic variants found only in their cfDNA. Further, cfDNA was capable of identifying the majority (&#62;70%) of solid tissue variants when samples were taken within one week of each other, though this concordance decreased with time. This data strongly supports the use of matched solid and cfDNA testing, and further exploration of the clinical utility of cfDNA to identify pathogenic variants over the course of a patient&#8217;s disease.<br \/>We will continue to acquire more data and results will be updated before presentation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cac47b6c-0c00-4f9e-9151-656c62122768\/@v03B8ZHh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biopsies,cfDNA,Liquid biopsies,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19003"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew MacKay<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joshua Drews<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bonnie V.
