[{"Abstract":"Magnolol is a phenolic compound extracted from <i>magnolia officinalis<\/i>, exhibited anti-tumor potential against many types of cancers. Magnolol has also recognized as an anti-inflammation agent which can downregulate several inflammation signals transduction. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common central nervous system (CNS) tumor and associated with poor prognosis among adults due to rapid growth and aggressive invasion. However, the treatment efficacy of current standard therapy for GBM is remaining unsatisfied. Nevertheless, whether magnolol may suppress GBM progression and its underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism and therapeutic efficacy of magnolol on GBM.First of all, we validated the potential treatment targets of GBM with the GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) analysis and Western blotting assay. GEPIA data indicated the PKC&#948;\/STAT3 signaling pathway as a potential target of GBM that may affect patient survival. In our results, magnolol can effectively suppress the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of STAT3 in GBM cells. Then, we used the MTT assay to investigate the cytotoxicity of GBM cells after various dose of magnolol treatment. We also detected the extrinsic\/intrinsic apoptosis induction ability of magnolol on GBM cells. This study also demonstrated that magnolol may significantly trigger the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the activation of cleaved caspase-3, -8 and -9. Transwell invasion and wound healing assays was used to identify the suppression of migration and invasion effects of magnolol on glioblastoma cells. Meanwhile, tumor invasion and migration ability and the associated genes, including MMP9 and uPA, were all diminished by magnolol treatment. In sum, our results demonstrated that magnolol suppressed GBM progression may be associated with the inactivation of PKC&#948;\/STAT3 signaling transduction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1daec956-747f-4377-aa99-0c7a865b3afb\/@C03B8ZRj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Magnolol,STAT3,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17646"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sin-Rong Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>I-Tsang Chiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei-Ting Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>.

In pre-clinical models, small molecule CDK12 inhibitors have demonstrated promising tumor killing effect, especially in combination with DNA damaging agents. Here we profiled new oral and selective CDK12 inhibitors.<br \/><b>Material and methods:<\/b> ADP-glo<sup>TM<\/sup> assays: inhibition of recombinant CDK12\/CyclinK, CDK2\/CyclinE, CDK7\/CyclinH\/MAT1 and CDK9\/CyclinT2 was measured by assessing ADP converted from ATP via luminescent signal at Km and 20x Km ATP. Kinome screen: 1 &#181;M of Compound A was tested in duplicate against 370 kinases at 10 &#181;M ATP in the radiometric HotSpot&#8482; assay. Cellular assays: p-Ser2, p-Ser5 and total RNA pol II signals were assessed 4hrs after compound treatment while &#611;H2AX and BRCA1 signals were measured after 24-48hr compound treatment via Immunofluorescence (IF) assays. Cell proliferation was determined using cell titer glo after 48-72hrs compound treatment. Apoptosis was measured by annexin V\/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis after 48-72hrs of treatment. Cell cycle profile was evaluated with Click-iT-EdU and FxCycle violet stain and flow cytometry analysis following 24-48hrs of treatment. Mouse xenograft: balb\/c mice were implanted subcutaneously with H1048 or MDA-MB-468 cells and randomized for treatment with test drug or vehicle when tumors reached 150-200mm<sup>3<\/sup>. Mice were dosed BID through oral administration for 4 weeks. Combination effect of Compound A and lurbinectedin was tested in vivo. Lurbinectedin and Compound A were dosed QW and BID respectively for 28 days in H1048 CDX model.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A series of CDK12 inhibitors were designed and profiled in biochemical and cellular assays. A representative member of the class, Compound A, exhibited selectivity over CDK2, CDK7, and CDK9 of 46-, 27-, and 9-fold, respectively. Compound A inhibited proliferation in a panel of cell lines with EC<sub>50<\/sub> in the low nanomolar range. Compound A treatment led to dose dependent apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines and induced G2\/M arrest in cancer cell lines. In vitro, combination treatment with Compound A and lurbinectedin lead to increased DNA damage accumulation, decreased homologous recombination repair, and overall enhanced antiproliferation. Dose dependent tumor growth inhibition in SCLC and TNBC CDX models was observed with Compound A treatment. Enhanced and durable antitumor effect was observed with lurbinectedin and Compound A combination compared to single agent treatment in vivo.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We designed and profiled orally available, CDK12 selective inhibitors with potent activity as single agent in vitro and in vivo in multiple cancer models. Compound A demonstrated enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo when combined with DNA damaging agents. These data support the rationale for advancing one or more members of this class toward clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/656f5fb0-5555-4e9e-88a2-5e60b24cd92c\/@D03B8ZRk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK inhibitor,DNA damage response,Antitumor activity,Homologous recombination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17647"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c0ef509a-5512-49cc-ba93-2eb0dcefae16","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0ef509a-5512-49cc-ba93-2eb0dcefae16\/@D03B8ZRk\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shanhu Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Moebius<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wojciech Dworakowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elliott Cooper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derek LaPlaca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sydney Alnemy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phone Perera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Marineau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudio Chuaqui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John P.

Treatment is mainly surgical because most other therapies have limited benefits. Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is a modulator of centriole duplication that is essential for proper cell division. Its inhibition by the PLK4 inhibitor, CFI-400945 resulted in centriole dysregulation, increased in double-strand DNA damage, and ultimately, mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Recent genomic studies have identified a subset of LMS with homologous recombination (HR) repair deficiency. We hypothesize that HR-deficient LMS is highly sensitive to CFI-400945.<br \/>METHODS: Gene knockouts (KO) were done by CRISPR-Cas9 system. Plasmids encoding the <i>BRCA1<\/i>- and <i>BRCA2<\/i>-targeting guide RNA, Cas9 protein, and selection markers were generated and were transfected into SK-UT-1 and SKN followed by selection with antibiotics. The KO and wild-type cell lines were treated with CFI-400945 in vitro. Percentage apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V-PI staining and cell proliferation was examined by sulforhodamine B assay. To determine whether <i>BRCA1<\/i>- and <i>BRCA2<\/i>-KO had any effects on double-strand DNA damage, the &#947;H2AX foci were studied by immunofluorescence staining.<br \/>RESULTS: CFI-400945 caused a greater degree of apoptosis and less cell viability in the KO than in the wild-type cell lines. In SK-UT-1, quantity of apoptotic cells for <i>BRCA2<\/i>-KO and <i>BRCA1<\/i>-KO were 77% and 34%, respectively, versus 27% in the wild-type cell line (p&#60;0.05). Less dramatic findings were observed in SKN with respective percentages of 20% and 25% versus 15% (p&#60;0.05). In SK-UT-1, the mean IC50 for <i>BRCA2<\/i>-KO and <i>BRCA1<\/i>-KO were 3.4 nM and 5.5 nM, respectively, versus 7.8 nM in the wild-type cell line (p&#60;0.05). Similar observations were noted in SKN, with respective mean IC50 of 6.5 nM and 7.1 nM versus 10.0 nM (p&#60;0.05). After CFI-400945 treatment, the &#947;H2AX\/Hoechst 33342 staining intensity ratio was 0.40 in SK-UT-1 <i>BRAC2<\/i>-KO and 0.44 in <i>BRCA1<\/i>-KO, where both were higher than in the corresponding wild-type cell line with 0.29 (p&#60;0.05). Similarly, the intensities in the two SKN KO cell lines were 0.29 and 0.31, respectively, and higher than in the wild-type cell line with 0.19 (p &#60;0.05).<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: PLK4 inhibitor induced DNA double-strand breaks in LMS and the repair of these breakages was dependent on HR repair. In vitro, LMS with <i>BRCA1<\/i> or <i>BRCA2 <\/i>deficiencies were more sensitive to the effect of PLK4 inhibitor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e1d0f39-343a-44cc-8aa6-e1519e78143f\/@D03B8ZRk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: other,Sarcoma,DNA damage response,BRCA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17648"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tsz Yan Chong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Horace HY Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judy WP Yam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kin Long Chow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ho Shing Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ka Yu Tse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark R.

With the success of cancer genome project in bladder cancer, we aimed to discover novel cancer drivers in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), the most aggressive type of bladder cancer. A total of 155 genes were filtered out using RNAseq data from the TCGA cohort (n = 367), which are overexpressed (Z scores &#62; 2.0) in more than 5% patients and correlated with poor overall survivals by Cox regression (p-value &#60; 0.05) and FDR correction (q-value &#60; 0.05). Using a unique HD-MAC (high-dimensional analysis of molecular alterations in cancer) algorithm developed by our team, 25 genes were further selected which show statistical significances as independent prognosis biomarkers for shorter overall survivals. Through clinical association study (including tumor stage, lymph node invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis) by using CGDSR (Cancer Genomics Data Server in R), five most significant genes were further filtered which can be validated by another cohort (GSE13507). Although those genes show no direct gene-gene interactions, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed common pathways governed by those driver genes, including cancer-related signaling, glycome alterations for TME remodeling, regulation in cell death, glutamate &#38; neuronal signaling, and ER-Golgi transportation. The above findings can be also confirmed at the protein levels by IHC staining. In this study, how those key genes assist cell survival under nutrition crisis and their impacts on aggressive behaviors of bladder cancer will be discussed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/24a40564-b98d-44e7-8b85-d8c2880d1d3f\/@D03B8ZRk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Survival,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17651"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jim Jinn-Chyuan Sheu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo-Chen Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oscar Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chung Chang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Most patients presenting with advanced stage disease where their treatment goal is palliation, emphasizing the requirement for new treatment options. HCC is characterized by arterialization of its blood supply deemed pathognomonic for its development. We investigated the neoangiogenic peptide apelin as a driver of carcinogenesis in HCC followed by the efficacy of novel apelin antagonists as a therapeutic strategy <i>in-vitro<\/i>. Firstly, meta-analysis conducted through the TCGA database showed that apelin is significantly upregulated in liver cancer compared to healthy tissue and this correlated with a worse mean overall survival. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of patient serum samples corroborated that apelin concentration significantly increases from healthy liver to cirrhosis and then further through tumorigenesis. <i>In-vitro <\/i>studies across multiple hepatocyte cell lines in media conditioned with elevated serum apelin levels were then performed to investigate the effects of increased apelin. All cell-lines demonstrated an increase in migration and proliferative properties with naturally higher basal apelin expressing cell lines showing the most significant changes. Using knockdown models, we elucidated hypoxia a well-known driver of angiogenesis, up-regulates apelin expression through a HIF-1&#945; dependent mechanism. Furthermore, increased apelin expression resulted in upregulation of its G-protein coupled receptor, APJ which initiates its downstream signaling pathways, together referred to as apelinergic signaling, demonstrating an autocrine loop. Co-culture of hepatocytes with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), activated in cirrhosis, further elucidated a paracrine signaling loop whereby secreted chemokines from HSCs, which including apelin, enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and migration. Assessing apelin as a therapeutic target, several novel antagonists were designed <i>in-silico<\/i> and investigated across multiple hepatocyte cell lines. MM315 showed the most promise with significant cytostatic properties at nanomolar levels coupled with a high binding affinity to APJ at picomolar levels demonstrated through blocking studies. As HCC is a highly vascularized cancer, we explored the likely effects of these antagonists on endothelial cells, cultured in the presence of IC<sub>50<\/sub> concentrations of each antagonist. MM315 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of abnormal blood vessel formation. Overall, our results suggest inhibiting apelinergic signaling is a promising therapeutic treatment for HCC, with MM315 being a lead compound. <i>In-vivo <\/i>work which will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0222da04-3e97-43a3-a7fe-1940ba586888\/@D03B8ZRk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Apelin,Angiogenesis,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17652"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jamie Beaumont<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Aboagye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beata Wojciak-Stothard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gilberto Serrano-De-Almeida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Glen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rohini Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the early response to chemotherapy, high incidence of recurrence leads to short overall survival and poor prognosis. Native hyaluronic acid (HA) interacts with CD44 and receptors for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM) overexpressed in TNBC mediating chemo-resistance and metastasis. In contrast, oligomeric HA (oHA) can disrupt HA-CD44\/RHAMM interactions and attenuate oncogenic and pro-metastatic pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase\/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (MAPK\/ERK) pathway, reducing downstream DNA repair and drug resistance markers. Our previous work demonstrated that oHA can exert synergistic anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects when combined with doxorubicin (DOX) and co-loaded in an integrin-targeted iRGD-modified nanoparticle system (iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLNs). This study aims to investigate the inhibitory effect of iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLNs on both DNA single-strand break (SSB) and double-strand break (DSB) repair proteins and drug efflux pumps responsible for multidrug resistance to enhance DOX efficacy in breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) mutant and non-mutant TNBC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The cytotoxicity of DOX, oHA and their combinations in free solution or in nanoparticles was evaluated by clonogenic assay in human MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN and MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1 mutant) TNBC cells. The <i>in vitro<\/i> expression of a DNA DSB marker, DNA repair markers, and drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were measured by Western blot. The <i>in vivo<\/i> expression level of BRCA1 and Rad51 in an orthotopic TNBC mouse model was determined by immunohistochemical staining.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The combination of DOX-oHA showed synergism against both BRCA1 mutant and non-mutant TNBC cells. The iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLNs induced great increases in DNA DSBs demonstrated by the highest &#947;H2AX level compared to other treatment groups. These nanoparticles also showed inhibitory effects on the expression of both DNA SSB repair protein (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) and DNA DSB repair proteins (Rad50 and Rad51), contributing to the enhanced efficacy of chemotherapy. The immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissues indicated lower levels of BRCA1 and Rad51 after iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLN treatment than the formulation without oHA, attributable to the effect of intracellularly delivered oHA on limiting the MAPK signaling. Additionally, iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLNs reduced the expression of the drug efflux pump P-gp as compared to DOX treatment groups without oHA.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The co-delivery of oHA and DOX in the iRGD-DOX-oHA-PLNs efficiently blocked DNA damage repair and down-regulated the drug efflux pump P-gp, thus improving the efficacy of DOX. Collectively, this nanoparticle system could be a promising option for metastatic TNBC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/42db11f0-5624-4142-b4f1-8e286ab0e787\/@D03B8ZRk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-04 Modulation of DNA repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair inhibition,Hyaluronan,Nanoparticle,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17653"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"c08ffe42-53bd-4772-bcfc-dc8c9e4ce413","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c08ffe42-53bd-4772-bcfc-dc8c9e4ce413\/@D03B8ZRk\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pei Zhi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ibrahim Alradwan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>HoYin Lip<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdulmutalib Zetrini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunsheng He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffery Henderson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Michael Rauth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiao Yu Wu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Common with these cancers is peritumoral edema, termed tumor tails, which our group has found could contain satellite tumor cells. A precise and accurate method of determining the presence of satellite tumor cells in this region is required to improve surgical planning, as the standard morphology-based technique is prone to misclassification. An emerging technology is targeted gene sequencing (t-NGS), a combination of whole genome or exome sequencing (WGS\/WXS) comparing primary tumor and patient-matched blood, and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). The objective of this study was to determine the viability of t-NGS in the detection of satellite tumor cells in the areas of edema surrounding MFS and UPS. A cohort of patients diagnosed with extremity MFS and UPS at Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, Canada) who underwent resection were retrospectively studied. Cases with available WGS\/WXS data were used (n=8) to identify case-specific tumor-specific variants (TSV) to detect with the QX200 ddPCR platform. (n=4-5\/case). Cases with a major TSV-positive droplet population in the tumor tails tissue indicated the presence of satellite tumor cells. Our quality analysis showed DNA above the ddPCR threshold of detection was extracted from the tumor tails of 6 of 8 cases. The ddPCR assay showed that a TSV-positive droplet population was detected within the tumor tails in 5 of 6 cases, while 1 of 6 cases showed no such population in the tumor tails. Overall, our results indicates that t-NGS has potential for TSV detection within tumor tails. A prospective study is underway to further test its validity and compare it with standard histology. The project aims to improve surgical planning by ensuring removal of satellite tumor cells while lowering the risk of wound complications.<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{CE2D05F1-E8C9-420E-94DC-2D6B5BCA437B}\"><caption>Targeted gene-sequencing results of all cases within this study<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Case #<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Histology<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pre-op Radiation<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DNA Extraction Successful<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TSV Probes (n)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TSV+ Tumor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TSV+ Tails<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TSV+ Normal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y* (normal insufficient)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">UPS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">UPS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Y<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9767c066-2bd2-4331-a418-848f7136bae0\/@D03B8ZRk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Droplet digital PCR,Recurrence,Surgical resection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17654"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Miguel Alfonso V.

OS was mostly found at sites of bone growth. Sixty percent OS cases happen at knee, 15% around hip, 10% shoulder and 8% jaw. Non-stop osteoclast cells differentiation by which osteoblasts secrete RANKL bind to RANK receptor on osteoclasts&#8217; cell surface, stimulate rapid bone metabolism and considerable as an important signaling pathway correlate with OS progression.<br \/>Depressant is usually occurring in cancer patients. Several reports suggested that several anti-depressant drugs presented anti-tumour potential. Previous study has reported, fluoxetine, a prescription antidepressant can inactivate NF-&#954;B and thus suppress hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer progression. Furthermore, fluoxetine may inhibit DNA repair in non-small cell lung cancer.<br \/>In our study, the MTT assay demonstrated fluoxetine significantly reduced viability of U-2 OS cells. Next, target protein RANK\/RANKL expression were also downregulated by fluoxetine in dose dependent manner. Besides, STAT3 mediated NF-&#954;B activity, were also inactivated by fluoxetine. Additionally, the expression of PARP1 (DNA damage related, and several oncogenes such as XIAP and Cyclin D1 were also downregulated by fluoxetine in dose dependent manner. Moreover, the inhibition of tumour angiogenesis by fluoxetine has also proven by using aorta ring assay. Further <i>in vivo<\/i> experiment may need to be performed to identify anti-tumor efficacy of fluoxetine.<br \/>In sum, fluoxetine can be used anti-tumour adjuvant of OS therapy and the detailed mechanism or further combination strategy may be worth exploring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a05fbfb-1d22-485f-80b7-d039eda78b69\/@D03B8ZRk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,STAT3,NF-&#954;B,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17655"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peggy Tan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei-Ting Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>I-Tsang Chiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Chang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Several factors should be put into account which influencing the treatment strategy for patients with mCRC. including tumor resectability, prior systemic therapy; tumor location (left or right), and molecular characteristics such as mutation in gene Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS). It has been demonstrated to be a tightly associated with poor response to anti-EGFR treatment, and even poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with colorectal cancer. Therefore, KRAS mutational status testing has been highlighted in recent years. Methods This study queried the data from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues of 2,294 CRC patients which underwent a targeted next-generation sequencing assay performed by 3DMed Clinical Laboratory Inc., a College of American Pathologists (CAP) certified and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory of 3D Medicines Inc. between January, 2017 and June, 2020 in China, to obtain a comprehensive molecular profile of KRAS mutations. Co-occurring genomic alterations, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status and PD-L1 expression (Dako 22C3 or VentanaSP263, TPS score) were analyzed. High TMB was defined as TMB &#8805;10 muts\/Mb. Postoperative follow-up data for 27 patients were collected and analyzed. Results KRAS mutation account for 48.7% Chinese CRC patients. In addition, proportions of KRAS mutation in different exons were counted. KRAS mutation in CRC mainly occurred in exon2 (84.0%), exon3 (6.1%), exon4 (7.4%), and exon5 (0.7%). KRAS mutation in exon2, the main mutations were G12D (35.4%), G12V (20.8%), G13D (21.9%), G12C (5.9%) ad G12S (5.8%). while in exon3 and exon4, the main mutations were Q61H (50.7%) and A146T (73.2%), respectively. The proportion of MSI-H in CRC patients with and without KRAS mutation were very close. While it seemed that there were more MSI-H patients in KRAS exon3 and exon4 mutation. In addition, PD-L1 expression was detected in 1220 tumor samples by means of IHC. Among these available tumor samples, level of PD-L1expression were similar among patients without KRAS mutation, KRAS mutation in different exons, but it reveled that there were very small part of patient with strong positive PD-L1 level (TPS&#8805;50). In addition, different prognosis were found among different mutations of KRAS exon2, in detail, worse PFS was showed in CRC patients with KRAS mutation in exon2 G12D than G12V and G13D.

The expression of Cathepsin D is regulated by steroid hormones including oestrogen and growth factors. There are conflicting results between different studies regarding Cathepsin D significance as prognostic and predictor marker in breast cancer. Furthermore, Cathepsin D has not been recommended for clinical use by the American Society of Clinical Oncology because of insufficient evidence. This study was aimed to fill the gap in the lack of recent and large studies on prognostic significance of Cathepsin D expression by studying a large well-characterized series of primary breast cancer for cathepsin D expression using immunohistochemistry.<br \/>Methods: Expression of Cathepsin D was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays, in a large well-characterized series of early-stage operable breast cancer (n=954) from Nottingham Primary Breast Carcinoma Series between the period of 1988 and 1998 who underwent primary surgery. Correlation of cathepsin D expression with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis was evaluated.<br \/>Results: Cathepsin D expression was positive in 28.8% (275\/954) of breast cancer tumors. Positive expression of cathepsin D was significantly associated with high histological grade (p=0.007), pleomorphism (p=0.002), poor Nottingham Prognostic Index score (NPI) (p&#60;0.002), recurrence (p=0.005) and distant metastasis (p&#60;0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that Cathepsin D expression was significantly associated with shorter breast cancer specific survival (<i>BCSS)<\/i> (p=0.001), higher risk of recurrence (p=0.001) and distant metastasis (p&#60;0.0001). Cathepsin D positive tumors with ER positive staining who were treated with tamoxifen were associated with lower <i>BCSS<\/i> and higher risk of developing distant metastasis (p=0.001).<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>This study shows Cathepsin D expression as a promising prognostic biomarker for early operable invasive breast cancer. Our results indicate that Cathepsin D expressing tumors are associated with shorter breast cancer specific survival and higher risk of recurrence and metastasis. Cathepsin D could be clinically useful to predict response to tamoxifen treatment. Targeting Cathepsin D either through inhibition of action or interference with the proteolytic pathway could be used to treat metastatic breast cancers expressing Cathepsin D.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a7051d85-6934-4829-818c-30ff38e56ba2\/@v03B8ZRm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunohistochemistry,Prognostic markers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17659"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Inas M.

Multiple studies have shown that progression of TNBC depends on more than one signalling pathways, suggesting that the therapies with multi-targeted anti-cancer agents will offer improved therapeutic benefit through synergistic effects in inhibiting cancer growth. Dual-targeted inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) have emerged as promising cancer therapy candidates. However, poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability limited their efficacy in cancer and accordingly, improved delivery systems are needed. The present studies have investigated the encapsulation of PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6 dual inhibitor into hybrid block co-polymers (polylactic acid-methoxy polyethylene glycol; polylactic acid-polyethylene glycol-polypropylene glycol-polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid) (HSB-510) as a delivery system to target PI3-K&#948; and HDAC6 pathways in TNBC cells. The prepared HSB-510 Quatramer nano-formulation showed an average diameter of 96 &#177;3 nm, the zeta potential of -17&#177;2 mV, and PDI of &#706;0.1 with a slow and sustained release profile of PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6 inhibitors in a non-physiological buffer. In vitro studies with HSB-510 have demonstrated substantial growth inhibition of TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-468, SUM-149 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) as well as downregulation of phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK and c-MYC levels. Importantly, bi-weekly treatment of BALB\/c wild-type mice harbouring EAC cells (syngeneic mouse model) with HSB-510 at a dose of 25 mg\/kg resulted in significant (76%) tumor growth inhibition (TGI). The treatment with HSB-510 was without any significant effect on the body weights of the mice. These results demonstrate that a novel Quatramer nano-formulation of a novel PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6 dual inhibitor (HSB-510) represents an approach for successful targeting of TNBC and potentially other cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2ce48b1-ca41-47c2-8e19-23e0760de062\/@v03B8ZRm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Breast cancer,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),HDAC inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18596"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sachchidanand Tiwari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suiyang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammad Anees<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neha Mehrotra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashish Thakur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Tawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gurmit Grewal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard M.

Traditional chemotherapy is still the main stream strategy in treatment of EAC patients. However, chemo-resistance usually develops that finally leads to failure of treatments. NFE2&#8209;related factor 2 (NRF2) is the master regulator of cellular anti-oxidant properties that maintains cell viability and cellular homeostasis. Overexpression of NRF2 in human cancers are associated with drug-resistance and poor prognosis.<br \/>Methods and Results: NRF2 protein levels are higher in several EAC cell lines, as compared to BE cell lines (CPA, BAR10T) and normal esophageal squamous cell lines, using Western blot analysis. We confirmed NRF2 overexpression in primary EAC samples, using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray that contained 76 EACs. Brusatol is an NRF2 specific inhibitor originated from natural plant. Administration of Brusatol in EAC cells significantly inhibited NRF2 ARE luciferase activity and reduced gene expression of NRF2 target genes such as <i>GR, HO1, GSTM2, GPX3 <\/i>and <i>GPX4<\/i>, resulting in a significant increase in cellular ROS levels, which were further increased by treatment with CDDP with subsequent increase in cancer cell death. Further investigation revealed that Brusatol significantly increased lipid peroxidation levels as detected by immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry and resulted in significant ferroptosis, in particular in combination with CDDP treatments. We confirmed that Brusatol in combination with CDDP significantly suppressed tumor growth in a xenografting mice model.<br \/>Conclusion: Constitutive overexpression of NRF2 in EAC cells favors tumor cell survival and drug resistance. NRF2 specific inhibitor may synergize with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs by inducing lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in EAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f8022ae7-7e98-45fa-b888-726d68def57b\/@v03B8ZRm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Nrf2,Cell death,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18597"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dunfa Peng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tianling Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heng Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shoumin Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wael El-Rifai<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, most HGSOC ultimately develops resistance to PARPi, leading to unmet medical needs for better therapeutic strategies. ATR-mediated G2\/M cell cycle checkpoints are important for cell survival and DNA repair, especially in HGSOC due to its dysfunctional p53-mediated G1\/S checkpoint, making them an attractive therapeutic target. However, only modest monotherapy activity of ATR inhibitors (ATRis) has been reported in patients with HGSOC, highlighting the need for combination treatment. We conducted a high-throughput drug combination screen of ATRi (ceralasertib) with 1,912 drugs in two<i> <\/i>PARPi-resistant <i>BRCA2<\/i>-mutant PEO1 (PEO1\/OlaR and PEO1\/OlaJR) HGSOC cell lines. In this screen, 234 drugs showed synergistic cytotoxicity with ATRi, including 31 (13.2%) cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors, 27 (11.5%) chemotherapeutic drugs, and 13 (5.6%) PI3K\/AKT pathway inhibitors. We prioritized the PI3K\/AKT pathway inhibitors for ATRi combination because the PI3K\/AKT pathway is upregulated in &#62;70% of HGSOC and associated with an aggressive phenotype. Moreover, PI3K\/AKT signaling is found to be activated in HGSOC cells with PARPi resistance. We separately validated that an ATRi (ceralasertib &#60; 1 &#956;M) in combination with an AKT inhibitor (AKTi; capivasertib &#60; 10 &#956;M) yielded additive\/synergistic cytotoxic effects (combination index &#60; 1) in various HGSOC cell lines, including acquired and de novo PARPi-resistant (PEO1\/OlaR, PEO1\/OlaJR, and PEO4) and platinum-resistant HGSOC cell lines (OVCAR3), by XTT and colony formation assays. With clinically attainable concentrations of ATRi (1 &#956;M) and AKTi (10 &#956;M), the combination treatment increased cell apoptosis compared to ATRi (increased 2.1 to 95.2-fold; P &#60; 0.001) or AKTi alone (increased 3.3 to 92.2-fold; P &#60; 0.001) in both PARPi-sensitive and -resistant HGSOC cells. ATRi+AKTi treatment also showed greater DNA damage as evidenced by increased percentage of cells with &#8805; 5 &#947;H2AX foci relative to ATRi (increased 1.1 to 7.6-fold; not significant in PEO1 and P &#60; 0.001 in PARPi-resistant cells) or AKTi (increased 2.3 to 6.2-fold; P &#60; 0.001) in both PARPi-sensitive and -resistant cells. Furthermore, ATRi+AKTi treatment augmented replication stress as measured by increased phospho-RPA+\/&#947;H2AX+ populations compared with ATRi (increased 1.7 to 4.7-fold; <i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.001) or AKTi (increased 3.7 to 12.0-fold; P &#60; 0.001). Overall, our results suggest that dual inhibition of ATR and AKT pathways results in greater cell death by increasing DNA damage and replication stress in HGSOC cells with PARPi resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2bcc9b05-1b9b-49ca-8f0e-b09142ee66b3\/@v03B8ZRm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,ATR inhibitor,AKT inhibitor,Replication stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18598"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tzu-Ting Huang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Yuan Chiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nitasha Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelli Wilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken Chih-Chien Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung-Min Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.

Nutrient-sensitive mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis through the downstream substrate, 4EBP1 (also called EIF4EBP1), p70S6K1, and p70S6K2. On the other hand, growth factor-sensitive mTORC2 is associated with Rapamycin-insensitivity. The presence of stem cells within the tumor mass and the surrounding areas precludes the possibility of the elimination of GB. Furthermore, the substrate of activated AKT, the proline-rich AKT substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40), is a surrogate marker of activated AKT in response to mTOR inhibition therapy in GB patients that regulates mTORC1. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of first (Rapamycin (RAPA)), second (Torin1, Torin2, and XL388), and third (Rapalink-1) mTOR inhibitors to suppress cell growth, dissemination, overcome drug resistance of GB cells, and alter self-renewal properties of GB stem cells. Results demonstrated: a significant number of tumors showed an increased expression of pAKT<sup>Ser473<\/sup> and pmTOR<sup>Ser2448<\/sup>, suggesting an overactivation of the mTOR pathway; co-expression of mTOR and stem cell marker, nestin, was evident in GB tumors, implying its role in stem cell regulation; Torin2, but not Torin1 or XL388, suppressed mTORC1 activity completely as shown by the reduced expression of its pS6K<sup>Ser235\/236<\/sup> in a dose-dependent manner; Torin1, Torin2, and XL388 inhibited the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and PRAS40; Torin1, Torin2, and XL388 suppressed dephosphorylation of pAKT<sup>Ser473<\/sup>; functional analysis revealed that RAPA, Torin1, Torin2, XL388, and Rapalink-1 effectively suppressed proliferation and S-phase entry; RAPA, Torin1, Torin2 and Rapalink-1 inhibited GB cell migration, while XL388 was ineffective; RAPA, Torin1, Torin2, and Rapalink-1 suppressed the self-renewal of GB stem cells and inhibited their proliferation, XL388 remained ineffective; drug resistance analysis revealed that Torin2 was most effective in eradicating GB tumor cells. These results suggested that RAPA, Torin1, Torin2, and Rapalink-1, but not XL388, are useful in suppressing the mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, thereby inhibiting GB cell proliferation, dissemination, and inhibiting stem cell self-renewal. Therefore, the use of these mTOR inhibitors presents a promising treatment strategy for Glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b603882c-33e9-41ed-877a-2652a081eacd\/@v03B8ZRm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,Glioblastoma,Therapeutics,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18600"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jose F.

Here we performed a comprehensive analysis on TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) treatment data over 22 cancer types, to explore the efficacy of cancer treatments, the recurrent rates of each cancer type, and their associated underlying molecular mechanism.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> TCGA treatment data for 22 cancer types was downloaded from TCGA data portal, and processed. Treatment response rate and recurrent rate across different cancer types were compared. Survival analysis was performed between patients who achieved complete response after first course of treatment (CRAFCT) with those who did not. RNAseq data analyses were further performed to identify significant genes associated with CRAFCT vs without CRAFCT to find the underlying molecular reasons of treatment efficacy.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Treatment responses after first course of treatment were compared for 22 cancer types. Cancer types were classified based on the rate of CRAFCT into 3 categories: high (&#62;80%), median (50%-80%), and low (&#60;50%); There were 12 cancer types with high complete response rate, 8 with median complete response rate, and 2 with low complete response rate. Cancer recurrent rates were further classified as high (&#62;25%), median (10%-25%), and low (&#60;10%) to check how the complete response rates affect the recurrent rate. After achieving CRAFCT, we found that cancers having high response rate can have low, median and high recurrent rate, while cancers having median or low response rate can have median and high recurrent rate. Patients who achieved CRAFCT had a much better overall survival than patients who didn&#8217;t across all 22 cancer types. Significantly expressed genes associated with treatment efficacy were identified and compared across 18 out of 22 cancer types. 6 genes were shared over 4 cancer types, 87 genes were shared over 3 cancer types. Finally, gene and cancer type networks were constructed to demonstrate the connections of cancer types, genes, and relationships of cancer types and genes.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Cancer treatment therapy and therapy regimens were either cancer-specific or shared across cancer types; different cancer types had different treatment response rate which might result in different cancer recurrent rate; treatment related gene-cancer networks were constructed across cancer types which could be targeted for clinical and therapeutic applications to drive new drug development for multiple cancer types.<br \/>The contents of this publication are the sole responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions or policies of the USUHS, HJF, the DoD or the Departments of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.

A series of HER3 mutations identified in breast cancer patients (F94L, V104L, G284R, D297Y, T355I, and E928G) were introduced using lentiviral transduction and stable cell lines were generated in HER3KOHCC1569 cells via puromycin selection. We identified HER3V104L mutation to have higher cell proliferation and higher p-HER3 expression compared to wild-type (wt) and empty-vector (EV) HER3. We observed that HCC1569HER3KO cells stably expressing WT and V104L were sensitive to increasing doses of neratinib (0.1-0.5 &#181;M) concentration. Next we analyzed if this mutation rendered resistance to the recently FDA- approved irreversible HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tucatinib. Our data indicated that both that V104L cells were sensitive to higher concentration of tucatinib compared to neratinib. In parallel experiments, we utilized COS7 cells to examine the signaling properties of HER3V104L. Our data indicated that transient transfection of COS7 cells with HER3V104L mutant significantly induces p-HER3\/p-AKT and p-HER2 expression compared to WT HER3 in a ligand dependent manner. In addition, we observed that the V104L mutation stabilizes HER3 protein expression independent of HER2 and ligand stimulation. Experiments are ongoing to determine whether V104L induced HER3 stabilization and downstream signaling activation is dependent on HER3 binding partners including EGFR, HER2 or HER4. We also aim to understand how the V104L mutation stabilizes HER3 expression. Structural modeling of V104L mutation will provide insight about the mechanism of stabilization of the HER3 protein. We will use MCF10A and HEK293 cells to determine the effect of the V104L mutation on HER3 expression and downstream signaling. We also aim to decipher the signaling mechanism that drives the oncogenic potential of V104L mutation. In addition, we are using various PDXs with different HER3 mutations to determine other driver HER3 mutations in breast cancer and how this can be targeted in the clinic using HER targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/319af8e9-d2a4-42af-99dc-37bf2f40121e\/@v03B8ZRm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB3,Breast cancer,Mutations,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18602"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rosalin Mishra<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Kate Kilroy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hima Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samar Alanazi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joan T.

We further investigated whether CYP3A5 inhibition blocks PC cell growth independently of AR signaling. Initially, most PCs respond to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but eventually PC becomes castration resistant and does not respond to ADT. With very limited options available for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), there is an urgent need for the development of novel targeted therapies for this subtype of PC. Additionally, understanding the role of CYP3A5 as promoter of PC growth in African Americans (AA) is very relevant as AAs preferentially carry wild type CYP3A5 gene, often present with aggressive disease, and have higher mortality rate versus Caucasian (CA) patients, who typically express the mutant CYP3A5.<br \/>Method: We used MDAPCa2b PC cell line of AA origin carrying one copy of wild type CYP3A5 for our study. After inhibiting the CYP3A5 using siRNA pool of 3 siRNAs, we performed Illumina RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between non-target and CYP3A5 siRNA triplicate samples were identified using DESeq2, at a false discovery rate of adjusted p &#60; 0.05. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis was performed to identify the roles of the differentially expressed genes in regulating prostate cancer growth.<br \/>Results: We identified 1814 DEGs after inhibiting CYP3A5 using siRNA pool in MDAPCa2b cells, 825 of which increased or decreased expression greater than two-fold. The differentially down-regulated genes associate with several growth regulatory pathways: cell cycle progression (39), cellular senescence (16) DNA replication (18) and base excision repair (9). Additionally, we identified that CYP3A5 siRNA downregulates several genes which are dysregulated (including oncogenes and tumor suppressors) in different cancer type including RAS, c-Met, ERBB2, FGFR2, cyclin E, p53, Myc, PTEN, RAR&#946; and CDK2. The upregulated genes correspond to two pathways, retinol metabolism pathway (arrests proliferation) and steroid hormone biosynthesis. We also identified several unique genes which are down regulated with CYP3A5 siRNA treatment like Glo1, FoxM1 (often upregulated in several cancers) and Tk1 (marker for chemotherapy sensitivity).<br \/>Conclusion: CYP3A5 siRNA inhibits several genes involved in cell growth and proliferation. Targeting CYP3A5 represents a potential novel therapeutic approach, especially for AAs expressing wild type CYP3A5.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/799feae1-e2ed-4622-ba8e-45ddafe782ae\/@w03B8ZRn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"African American,CYP3A5,Cell cycle inhibition,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18604"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Richard L.

Aberrant GPC3 expression is implicated in tumorigenesis, and GPC3+ cancers are characterized by a highly immunosuppressive landscape which induces exhaustion in tumor-resident T cells. We sought to assess the validity of a GPC3 antibody clone in immunohistochemistry (IHC) and then measure GPC3+ prevalence in selected solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We evaluated GPC3 transcripts in human normal and tumor tissue specimens from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genome-Tissue Expression Project. GPC3 IHC was performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissues: hepatocellular (HCC), squamous cell lung (SCC), colorectal (CRC), serous ovarian (OC), Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC) and liposarcoma (LS) using antibody clone GC33 and scored using H-score (range 0-300), with appropriate positive and negative controls. Accuracy and precision of GPC3 antibody clone GC33 were tested in GPC3+ high prevalence tumor types compared to a validated anti-GPC3 clone (1G12). GPC3+ cutoff was set as H-score &#8805; 30 (GC33) compared to &#62;20 (1G12). The prevalence of GPC3 expression measured by IHC was also used to calculate the theoretical mRNA cutoff value from the TCGA data for GPC3+ indications represented in the database.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> GPC3 mRNA was expressed at low levels predominantly in lung, adipose, tibial nerve, kidney and breast. GPC3 IHC of normal tissue showed predominantly faint, cytoplasmic staining in a few tissues including heart, kidney and stomach and no expression in lung or breast. HCC, SCC, LS, CRC, and OC showed high and varying levels of GPC3 mRNA expression in TCGA samples. The theoretical mRNA expression cutoff value based on IHC were HCC=1396 RSEM, SCC= 2675 RSEM, Sarcoma= 4126 RSEM; and OC 4486 RSEM; respectively. A cutoff for CRC could not be determined because the prevalence of GPC3 by IHC was &#60;10%. GPC3 IHC using GC33 showed a higher prevalence of positive cases in myxoid\/round cell LS (MRCLS) relative to other LS subtypes (15\/45 vs. 8\/75). HCC (n=110), SCC (n=73), MRCLS (n=45), and MCC (n=20) had a prevalence of 69%, 33%, 33%, and 70%; respectively. However, &#60;10% of CRC (n=80) or OC (n=31) were GPC3+.

This paradigm shift in HER2 assessment in BC stems from substantial antitumor activity of potent antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting the HER2 receptor on the tumor cell membrane. Whether these tumors constitute a distinct pathological entity is a matter of debate.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures:<\/b> To dissect the biology of HER2low BCs we performed a high throughput mutational analysis coupled with gene expression profiling on 98 HER2low BCs [34 cases score 1+ (1), 15 cases score 2+ <i>HER2<\/i> not amplified (2N), 49 cases score 2+ with <i>HER2<\/i> copy numbers in the equivocal range (2E)], of which 89 were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, and 9 ER-negative. DNA and RNA were extracted and subjected to targeted DNA sequencing (Illumina TSO500 panel) and targeted gene expression analysis (NanoString BC360 panel). Mutation rates were compared with in silico data from 1317 samples of the MSK Breast Cancer cohort (PMID: 30205045).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The most frequently mutated genes were<b> <\/b><i>PIK3CA <\/i>(33\/98, 33%),<i> GATA3 <\/i>(18\/98, 18%),<i> TP53<\/i> (17\/98, 17%), <i>HER2<\/i> (8\/98, 8%, private to 2E cases). Tumor mutational burden mean values were significantly higher in score 1+ compared to score 2+ cases (p= 0.04), with a single score 1+ tumor harboring microsatellite instability (MSI). Mutational signatures 1, 5 and 13 (APOBEC) were the most prevalent, with signature 30 being private to HER2 score 1+ cases. Comparative statistics revealed mutational drift of HER2low BCs from both HER2 negative (19 differentially mutated genes) and HER2 positive BCs (11 differentially mutated genes). Potentially actionable genetic alterations (OncoKB classes) accounted for 43 SNVs (predominantly <i>HER2<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations) and 17 CNVs (e.g. <i>MET<\/i> amplification and <i>PTEN<\/i> homozygous deletions), including a MSI tumor, distributed over 47 independent patients.Subgroup stratifications based on gene expression were observed when considering genes involved in angiogenesis, stromal marker and cytokines signalling.

However, rare CRC lesions may show a heterogeneous pattern of MMR protein expression. We aimed to evaluate the molecular effect of a heterogeneous expression of the MMR proteins in a complex context of concomitant loss of one of the other effectors of the DNA repair mechanism.<b><\/b><b> <\/b><br \/><b>Experimental procedures: <\/b>We evaluated MMR protein expression (by immunohistochemistry -IHC- for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) in 200 CRCs, identifying 3 groups with proficient (MMRp), deficient (MMRd) and heterogeneous (MMRh) MMR. MMRh tumors were micro-dissected based on the expression of the heterogeneous marker, DNA was extracted and subjected to targeted sequencing (TSO500 panel, Illumina). RNA was purified from bulk tumors of all MMRh cases and in a control series of 10 MMRp and 10 MMRd CRCs and analyzed using the IO360 panel (NanoString). The degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was calculated on H&#38;E slides and on IHC sections stained with antibodies raised against CD8.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Twenty-nine out of 200 cases were MMRd (14.5%). Nine cases (4.5%) showed a heterogeneous pattern of MMR expression, with 6 tumors harboring concomitant loss of one of the other MMR proteins, resulting in a microsatellite instable (MSI) phenotype. Five out of the 9 cases were suitable for separate mutational analysis of IHC-positive and IHC-(double)negative components of the tumor. Both components of all the lesions exhibited a high tumor mutation burden (mean TMB: 59 mut\/Mb) in line with the MSI status, nevertheless a significant increase in TMB in the double-negative components was observed (mean TMB: neg. 67 mut\/Mb vs pos. 53 mut\/Mb), due to a higher number of sub-clonal, non-synonymous variants compared to the positive component. Comparative gene expression analyses between MMRd, MMRp and MMRh CRCs highlighted differential gene expression patterns, with MMRh tumors displaying a strong activation of angiogenesis, MAPK and PI3K-AKT axes. Moreover, these tumors showed the highest number of TILs, characterized by a substantial population of exhausted CD8+ lymphocytes.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We describe a unique subgroup of CRCs showing heterogeneous expression of MMR proteins, in a background of concomitant loss of one of the other markers. This heterogeneity is associated with i) an increase of TMB and of unstable loci in the negative component, with additional markedly sub-clonal variants, ii) a high number of TILs, mostly exhausted CD8+ lymphocytes, and iii) a differential activation of signaling pathways. Taken together these data provide indirect evidence that heterogeneous loss of MMR proteins may impact on the biology of CRCs.

Mechanistic dissection was performed using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, western blotting, DNA fiber assay, RT-qPCR, and dot blot to evaluate markers of DNA damage response, replication stress and cell-autonomous innate immune signaling.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The drug screen identified that JN1 cells were particularly sensitive to one ATR inhibitor (ATRi) and multiple PARPi inhibitors (PARPi), which scored #6, 7, 9 and 20 of the hits. Sensitivity to ATRi was revalidated in the JN1 and R cell lines, whereas sensitivity to PARPi was only revalidated in the JN1 cell line - consistent with the very low PARP1 expression in that cell line. Sensitivity to ATRi and PARPi was partially reversed upon EWS-WT1 silencing. Combination experiments revealed that both drugs were synergistic in the JN1 cell line. Exposure to PARP inhibitor increased the number of &#947;H2AX and RAD51 foci, suggesting that JN1 cells were not deficient in homologous recombination. Further, PARPi or ATRi exposure decreased replication fork speed and increased R-loops accumulation, whereas EWS-WT1 silencing increased replication fork speed. Resistance to PARPi and to ATRi was restored upon exogenous expression of the R-loop resolution enzyme RNAseH1. The combination of PARPi and ATRi also induced micronuclei formation and activated the cGAS-STING cytosolic innate immune sensing pathway, together with increased expression of CCL5, CXCL10 and PD-L1.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>DSRCT cells are sensitive to ATR and PARP inhibitors, through a mechanism that, at least in part, may involve enhanced replication stress and increased R-loop formation. Our data provide the preclinical rationale for assessing ATRi combined with PARPi in patients with DSRCT, as a cytotoxic therapy or as an immunomodulatory approach to enhance cell-autonomous immunogenicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2f34368-5e3a-4cf5-b06a-12f3946e0683\/@w03B8ZRn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 DNA damage response ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug-discovery screen,DNA replication,DNA repair inhibition,Immunocytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21064"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Asuka KAWAI-KAWACHI<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madison LENORMAND<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clémence HENON<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas EYCHENNE<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leo COLMET-DAAGE<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas DORVAULT<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marlene GARRIDO<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clémence ASTIER<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carine NGO<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen PEMBERTON<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aditi GULATI<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen PETTITT<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roman CHABANON<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher J LORD<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie POSTEL-VINAY<\/i><\/presenter>.

This study aimed to investigate the expression levels of SP and NK1R in hormone receptor negative (HR -ve) versus positive (HR +ve) breast cancer tissues and their relationship with clinicopathological characteristics of patients, Ki-67 index, and overall survival rate.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Immunohistochemical expression levels of SP, NK1R and Ki-67 were measured in 144 paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues (77 HR -ve and 67 HR +ve). SP and NK1R were scored semiquantitatively, while Ki-67 was obtained by the percentage of total number of tumor cells with nuclear staining. The optimal cutoff value for SP, NK1R and Ki-67 were assessed by Cutoff Finder. Pearson Chi-square (&#967;<sup>2<\/sup>) and Fisher&#8217;s exact tests were used to compare the staining scores between groups. ANOVA and student&#8217;s t-test were used to compare group means. Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test was used for survival analysis.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: High expression of SP, NK1R and Ki-67 was observed in 41%, 36.8% and 38.9% of cases, respectively. Association analyses revealed that SP expression in HR -ve breast cancer was higher in pN3 tumors (p=0.002), positive axillary lymph node metastasis (p=0.003), and high NK1R expression (p=0.010). In HR+ve breast cancer, SP was lower in HER2 positive tumors (p=0.001). Regarding NK1R, the association analysis showed that low NK1R expression level in HR +ve tumors was related to stage IV (p=0.023), pN1 (p=0.006), and low Ki-67 index (p=0.038). Survival analysis revealed that high SP level negatively impacted overall survival in HR-ve tumors that had low NK1R level (p=0.021). Moreover, high SP negatively impacted overall survival in HR-ve tumors that had low Ki-67 level (p=0.005). Nevertheless, NK1R expression did not impact survival in HR-ve or HR+ve cases despite stratification by SP and Ki-67 expression (p&#62;0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Up to our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the prognostic potential of SP and NK1R in breast cancer. Combined expression levels of SP and NK1R or Ki-67 could be used to predict survival in breast cancer patients with HR-ve tumors. Our findings suggest the potential role of SP and NK1R as therapeutic targets in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ab08bd9-41b9-40e6-9976-574b6df92632\/@w03B8ZRn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Prognostic markers,Hormone receptors,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21716"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maha S.

They can lead to skeletal deformity, pain, loss of motion and neurovascular compression. Occasionally, malignant degeneration can occur. OC is thought to arise by mysregulation of chondrogenesis or chondrocyte differentiation, leading to ectopic cartilage formation. OC can occur as a solitary or multiple OC (MO). MO can occur from a hereditary cancer syndrome in which <i>EXT1<\/i> and <i>EXT2<\/i> are the major causative genes. Currently, treatment is limited to surgical resection only. There are no available FDA-approved therapies for MO. Previous translational research suggested that retinoic acid nuclear receptor gamma agonist (RAR&#947;) suppresses ectopic cartilage formation including OC in rodent models. These preclinical studies led to a clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of Palovarotene, a RAR&#947; agonist, for the systemic treatment of MO (NCT03442985). The clinical trial was terminated due to concerns of skeletal toxicity observed in pediatric patients. To overcome this adverse action, we should elucidate the molecular action of RAR&#947; agonists on osteochondromas and refine the treatment regimen. The purposes of our study are to examine the mechanism in which RAR&#947; elicits osteochondroma growth and to determine whether the responsiveness to RAR&#947; agonists is different between OC and growth plate. Treatment of RAR&#947; agonists on mouse chondrocytes stimulated cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In addition, human OC explants treated with RAR&#947; agonists contained more apoptotic cells than vehicle-treated OC explants. OCs were induced in <i>AcanCreER; Ext1e2neofl\/e2neofl MO mouse model<\/i> via tamoxifen induction at P5. After two weeks, mice were treated with Palovarotene (1.76 mg\/Kg) or corn oil, and 24hrs after treatment, forelimbs were harvested. In-situ hybridization analysis revealed that Palovarotene-treated OC had much more transcripts of <i>Cyp26b1 <\/i>(retinoid target gene) as compared with the corn oil-treated OC and that OCs had significantly higher response to Palovarotene compared to the adjacent growth plate. When Palovarotene (1.76 mg\/Kg, daily) treatment continued for 2 weeks, OC development was greatly suppressed compared to vehicle control in the wrists and ribs as determined by histological staining and radiological assessments, whereas the Palovarotene-treated growth plate did not show histological abnormality. Together, these findings indicate that OC have higher sensitivity to RAR&#947; agonist compared to the growth plate and RAR&#947; agonists rapidly inhibits OC development without a significant negative effect on growth plate and may exert anti-tumor function on OC by inducing cell death via apoptosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0772d86c-9060-46df-9ab6-2208ae28d20a\/@w03B8ZRn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Retinoids,Cell death,Bone,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20029"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sonia A.
