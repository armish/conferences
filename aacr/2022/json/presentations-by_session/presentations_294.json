[{"Abstract":"OncoKB, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&#8217;s (MSK) precision oncology knowledge base (<u>www.oncokb.org<\/u><u><\/u>), is a comprehensive database that annotates the oncogenic effects and clinical actionability of somatic alterations in cancer. OncoKB supports variant interpretation by the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and is used to annotate &#62;12,000 MSK patient sequencing reports annually. Since its introduction in 2016, OncoKB has expanded to include 5685 alterations in 682 genes, and in October 2021, it became the first somatic knowledge base to be partially recognized by the FDA. The scope of the OncoKB FDA recognition includes clinically actionable variants that map to an FDA level of evidence, the processes of variant curation, and policies regarding database oversight, personnel training and transparency of data sources and operations. This recognition credentials OncoKB as providing accurate, reliable and clinically meaningful information to the medical and scientific communities.<br \/>The OncoKB Therapeutic (Tx) Levels of Evidence categorize variants based on their tumor type-specific predictive value of sensitivity or resistance to matched standard care or investigational targeted therapies. To date, OncoKB includes 43 Level 1 genes (included in the FDA drug label), 23 Level 2 genes (included in professional guidelines), 25 Level 3A genes (predictive of drug response in well-powered clinical studies), 23 Level 4 genes (predictive of drug response based on compelling biological evidence), and 11 R1 or R2 resistance genes. Initially focused on solid tumors, OncoKB was expanded to include hematologic disease annotation in 2019 and introduced Diagnostic (Dx) and Prognostic (Px) levels of evidence. All three level of evidence systems (Tx, Dx and Px) are consistent with the guidelines for evidence-based categorization of somatic variants published as a joint consensus recommendation by AMP\/ASCO\/CAP.<br \/>OncoKB is governed by a Clinical Genomics Annotation Committee, composed of MSK physicians and scientists who ensure that the information captured is accurate and current, and an external advisory board composed of leaders in the clinical oncology and genomics communities who oversee OncoKB updates and progress. OncoKB curation rules and processes are transparent and documented in the OncoKB Curation Standard Operating Procedure, which is publicly available via the website. User feedback to OncoKB content is encouraged via the website and through cBioPortal. Queries or suggestions by OncoKB users are addressed by the OncoKB team within 72 hours.<br \/>OncoKB offers licenses for academic, commercial and hospital use, with which users can programmatically access the web API. Future work includes coverage of additional cancer-associated genes, annotation of germline alterations that are predictive of drug response and\/or associated with increased heritable cancer risk and the development of a clinical trial matching system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/282bfc14-d788-4aa7-be5e-6d1e8c87402b\/@t03B8ZAg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Databases,Molecular targets,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15708"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah P.

The distributed and heterogenous nature of information about these model systems makes it difficult for researchers to integrate and interpret the information to determine the state of the field and to identify the most relevant models for basic and preclinical research. The Mouse Models of Human Cancer database (<u>http:\/\/tumor.informatics.jax.org<\/u><u><\/u>) is an expertly curated knowledgebase about genetically defined mouse strains and Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models of human cancer. Data in MMHCdb are obtained from peer-reviewed scientific publications and direct data submissions from individual investigators and large-scale programs. MMHCdb is built on FAIR data management principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The enforcement of metadata standards and official gene, allele and strain nomenclature ensure accurate and comprehensive search results for cancer models. MMHCdb has long represented data from spontaneous or endogenously induced tumors from genetically defined mice and for PDXs which have been the foundation of basic cancer research and preclinical studies for decades. MMHCdb has expanded to include cancer models such as Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice which are ideally suited for research into the relationship of genetic variation with cancer susceptibility and for modeling the genetics of variability in treatment responses. The MMHCdb contains over 109,266 curated tumor frequency records for over 8,275 mouse strains. Tumor types in the database have been indexed to over 21,000 literature citations. PDX models and data available in MMHCdb are also accessible from the Patient Derived Cancer Models resource at EMBL-EBI which currently provides information for over 4,000 PDXs (<u>https:\/\/cancermodels.org<\/u><u><\/u>).MMHCdb is supported by NCI R01 CA089713 &nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5005c682-201a-4606-9d72-a60a24e18ff1\/@t03B8ZAg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Databases,Genetic factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15709"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Dale A.

We will report on progress and plans of the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Somatic Cancer Clinical Domain Working Group (CDWG). The CDWG membership consists of over 150 multi-disciplinary experts in cancer biology, oncology, pathology, genetics, genomics and informatics. The mission of the ClinGen Somatic Cancer CDWG is to facilitate the development of data curation guidelines and standards to determine the clinical significance of somatic alterations in cancer, thereby enhancing the usability, dissemination and implementation of cancer somatic changes in the ClinGen resource and other knowledgebases including CIViC, ClinVar, and the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) MetaKB. Our goal is to create high-quality assertions of the clinical significance of specific somatic variants in cancer by leveraging the CIViC curation interface, adapting the germline procedures of ClinGen to somatic variant interpretation, and implementing the interoperability standards of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). The ClinGen Somatic effort is overseen by the Somatic CDWG and reports progress to the overall ClinGen consortium. There are Somatic Cancer subdomains focused on particular clinically important domains of cancer variant interpretation including three Task Forces (covering Pediatric Cancer, Hematologic Cancer, and Solid Tumors) and a growing number of Somatic Cancer Variant Curation Expert Panels (SC-VCEPs). To improve quality and consistency of clinical interpretations, each candidate somatic cancer VCEP must complete a four step approval process adapted from ClinGen&#8217;s work in Germline disease domains. The Somatic CDWG works to ensure that each group is aware of available training materials and detailed standard operating procedures. Each SC-VCEP also coordinates with the ClinGen Cancer Variant Interpretation Committee (CVI) whose goal is to support development of granular specifications for the AMP\/ASCO\/CAP guidelines for somatic variant interpretation. New SC-VCEPs are anticipated to focus on specific clinically relevant genes, pathways, disease entities, variant classes or treatment modalities. Currently, three SC-VCEPs have begun to work through the four step process (focused on FGFR mutations, NTRK fusions, and FLT3 mutations respectively), and two more SC-VCEPs are in the planning stage (Histone H3 and Ph-like ALL). To date, ClinGen Somatic groups have contributed 619 evidence lines into CIViC from 353 published papers and 21 assertions of clinical significance. Input from the AACR community is critical for the establishment of new SC-VCEPs that address areas of variant interpretation with the greatest need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/559e33f1-6d8d-458a-b088-b1248de262cd\/@t03B8ZAg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,Variant interpretation,Expert panels,Curation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15711"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason Saliba<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gordana Raca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angshumoy Roy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ian King<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shamini Selvarajah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinjie Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rashmi Kanagal-Shamanna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laveniya Satgunaseelan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Meredith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Evans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alanna Church<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Panieh Terraf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yassmine Akkari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather E.

Consequently, genes and variants associated with childhood tumors are under-represented in public cancer databases and knowledgebases. A focused effort is needed for the structured curation of genetic variant-level data to document diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers for childhood cancers. The Pediatric Cancer Curation Advancement Subcommittee (PCCAS), a collaboration between the Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer knowledgebase (CIViC; civicdb.org), the ClinGen Somatic Pediatric Cancer Taskforce, Disease Ontology (DO; disease-ontology.org) and CIViCmine (bionlp.bcgsc.ca\/civicmine\/), is addressing this challenge through enhanced curation, tagging, and automation.<br \/>PCCAS created a pediatric specific curation standard operating procedure (SOP) to harmonize pediatric evidence entered in CIViC. Our SOP provides general guidance and considerations to define and classify childhood cancers and to represent childhood cancer evidence on a spectrum of age-related incidence and presentation. For instance, pediatric evidence in CIViC is now tagged using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) age of onset terms, allowing pediatric evidence to be easily searched, tracked, and sorted. We also initiated the addition of new age of onset terms to enhance the granularity of these tags.<br \/>WHO ICD-O nomenclature has been chosen for pediatric disease classification in CIViC. ICD-O provides updated terminology including specific genetic subtypes, which are important in pediatric cancers where their underlying molecular profiles often define the disease. To aid curator selection of disease, we verified pediatric relevant ICD-O terms inclusion in DO and restructured DO disease hierarchies to ensure proper mapping.<br \/>CIViC highlights our pediatric cancer initiative in multiple areas including a homepage feature linking directly to a dedicated pediatric advanced search that returns all evidence tagged with pediatric or young adult age of onset. Most importantly, our childhood specific SOP and initiatives are included in all ClinGen Somatic Cancer and CIViC training sessions for consistent implementation.<br \/>CIViCmine supports CIViC by using natural language processing to identify important cancer biomarkers in the literature. To better identify pediatric biomarkers, we are adapting and refining CIViCmine to use MeSH terms and other approaches to enhance accuracy in the identification of childhood evidence in both the literature and CIViC. In conclusion, implementation of these procedures, features, and automation are pushing to make childhood cancer variant evidence more accessible and interpretable.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/50ec8a82-eec1-4a4f-a4d7-b7c31404c486\/@t03B8ZAg\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Curation,Variant interpretation,Natural language processing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15714"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason Saliba<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jake Lever<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kilannin Krysiak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arpad Danos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Wagner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather E.

Since the launch of the beta user interface in 2014, this knowledgebase has undergone substantial evolution and redesign to support the needs of the clinical and research communities. Significant work has been done by the community to release guidelines and resources to support cancer variant interpretation. CIViC is a crowd sourced, expert moderated resource with a community of over 300 active curators. In response to community feedback, evolving guidelines and improved understanding of the genetics of cancer, we have developed CIViC 2.0, a major redesign that expands the capabilities of this widely used resource.<br \/>CIViC 2.0 has been designed to support complex variant relationships (termed molecular profiles in CIViC) such as the poor prognostic impact of the combination of variants in <i>FLT3<\/i>, <i>DNMT3A<\/i> and <i>NPM1<\/i> in acute myeloid leukemia. These highly structured molecular profiles link details about each constituent variant, including genomic coordinates, HGVS, aliases, and additional metadata. Molecular profiles will also support the absence of a variant, which has become critical in targeted therapy decision making such as colorectal cancer where EGFR expression without a <i>KRAS<\/i> variant is an indication for targeted inhibitor therapy. These molecular profiles also support structural variants. While fusions have always been supported, CIViC 2.0 will support complex genomic coordinate or cytoband specific queries.&nbsp;<br \/>Significant technical changes have improved the speed and performance of the UI and the underlying API. A complete redesign of the API, utilizing GraphQL, empowers users to ask more complex questions and more deeply explore this highly curated data. More robust data schemas and comprehensive validation of evidence structure will allow for the programmatic submission of new evidence. By utilizing site-wide full text faceted search, identifying relevant content in summaries, evidence items, or even curator comments is straightforward.<br \/>The CIViC 2.0 redesign supports the ever-increasing complexity of cancer variant information and provides a powerful tool to explore and utilize the carefully curated data within the knowledgebase for a multitude of questions related to basic, translational, and clinical research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79af7fe9-b070-465a-bbe1-2a56eecdcc89\/@t03B8ZAg\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Databases,Cancer genetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15715"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kilannin C.

These often fail to detect lower affinity binding targets and secondary effectors that are usually highly tissue context-dependent. As such, these can vary dramatically across different cancer types. To address this challenge and facilitate more quantitative approaches to targeted cancer therapy, a more comprehensive picture of drug MoA, including poly-pharmacology and toxicity effects mediated by the full range of its high-affinity (primary), as well as its context-specific lower-affinity (secondary) and downstream effector (tertiary) targets. For this purpose, we generated transcriptional genome-wide RNA-Seq profiles of cancer cell lines, following compounds perturbation with FDA approved and late-stage experimental oncology drugs using a fully automated and highly efficient PLATE-Seq technology<sup>1<\/sup>. Compared to prior approaches, this provides (a) genome-wide readouts, rather than readouts limited to a small set of landmark genes, (b) in cell lines that were specifically selected as the highest-fidelity models for published human cancer cohorts, using the OncoMatch algorithm<sup>2<\/sup>, and (c) for a drug repertoire that is clinically relevant. In addition, to avoid confounding effects from drug stress\/death response pathway activation&#8212;a common issue in previous studies&#8212;drugs were titrated at their maximum sub-lethal concentration (48-hr IC<sub>20<\/sub>) using 10-point dose response curves in each cell line. The ~20,000 molecular profiles generated by these assays were analyzed using the VIPER algorithm<sup>3<\/sup> to reproducibly assess the effect of each drug on the activity of ~6,500 regulatory and signaling proteins compared to vehicle control.

By using peer-reviewed data sources and publications, DGIdb represents a stand-alone resource with over 100,000 drug-gene interaction claims across 30 interaction types to drive hypothesis generation in precision medicine and interpretation pipelines. The background process that normalizes drugs to a harmonized ontological concept has been upgraded. These improvements have increased concept normalization for drugs by 20% and are now available as a stand-alone service for use (<u>https:\/\/normalize.cancervariants.org\/therapy\/<\/u><u><\/u>). Leveraging our platform&#8217;s ability to find relationships between disease-critical genes and available therapeutics, DGIdb has been used in clinical interpretation pipelines to find drugs for specific diseases with an emphasis on regulatory approval status. DGIdb now uses annotations from Drugs@FDA as an additional source to provide more accurate descriptors for market and maturity status of drugs, when available. Lastly, to enhance the annotation potential for DGIdb in precision medicine pipelines, we have updated our druggable gene category sources with an additional curated list of 2,217 genes. Used alone or in combination with existing categories-such as the heavily-utilized &#8216;clinically actionable&#8217; category-this additional source will give precision medicine and interpretation pipelines the power to find concise, actionable annotations for specific diseases including pediatric cancers and epilepsy.

Among thousands of surface proteins, experimentally identifying the best target pairs that are expressed only in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, is costly and time-consuming. The open bulk RNASeq and single-cell (sc)RNASeq offers a great resource to identify novel bispecific targets. Bulk RNASeq has been widely explored to identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers, resulting in voluminous data for various cancers and normal tissues, but the mixture of cell types in bulk RNASeq could not characterize the precise expression of targets in cancer cells, resulting in considerable false positives. scRNASeq provides a high resolution of target expression in individual cells, however, the challenges in solving the dropout issue and cell type classification hinder the direct use of scRNASeq in bsAbs target identification. Utilizing the OCTAD database consisting of over 20,000 bulk RNASeq samples, we proposed an approach that identifies target pairs that separate tumors from healthy the most, taking into account cluster heterogeneity, the distance between tumors and healthy as well as the angle between potential markers. Among the top pairs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), CD33~PLVAP, for example, was a false positive because CD33 is myeloid and lymphoid cell lineage-specific. We thus assembled a scRNAseq database of healthy vital organs containing 39361 cells to aid selection. By comparing their expression with the expression of 18000 malignant cells predicted from 72000 cells of eight HCC samples, we identified target pairs that mostly express on the surface of the malignant HCC cells and had low or zero expression in vital organs. The most promising marker pair was GPC3~MUC13, presenting on the surface of over 30% of malignant HCC cells, with very low expression in vital organs. We further developed an R package to navigate the bsAbs target selection from open bulk RNASeq and scRNASeq.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4fcba4ef-d58e-4ff4-9121-86b527273e1b\/@u03B8ZAh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Bioinformatics,Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15719"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eugene Chekalin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shreya Paithankar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bin Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Most of them do not bring any negative effect. However, certain mutations change protein behaviour, structure, or level of expression. More importantly, some mutations are known to initiate and drive oncogenic transformation. These mutations often make good therapeutic targets but recognising this small subset in a cancer sample is a major challenge. The average cancer cell carries a life-long baggage of somatic mutations, and the mutational process is sped up in these cells through genomic instability (one of the hallmarks of cancer). As a result, there are hundreds of thousands of variants of unknown significance identified through sequencing of cancer DNA. COSMIC Cancer Mutation Census (CMC) answers this challenge by identifying coding mutations with a potential to drive cancer. This is achieved by combining manually curated information regarding cancer genes and genetic variants with data on variant frequencies in cancer and non-cancer populations, and algorithmic evaluation of variant significance. It applies a simple and transparent set of rules to the whole set of coding mutations in COSMIC to identify variants with the highest potential of clinical relevance. In current version (v95, November 2021) the CMC describes 4.7 million somatic variants and segregates them into four tiers. Tier 1 is the highest confidence set. This set includes 1558 mutations that are found in Cancer Gene Census genes and are also described as pathogenic in cancer by ClinVar. Tiers 2 and 3 contain variants with less extensive evidence of involvement in carcinogenesis. The dN\/dS algorithm is used to include variants that are under positive selection in cancer cells. Finally, mutations without evidence for driving cancer are classified as Tier 4. In addition to this classification, CMC integrates and presents the information used to prioritise variants, including their frequencies in various cancer types (COSMIC), germline frequencies (gnomAD), ClinVar annotations, dN\/dS analysis results, and nucleotide and amino acid conservation.

GenomeCruzer has the dual objectives of representing large amounts of genomic data in an easily readable way, allowing interactive analysis and providing visual results in real-time. Powerful graphics also allow simultaneous display of different types of values for the same objects, through multiple dimensions and customizable visual metaphors. The user can navigate this 3D environment and interact with the different elements, which constitute a representation of the starting datasets, building analysis paths and using statistical tools e.g. for the comparison of groups to highlight correlations.<br \/>In conclusion, GenomeCruzer enables users without bioinformatics background to browse, analyse and interpret complex omics datasets for multiple groups of patients and genes simultaneously, extracting clinical correlates and biological knowledge.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/218ce4b7-d6fe-4701-b0f4-4db3aa79230f\/@u03B8ZAh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15722"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Claudio Isella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riccardo Corsi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamal Elhasnaoui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Bertotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Vezzadini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Enzo Medico<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Histological imaging enables exploring the spatial heterogeneity and dynamics of cancer, stromal, and immune cell interactions as correlates of tumor stage and therapeutic response over passages. We created a repository of curated, haematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) images as a community resource for addressing these questions.<br \/>Images were generated at five sites within the NCI&#8217;s PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet) and the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository. Over 900 images, including 739 from PDXs and 190 from paired patients, are hosted on the Seven Bridges Genomics Cancer Genomics Cloud. They represent 42 cancer subtypes, including breast cancer (n=134), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD; n=94), pancreatic cancer (n=87), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD; n=80), melanoma (n=71), and squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC; n=65). Paired human \/ PDX images are available for each of these cancers. Human and \/ or PDX images generated following patient treatment are available for 37 of the subtypes. Most images are from early passages (P0: 158; P1: 292; P2: 152; P3: 69; &#62;P3: 55). Annotations include sex, age, race, ethnicity, and, for most images, pathological assessment of tissue-level percent cancer, stromal, and necrotic cell content (n=639) and tumor stage (n=650). RNA and exome sequencing data are available for 99 and 228 images, respectively, matched at the patient or sample level.<br \/>Quality control was performed using HistoQC. Cells were segmented and labeled as neoplastic, necrotic, immune, stromal, or other using Hover-Net and predictions of total neoplastic cell area correlated with whole-slide pathological assessment of cancer cell percentage (COAD: r=0.51; LUSC: r=0.59). HD-Staining, another classification approach, was applied to a subset of images and our clinical annotations will facilitate validation of this and related methods. Features of 512 x 512 pixel tiles were computed using the Inception V3 convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. Unsupervised clustering of these features demonstrate inter-patient heterogeneity within pathologist-annotated tumor regions. A classifier developed using pathologist-annotated cancer, stromal, and necrotic regions and trained on the features in LUSC images (n=10 images) achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 96% for cancer tiles across (n=5) LUAD images. Accuracy was lower for stromal classification (90%), likely reflecting current limitations of our small, but growing, labeled training set.<br \/>Our repository of clinically-annotated PDX H&#38;E images should aid the community in studying spatial heterogeneity and in training deep learning-based image analysis methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/030ec0da-6f03-49ab-be96-0566e5d27487\/@u03B8ZAh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Image analysis,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Histopathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15854"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian S.
