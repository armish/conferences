However, T cells are educated by antigen presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells (DC), that control their differentiation into effector T cells able to eliminate target tumor cells. While most studies focused on understanding T cell features leading to antitumor immunity, little is known about DC determinants required to promote effective antitumor T cell function. Yet several studies are revealing that high DC content in tumor lesions correlate with improved tumor outcome. To identify molecular program that modulate DC functionality in tissues we have profiled tumor-associated DC in mice and tumor lesions. We identified a DC molecular program that was shared between mice and human tumors that included <u>m<\/u>aturation genes associated with T cell simulation and migration to the LN (<i>Cd40<\/i>, <i>Cd80<\/i>, <i>Fscn<\/i>, <i>Ccr7<\/i>), but also genes associated with immuno<u>reg<\/u>ulation (<i>Socs1, Socs2, Socs3, Cd200,<\/i> <i>Pd-l1, Pd-l2, Fasl<\/i>) , we named mregDC (Maier et al., Nature 2020). We also found that mregDC molecular state is induced in DC1 and DC2 upon capture of tumor debris leading to hypothesize that the mregDC state identifies antigen-charged DC that migrate to lymphoid structures, including tertiary lymphoid structures and tumor draining lymph nodes to modulate tumor specific T cell immune responses. While the role of DC in the draining LN has been established the exact role played by DC in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear. To explore this question, we used multiplex imaging and spatial transcriptomics platforms to identify the distribution and spatial interactions of DC1, DC2 and mregDC within the TME of human NSCLC and HCC lesions during treatment with PD-1 blockade. We found that mregDC accumulate within the tertiary lymphoid structures together with activated T cell and B cell programs. We are continuing to generate additional data on mregDC interactions in human tumors tissues that respond or resist PD-1 blockade and should be able to provide additional information at the time of the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,T cell,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Raphael Mattiuz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nima Assad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pauline Hamon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Assaf Magen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Le Berichel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miriam Merad<\/i><\/presenter>.

To this end, we sought to identify, validate, and target novel master regulators of TI-Tregs by leveraging a suite of next-generation bioinformatic tools and rigorous <i>ex vivo <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> screening and validation methodologies. Specifically, we performed VIPER (Virtual Inference of Protein Activity) analysis on a large dataset of T cell transcriptional profiles from matched peripheral blood and tumors of 36 human patients, yielding 17 master regulator (MR) proteins predicted to uniquely drive the TI-Treg phenotype across cancers. To identify putative therapeutics that modulate TI-Treg MRs, we performed a systematic <i>ex vivo <\/i>drug screen with an unbiased panel of 1,554 FDA-approved and experimental compounds coupled to RNA sequencing (PLATE-Seq) on human TI-Tregs and P-Tregs. Drug candidates with preferential cytotoxic activity on TI-Tregs versus P-Tregs that also reversed MR transcriptional activity were thoroughly validated <i>in vivo <\/i>in the MC38 tumor model. In parallel, we performed a pooled <i>in vivo <\/i>CRISPR\/Cas9 screen via the CHIME (CHimeric IMmune Editing) system to identify candidate MRs that regulate TI-Treg recruitment to and\/or retention within MC38 tumors. By these approaches, we successfully validated an as-yet poorly described TI-Treg MR, TRPS1 (Transcriptional Repressor GATA Binding 1), which after genetic deletion across the hematopoietic compartment diminished TI-Tregs while preserving P-Tregs in MC38-bearing mice, and led to enhanced spontaneous control of MCA205 sarcomas. In addition, we found the widely used nucleoside analog chemotherapeutic Gemcitabine exhibits preferential inhibitory activity against human TI-Tregs versus P-Tregs, and validated in mice that at sub-clinical dose levels Gemcitabine exhibits immune-dependent therapeutic activity that significantly potentiates checkpoint blockade control of late-stage MC38 tumors. By single cell RNA sequencing of TI- and P-Tregs flow-sorted from Gemcitabine-treated mice, we observe specific depletion of a TI-Treg subset enriched for expression of TI-Treg MRs, including TRPS1. Together, these studies reveal new putative regulators of human TI-Tregs and identify a readily available clinical therapeutic that exhibits inhibitory activity against them. These findings specifically warrant future investigation into the role of TRPS1 in TI-Treg activity and clinical evaluation of low-dose Gemcitabine as a Treg-targeting strategy capable of enhancing checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,CRISPR\/Cas9,Master regulators,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Casey R.

PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cells are heterogeneous: T cell factor (TCF)-1<sup>+<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+ <\/sup>progenitor exhausted cells (Tpex) are capable of self-renewal and give rise to the more differentiated subpopulation of TCF-1<sup>neg<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+ <\/sup>CD8 T cells that can retain some effector-like function. Tpex are essential for the maintenance of the antigen-specific T cell pool during chronic stimulation, and in animal models, only these cells respond to PD-1 blockade. In cancer patients, the presence of Tpex cells in tumors has been associated with response to PD-1 targeted therapy. However, it has been reported that the presence of these cells in the tumor microenvironment requires a specific niche, and the molecular mechanisms supporting maintenance of Tpex remains to be investigated. Tpex have high CD28 expression, and we have shown that during PD-1 targeted therapies, CD28 costimulation is required for the reinvigoration of CD8 T cell responses. In this study, we sought to understand the role of sustained CD28 signaling for self-renewal and differentiation of Tpex<sup> <\/sup>cells. In mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), we abrogated CD28 signaling by blockade of anti-B7-1\/B7-2, and observed a sharp reduction of virus-specific CD8 T cells (both TCF-1<sup>+<\/sup> and TCF-1<sup>neg <\/sup>subsets). By contrast, B7-2 single blockade resulted in reduction of differentiated TCF-1<sup>neg <\/sup>virus-specific<sup> <\/sup>cells, yet the Tpex subset was not affected. We hypothesized that stronger CD28 signaling might be required for differentiation of Tpex cells into TCF-1<sup>neg<\/sup>, whereas weaker CD28 signaling would be sufficient for Tpex self-renewal. To address this question, we performed conditional deletion of <i>Cd28<\/i> on PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cells in mice with established chronic infection. Deletion of both <i>Cd28 <\/i>alleles resulted in reduction of TCF-1<sup>+<\/sup> and TCF-1<sup>neg <\/sup>subsets. In contrast, when CD28 signaling was reduced (deletion of one allele), TCF-1<sup>neg <\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cells were decreased but the number of Tpex cells was not affected. We performed RNA sequencing and metabolic assays to better understand the role of CD28 signaling on PD-1+ CD8 T cells. These data revealed that sustained CD28 signaling during persistent antigen stimulation is required to maintain mitochondrial fitness. Our work support the novel hypothesis that CD28 signaling strength modulates cell fate decision of Tpex cells through metabolic regulation. Our data also suggest that antigen presenting cells capable of providing ligands to CD28 are required for the long-term maintenance of antigen-specific T cells during chronic stimulation. These findings provide key insights about PD-1+ CD8 T cells, with important implications for checkpoint therapy in cancer, including longevity of responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,CD28 costimulation,TCF-1+ PD-1+ CD8 T cells,Chronic stimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Etienne Humblin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Verena Van der Heide<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Filipescu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashley Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Soares-Schanoski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myvizhi Selvan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laila Horta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zeynep Gumus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Bernstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jerry Chipuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dirk Homann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alice O.

TRACERx has examined the intrinsic mechanisms of immune escape in non-small cell lung cancer. Here, we applied imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to address the contribution of extrinsic mechanisms in the context of intrinsic mechanisms and genomic features such as neoantigen burden.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We applied two 35-antibody IMC panels to the treatment na&#239;ve multiregion TRACERx cohort (n=81 patients, 221 regions), and developed an IMC analysis pipeline to study T cell differentiation states, cancer associated fibroblasts, vasculature, and innate and adaptive immunity. Identities and functional states were assigned to over 4 million cells and their positions were mapped within tumor and stromal compartments.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified four distinct TMEs according to the local densities of lymphoid and myeloid cells: high infiltrate, stroma TIL enriched, myeloid enriched, and low infiltrate. We confirmed frequent intratumor TME heterogeneity, previously inferred from RNA sequencing. In high and stroma TIL enriched TMEs, we found the balance of effector and suppressor cells either favoured an exhausted (exhausted T cells and Tregs, n=16, 26.7%), suppressed (effector T cells and suppressive macrophages, n=31, 51.6%) or effector phenotype (high M1:M2, n=13, 21.6%). Tregs within exhausted TMEs neighboured effector and exhausted T cells, whereas effector T cells were nearest tumor cells within effector TMEs. Cell-type specific checkpoint molecule expression favoured specific compartments and TMEs. For example, the highest density of intratumoral PDL1+ M2-macrophages was observed within high infiltrate regions. Complementary intrinsic and extrinsic immune evasion mechanisms were identified, including immune avoiding architectures and stromal barriers as spatial mechanisms of evasion. Tumor cells were found to express lactate transporter, MCT4, in high infiltrate environments. Neoantigen burden associated with immune cell densities in a histology-specific manner. In lung adenocarcinoma, neoantigen burden was associated with a high infiltrate TME and suppressive myeloid populations such as M2-macrophages. In squamous cell carcinoma, we observed significant associations with CD8+ T cells, including exhausted populations, specifically in tumors lacking HLALOH.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> IMC allowed for the identification of spatial mechanisms of immune evasion that, when combined with intrinsic mechanisms, provided a more complete understanding of how lung tumors escape immune predation. By visualising single cells in their native context, we observed various immunosuppressive TMEs that defined high infiltrate tumors. Histology-specific relationships between immune cells and neoantigen burden point to different immune pressures, which may influence tumor evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Intratumor heterogeneity,Tumor evolution,Imaging mass cytometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katey Enfield<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Colliver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mihaela Angelova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alastair Magness<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristiana Grigoriadis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oriol Pich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clare Puttick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dina Levi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Hobson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Moore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahiro Karasaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Selvaraju Veeriah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>TRACERx Consortium<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariam Jamal-Hanjani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas McGranahan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik Sahai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julian Downward<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Crispin Hiley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Swanton<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, we report the systematic identification of immune evasion mechanisms using genome-scale <i>in vivo <\/i>CRISPR screens in eight murine cancer models treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We identify and validate previously unreported immune evasion genes and identify key immune inhibitory checkpoints that have a conserved role across several cancer models, such as the non-classical MHC-I molecule Qa-1<sup>b<\/sup>\/HLA-E, which scores as the top overall sensitizing hit across all screens. Surprisingly, we find that loss of IFN&#947; signaling by tumor cells sensitizes 6 of 8 cancer models to ICB. While IFN-mediated inflammation has been associated with response to ICB, there have also been reports of ICB-resistance driven by IFN sensing. However, several divergent mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inhibitory effect of tumor IFN sensing, leading to uncertainty about how this key immune signaling pathway is regulating anti-tumor immunity in different contexts. Using <i>in vivo<\/i> screening data, transcriptional profiling, and genetic interaction studies, we reveal that the immune-inhibitory effects of tumor IFN sensing are the direct result of tumor upregulation of classical and non-classical MHC-I genes. The interferon-MHC-I axis can inhibit anti-tumor immunity through two mechanisms: first, upregulation of classical MHC-I inhibits the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, which are activated by ICB. Second, IFN-mediated upregulation of Qa-1<sup>b<\/sup> directly inhibits cytotoxicity by effector CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells via the NKG2A\/CD94 receptor, which is induced on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells by ICB. Finally, we show that high interferon-stimulated gene expression in patients is associated with decreased survival in RCC and poor response to ICB in melanoma. Our study establishes a unifying mechanism to explain the inhibitory role of tumor IFN sensing, revealing that IFN-mediated upregulation of classical and non-classical MHC-I inhibitory checkpoints can facilitate immune escape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,Functional genomics,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juan Dubrot<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter P.
