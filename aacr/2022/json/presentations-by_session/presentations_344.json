[{"Abstract":"Purpose: Cisplatin (CPT) is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of ovarian cancer. However, CPT has severe adverse effects. The purpose of this study is to develop targeted liposomes that selectively target the xCT transporter which is upregulated in ovarian cancer and carry CPT to ovarian cancer only, thereby avoiding the adverse effects of CPT. We evaluated the stability, the cytotoxicity and the cellular uptake of targeted liposomes in ovarian cancer cell lines.<br \/>Methods: CPT was encapsulated by the remote loading method in liposomes. The stability of liposomes was evaluated by measuring the drug-leakage from liposomes and the growth of liposome size stored at 4&#176;C and room temperature over a 30-day period. For the drug-leakage study, liposomes were placed into a dialysis tubing and dialysate aliquots were removed and analyzed twice weekly for CPT content. The liposome size was evaluated using Dynamic Light Scattering (Nano Brook Omni, Brookhaven Instruments). The cellular uptake of targeted liposomes (encapsulating the fluorescent dye sulforhodamine B, SRB) was evaluated in drug-resistant (A2870cis, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, IGROV1, and NCI\/ADR-RES) and drug sensitive (A2870 and OVCAR8) ovarian cancer cell lines (purchased from the NIH), were evaluated using flow cytometry (BD Accuri C6). The cytotoxicity of CPT in targeted liposomes was evaluated in the various ovarian cell lines using the MTS assay (Novus Biologicals).<br \/>Results: The targeted liposomes over the 30-day period, show that 6.8% of the total loaded CPT leaked out of the liposomes. During that period the growth of the liposomes was &#60;5% for the liposomes stored at 4&#176;C and &#60;1% of their initial size, stored at 25&#176;C. The cellular uptake of ovarian cancer cell lines, A2870, A2870cis, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR8, and NCI\/ADR-Res the targeted SRB loaded liposomes showed significantly more fluorescence intensity when compared to free SRB and non-targeted liposomes (p&#60;0.05). In the cell line IGROV1, there is a similar trend seen, where there was a higher fluorescence intensity compared to free SRB and non-targeted. The fluorescence intensity was found to be higher compared to non-targeted liposomes (p&#60;0.0001) but not statistically significant higher compared to free SRB. For cytotoxicity, a similar trend is seen in cell lines A2870, A2870cis, IGROV1, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR8, and NCI\/ADR-res, where the cisplatin loaded targeted liposomes had the lowest IC<sub>50<\/sub> compared to free drug and non-targeted liposomes. Non-targeted liposomes had the highest IC<sub>50 <\/sub>values compared to free drug and targeted liposomes. In cell lines A2870, A2870cis, IGROV1, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR8, and NCI\/ADR-res the IC<sub>50<\/sub> values show a 2.4, 5.3, 4.1, 3.3, 1.7, 1.6, and 2.5-fold lower values compared to free cisplatin, respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: Targeted liposomes encapsulating CPT show stability, enhanced <i>in-vitro<\/i> cellular uptake and anti-cancer activity in resistant and sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0454c96b-2481-43e5-800d-05203a8d3fcf\/@G03B8ZDr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-07 Platinum complexes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liposomes,Cisplatin,Ovarian cancer,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15083"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Antonia Marashio<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria (Mary) P.

CRC metastasis is strongly associated with mortality. The liver and lungs are the most frequent sites of distant disease, accounting for ~70% and ~12% of cases, respectively. We hypothesize that anticancer agents that mimic the organotropism of metastatic CRC will be highly effective in treating CRC patients. Our studies have identified that Annamycin (ANN), a potent topoisomerase II poison that displays organotropism imitating that of metastatic CRC. ANN is an analog of doxorubicin (Dox) that shows unique properties. Notably, ANN is active against multidrug-resistant tumors and undergoes efficient uptake by lungs and liver. ANN is easily formulated in multilamellar liposomes (L-ANN), which further increases ANN levels in lungs and liver.<br \/><b>Objective.<\/b> The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of L-ANN in experimental CRC liver and lung metastasis models.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>The efficacy of L-ANN was<b> <\/b>tested in syngeneic models of metastatic CRC established in lungs or liver. For lung metastasis model, CT26-Luc cells were injected intravenously (IV) into Balb\/c mice, followed by weekly IV treatment of L-ANN (4 and 6 mg\/kg). The liver metastatic model was established using intrasplenic injection protocol. Mice received six weekly IV injections of 4 mg\/kg of L-ANN or vehicle. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computer Tomography (CT) were used to track tumor progression.<br \/><b>Results. <\/b> L-ANN exhibited robust antitumor activity in both models. In the lung metastasis model, a dose-dependent delay in the tumor progression was visualized by both BLI and CT scan in the L-ANN treated group. The delay correlated with 272% extension of survival in the group receiving 6 mg\/kg L-ANN [median survival (MS) 79d for treated vs 29d vehicle, p&#60;0.0001] and 234% for the animals dosed with L-ANN at 4 mg\/kg [MS 68d, p=0.0012]. In the liver metastasis model, all vehicle-treated mice showed massive tumors in the liver and peritoneal cavity as monitored by BLI and MRI. In the vehicle group, 13\/14 died or were euthanized by 35d (median survival was 34.5d). Yet, no tumors were detected by BLI or MRI in L-ANN treated mice as of 44d and 0\/14 mice died (100% survival). This indicates a highly significant (P&#60; 0.0001) extension of survival (ongoing experiment).<br \/><b>Conclusion. <\/b>In summary, the strategy to develop anticancer agents that imitate metastatic CRC organotropism appears to be highly promising and is supported by these results. Our previous <i>in vivo<\/i> studies of L-ANN in sarcoma lung metastasis models already led to initiation of multicenter clinical studies (NCT04887298). This study demonstrating L-ANN efficacy in CRC models provides convincing evidence for further preclinical development aimed at initiation of clinical studies in CRC metastatic patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-09 Topoisomerases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anthracycline,Colon cancer,Liver Metastasis,Lung metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15084"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rafal J.

Initial clinical studies with the DHODH inhibitor brequinar in solid tumors showed limited efficacy due to dose limiting adverse effects [Peters et al, 2018]. Recently, there is renewed interest in the use of more potent and selective DHODH inhibitors for the treatment of myeloid and lymphoid malignancies [Sykes et al, 2016].<br \/>Here we report the identification of the novel potent and highly selective DHODH inhibitor GTX-0196, with excellent physicochemical properties. GTX-0196 exhibited a biochemical IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 3.7 nM in a DHODH biochemical assay and an antiproliferative IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 1.1 nM in the MOLM-13 cell line, with brequinar showing IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 6.9 and 50 nM, respectively. The activity in the MOLM-13 proliferation assay was uridine-dependent, indicating absence of general toxicity of the compound and confirming DHODH-mediated efficacy.<br \/>Profiling of GTX-0196 in the BioPrint panel (Eurofins\/CEREP, at 10 &#181;M), showed &#60;50% inhibition for all 133 target proteins tested (GPCR&#8217;s, NR&#180;s, kinases and other enzymes), illustrating the high selectivity for DHODH (&#62; 2000-fold selectivity versus other targets tested). Furthermore, no inhibition was observed in a human CYP panel (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4, at 30 &#181;M) and in a panel of transporters (at 10 &#181;M). High metabolic stability in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes was observed with t<sub>&#189;<\/sub> &#62; 6h and 10h, respectively.<br \/>Compared to an earlier lead compound, GTX-0196 demonstrated enhanced potency and metabolic stability (particularly in preclinical species). Potent and efficacious inhibition of proliferation through DHODH was confirmed in a large number of solid tumor and hematologic malignancy cell lines, illustrating the broad potential use of this chemical series. Furthermore, tumor growth inhibition was observed in the MOLM-13 xenograft mouse model.<br \/>Due to its favorable properties, GTX-0196 has progressed towards IND-enabling studies. In parallel, we are exploring mono and combination therapy opportunities in hematological malignancies as well as combination therapy opportunities in solid tumors to investigate the full therapeutic potential in oncology for this optimized DHODH inhibitor.<br \/>L&#246;ffler et al.

Prodrug versions need to be developed to ensure a sufficient therapeutic window for cancer treatment (1). A series of duocarmycin bioprecursors have been developed in-house which lack a key hydroxyl trigger group, required for spirocyclisation and subsequent activation. This hydroxyl group can be regioselectivity restored by specific Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), with a primary focus on cancer associated isoforms CYP1A1 and CYP2W1 (2). An exploratory library of analogues of our lead compound, ICT2700 (CYP1A1 and CYP2W1 activated), has been synthesized and elucidated aspects of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the compound and subsequent toxicity in CYP transfected and mock cell lines, using MTT assays. The data shows the importance of having an indole in the DNA recognition subunit (the non-alkylating subunit) for CYP1A1 and CYP2W1 activation. Further, a compound with thus far unexplained activity was identified. ICT11038 has a benzofuran instead of an indole in the recognition subunit and subsequently demonstrates inherent nanomolar toxicity consistently in all cell lines tested, including a range of cancerous and non-cancerous cells, which is not dependent on cytochrome expression. CYP1A1 has been shown to enhance the toxicity of ICT11038 further but is not required for nanomolar toxicity. Further SAR exploration and western blots confirm that the inherent toxicity is achieved through DNA damage despite lacking the key trigger group, suggesting a novel activation pathway. Additionally, our SAR studies show that replacing the indole of the DNA alkylation subunit with a benzofuran ablates CYP dependent activity, with one exception, ICT2724. ICT2724 is non-toxic in mock transfected cells but is toxic in CYP1A1 transfected cells, albeit it at higher concentration than ICT2700. ICT2724 is analogous to ICT2700, except for the direct indole to benzofuran substitution. Other compounds with benzofurans in the alkylating subunit compounds are not metabolized to a toxic compound by CYP1A1 or CYP2W1 despite their indole equivalents being good prodrug candidates. To conclude, the introduction of the benzofuran functional group into the CYP-activated duocarmycin bioprecursor pharmacophores produces an unexplained pattern of CYP activation and, in one example, an intrinsically toxic DNA damaging agent (ZYP-11038).<br \/>References (1) Z.

It is the 4<sup>th<\/sup> leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. and has the lowest 5-year survival rate among all cancer types. One of the main hurdles for the treatment is limited effective chemotherapy and rapidly acquired resistance against it. Advanced PDAC research and various treatment options only showed minimal enhancement to the overall survival outcomes. Hence more effective drugs and therapies are in need for improving overall therapeutic outcomes for PDAC patients. Recently, we reported the discovery of a new generation of tubulin inhibitors (SB-216) that targets the colchicine binding site and serves as a potent anti-cancer agent for various cancer types. Here, we evaluated the <i>in vitro <\/i>effects of SB-216 on the PDAC cell lines in comparison with one of the first-line treatment paclitaxel. We also established luciferase labeled Mia PaCa-2 cell line, Mia PaCa-2-Luc, for live monitoring tumor progression and evaluating the anti-tumor effect in subcutaneous mouse models. The results showed that SB-216 effectively inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration dose-dependently at low nanomolar concentrations. Immunoblotting also confirmed SB-216 induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle arrest assay confirmed that SB-216 can arrest cells in the G2\/M phase. In vivo study suggested that SB-216 inhibited tumor growth significantly in Mia PaCa-2-Luc subcutaneous xenograft model with low toxicity. Our preclinical data demonstrated the potential of SB-216 to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in PDAC cells, indicating a promising chemotherapy agent in treating PDAC. However, further evaluations are warranted in orthotopic and PDX tumor models for clinical significance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/11c15bfd-fdc2-4183-92a3-e4002e9664bd\/@p03B8ZDs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tubulin inhibitor,Chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15124"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rui Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satyanarayana Pochampally<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Hamilton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Duane D.

Therefore, targeting metabolic alterations in cancer is critical for developing novel cancer therapeutics. We have developed NGY-B as a first-in-Class small molecule inhibitor of the lactate transporters, MCT1 and MCT4, that also decreases mitochondrial respiration. These transporters play a crucial role in regulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells. NGY-B treatment exhibited potent <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity in cancer cells with various levels of MCT1 and MCT4 expression. The on-target activity of NGY-B was validated by measuring intracellular and extracellular lactate levels. NGY-B blocks lactate import through MCT1 under high lactate conditions and lactate export through MCT4 in high glucose conditions. Seahorse and U-<sup>13<\/sup>C-glucose tracing analysis demonstrated NGY-B treatment modulates glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation consistent with the lactate measurement data. Therefore, NGY-B is a novel inhibitor of MCT1\/4 while also exhibiting inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ca61a5bc-88f6-4a10-a299-02455586e35e\/@p03B8ZDs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Cancer therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15125"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sambad Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Goreczny<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Bowman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Duffy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daliya Banerjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanath Wijerathna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Dzuris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaime Escobedo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Sandanayaka<\/i><\/presenter>.

Current treatment options include conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. Disadvantages of these therapies, as well as other factors such as refractiveness, have contributed to poor outcomes in melanoma patients. Antifungal drugs potentially represent a novel class of anticancer agents. Our objective here was to analyze the ability of these agents to eradicate primary human metastatic melanoma cells. Antitumor effects were investigated using cell growth and proliferation assays, flow cytometry (FACS), and cell death assays. Wild-type human melanoma cell lines or those possessing the BRAF V600E mutation or the NRAS Q61R mutation were analyzed. Clotrimazole treatment led to profound decreases in cell growth in wild-type and NRAS mutant melanoma cells. Significant, but lesser effects were observed in BRAF mutants. However, treatment with econazole caused substantial reductions in cell growth in wild-type and BRAF mutant cells. These results were corroborated by cell death analyses and FACS, where clotrimazole treatment caused greater than 80% cell death in wild-type and NRAS mutant cells, while econazole caused greater than 75% cell death in BRAF mutants. Taken together, these preliminary studies indicated that clotrimazole and econazole were effective in inducing antitumor effects in human metastatic melanoma cell lines, but with differing degrees of efficacy. This data suggests that melanoma tumors of each known genotype can potentially be treated with antifungal agents. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the ability of antifungal agents to successfully treat human metastatic melanoma cells. Since each agent displayed differential effects for each type of mutation, it is possible that these antifungal agents affect different molecular targets in each melanoma cell line. These antifungal agents thus appear to be potential alternative treatments, as well as affordable and widely accessible therapies, for melanoma patients in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ecdafee2-9153-4bec-8e51-473cacf276c5\/@p03B8ZDs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Cell death,Novel anticancer agents,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15127"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Lukas R.

Despite initial therapeutic benefit, current inhibitors induce TS overexpression or alter folate transport metabolism feedback pathways that tumor cells exploit for drug resistance. Here we report a small molecule TS inhibitor that exhibits i) enhanced antitumor activity as compared to current fluoropyrimidines and antifolates without inducing TS overexpression, ii) is structurally distinct from classical antifolates, iii) extends survival in a pancreatic tumor mouse model, iv) and is well tolerated with equal efficacy using either intraperitoneal or oral administration. Mechanistically, we confirm the compound is a multifunctional non classical antifolate and through a series of analogues identify structural features allowing direct TS inhibition while also maintaining the ability to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises about 10 to 15 percent of all lung cancer diagnoses. Frequent loss of RB1 and mutations in p53 in SCLC make it rather difficult to develop targeted therapies. Many current therapies rely on toxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy to combat the aggressive nature of SCLC; however, even with the advent of new therapies, the median survival rate has remained relatively low at 12 to 16 months. SCLC is also characterized by a high mutation rate, resulting in patients becoming increasingly resistant to treatments. This calls for a novel combination to extend patient life expectancy. ONC201 is an imipridone that is currently in clinical trials for its proapoptotic effects in several cancer types. We propose that combining ONC201 with standard first-line chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and carboplatin will result in a synergistic effect and serve as a novel treatment plan for SCLC patients. SCLC cell lines H1048 and H1105 were treated with the novel triple drug combination ONC201, etoposide, and carboplatin. Cell-Titer Glo cell viability assays were conducted for 72 hours to see the additive and\/or synergistic effect of novel triple drug treatment. Western blots were also run to evaluate the expression of proapoptotic protein cleaved PARP or expression of cellular metabolic stress protein ATF4 to explore the synergistic effect of triple drug treatments in SCLC cell lines. Cell viability after the triple drug treatment in both cell lines H1048 and H1105 may indicate a potential synergistic effect. Preliminary western results indicate that the triple drug treatment results in an increase in cPARP or ATF4 expression relative to the vehicle, suggesting a synergistic effect of the triple drug treatment. We are currently exploring the novel combination and potential underlying mechanisms behind the synergistic effects of the triple drug treatment. Future studies will evaluate this triple drug combination treatment in mouse models of SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d934a63b-232c-48ff-941a-05c0c4301f60\/@p03B8ZDs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Combination therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15129"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Young S.

The most effective intravesical therapy, BCG, has an ongoing shortage, while other second line therapies are not very effective, leaving radical cystectomy (RC) as the most effective option for cancer control. However, RC is a morbid, life-altering, and expensive procedure. Unfortunately, high-grade superficial disease is associated with cancer-specific mortality in 1\/3 of the patients. Improved second line therapies or development of a BCG alternative would increase the rate of bladder preservation and survival, especially in light of the recurrent BCG shortages which have plagued bladder cancer patients. We earlier demonstrated that our first-generation imidazolium compounds are effective exfoliants that induce apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway and had potential to be used as intravesical therapy for bladder cancer. In this study, we developed and investigated second generation imidazolium compounds that have selective toxicity towards tumor tissues. We also investigated the mitochondrial target(s) of these imidazolium compounds.<br \/>Methods: Second generation imidazolium compounds were screened for their toxicity against various bladder cancer cell lines using CellTiter-Glo and colony forming assay. Apoptosis induction was confirmed using western blot and propidium-iodide incorporation analysis. <i>In vitro <\/i>toxicity comparison between BBN-tumor organoids and normal organoids was performed using confocal microscopy.<i> In vivo<\/i> toxicity of these compounds was studied in normal mice. For candidate target identification, mitochondria from cells grown in SILAC heavy\/light media were treated with biotinylated imidazolium compound or a mixture of biotinylated compound plus TPP1 (a first-generation imidazolium compound). Lysates were subjected to streptavidin pull down followed by LC-MS\/MS proteomics analysis. Shortlisted target candidates were knocked down using siRNA followed by imidazolium treatment to assess their candidacy as the imidazolium target.<br \/>Results: All second-generation imidazolium compounds had significantly higher toxicity to bladder cancer cell lines compared to first generation compounds. Compounds IS154 and IS155 were shown to be cancer selective. These two compounds showed no change in histopathology of murine bladder urothelium 24 h after intravesical instillation. Proteomics data from SILAC experiments prioritized three possible targets of the imidazolium compounds which are currently being explored.<br \/>Conclusions: Second generation imidazolium compounds are tumor-specific and highly potent compounds that are worthy of further study as an intravesical agent for the treatment of high grade superficial bladder cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c083b1f-8e4a-44bc-9d24-e904e1ba526a\/@p03B8ZDs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Intravesical therapy,Imidazolium salt,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15131"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Uttam Satyal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Weader<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henkel Valentine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Stromyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wiley J.

Compared to cisplatin, organotins give more favorable toxicological profiles and better cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activities. However, organotins have limited biological applications due to their poor water solubility. In this study we synthesized a diphenyltin complex (Diphenyltin Dioxalate) that possesses partial ionic characteristics, by reacting a diprotic carboxylic acid, with triphenyltin chloride in the presence of di-isopropylamine. A tin-carbon cleavage reaction was observed, as IR\/NMR spectroscopy and X-ray Crystallography studies showed that diphenyltin dioxalate was successfully obtained in the reaction. Post synthesis solubility tests were performed to examine diphenyltin dioxalate&#8217;s water-soluble nature, compared to its precursor triphenyltin. Diphenyltin dioxalate was then tested to examine its cytotoxicity and antitumor activity on human glioblastoma cell model (T98G) and a normal human oligodendrocyte cell model (MO3.13). Further studies with the complex will consist of synthetic mechanistic studies on the Sn-C cleavage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5c7535f6-f291-4422-a3d1-4e4fd3c06812\/@p03B8ZDs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor activity,Chemotherapeutics,Organotins,Drug design,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15132"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jade Witter<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuequing Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Taraboletti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tajera Henry<\/i><\/presenter>.

Current treatments for breast cancer are associated with severe side effects. Additionally, TNBC is resistant to hormone therapy commonly used to treat other forms of breast cancer. <i>Tulbaghia violacea,<\/i> a plant native to Southern Africa, is a medicinal herb used in traditional medicine. This study aims to establish the impact of water soluble extracts from <i>T.<\/i> <i>violacea<\/i> on TNBC cancer cell lines and identify any anti-cancer compounds present in this extract.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Following the determination of the IC50 value for this extract. The anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic activities of the extract on the TNBC cell line were determined using scratch assays and cell invasion and migration assays, performed using real time cell analysis. The pro-apoptotic action of the extract on the TNBC cell line was determined using flow cytometry cell death assays. Once the anti-cancer activity of the extract was confirmed, the composition of the extract was determined in order to establish what known or possible anti-cancer compounds are present within it. This was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The structure of these identified compounds was then confirmed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The IC50 value for the <i>T. violacea <\/i>water soluble<i> <\/i>extract against MDA MB 231 cells was determined to be ~350 &#181;g\/mL. The extract was also shown to have anti migration and invasion as well as pro-apoptotic effects on these cells. Fourteen known anti-cancer compounds were identified in this water soluble extract. In addition to this multiple other compounds were shown to also be present in the extract.<br \/><b>Discussion: <\/b>The water soluble <i>T. violacea<\/i> leaf extract has cytotoxic effects and the ability to inhibit proliferation and metastasis in a TNBC cell line. The identification of fourteen compounds with known anti-cancer activity may explain the effects this extract has on these TNBC cells, however, the contribution made by any of the other compounds to this activity remains to be determined.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These findings suggest that one or more of the compounds present in <i>T. violacea<\/i> may serve as lead compounds for the development of new treatments for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f0da551d-3438-451a-8944-10b6d686ceeb\/@q03B8ZDt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Natural products,Antitumor activity,Antiangiogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15133"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zodwa Dlamini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clement Penny<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodney Hull<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammed Alouna<\/i><\/presenter>.

The &#8220;Warburg Effect &#8220;reflecting increased glycolytic activity in the presence of oxygen represents an opportunity to target specific features of cancer to induce selective toxicity to malignantly transformed cells. 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) is a pyruvate analogue that inhibits hexokinase II at the mitochondrial level resulting in cancer cell death. Numerous studies have confirmed activity for 3-BP in human SW480 and HT 29 colon carcinoma, glioblastoma (U373MG), HTP-1 leukemic and other cell lines. Our interest in exploring the activity of 3-BP in human tumor primary culture explants led to the application of the ex vivo analysis of programmed cell death in 19 patient tumors. The intent was to develop concertation ranges for future studies and explore disease-specific activity.<br \/>Methods: Fresh Sterile tumor samples were mechanically and enzymatically disaggregated and 3-dimensional organoids of desired size isolated by density centrifugation. Blood samples were isolated by density centrifugation. Cell suspensions in modified RPMI media were exposed to serial dilutions of 3-BP for 72 hours and then assessed for cell death by morphology, staining characteristics and ATP content by luciferase. Viability was scored against saline-exposed controls, normalized to 100%.<br \/>Results: 3BP reveals activity in human tumor explants. Activity varied by cancer type. Hematologic tumors including NHL, CLL and AML were found sensitive as were several solid tumors including GI and lung cancers. Of interest lower degrees of activity were observed in breast and ovarian cancers that are generally considered chemo-sensitive . Activity in 2 fibrolamellar cancers could suggest a novel therapy for this drug refractory neoplasm. Studies are underway examining 3-BP correlations with other classes of drugs and metabolic inhibitors as well as 3-BP combinatorial potential.

One of the most notable advances in the last decade has been the approval of lurbinectedin for platinum resistant SCLC. Lurbinectedin is a small molecule inhibitor, targeting RNA polymerase II, and binding the minor grooves of DNA to induce double-strand breaks. The dismal SCLC survival rate underscores the need for a novel combination to increase patient survival outcomes. ONC201 is a pro-apoptotic TRAIL-inducing compound that activates the integrated stress response and appears to have efficacy in neuroendocrine tumors including paragangliomas. In our preclinical experiments, we explored the combination of ONC201 and lurbinectedin as a potentially effective treatment regimen for SCLC. Lurbinectedin has been shown to have effective cancer cell killing ability in multiple SCLC cell lines (H1048, H1105, H1882, H1417) at sub-nanomolar concentrations, while sparing healthy lung epithelial tissue cells (cell line HSAEC). We hypothesized that combining ONC201 and lurbinectedin will yield synergistic outcomes due to combining drugs that act by different potentially complementary mechanisms. We treated SCLC cell lines with ONC201 and lurbinectedin at increasing concentrations of the drugs. CellTiter Glo was used to perform cell viability assays, and combination index analysis (Combenefit software) revealed the most synergy between the agents occurred at the concentrations of 0.156 uM ONC201 and 0.047 nM lurbinectedin. We are expanding this combination&#8217;s efficacy in other SCLC lines and tumor types. Western blotting further examined these synergies and showed that PARP cleavage and expression of ATF4 and TRAIL death receptor DR5 were increased at higher concentrations of these agents. We further noted that combinatorial treatment with these agents induced marked upregulation of Phosphorylated Chk1 and CHOP at the highest treatment concentrations versus lower concentrations and control. These effects indicate effectiveness of the combinatorial treatment in causing DNA damage and instability, inducing double-stranded DNA breaks, as well as initiating the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through the integrated stress response, selectively in the malignant cells. Ongoing directions include testing similar concentrations of both ONC201 and lurbinectedin in additional SCLC cell lines, SCLC patient-derived organoids, and in vivo, as well as exploring immune correlates of the drug treatments.<br \/>Keywords: SCLC; lurbinectedin; chemotherapy; imipridones; genomics","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bd900112-c923-4836-b908-402c38b08abd\/@q03B8ZDt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imipridone,Lung cancer: small cell,Genomics,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15139"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nicholas R.

Since TNBC lacks targeted therapy options, the frontline therapy is Paclitaxel, which targets actively dividing cells inducing subsequent apoptosis. Since dormant cells or metastatic cancer cells are not targeted by Paclitaxel, more targeted treatment options are needed. MBQ-167, a small molecule developed by us to target the metastasis drivers Rac and Cdc42, is highly effective in reducing tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models of TNBC (Cruz-Collazo et al., 2021, <i>Molecular Cancer Therapeutics<\/i>). The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that MBQ-167 is a viable candidate for combined therapy with Paclitaxel in TNBC. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of MBQ-167 in combination with Paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells via MTT viability assays and caspase 3\/7 apoptosis, using effective concentrations of MBQ-167 and\/or Paclitaxel for 24, 48, 96 &#38; 120 hrs. We found that individual MBQ-167 or the combination therapy was more effective at 48-120 hrs at reducing cell viability by ~80% compared to ~60% by Paclitaxel treatment alone and significatively increasing apoptosis. Next, we tested individual or combined MBQ-167 (5 mg\/kg 5X a week) and Paclitaxel (10 mg\/kg 1X a week) on SCID mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumors, via intraperitoneal administration. We report a significant reduction in tumor growth and lung metastasis in response to combined MBQ-167 and Paclitaxel compared to either treatment alone. A more aggressive syngeneic model of 4T-1 mouse breast cancer cells in BALB\/c immunocompetent model was used to determine the direct effect of MBQ-167 and Paclitaxel on metastasis. When 4T-1 tumors were surgically removed and MBQ-167, Paclitaxel, or the combination administered for 17 days, the combination treatment, but not individual compounds, significantly reduced lung metastases by ~80%. In conclusion, this study validates the clinical testing of MBQ-167 in combination with Paclitaxel as a potential therapeutic for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb568acd-8aae-4569-a6ca-33872894ef46\/@q03B8ZDt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Small molecule inhibitor,Combination therapy,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15140"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ailed M.

HGSOC is treated with platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapy, to which patients develop resistance over time, leaving them with very limited therapeutic options. Thus, new treatments are needed for these patients. In the present work, we provide evidence for the <i>in vitro<\/i> anti-HGSOC efficacy of the gold complex auranofin (AUF), a compound approved in the clinic in the 1980&#8217;s as an anti-rheumatic agent. AUF targets thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), which is overexpressed in many cancers, including ovarian cancer. Using the Kaplan-Meir plotter database we analyzed that high expression of TrxR1 predicted poor overall survival, suggesting that TrxR1 plays an important role in ovarian cancer progression. We show that AUF impairs the growth of HGSOC cells regardless of Pt sensitivity. HGSOC cells obtained from the same patient when it was clinically sensitive (PEO1) or resistant (PEO4) to Pt-based chemotherapy, were both equally sensitive to the growth inhibition induced by the gold complex in a concentration-dependent manner when using an MTT reduction assay. The toxicity of AUF against HGSOC cells was further studied exposing PEO1 cells to the compound and assessing cell number, cell viability, and cell cycle traverse. Results showed that AUF blocked cell proliferation, reduced viability, and caused accumulation of cells with hypo-diploid DNA content, suggesting a likely apoptosis-mediated cell death mechanism. We confirmed that AUF-triggered lethality was driven by apoptosis by measuring the accumulation of Annexin V positive\/7-AAD negative cells via flow cytometry. We also found out that the lethality of AUF required the induction of oxidative stress because the effect was prevented by the presence of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine. We further show that AUF-induced ROS production is associated with the generation of DNA damage as denoted by the increase in the phosphorylation of the Ser-139 residue of the histone variant H2AX by western blotting thus signaling a genotoxic endpoint. Finally, we generated evidence that the combination of AUF and the Pt agent cisplatin (CDDP) is more potent than either drug alone in inducing lethality in PEO4 cells isolated from a patient when Pt-resistant. In summary, we provide proof-of-principle that the TrxR1 inhibitor AUF impairs the survival capacity of HGSOC cells regardless of their Pt sensitivities, triggering a program of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress that is associated with DNA damage; such toxicity is enhanced when AUF is combined with CDDP. The novelty of this work for cancer research in general and HGSOC in particular is that, as AUF is clinically approved to treat arthritis-related conditions, the compound can be rapidly repositioned as a consolidation therapy following Pt-based standard of care and\/or overcome Pt resistant disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/82d4154c-fa41-4240-966b-bef472c92494\/@q03B8ZDt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage,Apoptosis,Reactive oxygen species,Cisplatin ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15141"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Farah H.

Selinexor is an inhibitor of nuclear exporter XPO1 and is approved in relapsed refractory MM. We recently analyzed RNA-seq from 859 MM patient samples (MMRF CoMMpass study) and compared them to healthy bone marrow samples (GSE114922). After correcting for batch effects, differential gene expression analysis found apoptosis and cell cycle regulation amongst the top upregulated gene pathways in MM. We therefore hypothesized that MM would be sensitive to the combination of the pro-apoptotic drug, venetoclax, and selinexor, which causes cell cycle arrest.<br \/>Using a panel of 8 MM cell lines (U266-B1, KMS12BM, SKMM2, RPMI-8226, LP1, OPM2, KMS12PE, and NCIH929), we performed cell viability assays in increasing concentrations of selinexor, venetoclax, and a combination of the two drugs at 72 hours. Overall, the combination showed synergy in MM cell lines but strikingly, cell lines that possessed t(11;14) were more sensitive to the drug combination and showed enhanced synergy compared to the non-t(11;14). Average Bliss model synergy score were 0.5 in non-t(11;14) and 10.2 in t(11;14) MM cells (&#62;10 indicates synergistic effects and &#60;-10 indicates antagonistic drug effects).<br \/>To better understand molecular mechanisms underlying the observed synergistic effect in t(11;14), we performed western blot analysis in these cell lines treated with selinexor, venetoclax, the combination, or DMSO control for 24 hours. We measured protein levels of Cyclin D1, which is overexpressed in t(11;14) and a cargo of XPO1. We confirmed Cyclin D1 overexpression in t(11;14) cells lines but not in non-t(11;14) cells. Cyclin D1 levels decreased with selinexor, and the reduction was enhanced by adding venetoclax. Additionally, we measured levels of XPO1, p53, MCL-1, and p65, which we have previously shown to be altered by selinexor treatment. While venetoclax monotherapy caused increased MCL-1 expression, this was abrogated by combining with selinexor and the effects were statistically more significant in t(11;14) cell lines.<br \/>Concurrently, two patients with relapsed, refractory t(11;14) MM and disease progression after multiple lines of therapy were treated with venetoclax; however, after initial response, they developed resistance and progressive disease. Based off our preclinical results, selinexor was added to venetoclax and recaptured responses (VGPR and MR, respectively) suggesting a beneficial effect of the combination over single agent venetoclax. To our knowledge, this is the first report of patients with MM treated with the combination of selinexor and venetoclax. Further clinical evaluation of this combination in t(11;14) MM is planned and samples will be collected to better understand the mechanistic correlation between XPO1, BCL2\/MCL-1, and Cyclin D1 levels and response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9ce2ab13-3c96-480b-bacb-46003560d390\/@q03B8ZDt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcl-2 protein family,Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,Cyclin D1,Mcl-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15278"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sana Chaudhry<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nina Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rimpi Khurana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tulasigeri M.

It has been previously disclosed to have single-digit nM anti-proliferative activity in a panel of human cancer cell lines (Ahmed et al., ACS Med Chem Lett, 2020, 11, 1634-1644). It also has significant anti-tumor activity in several models for pancreatic cancer. We have also previously shown that two early-generation ND derivatives are active in both androgen-positive and negative prostate cancer cell lines (Mitchell et al, Biochemistry, 2013, 32, 1429-1436) and that these compounds down-regulate the transcription of quadruplex-containing genes such as c-MYC. We now report that this compound also shows significant anti-proliferative activity in several prostate cancer cell lines, notably with a GI<sub>50<\/sub> value of 3 nM in the PC3 cell line. Abiraterone has a GI<sub>50<\/sub> in this line of 4820 nM. By contrast SOP1812 has a GI<sub>50<\/sub> of 247 nM in the LNCaP line, which is also derived from a patient with metastatic prostate cancer but is androgen positive. The PC3 line is derived from a metastatic carcinoma following androgen suppression therapy and is thus androgen independent and is a model for castration-resistant prostate cancer when hormone therapies are no longer effective. We have evaluated the activity of SOP1812 in the PC3 xenograft model using a twice-weekly 1 mg\/kg dose regimen IV administered, against a saline control and abiraterone, at a daily dose of 200 mg\/kg, administered by the PO route, both over a 28-day period. No weight loss was observed in treated animals with either drug. SOP1812 produced statistically significant tumor shrinkage (P value of 0.0008) relative to the controls, with a T\/C value of 33.5% on day 28. Abiraterone treatment resulted in a T\/C value of 61.6%, with a P value of 0.0382. SOP1812 is bio-available at therapeutic doses and is well tolerated at these levels in this animal model.

Gemcitabine has been used in the treatment of solid tumors, including non-small cell lung, pancreatic, bladder, and breast cancers. Our previous work in pancreatic and lung cancer models demonstrates that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) enhances uptake of albumin and albumin-conjugated drugs. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the presence of Cav-1 expression alters therapeutic efficacy of JNTX-101, a novel albumin encapsulated gemcitabine prodrug.<br \/><b>Experimental design:<\/b> We first determined the treatment efficacy of JNTX-101 in a panel of 4 pancreatic\/lung cancer cell lines (MIAPaCa-2, PANC-1, H23, and HCC15) by alamarBlue cell viability assay. We further established 4 pairs of Cav-1 isogenic cells stably expressing shRNA targeting Cav-1 (shCav-1) or scrambled control shRNA (shCtrl). We investigated whether the absence of Cav-1 expression alters sensitivity of JNTX-101 using alamarBlue cytotoxicity assay and western blotting in both high and low serum conditions. In addition, we tested whether JNTX-101 treatment can alter expression and cellular distribution of Cav-1 as well as other caveolae resident proteins, such as Cav-2 and Cavin-1.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Differences in Cav-1 expression resulted in different uptake of albumin prodrug conjugate and Cav-1 depletion attenuated sensitivity of the cells to JNTX-101. Decreased Cav-1 expression markedly reduced JNTX-101-induced apoptosis in a panel of cells in both high and low serum conditions, but particularly in low serum conditions. In addition, our data showed both serum starvation and JNTX-101 independently increased Cav-1 expression in a time-dependent manner (24hrs, 48hrs, 72hrs) similar to gemcitabine, with peak level at 48 hrs post treatment, while other caveolae resident proteins were minimally affected.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our preliminary results suggest that JNTX-101 effectively inhibits cell viability in pancreatic\/lung cancer cells and Cav-1 expression dictates sensitivity to JNTX-101, at least partially through reduced apoptotic cell death. These data indicate that Cav-1 may be a potential predictive biomarker of JNTX-101 sensitivity, especially in nutrient deprived conditions. Further study will be performed to explore the impact of Cav-1 expression on JNTX-101 sensitivity in mouse models of pancreatic\/lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8743c7cc-f898-47fa-a471-04a26ead31ed\/@q03B8ZDt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor agents,Gemcitabine,Caveolin-1,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15293"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tiantian Cui<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergio Corrales-Guerrero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Maneval<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Curtis Monnig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Kearney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Ellis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Terence M.

Ovarian cancer can be stratified into distinct subtypes of which high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) comprises 90% of all cases. The majority of HGSOC patients are diagnosed with late-stage disease and have a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of less than 30%. Thus, there is a critical need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to improve patient treatment and survival outcomes. Our lab has recently discovered that the small molecule colforsin has potent anti-cancer properties when used to treat HGSOC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Colforsin is a water-soluble derivative of forskolin, and acts as an activator of cAMP signaling via direct binding and activation of adenylyl cyclase. It is currently in clinical use for treatment of conditions such as glaucoma, diabetes, and liver fibrosis. This makes colforsin a prime candidate for drug repurposing to treat ovarian cancer. Our data show that colforsin can induce cell cycle arrest and cell death in established HGSOC cell line models <i>in vitro<\/i>. We have also found that colforsin can inhibit tumor growth and tumor burden in an intraperitoneal model of HGSOC using HEYA8 cells. In addition, we have also found that colforsin acts synergistically with cisplatin to cause HGSOC cell death. Taken together, our data show that colforsin has potential as a new therapeutic tool to aid in HGSOC treatment in combination with existing therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e99cd92e-3db1-44ea-b65c-2f02954f6ca5\/@r03B8ZDu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Therapeutics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15297"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Matthew Knarr<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hunter Reavis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marilyn Mitchell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronny Drapkin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Pathogenic gain-of-function mutations of LRRK2 are associated with aberrant LRRK2 hyperactivity which results in neurotoxicity and protein aggregation caused by dysfunctional autophagy and vesicle trafficking. Thus, the development of LRRK2 inhibitors represents a promising strategy for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Interestingly LRRK2 mutations have also been reported to increase the risk for the onset of different types of cancer (e.g. breast, thyroid, lung). Several studies suggest that LRRK2 is involved in the regulation of different cancer-related pathways (e.g. ATM-p53-p21-pathway, JNK pathway). Deregulation of LRRK2 activity caused by mutations has been shown to interfere with these pathways thereby increasing the risk to develop certain types of cancer. Since anti-cancer treatments mostly target the same pathways, we hypothesized that LRRK2 inhibitors may affect anti-cancer treatments in specific cancer cell types. In this study we report on the analyses of various inhibitors (e.g. MLi-2 and PF-06447475) on LRRK2 autophosphorylation at S935 in a cellular phosphorylation assay using the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 in comparison to biochemical LRRK2 activity assays. Furthermore, we compare the direct LRRK2 inhibitor effect on the proliferation of 140 cell lines, as well as their potential combinatorial impact on the potency of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. Adriamycin). The observed effects can help to understand the implications of pharmaceutical LRRK2 inhibition in the treatment of both Parkinson&#8217;s disease and cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/22725ffc-70b9-416c-ad68-d19abd473a77\/@r03B8ZDu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,LRRK2,Cancer therapy,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15545"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Franziska Fimm-Todt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joachim Lauterwasser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva-Maria Egenter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Weber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Feger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katharina Schaich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Ulrich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Siedentopf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Totzke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Kubbutat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Erik Ehlert<\/i><\/presenter>.
