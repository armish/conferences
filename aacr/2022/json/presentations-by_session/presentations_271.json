SCLCs display intertumoral heterogeneity; high neuroendocrine (NE) tumors evolve with treatment and time in a largely MYC driven manner to a chemotherapy resistant non-NE state. Lurbinectedin, an RNA Pol-II inhibitor which causes DNA damage through binding ERCC5 was approved as second line therapy in 2020, with an overall response rate of 35% in patients with relapsed SCLC. However, these responses are short-lived and the majority of patient still succumb to their disease. A trial testing the combination of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin failed to improve survival compared with standard-of-care. We assessed lurbinectedin in combination with 43 other agents in SCLC cells. The top synergistic hit was the clinically relevant ATR inhibitor berzosertib which was 4-fold more synergistic than doxorubicin. Compared with lurbinectedin alone, the combination with berzosertib caused a 3.5-fold increase in DNA damage while significantly reducing the ability of cells to sense this damage by inhibiting &#947;H2AX induction. This led to continued DNA replication even in the presence of lurbinectedin induced DNA damage, causing mitotic catastrophe and cell death. The combination was highly synergistic in 6 of 9 SCLC cell lines tested. Synergy was inversely correlated with p21 RNA and protein expression. The canonical role of p21 is to inhibit G1\/S transition, and we found that thymidine induced G1 arrest inhibited synergy, while p21 knock-down increased the synergy. Interestingly, we observed synergy was inversely correlated with NE differentiation. In a high NE high p21 mouse model of SCLC, lurbinectedin alone was highly effective, with the combination showing little improvement. Conversely in a non-NE low p21 mouse model, lurbinectedin treatment alone was less effective, however the addition of berzosertib was synergistic and significantly improved efficacy. Overall, this work demonstrated berzosertib augments lurbinectedin efficacy in the recalcitrant non-NE SCLC subsets, and supported the development of a clinical trial testing lurbinectedin and berzosertib in SCLC patients NCT04802174.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synergism,Biomarkers,Lung cancer: small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher William Schultz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiqing Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuhisa Murai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darawalee Wangsa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Devon Atkinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liton Saha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Elenbaas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chien-Fei Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Astrid Zimmerman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Ried<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Zenke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoe Weaver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajaa Elmeskini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yves Pommier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anish Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>.

The PARP family consists of seventeen enzymes that regulate fundamental biological processes including response to cellular stress. PARP7 (TIPARP) is a stress-induced mono-ART that catalyzes the transfer of a single unit of ADP-ribose onto substrates (MARylation) to regulate their function and plays a role in suppressing the Type I IFN response in tumor cells (Gozgit 2021 Cancer Cell). RBN-2397 is the first potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of PARP7 catalytic function. To investigate the cell autonomous effects of PARP7 inhibition, we performed a cell line screen to identify PARP7 dependent cancer cell lines. We found that treatment of a subset of lines across several cancers led to a robust decrease in cell viability. Additionally, dosing of tumor bearing mice led to complete regressions in NCI-H1373 lung cancer xenografts. To investigate the mechanism of action (MOA) leading to decreased cell viability, we treated NCI-H1373 cells with RBN-2397 and found accumulation of cells in the G<sub>0<\/sub>\/G<sub>1<\/sub> phase of the cell cycle indicative of a cell cycle arrest. This arrest in NCI-H1373 cells was associated with the induction of senescence and increased mRNA expression of senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes. To evaluate the in vivo MOA, we performed an NCI-H1373 xenograft study and collected tumors after 7 days of RBN-2397 treatment. PARP7 inhibition led to decreased expression of Ki67, and increased expression of P21 and cleaved caspase-3, suggesting decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Increased expression of SASP genes was also observed in RBN-2397 treated tumors. Finally, we investigated transcriptional changes after RBN-2397 treatment by RNA sequencing. In addition to the effects observed in Type I IFN signaling, we also observed differential expression of genes associated with other pathways including autophagy and energy metabolism. Further evaluation of key autophagy proteins revealed that RBN-2397 affects autophagy flux and leads to a decrease in the oxygen consumption rate of cells and reduced ATP production from the mitochondria, suggesting that a change in energy metabolism may be related to the tumor intrinsic effect of RBN-2397. In summary, we show treatment of cancer cells with RBN-2397 not only leads to activation of tumor cell IFN signaling, but also causes G1 arrest and senescence, and changes in cancer cell autophagy and energy metabolism. In vivo, RBN-2397 treatment leads to complete tumor regressions in xenografts accompanied by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of tumor cells. RBN-2397 is currently being evaluated in the clinic as single agent in selected cancer types (NCT04053673) and in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP,Small molecule inhibitor,Therapeutic target,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer R.

PTEN-loss stimulates activity of the mTOR pathway, while amplification of MYC leads to increased ribosome biogenesis and elevated mRNA translation rate. Our previous work has demonstrated the efficacy of co-targeting ribosome biogenesis, via inhibition of RNA Pol I activity, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation to suppress prostate cancer growth <i>in vivo<\/i> in GEMM of PCa and in patient-derived xenografts (Rebello et al., <i>Clinical Cancer Research<\/i>, 2016; Lawrence et al., <i>European Urology<\/i>, 2018).<br \/>In a collaboration with Pimera Inc., we investigated the efficacy of their new lead RNA Pol I inhibitor PMR-116 in models of prostate cancer. PMR-116 is well tolerated <i>in vivo<\/i> in mice and can be given at 300mg\/kg weekly. Using the Hi-MYC mouse model of PCa we show that dosing 6 month old mice once weekly for 4 weeks can decrease the incidence of invasive lesions by up to 85% compared to vehicle control while reverting glands to patterns of low grade intraepithelial neoplasia. PMR-116 rapidly inhibits proliferation in the Hi-MYC model with a 50% decrease in Ki67 observed 12 hours after oral administration. Conversely, PMR-116 showed minimal anti-tumour efficacy in the PTEN-null model of PCa suggesting that elevated MYC signalling may be required for optimal response.<br \/>To further validate our promising GEMM results in more clinically relevant human-derived models, we used patient-derived xenografts lines we established from multidrug-resistant, metastatic PCa (Lawrence et al, <i>European Urology<\/i>, 2018). PMR-116 treatment decreased tumour volume in all PDX tested including complete response in a line in which tumour volume decreased by ~90% compared to baseline.<br \/>We believe this new RNA Pol I inhibitor shows promising results in a wide range of preclinical models and may exert higher efficacy in tumours expressing high levels of MYC.

Many cancer indications have a high frequency of mutations in the Hippo pathway. These pro-tumor mutations lead to constitutive TEAD transcription factor activation, which drives gene expression involved in cell growth and pro-survival signaling. To target cancers harboring mutations in the Hippo pathway, we have discovered and are developing IK-930, a novel small molecule that selectively inhibits TEAD-dependent transcription by directly blocking autopalmitoylation. IK-930 prevents this critical post-translational modification that is required for the functional interaction of TEAD with two transcriptional activators, YAP1 and TAZ (<i>WWTR1<\/i>). IK-930 inhibits in vitro proliferation of Hippo pathway-deficient cancer cell lines, but not Hippo pathway wild type cells. In human mesothelioma xenografts, IK-930 downregulates TEAD-dependent genes. Daily oral administration of IK-930 resulted in antitumor activity in Hippo-dysregulated mesothelioma xenograft models. In <i>EGFR<\/i> or <i>KRAS<\/i> mutated tumors, IK-930 enhanced apoptosis and <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity in combination with EGFR and MEK inhibitors, respectively. IK-930 is inactive in a broad panel of kinases, receptors, and transporters, furthering evidence of selectivity. Multispecies pharmacokinetic analysis and additional <i>in vitro<\/i> ADME properties imply favorable pharmacokinetic properties, with a low potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions. To identify indications that may be dependent on TEAD we evaluated tumor types for the incidence of gene alterations in the Hippo pathway, as well as for YAP1 and TAZ activation. YAP1 and TAZ activation was assessed by evaluating nuclear protein expression in tumor tissue microarrays. These analyses showed high YAP1 nuclear expression in tumors with frequent genetic alterations, that may help guide the development of IK-930. Mesothelioma ranks top among tumor types evaluated, due to high prevalence of YAP1 nuclear expression and Hippo pathway genetic alterations, which are predominantly mutations and copy number alterations in the tumor suppressor NF2. In summary, Hippo pathway dysregulation has been implicated in the etiology of multiple tumor types, including mesothelioma. IK-930 is a selective and potent TEAD inhibitor expected to enter the clinic in early 2022. Our analysis pointed to tumors with genetic alterations driving aberrant Hippo signaling. IK-930 demonstrates efficacy in tumor models representing these indications and beneficial combination activity with other targeted therapies. Taken together, these data have informed the clinical development plan for IK-930.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,Small molecule inhibitor,YAP\/TAZ,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Benjamin S.

The most common mutation in BRAF is V600E (Class I), occurring in half of malignant melanomas. This mutation hyperactivates ERK and signals as a RAF inhibitor-sensitive monomer. BRAF inhibitors including vemurafenib, dabrafenib and encorafenib have produced impressive responses in V600X patients, however resistance usually emerges within a year, including RAS mutation, BRAF<sup>V600E <\/sup>amplification, and BRAF<sup>V600E <\/sup>intragenic deletion or splice variants. These inhibitors are also ineffective against non-V600 BRAF mutants (Class II &#38; III). To address some of these limitations we have developed CFT1946, a bifunctional degradation activating compound (BiDAC&#8482;) degrader comprising a BRAF kinase domain targeting ligand linked to a cereblon ligand. CFT1946 is capable of degrading BRAF V600E (Class I), G469A (Class II), G466V (Class III) mutations, and the p61-BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> splice variant while maintaining exquisite selectivity against the proteome including WT BRAF and CRAF. In A375 cells, CFT1946 potently degraded BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> (E<sub>max<\/sub> = 26%; DC<sub>50<\/sub> = 14nM at 24hr) and, inhibited ERK phosphorylation (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 11nM at 24hr) and cell growth (GI<sub>50<\/sub> = 94nM at 96hr) while having no effect in the mutant KRAS driven cell line HCT116. In A375 xenografts, oral delivery of CFT1946 resulted in deeper tumor regressions when dosed at 10 mg\/kg PO BID and compared favorably to a clinically relevant dose of encorafenib. We further evaluated CFT1946 in an engineered A375-BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>\/NRAS<sup>Q61K<\/sup> double mutant model of BRAF inhibitor resistance. CFT1946 was able to degrade BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> in these cells and was much more effective than encorafenib at inhibiting viability <i>in vitro<\/i>. In this model, <i>in vivo<\/i> dosing of single agent CFT1946 caused robust tumor growth inhibition and combination with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib, resulted in tumor regressions. The combination of encorafenib and trametinib showed no activity in the same model. Next, we demonstrated that CFT1946 was able to degrade additional BRAF mutant proteins including G469A (Class II), G466V (Class III), and the p61-BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> splice variant using heterologous expression in HEK293T cells. Additionally, we also showed that CFT1946, but not encorafenib, inhibited proliferation of the BRAF<sup>G466V<\/sup> heterozygous lung tumor cell line H1666. Based on its activity in preclinical models, including models of BRAF inhibitor resistance, and its drug-like properties we are progressing CFT1946 as a candidate for clinical development in patients with solid tumors bearing BRAF V600X mutations. Further, given CFT1946&#8217;s activity on non-V600 BRAF mutations, we are continuing to explore CFT1946 and related BiDAC degraders as therapeutic options for patients bearing Class II or Class III BRAF mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Cancer,Cancer therapy,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mathew E.

As an epigenetic regulator, PRMT5 plays essential roles in promoting cancer growth and survival, including through mechanisms that control alternative splicing and RNA processing, and the expression of DNA damage repair genes. Spliceosome mutations have been suggested to represent a potential biomarker for PRMT5 inhibitors, and our previous work highlighted this sensitivity in SF3B1<sup>R625C\/G<\/sup> expressing uveal melanoma cells. Here, we highlight <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> activity of PRT543, a potent, selective, and orally available PRMT5 inhibitor, in cancer cells harboring mutations in other spliceosome factors such as U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1) and RNA binding motif protein 10 (RBM10). Mutations in U2AF1 (including S34F hotspot mutations) and RBM10 (primarily loss of function (LOF) mutations) occur in 5-10% of all non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Cell proliferation (10-day assay) was assessed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines treated with PRT543, either wild-type or harboring U2AF1<sup>S34F<\/sup> or RBM10<sup>LOF <\/sup>mutations. Strikingly, both U2AF1<sup>S34F<\/sup> and RBM10<sup>LOF<\/sup> cell lines were significantly more sensitive to PRT543 compared to wild-type cell lines. Furthermore, PRT543 induced significant dose-related tumor growth inhibition at well-tolerated doses in cell-line derived xenograft (CDX) models harboring the U2AF1<sup>S34F<\/sup> or RBM10<sup>LOF<\/sup> mutation. Consistent with our previous findings in other tumor types, PRT543 decreased expression of DNA damage repair-associated genes (e.g. BRCA1, RAD51AP1, FANCA, and FANCL) in U2AF1<sup>S34F<\/sup> or RBM10<sup>LOF<\/sup> mutant NSCLC cells. Combination with PRT543 increased the effectiveness of specific chemotherapeutic agents in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> (CDX) models of U2AF1<sup>S34F<\/sup> and RBM10<sup>LOF<\/sup> NSCLC. Efficacy studies in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, as well as genomic profiling of spliceosome-mutant cellular models in response to PRT543 are ongoing. PRT543 is currently under evaluation in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies (NCT03886831).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Spliceosome,NSCLC,Epigenetics,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jack Carter<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koichi Ito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Venkat Thodima<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monisha Sivakumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hulse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Rager<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Komali Vykuntam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neha Bhagwat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kris Vaddi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce Ruggeri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peggy Scherle<\/i><\/presenter>.

Increasing evidences demonstrated that PRMT5 is a potential therapeutic target. Given the essential role in maintenance of adult hematopoietic cells, inhibition of PRMT5 leads to hematological toxicity. Anemia is the most common treatment related adverse event observed by PRMT5 inhibitor, such as GSK3326595, which limited the dose escalation. Therefore, developing a PRMT5 inhibitor with tumor-biased distribution could be an effective approach to avoid these target related toxicities. In this study, a novel and high selective PRMT5 inhibitor, SCR-6277 was identified. SCR-6277 inhibited the PRMT5 enzyme with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 1.5 nM, and showed a high selectivity against other five methyltransferase isoforms (selectivity folds &#62;1000). SCR-6277 potently inhibited the PRMT5-mediated SDMA production in Z-138 cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 0.6 nM) and the cell proliferation (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 3 nM). SCR-6277 also demonstrated robustly anti-proliferation activities on multiple PRMT5 proficient solid tumor cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 20 - 130 nM) and no inhibitory effects on PRMT5 deficient cell lines. SCR-6277 had good oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. In Z-138 and 5637 xenograft models, SCR-6277 robustly inhibited tumor growth. In contrast to GSK3326595, SCR-6277 showed tumor biased distribution. Exposure of SCR-6277 in tumors were 50 folds higher than that in plasma. The extremely high T\/P ratio made SCR-6277 achieve the better anti-tumor activities at lower blood exposure (Table 1). In conclusion, SCR-6277 is a novel, potent and high selective PRMT5 inhibitor. And higher tumor\/plasma distribution ratio predicts SCR-6277 is a more tolerant and effective PRMT5 inhibitor in human.
