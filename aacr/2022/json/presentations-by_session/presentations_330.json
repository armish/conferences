[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Allele-specific KRAS inhibitors are an emerging class of cancer therapies. <i>KRAS<sup>mut<\/sup> <\/i>non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) exhibit heterogenous outcomes, driven by differences in underlying biology shaped by co-mutations. In contrast to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> NSCLC, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> NSCLC is associated with low\/never smoking status and has not been characterized in depth.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We examined characteristics of patients with advanced <i>KRAS<sup>mut<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC seen at a single center. RECISTv1.1 and Cox-proportional hazards models adjusting for line of therapy and performance status were used to compare outcomes to immunotherapy. Benjamini-Hochberg corrected q-values were used for genomic comparisons.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of 1,823 patients with <i>KRAS<sup>mut<\/sup> <\/i>NSCLC, 16% (n=283) harbored KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> which was mutually exclusive from other targetable alterations. Among these, the median age was 66 (range 20-92), 0.7% had squamous histology, 30% had a never\/light smoking history (&#60;10 pack-years, KRAS<sup>G12D,light-sm<\/sup>) and 43% had a high pack-year smoking history (&#8805;30 pack-years, KRAS<sup>G12D,high-sm<\/sup>). Compared to KRAS<sup>non-G12D <\/sup>NSCLC, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> NSCLC had a lower pack-year smoking history (median 22 vs 30, p&#60;0.0001), more commonly had <i>NKX2-1<\/i> and <i>CDKN2A <\/i>co-mutations (q&#60;0.05), and less commonly had <i>STK11<\/i> co-mutations (q&#60;0.05). KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> had lower PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) (median 1% vs 10%, p=0.01) and lower tumor mutation burden (TMB) compared to KRAS<sup>non-G12D<\/sup> (median 8.3 v 9.9 mt\/Mb, p&#60;0.0001). Compared with KRAS<sup>G12D,high-sm<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12D,light-sm <\/sup>had lower PD-L1 TPS (median 0% vs 10%, p=0.005) and TMB (median 6.1 vs 9.9 mt\/Mb, p&#60;0.0001).As compared to patients with KRAS<sup>non-G12D <\/sup>(n=120) NSCLC and adequate baseline tissue for multiplex-immunofluorescence, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> (n=25) had fewer CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (median 13 vs 32 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p=0.04), PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (median 90 vs 135 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p=0.03), and lower proportion of PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor and immune cells (median 1.2% vs 3.3%, p=0.06 and median 3.4% vs 7.5%, p=0.01, respectively).Among the subset of patients with advanced <i>KRAS<sup>mut<\/sup> <\/i>NSCLC who received immunotherapy (n=57 with KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, n=411 with KRAS<sup>non-G12D<\/sup>), there was no difference in clinical outcomes to anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy between KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>non-G12D<\/sup> (ORR: 18% vs 26%, p=0.3; mPFS: 2.8 vs 3.9 months, aHR 0.86 95% CI 0.60-1.25; mOS: 7.4 vs 15.1 months, aHR 0.77 95% CI 0.51-1.16). Similarly, there was no difference in clinical outcomes to chemo-immunotherapy between KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>non-G12D<\/sup> (ORR: 18% vs 39%, p=0.10; mPFS: 6.3 vs 7.0 months, aHR 0.79 95% CI 0.43-1.43; mOS: 14.0 vs 20.8 months, aHR 0.72 95% CI 0.38-1.35).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>lung cancers harbor distinct clinical, genomic, and immunologic features compared to other KRAS mutated lung cancers and numerically worse outcomes to PD-(L)1 blockade-based therapies. Drug development for KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>lung cancers will have to take these differences into account.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b91817f1-803e-4b03-b7be-111441c6fc18\/@A03B8ZCp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,KRAS,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11954"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jia Luo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Biagio Ricciuti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joao V.

BM are a further challenge to treat. We previously reported NGS timing in relation to start of first-line Tx (1L) for pts with <i>MET<\/i>ex14 NSCLC in the RW. Here we provide overall survival (OS) data, including subgroup analyses for pts with known BM prior to 1L initiation.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Data originating from ~280 US cancer clinics (~800 sites of care) from the US electronic health record-derived de-identified Flatiron Health Foundation Medicine clinico-genomic database (FH-FMI CGDB) were evaluated. Pts were &#8805;18 yrs, diagnosed with advanced\/metastatic NSCLC from Jan 1, 2011, with NGS-confirmed <i>MET<\/i>ex14, &#8805;1 line of Tx, and &#8805;90 days follow-up from 1L initiation to cutoff date (Dec 2020). Pts treated with capmatinib or tepotinib were excluded. We examined Tx patterns and OS for pts with and without known BM before starting 1L, and OS for pts with an NGS report before or on\/after 1L initiation (time from 1L initiation to death or censoring, analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method with left truncation adjustment to mitigate bias due to the prerequisite for NGS testing). HRs were estimated using Cox regression models with covariates adjustment to estimate risk of death.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The analysis included 156 <i>MET<\/i>ex14 NSCLC pts: median age 75 yrs, 59% females, 85.3% non-squamous (NSQ), 9% squamous cell carcinoma (SQ), and 64% had history of smoking.<b> <\/b>A total of 31 pts (20%) had BM before 1L initiation: median age 73 yrs, 61% females, 94% NSQ, 0% SQ, and 71% had history of smoking.

Median OS for pts with BM was 8.11 mo (95% CI, 6.0-19.8) and 14.39 mo (11.1-22.1) for pts without BM, corresponding to a 73% increase in risk of death for pts with BM vs pts without BM by univariate analysis (HR 1.73 [95% CI, 1.06-2.82]; <i>P<\/i>=0.03). Median OS for pts with an NGS report before and on\/after 1L initiation was 13.3 mo (8.8-26.2) and 6.8 mo (0.03-19.8), respectively (<i>P=<\/i>0.45); HR by multivariate analysis was 0.78 (0.45-1.35) when comparing pts with NGS report before vs on\/after 1L initiation.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Tx patterns in 1L were similar for pts with or without BM at time of 1L initiation; presence of BM prior to 1L was associated with inferior outcomes.

Certain molecular subtypes of EGFR may be more responsive. There is a lack of clarity on the genomic and immune profiles of EGFR subtypes, and further elucidation of this may assist in optimally identifying those likely to respond to immune-based therapies.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Profiles of 5,510 lung adenocarcinoma specimens were obtained utilizing next-generation sequencing of 592 genes (Caris Life Sciences) and categorized by EGFR subtype. PD-L1 expression (Ab: 22c3), tumor mutational burden (TMB), immune cell type fractions, and co-mutations in TP53 were assessed by EGFR subtype and compared to wild-type (WT) tumors.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Of the total cohort, 791 (14.4%) were EGFR-mutant (Table). Among EGFR-mutant tumors, exon 19 deletions were most common (49.7%), followed by L858R, (32.9%), exon 20 insertions (13.0%), L861Q (2.9%), and G719X (1.5%). PD-L1 positivity of each EGFR subtype as compared to WT did not vary, except for L858R tumors which had a significantly lower percentage of PD-L1 positive cases. Exon 19 deletion, L858R, and exon 20 insertion tumors were significantly less likely to have high PD-L1 or high TMB compared to WT. Among the EGFR subtypes, L861Q and G719X tumors had the greatest percentage with high TMB. TP53 co-mutations were frequent in EGFR tumors, especially among L861Q and G719X tumors. Exon 19 deletion and L858R tumors had significantly less CD8+ and greater CD4+ T cell fractions compared to WT. Neutrophil and M2 macrophage cell fractions were significantly higher in exon 19 deletion, L858R, and exon 20 insertion tumors compared to WT.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Most subtypes of EGFR have profiles consistent with decreased immunogenicity; however L861Q and C719X tumors have a greater percentage with high TMB or TP53 co-mutations. Such features in uncommon EGFR subtypes may correlate with responsiveness to immune-based therapies and warrant further study.<table class=\"AbstractTable\"

Lorlatinib, a selective third-generation inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), is a treatment option for ALK-positive NSCLC patients who previously failed on ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Larotrectinib, a highly selective tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor, is a treatment option for NSCLC with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) mutation. Herein, we present an acquired TPM3-NTRK1 fusion resistant to larotrectinib in lung adenocarcinoma with EML4-ALK fusion progressed on lorlatinib.<br \/>Case Presentation: A 48-year-old male with stage IV adenocarcinoma of lung with metastatic disease of bone was initially treated with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab. Follow up CT in 4 months showed numerous hepatic lesions and liver biopsy demonstrated large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Upon progression of disease (PD), systemic therapy regimen was switched to combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab. After two months since starting the new regimen, a second PD was observed. Follow-up MRI brain demonstrated multiple small metastatic lesions. Subsequently, he was started on alectinib 600 mg twice a day given EML 4-ALK fusion mutation [4.8% of variant allele frequency (VAF)] in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) NGS assay. Follow-up CT chest in 5 months showed 5 mm left lower lobe nodule which remained unchanged in size. He maintained SD for 9 months before repeat MRI brain demonstrated PD with new leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Subsequently, he received whole brain radiotherapy and the treatment regimen was switched to lorlatinib 100 mg daily. In 7-week follow-up CT, the 5 mm nodule in the left lower lobe was stable. Follow-up MRI brain in 16 weeks showed decrease in size and number of numerous enhancing parenchymal and leptomeningeal lesions. Overall SD was maintained for 8 months before follow-up MRI brain showed new punctate lesions. Repeat ctDNA NGS assay revealed new TPM3-NTRK1 fusion (VAF 0.2%) and ALK L1196M (VAF 2.8%), and a decision was made to add larotrectinib 100 mg daily. The 6-week follow-up MRI brain showed new parenchymal brain metastases.<br \/>Discussion: It has been reported that the development of ALK resistance mutations may be associated with specific EML4-ALK variants. However, the influence of the specific EML4-ALK variants in NSCLC was not fully investigated. We report the case of acquired TPM3-NTRK1 fusion resistant to larotrectinib and acquired ALK L1196M in lung adenocarcinoma with EML4-ALK fusion progressed on lorlatinib. Further investigations are warranted to explore the mechanism of resistance to ALK TKIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95a9b7f9-3415-4c9f-8690-ea24729f014f\/@s03B8ZCq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,ALK,Targeted therapy,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11986"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Horyun Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinah Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeun Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leeseul Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Na Hyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/presenter>.

Treatment options are limited with no approved systemic adjuvant therapy and the disease requires frequent surgical resection to prevent airway obstruction. Therefore, expanding available treatment options remains a highly important, but unmet need in RRP. Herein, we present a case of RRP with squamous cell carcinoma of lung that demonstrated durable stable disease with nivolumab and subsequent bevacizumab.<br \/>Case presentation: A 48-year-old woman with long standing RRP since teenager, who underwent multiple microsuspension laryngoscopies, debridements including laryngeal lesions, and ultimately, 5 years ago, video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) resection of right upper lobe mass, confirming squamous cell carcinoma, has been managed with debulking surgery on tracheal lesions by ENT on regular basis. Nivolumab, a programmed death-1 blockade, 3 mg\/kg every 2 weeks was started given squamous cell carcinoma of lung. Stable disease (SD) in lung lesions was achieved on nivolumab for one year but she required more frequent debulking of tracheal lesions. After multidisciplinary discussion with Otorhinolaryngology, she was started on bevacizumab, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, 10 mg\/kg every 6 weeks. Follow-up CT scans in 10 weeks showed a decrease in size of a left lower lobe mass to 27 mm from 32 mm in the previous image. After one year, administration of bevacizumab was spaced out to every 12 weeks. She requires less debulking surgery and the last debulking surgery was approximately 3 years ago. She maintains SD for over 4 years since starting bevacizumab.<br \/>Discussion: Our patient with RRP and squamous cell carcinoma of lung demonstrated SD on nivolumab before she was switched to bevacizumab. In addition, her SD on bevacizumab of more than 4 years with 12 weeks of maintenance interval is encouraging as there is no current standard of care treatment for RRP. Despite difficulty in running clinical trials in RRP due to its rareness, additional studies evaluating the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor or anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody on RRP are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ebe39c8-c9c0-4363-9df7-629c5dfff8ae\/@s03B8ZCq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor,Squamous cell carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Human papillomavirus (HPV),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11943"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Horyun Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinah Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeun Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leeseul Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/presenter>.

There are currently no approved BRAF targeted therapies for patients whose tumors bear BRAF class II or III alterations. This research utilizes the GuardantINFORM<sup>TM<\/sup> clinical-genomic database to assess the real-world occurrence and outcomes of patients with oncogenic BRAF alterations by distinct classes across solid tumors.&#8203;<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This observational study utilized a database containing clinical and genomic data from ~160,000 cancer patients with ctDNA profiling by the Guardant360 assay. Patients were categorized using a broad list of known and putative class I, II or III BRAF alterations compiled from published sources. Patients were stratified by BRAF mutant class for real-world overall survival analyses.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The analysis identified a cohort of over 5,890 patients with oncogenic BRAF alterations. Class II and III alterations were present in more than 2% of all ctDNA positive patients and made up approximately 55% of all the oncogenic BRAF alterations. Class II and III accounted for 65%, 30% and 20% of oncogenic BRAF alterations in NSCLC, CRC and melanoma respectively. NSCLC and melanoma patients with class II or III BRAF alterations experienced shorter overall survival relative to patients with class I alterations.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The analysis of this large real-world dataset identified a substantial number of cancer patients with BRAF class II and III alterations.

RWD coupled with genomic data provides an opportunity to identify the association between certain genomic alterations and response to current standard of care (SOC). Such analyses may help identify predictive biomarkers to select patients who will benefit most from SOC, and\/or potential therapeutic nodes that can be pharmacologically targeted to overcome resistance to SOC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We obtained Flatiron CGDB Breast Cancer (as of Q3 2020 release) data set. This data set includes clinical and genomic data from 6,918 breast cancer patients. Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) was used as real world outcome. We performed two types of genomic-outcome association analysis: 1) Use Cox proportional hazards regression model to identify which baseline mutation (mutation occurred prior to the treatment) could predict the outcome; and 2) use Fisher exact test to identify which mutations are enriched in post-treatment tumors samples, compared to pre-treatment tumor samples.<br \/><b>Result<\/b> We found TP53 mutation is associated with shorter TTD for Palbociclib + Aromatase inhibitor (AI); Palbociclib + Fulvestrant; and endocrine monotherapy. It is consistent with the reports that TP53 mutation is poor prognostic factor (ref). Interestingly, <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation is associated with shorter TTD for Palbociclib + AI and AI monotherapy; but not associated with TTD for Palbociclib + Fulvestrant or Fulvestrant monotherapy. On the other hand, MYC amplification is associated shorter TTD for Palbociclib + Fulvestrant or Fulvestrant monotherapy. We found that genes associated with Palbociclib + Endocrine are by and large same as those associated with endocrine monotherapy; suggesting the association is largely driven by endocrine treatment. Comparison of post-treatment vs. pre-treatment analysis found that <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation is enriched in post treatment of AI; but not Fulvestrant.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> We demonstrated that real-world clinicogenomic data could identify the biologically meaningful genomic biomarkers that are associated with real world response. This study warrants the further investigation of novel genomic biomarkers identified from the analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb63856f-3b9b-4508-a870-1c448ca469b2\/@s03B8ZCq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Breast cancer,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Endocrine resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11955"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kun Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tenghui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manav Korpal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ping Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaojie Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lihua Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yonghong Xiao<\/i><\/presenter>.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of HER2-low and HER2-zero metastatic breast cancer in the real world.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Female patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer and low HER2 expression or HER2-zero expression between 2010 and 2017, and who received systematic therapy, were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB). The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is a nationwide oncology outcomes database that collects information on approximately 70% of all new invasive cancer diagnoses in the United States.HER2-Low was defined as IHC1+ or 2+\/ISH negative, whereas HER2-zero was defined as IHC0, based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology\/College of American Pathologists guideline. The primary outcome was overall survival(OS). A multivariable Cox regression model was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HR), adjusting for age, race\/ethnicity, education, comorbidities, grade, presence of visceral metastasis, and the type of cancer center where patients were treated. The analyses were stratified by hormone receptor status.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 22817 of 33417 (68%) were HER2-low and 10600 (32%) were HER2-zero. Hormone receptor-positivity was in 19988 (88%) with HER2-low tumors, whereas 8112 (77%) was in HER2-zero tumors. Women with HER2-low tumors had significantly longer overall survival (OS) than did with Her2-zero tumors in both hormone receptor-positive (median OS 39.0 months vs 37.1 months; adjusted HR: 0.93, 95%CI (0.90-0.96), p&#60;0.001) and hormone receptor-negative groups (median OS 15.8 months vs 14.1 months; adjusted HR: 0.92 95%CI (0.86-0.98), p=0.005).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In the metastatic setting, HER2-low tumors have a better survival than HER2-zero tumors, irrespective of hormone receptor status.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether results of genomic testing are associated with receipt of targeted therapy (i.e. VEGFi and EGFRi), and whether receipt of first-line targeted therapy is associated with survival among patients with mCRC.<br \/>Methods: Using the nationwide de-identified electronic health record-derived Flatiron Health database, we included 10,168 patients with de novo mCRC diagnosed between 2013-2020 and tested for at least one of the above biomarkers at any time. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, beginning follow-up at date of metastatic diagnosis and continued until death or end of follow-up, adjusted for age, sex, race\/ethnicity, mutation status (mutant vs. wild type (WT)), tumor site (colon vs. rectum), mismatch repair (MMR), comorbidities, ECOG status, payer type, and first-line (1L) treatment, to investigate the associations between: 1) mutation status and 1L treatment; and 2) 1L treatment and overall survival.<br \/>Results: Overall, 9.5% did not have documented 1L treatment. Among patients with 1L treatment documented (n=9,202), the most common were FOLFOX+VEGFi (36.3%), followed by FOLFOX alone (15.8%), single-agent capecitabine (7.2%), and FOLFIRI+VEGFi (5.0%). After adjusting for treatment, patients with KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutant tumors had worse survival than those WT for all three: (HR: 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-1.42), (HR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.04-1.47), and (HR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.57-2.00), respectively. Of patients with RAS mutations, 59.8% received VEGFi, regardless of chemotherapy backbone. Contrary to outcomes reported from clinical trials, we observed similar survival in patients treated with VEGFi, compared to those without (HR: 1.03, (0.95-1.12)). Among patients with RAS WT tumors, 51.6% received VEGFi, but had no survival benefits (HR:1.06 (0.96-1.17)). About 1% of patients RAS mutant and 15.9% of RAS WT tumors received EGFRi regardless of chemotherapy backbone, and experienced better survival than those treated with VEGFi (HR: 0.88 (0.77-1.00). We observed no differences in survival by treatment among those with BRAF<i> <\/i>mutations.<br \/>Conclusions: Treatment with VEGFi was common. However, contrary to survival data from clinical trials, which exclude vulnerable populations, patients treated with VEGFi did not experience survival benefits, highlighting the importance of examining survival outcomes in routine clinical care. In patients with RAS WT tumors, treatment with EGFRi was associated with improved survival compared with those treated with VEGFi. Future studies should incorporate tumor sidedness and contraindications to determine appropriateness of treatment with VEGFi or EGFRi in patients with mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d79307a-7aac-4bf5-bc4a-018f13b59fab\/@s03B8ZCq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Biomarkers,Survival,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11946"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ben D.

PCFHTCL is comprised of small to medium lymphocytes that express CD4, CD19, Bcl6, PD1, ICOS, CXCR5, and CXCL13. While it tends to have mostly an indolent course, occasionally PCFHTCL may display a more aggressive pattern. We conducted this analysis to explore the key clinicopathologic characteristics of this rare and little-known entity.<br \/>Methods: In order to study the demographic characteristics, molecular and immunohistochemical signatures, therapeutic interventions, survival, and prognostic factors, we compiled a pooled database of 57 cases. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed. Cox proportional-hazards model and Log-rank tests were used to assess the influence of demographic and clinicopathologic factors on overall survival and disease-free survival.<br \/>Results: A total of 57 patients with confirmed PCFHTCL were identified. The median age was 57 years with a peak incidence between ages 53 and 64. There was a male predominance with an M:F ratio of 1.25. PCFHTCL commonly involved the head (54%), followed by the torso (24%) and limbs (12%). Sixteen percent of the lesions were solitary and mostly involved the head. The most common pattern was nodular\/tumorous. Histologically, PCFHTCL involved mainly the dermis with occasional focal epidermotropism (27%), folliculotropism (43%), syringotropism (7%), and subcutaneous extension (14%). Extracutaneous involvement comprised lymph nodes (11%), bone marrow (4%), and the peripheral blood (2%). The median duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 5 months. The six-year disease-free survival is around 85%. Surgical resection alone resulted in durable remission in 40% of the cases. Recurrent disease was successfully salvaged with re-resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. While solitary lesions tended to have a better disease-free survival, it did not reach statistical significance.<br \/>Conclusions: This study represents the largest cohort of this rare cutaneous T-cell entity. It describes the demographic and clinical patterns of disease presentation and provides a detailed update on the clinicopathologic features PCFHTCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6e444657-d8bd-4e19-9fa0-792c7bf9a1be\/@s03B8ZCq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Skin,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11959"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Philip A.

The antitumor efficacy of ensartinib, a novel multi-kinase inhibitor, against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping mutations was investigated in this study.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The<b> <\/b><i>MET<\/i>-mutant binding affinity and antitumor activity of ensartinib were assessed <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Preliminary therapeutic activity of ensartinib in patient-derived organoids was observed. To explore clinical activity, 17 NSCLC patients with <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping mutations were treated with ensartinib at 225 mg qd.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that ensartinib exhibited favorable binding to c-MET. Ensartinib was highly effective in inhibiting the kinase activity of the MET exon 14 deletion protein (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 7.9 nM). Furthermore, ensartinib potently suppressed the MET pathway and the growth of Hs746T cells that were subcutaneously implanted into mice. Most importantly, of 17 patients with 14 different types of <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping mutations undergoing ensartinib treatment, 1 (6%) showed a complete response, 11 (65%) achieved a partial response, and 4 (24%) exhibited stable disease. Thus, the objective response rate (ORR) was 71% and the disease control rate (DCR) was 94%, and the ORR in MET-TKI naive patients was even higher (12\/15, 80%).

Prolonged survival in cancer patients have surfaced novel cardiovascular adverse outcomes. A rise in the number of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, have been observed. The increased burden of atrial fibrillation in patients with non-metastatic cancer is not well explored. We aimed to discover the magnitude of the impact of cancer on readmission in patients with atrial fibrillation.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We performed a retrospective cohort study utilizing the 2016 to 2019 Nationwide Readmission Database. International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes were used to identify diagnoses and procedures. Patients were included in the study if they were at least 18 years of age with a non-elective admission for atrial fibrillation between January and November. Atrial Fibrillation was defined as admissions with the primary diagnosis code I48.0, I48.11, I48.19, I48.20, I48.21, or I48.91. Non-metastatic cancer was identified using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software. We assessed the effect of non-metastatic cancer on 30-day atrial fibrillation readmission rate and analyzed temporal trends.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results<\/b> Baseline characteristics for 1,272,156 index admissions were identified. The mean age was 71 +\/- 13 years, and 52.2% were female. Readmissions occurred in 11.7% of total index admissions; 11.4% of non-cancer patients versus 16.8% with cancer (p&#60;0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that patients with cancer were 1.47 times more likely to be readmitted (95% CI, 1.41 - 1.52; p&#60;0.001). Though, patients with cancer were 51.8% less likely to be readmitted after a palliative care consultation (p &#60;0.001). Patients were most likely to be readmitted due to episodes of atrial fibrillation, hypertensive heart failure, and sepsis. In-hospital mortality was higher in the cancer group (7.2% vs 4.2%, p &#60;0.001), with multivariate Cox regression indicating a hazard ratio of 1.41 in the cancer group. Patients with cancer, on average, also had higher a length of stay (4.3 days vs. 3.5 days, p &#60;0.001), total cost ($17,780, p &#60;0.001), and were more likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility (13.8% vs 11.0%). There was no significant difference in the likelihood of pacemaker or CRT placement. Finally, patients with cancer were 3.2% more likely to die during a readmission (p &#60;0.001)<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b><b> <\/b>Atrial fibrillation and a concomitant non-metastatic cancer diagnosis tend to portray poor outcomes, including higher readmission, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and healthcare cost, compared to patients without a non-metastatic cancer diagnosis.

The results showed that objective response rate (ORR) was 34.2% for patients with measurable disease having biallelic <i>BRCA<\/i>1\/2 alterations (n=76). The development of <i>BRCA<\/i> reversion mutations, a type of secondary mutation that restores protein function, has been proposed as a key resistance mechanism to PARP inhibition. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between reversion mutations and treatment response in <i>BRCA<\/i>1\/2 altered patients treated with niraparib in the GALAHAD study.<br \/>Thirty-three patients with biallelic <i>BRCA <\/i>alterations (excluding patients with homozygous deletions) had donated an end-of-treatment (EOT) ctDNA sample. We performed sequencing to detect reversion mutations using the Resolution Bioscience ctDx-HRD assay. Mutation patterns at baseline included splice site, nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations, with the latter being the most common (24\/33; 73%). No reversions were detected at baseline and the baseline <i>BRCA <\/i>alterations were detected at EOT for every patient. Most <i>BRCA<\/i> patients (28\/33; 85%) had at least 1 reversion mutation (range: 1-38 different <i>BRCA <\/i>alterations) at EOT. Of the 28 patients with reversions, 5 were classified as low reversions: 3 patients had only one reversion mutation, 1 patient had 2 reversions at low allele frequency and 1 patient had 4 reversions at low allele frequency. Patients with reversion mutations showed better composite response (defined as ORR by RECIST 1.1, or CTC conversion to &#60;5\/7.5 mL blood, or &#8805;50% decline in prostate specific antigen) (74.2% vs 25.8%, p=0.01) and longer duration on treatment (median 6.9 vs 3.7 mo, p&#60;0.05) compared to those without or low reversions. Additionally, patients with reversions trended to have longer median radiographic progression-free survival compared to those without or low reversions (8.1 vs 5.5 mo, p=0.12). In conclusion, the high prevalence of patients with <i>BRCA <\/i>reversion mutations and the displayed longer benefit from niraparib underscores the dependence of these tumors on <i>BRCA<\/i> mutation as an oncogenic driver and reversion mutations as a marker of secondary resistance to niraparib treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/44c12c08-53aa-4860-b68f-860debcebcf9\/@t03B8ZCr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA,PARP inhibitors,Prostate cancer,Reversion mutation ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17211"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Karen Urtishak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerhardt Attard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tokuwa Kanno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shibu Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gary E.

We asked if the tumor stroma in surgically treated primary PCa lesions positive or negative with MRI are different in their cellular and molecular properties, and whether the differences are reflected to the clinical course of the disease.<br \/>We profiled the stromal and immune cell composition of MRI-classified tumor lesions by applying multiplexed fluorescence immunohistochemistry (mfIHC) and automated image analysis in a clinical cohort of 343 patients (Cohort I). We compared stromal variables between MRI-visible, invisible lesions, and benign tissue and assessed the predictive significance for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and disease-specific survival (DSS) using Cox regression and Log rank analysis. Subsequently, we carried out a prognostic validation of the identified biomarkers in a population-based cohort of 319 patients (Cohort II).<br \/>MRI true-positive lesions are different from benign tissue and MRI false-negative lesions in their stromal composition. CD163-positive cells and fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-positive cells were more abundant in MRI true-positive than in MRI false-negative lesions or benign areas. In MRI true-visible lesions, a high proportion of stromal FAP-positive cells was associated with PTEN status and increased immune infiltration (CD8+, CD163+), and predicted elevated risk for BCR. High FAP phenotype was confirmed to be a strong indicator of poor prognosis in two independent patient cohorts using also conventional IHC.<br \/>The molecular composition of the tumor stroma may determine whether early prostate lesions are detectable by MRI and associates with survival after surgical treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f896d088-be0b-4658-ae6f-7ea6992da466\/@t03B8ZCr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Stroma,Immunohistochemistry,Magnetic resonance imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17212"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Teijo Pellinen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Smith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sami Blom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riku Turkki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annabrita Hemmes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Välimäki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juho Eineluoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anu Kenttämies<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stig Nordling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olli Kallioniemi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antti Rannikko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tuomas Mirtti<\/i><\/presenter>.

Second look laparoscopy (SLL) can provide more sensitive detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) allowing for more individualized prognostication and possible therapeutic intervention. It may also assess tumor biology and microenvironment associated with undetectable chemoresistant MRD phase of ovarian cancer. The objective of this study was to determine SLL feasibility, and clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of MRD after frontline therapy in ovarian cancer.<br \/>Methods: SLL was offered to patients with stage III-IV high grade epithelial ovarian cancer who achieved complete response after frontline surgery and 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. Patients were offered standard of care or investigational management options based on homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and MRD status at SLL. Preliminary translational studies included RNAseq for comparison of serial, matched tumor from primary or interval TRS and SLL derived MRD+ biopsies at the time of SLL. In addition, Nanostring analyses of SLL surgical biopsies both with and without residual tumor were performed. Molecular profiling employed hierarchical clustering, principle component analysis, non-parametric testing, and pathway analyses.<br \/>Results: Between 4\/2017- 7\/2021, 39 patients underwent SLL. The majority had stage III disease (74%), high grade serous histology (90%) and underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval tumor reductive surgery (TRS; 54%). MRD was present in 49% (n=19) of patients and was more frequent among neoadjuvant chemotherapy recipients (73% vs 26%, P=0.015) and patients with homologous recombination proficient tumors (81% vs 25%, P=0.01). Most patients without MRD were dispositioned to observation; 4 patients with HRD received a PARP inhibitor per standard of care. All other patients with MRD received bevacizumab as part of a clinical trial, except for one patient who received a PARP inhibitor. Median follow-up was 6.74 months (range 0.66 - 28.62). Presence of MRD was associated with worse PFS (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3- 10.9; 5.5 vs 24.6 months; P= 0.02). Based on transcriptional signature, MRD are immunologically distinct from untreated tumors or those collected at interval TRS (after 3 cycles of chemo) but also displayed heterogeneity with two distinct subclusters.<br \/>Conclusions: SLL to assess for MRD has potential to further individualize post-frontline therapy, and identify patients at high risk for progression for early intervention clinical trials. Transcriptional profiling suggests that MRD phase of ovarian cancer is characterized by a distinct, heterogeneous, and evolving tumor and immune microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8481121c-3e6b-409b-a62c-c95f72dba500\/@t03B8ZCr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Survival,Surgical resection,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17213"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Roni Nitecki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minghao Dang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanghoon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Fellman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>J Alejandro Rauh-hain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jolyn Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lois Ramondetta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michaela Grinsfelder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Cobb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David M.
