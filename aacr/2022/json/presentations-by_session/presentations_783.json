[{"Abstract":"Background: Surgical resection is one of the most important radical treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the 5-year recurrence rate of HCC after surgery is up to 70%, hampering further improvement in the prognosis of HCC patients. Risk factors for recurrence include microvascular invasion (MVI), multiple lesion and solitary tumor &#8805; 5 cm, etc. Postoperative adjuvant treatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) can reduce the recurrence rate and improve overall survival (OS) for patients with high risk of recurrence to some extent. TACE treatment promotes the release of tumor related antigen and the recruitment of immune cells by killing tumor cells, thereby promoting the anti-tumor immune response; it may have a potential synergistic effect with PD-1 blockade. Currently, there is no ongoing study on TACE combined with immunotherapy as postoperative adjuvant therapy for HCC. This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE sequential tislelizumab as adjuvant therapy in HCC patients with high risk of recurrence after curative resection (NCT04981665).<br \/>Trial design: Eligible patients are &#8805;18 y, ECOG PS 0 or 1, Child-Pugh class A, diagnosed with HCC confirmed by histopathology or cytology, with no prior systematic treatment and locoregional therapy for HCC, and have received a curative resection with high risk of recurrence fulfilling one of the following criteria: (1) a solitary tumor &#62; 5 cm, (2) solitary tumor &#62; 2 cm and &#8804; 5 cm with MVI, (3) 2-3 lesions. 50 pts will receive TACE treatment once (4&#177;1 w) after curative resection, then followed by tislelizumab 200 mg IV Q3W (5&#177;2 d). Tislelizumab will be administered until disease recurrence, intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent or completion of a maximum of 17 cycles of tislelizumab. Primary endpoint is 2-year recurrence-free survival rate (2-year RFS rate). Secondary endpoints include RFS, time to recurrence, OS, 1-year RFS rate, 1-year and 2-year OS rate, and safety. Exploratory endpoints include biomarkers related to the response and prognosis of adjuvant TACE sequential tislelizumab therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5fdd526d-67cc-4a6b-849f-e7a5dd09279d\/@C03B8ZYV\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Immunotherapy, Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE),Adjuvant therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20353"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tingbo Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zongli Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinfang Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yijun Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jialin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Tao Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunfei Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Changxiong Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yiman Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoli Yang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Emerging data suggest that neoadjuvant therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can elicit major pathological responses (MPRs) that translate into prolonged survival outcomes, serving as an early surrogate for efficacy. Adjuvant therapy can improve overall and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with completely resected NSCLC. DFS observed with osimertinib in patients with early-stage <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutated tumors supports evaluation of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. In early-stage NSCLC, <i>MET <\/i>exon 14 skipping mutation (<i>MET<\/i>ex14) and de novo <i>MET <\/i>amplification (<i>MET<\/i>amp) are estimated to occur in up to 2.8% and 1.7% of patients, respectively. Capmatinib, a selective MET TKI, is FDA approved for patients with metastatic <i>MET<\/i>ex14 NSCLC. It was studied in GEOMETRY mono-1 in patients with advanced\/metastatic NSCLC with <i>MET<\/i>ex14 or <i>MET<\/i>amp. In 2 treatment-naive <i>MET<\/i>ex14 cohorts, overall response rate (ORR) was 68% and 66%. In a treatment-naive high-level <i>MET<\/i>amp cohort, ORR was 40%. Capmatinib had a tolerable safety profile; most adverse events were reversible with dose adjustments. Based on the response rates and safety profile observed in treatment-naive patients with advanced\/metastatic <i>MET-<\/i>dysregulated NSCLC, GEOMETRY-N (NCT04926831), a Phase II, 2-cohort, 2-stage study, is evaluating the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant and adjuvant capmatinib therapy in improving the MPR rate and outcomes in patients with <i>MET<\/i>ex14 or high-level <i>MET<\/i>amp NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Adults with resectable, histologically confirmed NSCLC stage IB-IIIA, N2 and select IIIB (T3N2 or T4N2) with either <i>MET<\/i>ex14 (cohort A) or high-level <i>MET<\/i>amp (gene copy number &#8805;10; cohort B) are eligible. <i>MET<\/i>ex14 must be determined by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified lab. <i>MET<\/i>amp must be determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization at a CLIA-certified lab or by FoundationOne CDx next-generation sequencing. Prior systemic anticancer therapy is prohibited. Patients will receive capmatinib 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks before surgical resection, followed by 3 years of adjuvant capmatinib. In the 2&#8209;stage design, stage 1 will enroll 9 patients per cohort, with MPR evaluated in each cohort after 9 patients have completed neoadjuvant therapy; stage 2, enrolling 10 more patients in a cohort, will proceed only if &#8805;1 of 9 participants has an MPR. About 42 patients will be enrolled, with 19 evaluable patients per cohort. The primary endpoint is MPR rate (local assessment). Secondary endpoints are complete pathological response rate (central and local review), ORR (local assessment), DFS, and safety. Following treatment, there will be a 2-year survival follow-up.

PDAC tumors grow aggressively, diagnosis is typically made after metastasis and the disease remains associated with poor outcomes. The triplet chemotherapy regimen of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel with cisplatin was associated with a median overall survival of 16.4 months in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in the first-line setting (Jameson et al., 2020). Nutritional, metabolic interventions offer an opportunity to fundamentally change the tumor microenvironment and improve outcomes for patients. A medically supervised ketogenic diet (MSKD) defined as lower carbohydrate, lower protein, and higher fat can significantly reduce glucose and insulin and increase metabolically active ketone bodies. A ketogenic diet combined with triplet chemotherapy (gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin) was shown to inhibit murine pancreatic KPC tumor growth and to triple the survival benefit of chemotherapy alone. The ketogenic diet combined with triple chemotherapy was associated with glucose depletion, altered TCA substrate usage, and NADH elevation.<br \/>Methods: In this Phase II randomized clinical trial (NCT04631445), we are evaluating a medically supervised ketogenic diet (MSKD) versus a standard diet when combined with the triplet therapy in patients with treatment-naive advanced pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint is progression free survival for triplet therapy while on MSKD or non-MSKD. Secondary endpoints include disease control rate (PR+ CR+ SD for at least 9 weeks), change in CA 19-9 (or CA125, or CEA if not expressers of CA 19-9), average insulin levels, HbA1c, body weight, a comparison of gut microbial diversity, changes in serum metabolites and quality of life via the EORTC QLQ-C30 assessment. Unlike prior ketogenic intervention studies, the MSKD is being supported by a continuous care nutrition intervention through Virta Health Corp, that offers tracking of daily ketone and glucose levels, a web-based software application, education, and communication with a remote care team to ensure sustained nutritional ketosis. A total of 40 patients with untreated metastatic PDAC are planned for enrollment, 20 randomized to each arm.

The presence of an anti-MAG antibody is often associated with a chronic, progressive symmetric demyelinating polyneuropathy that can lead to sensory deficits and gait dysfunction, significantly altering a patient&#8217;s quality of life. Prior clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an effective long-term therapy for anti-MAG neuropathy. Additionally, the best manner to assess the evolution of this type of neuropathy has not been elucidated. We designed this clinical trial to evaluate a potential therapy for anti-MAG related neuropathy based on previous reports of subjective improvement in patients with anti-MAG neuropathy treated with rituximab or Bruton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We included multiple neurologic outcome measures so their responsiveness and performance could be assessed in a clinical trial setting.<br \/>Methods: This is a single-arm open-label phase II trial investigating the use of acalabrutinib and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of an IgM-associated anti-MAG mediated neuropathy. Eligible patients must have positive anti-MAG antibody titers with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or Waldenstr&#246;m macroglobulinemia (WM). Patients must have a predominantly sensory neuropathy characterized by demyelinating features in nerve conduction studies with a modified Rankin score of &#8805;1 with progressive symptoms or a modified Rankin score of &#8805;2. The ECOG performance status must be &#8804;2. Acceptable organ and marrow function are required. Prior exposure to chemotherapy, Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors, or other therapies for WM are not permitted except for steroids, IVIg, or an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody given at least 90 days before study drug initiation. Approximately 33 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be treated with acalabrutinib 100 mg orally twice daily on days 1-28 of each cycle and treatment will be administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Rituximab (or a biosimilar) will be administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1 and 4.<br \/>The primary endpoint of this trial is to evaluate the overall hematologic response rate (defined as &#8805;25% reduction in serum IgM) associated with the treatment. The key secondary endpoint is to evaluate the proportion of patients that achieve improvement or stability in neuropathic symptoms based on the Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS) patient-reported disability scale. Additional secondary neurologic endpoints include the INCAT disability score, exam-based outcomes (the MRC distal sum score and INCAT-ISS), measures of function (10-meter walk test, 9-hole peg test), a pain scale, a fatigue scale (FSS), and a neuropathy-specific quality of life scale (IN-QOL). Additional secondary endpoints include time to next treatment, overall survival, hematologic response based on <i>MYD88<\/i> and <i>CXCR4<\/i> mutational status, change in bone marrow disease burden, and proportion of adverse events associated with treatment.<br \/>This study is currently open and accruing patients.<br \/>Clinical trial information: NCT05065554<br \/>Sponsor: AstraZeneca","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/24597de0-4a06-4db6-bee9-73b228cdae39\/@u03B8ZYW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Rituximab,MGUS,Acalabrutinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20372"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shayna Sarosiek<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher T.

Synergistic activity of anti-PD-1 with P has been reported in several murine tumor models, including the B-16 OVA mouse model.<sup>3<\/sup><sup>,<\/sup><sup>4<\/sup><sup><\/sup> A retrospective study has shown an improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients (pts) with metastatic melanoma (MM) treated concurrently with non-selective &#946;-blocker and immunotherapy.<sup>5<\/sup> This formed the basis for our phase I study of the combination of P (at dose levels; 10 mg, 20 mg BID, and 30mg BID) and pem 200 mg every 3 weeks in pts with MM. Our published phase I results found all 3 dose levels of P to be well tolerated, and an objective response was observed in 7\/9 pts.<sup>6<\/sup> A decrease in perceived stress score (PSS) in pts over time was observed. Intra-tumor ratio of (CD4+T cells + CD8+T-cells)\/ (MDSC+ Treg) &#62;1 in the pre-treatment biopsy was predictive of treatment response. Based on the results of the phase I study, we chose P 30 mg BID as the recommended phase II dose. These results, though preliminary, strongly support our subsequent phase II clinical trial.<br \/>Methods: In this prospective, single-arm, phase II, multicenter trial, pts with unresectable stage III\/IV MM and measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 will be treated with P (30 mg BID) + Pem. Pts with active CNS disease, prior therapy with PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors, or contraindications to &#946;-blocker are excluded. The primary objective is to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) by immune-modified RECIST v1.1. The secondary objectives are the assessment of progression free survival and OS. A Simon two-stage design will be employed, requiring a minimum of 29 pts (17 in stage 1 and 12 in stage 2) to achieve approximately 80% power to detect a 20% increase (0.35 to 0.55) in the ORR. As an exploratory analysis, we will further report a) Baseline and on-treatment PSS and b) Chronotropic effect of P after 5-minute treadmill walk as a biomarker of response; c) Post therapy changes in the TME, with a 12 week on therapy optional biopsy d) Peripheral blood changes in T cell and MDSC subsets, and cytokines\/chemokines. To date, 10 pts have been accrued on the study (NCT0384836).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/40a177ed-a93b-48da-b87c-8fef0e7c0175\/@u03B8ZYW\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT08-02 Phase II clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Stress response,Immune checkpoint,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21343"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"a7f174ec-b150-495a-a26b-8463bdf28149","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a7f174ec-b150-495a-a26b-8463bdf28149\/@u03B8ZYW\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin Switzer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manu R.
