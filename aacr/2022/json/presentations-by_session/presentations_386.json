[{"Abstract":"Lysosome-induced immunogenic cell death (LIICD) is a powerful mechanism of targeting cancer cells that kills circulating malignant cells and primes the host&#8217;s immune cells against future remission. Current immunotherapies for cancer are limited in preventing recurrence - a gap which can be bridged by training the immune system to recognize cancer neoantigens. Lysosomal leakage can be induced therapeutically to traffic antigens from dying cells to dendritic cells which can later present those tumorigenic antigens to T cells. We demonstrate that the oxidative agent native bovine xanthine oxidase can induce early markers of lysosome-induced immunogenic cell death in an in vitro human cancer cell line (CCL2). Specifically, we measured overall cell death, as well as surface-expressed calreticulin, extracellular ATP release, and HMGB1 production. These markers are consensus indicators of ICD. Flow cytometry, luminescence assays, and ELISA were used respectively to quantify biomarker levels between treated versus untreated cells. We also included a positive control group of cells dosed with doxorubicin (a known inducer of LIICD). We looked at each marker at various time points after cancer cells were treated with xanthine oxidase, doxorubicin, and an untreated group. Upregulated biomarkers after treatment with the protein indicate an immunogenic response. Further, we used confocal imaging to show lysosomal membrane permeabilization after treatment with Native Bovine Xanthine Oxidase using Lucifer Yellow staining. We thus show the potential for this protein to induce an anticancer effect paired with an adaptive immune response against tumor cells. Our research in human cell lines here provides evidence for the success of the same therapeutic method in patients and serve as the gateway to developing a new treatment approach against breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86b6653b-85d9-4d46-94f7-a48acfcb524b\/@E03B8ZGm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Breast cancer,Immunogenic cell death,Lysosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16953"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Iulianna Taritsa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Fossel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kuldeep Neote<\/i><\/presenter>.

Activation of 4-1BB requires receptor clustering, which is naturally mediated by the endogenous trimeric 4-1BB ligand. Cross-linking via agnostic monoclonal antibodies can also activate 4-1BB but has generally resulted in unwanted side effects, mainly liver toxicity. To address the shortcomings of 4-1BB agonists, we have developed QL301, a PD-L1 x 4-1BB bispecific antibody that conditionally activates 4-1BB only when concurrently engaged to PD-L1, an immune checkpoint mediator elevated in the immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment. The IgG1 backbone of QL301 was mutated to eliminate Fc gamma receptor-dependent functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), thereby preventing depletion of effector immune cells and non-specific activation of 4-1BB through Fc gamma receptor binding. In addition, QL301 blocks the suppressive interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1. Therefore, through a combination of 4-1BB agonism and PD-L1 blockade, QL301 provides both a co-stimulatory signal and the release of a suppressive signal to reinvigorate anti-tumor immune response. In vitro, QL301 induced robust cytokine release and expansion of CD8+ T cells conditional on the presence of tumor or antigen presenting cells expressing PD-L1. In xenograft and transgenic mice models, QL301 had potent anti-tumor effect that was superior to PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies. Tumor regression correlated with the expansion of CD8+ T cells. In addition, QL301 potentiated tumor cell killing mediated by an EGFR targeted CD3 bispecific antibody, providing a basis for combination therapy. In non-human primates, QL301 was well tolerated up to 30 mg\/kg. There was no chronic elevation of serum AST and ALT levels, and histopathology analysis showed minimal inflammation of liver tissue. A phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and early efficacy of QL301 is currently ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f13ce63-92a6-4f46-a108-f83dcc1abd23\/@E03B8ZGm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,4-1BB,Bispecific antibody,Costimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16954"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shenda Gu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shirley Mihardja<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Wei Prior<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hieu V.

B7-H4 expression was also observed in tumor associated macrophages and implicated as an immune checkpoint regulating T cell responses. Although B7-H4 expression in normal tissues is quite limited, tumor-specific immune response by ABL103 would minimize potential adverse effects. ABL103, B7-H4 Grabody-T, is a First-in Class bispecific antibody targeting B7-H4 and 4-1BB and augments T cell function by a dual mechanism, i.e., 1) blocks the B7-H4 mediated T cell inhibition, and 2) elicits superior T cell activation through B7-H4-dependent 4-1BB clustering. Our data showed that simultaneous binding of B7-H4 and 4-1BB by ABL103 led to potent in vitro T cell activation only in the presence of B7-H4 expressing tumor cells. In the established tumor model, ABL103 potently inhibited tumor progression in a dose-dependent manner and showed higher rate of complete remission (CR) at 2 and 10 mg\/kg dose groups. Moreover, mice were protected from the tumor re-challenge 3 months after cessation of ABL103 treatment, suggesting long-term memory has been established. In 4-week pilot tox study using cynomolgus monkeys, ABL103 was tolerable up to 100 mg\/kg dosed weekly with no ABL103-related toxicity observations. To understand the relationship of target expression, expression of B7-H4, CD4, CD8, PD-L1, and 4-1BB was examined in 142 ovarian cancer patient biopsies. About 83% of ovarian cancer patient tissues showed B7-H4 positive staining and 62% of them showed strong positive. In addition, the staining of 4-1BB as well as CD4 and CD8 T cells were observed in both tumor nest and stroma, suggesting that cross-linking of B7-H4 and 4-1BB is feasible in tumor microenvironment. Overall, ABL103 has a strong <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity and good safety profile via B7-H4-dependent 4-1BB activation. This strongly suggests ABL103 is a promising therapeutic agent potentially benefitting patients with B7-H4 overexpression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8a0dc01c-a1dd-45f9-a2b7-c3fbc44f15b8\/@F03B8ZGn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,B7-H4,4-1BB,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16955"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyungjin Park<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangsoon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saeyi Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyeongsu Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eunjung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanbyul Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiseon Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngdon Pak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeunju Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minji Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonghwa Won<\/i><\/presenter>.

To date, there are no validated in vivo mouse models that support the development of fully functional human NK cells. In recent years, the adoptive transfer of human peripheral mononuclear blood cells or CD34+ stem cells into highly immunodeficient mouse strains mostly allowed the evaluation of T cell-based therapies. However, these humanized mouse models have limitations and do not show an optimal development of innate immune cells such as NK, dendritic or myeloid cells. This is mostly due to the poor interspecies cross-reactivity of key factors necessary for cell development and maturation, like cytokines and growth factors.Here, we report the development and characterization of robust in vivo models that allow the engraftment and maintenance of fully functional human NK (huNK) cells, using several strains of immunodeficient transgenic mice for human cytokines (IL-15). The optimal parameters (source of immune cells, pre-conditioning regimen, route of administration) were identified. These models were characterized and validated by flow cytometry, and in vivo efficacy studies using an anti-CD20 Ab.In summary, we developed several murine models that exhibit significant numbers of functional huNK cells maintained over time in vivo. Different sources of human immune cell (CD34+ HSC, huNK cells) were used to implant immunodeficient huIL15 transgenic mice. HuNK cells were monitored by flow cytometry in all tested models. We showed huNK engraftment in both irradiated and non-irradiated models and confirmed the maintenance of expression of important functional NK markers on these cells. Efficacy studies performed in disseminated models showed promising results as efficacy of an anti-CD20 Ab, rituximab, was improved in presence of huNK cells, thus confirming the engagement of huNK cells in vivo in these models. Overall, we have developed several models that can sustain fully functional huNK cells over a period of several weeks that can be proficiently recruited in vivo by various NK-based therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f87a93a0-f555-4c61-beee-6bdf95a85469\/@F03B8ZGn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Therapeutics,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16956"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pauline Rettman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dorothée Bourges<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laure-Marie Meyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi Rangara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Ponchet-Lac<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Moindrot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sukhvinder Sidhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Céline Nicolazzi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Ligation of HVEM with BTLA induces recruitment of SHP1 and SHP2, and triggers inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine production. In melanoma, HVEM is described to have a broader expression than PD-L1 and constituted a negative prognostic marker; in PD-L1 negative NSCLC, the expression of HVEM has been shown to contribute to immune escape. Therefore BTLA-HVEM axis could play an important role in the immune escape, thus BTLA blockade in combination with PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade could represent an effective therapeutic option. Using our proprietary microfluidic-based single cell platform CelliGO<sup>&#8482;<\/sup>, we identified a series of anti-human BTLA antibodies that were characterized for their binding affinity, cross-reactivity, selectivity and functional activity. Amongst them, HFB200603 was identified as a single-digit nanomolar binder to human and cynomolgus BTLA, capable of reversing HVEM-mediated immune suppression in a BTLA-HVEM reporter system and in a primary CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell proliferation assay. HFB200603 showed synergistic effect with anti-PD-1 to enhance IFN-&#947; production in an MLR assay, and demonstrated favorable developability and pharmacokinetic profiles.

Blockade of the BTLA-HVEM interaction with HFB200603 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 led to increases in IFN-&#947;, CXCL9, IP-10 and other proinflammatory cytokines in primary dissociated tumor cultures. Based on its favorable pharmacological activity and excellent developability, HFB200603 is currently being developed as a potential novel immunotherapy coupled with a patient biomarker strategy derived from HiFiBiO&#8217;s Drug Intelligent Science (DIS&#8482;) single-cell immune profiling platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bf98a349-92c1-4603-9244-fc966d758e57\/@F03B8ZGn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16958"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juying Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bingqing Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manan Shah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingjie Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sharon Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ling Dong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Adrian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang Schweizer<\/i><\/presenter>.

Quantitative measurement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is critically required for understanding the Fc function in mAb drug development. Despite the increasing interest and clinical success of the mAb therapeutic, it has been highly challenging to measure their ADCC activity in a reproducible and quantitative manner due to the lack of consistency in current methods that are based on primary PBMCs or NK cells and use tedious assay procedures. To improve ADCC assay precision so they can be validated as potency assay in cGMP laboratories, we developed reporter based ADCC bioassays using engineered effector cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter and Fc&#947;RIIIa (V or F variant) to replace primary PBMC to overcome the assay variation. The ADCC reporter bioassays have been validated according to ICH guidelines by many laboratories and are demonstrated to be suitable for product release and stability studies in a quality-controlled environment. For early research and antibody characterization, we developed an improved PBMC ADCC assay using ADCC-prequalified PBMCs and engineered HiBiT target cells so they can measure the target specific lysis in ADCC. The PBMCs used in the study are isolated from prescreened blood donors and QC tested in ADCC assay. When HiBiT target cells are incubated with an antibody and PBMCs, HiBiT are released to the culture medium where it binds to LgBiT in the detection reagent to form a functional NanoBiT luciferase to generate luminescence signal. This new PBMC ADCC bioassay is simple, homogenous, highly sensitive, and gives a robust assay window. We demonstrate that it can quantitatively measure the potency for mAb drugs in cancer immunotherapy (e.g., rituximab, trastuzumab), and for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in antiviral drug development. Additionally, it shows antibody potency comparable with the ADCC reporter bioassay. In summary, the new PBMC ADCC bioassay using HiBiT target cells can be a valuable tool for early antibody discovery and characterization and also for method bridging study with ADCC reporter bioassay.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2117aaec-1062-4384-ad22-90baa2386429\/@F03B8ZGn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16959"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Pete Stecha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jun Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Garvin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Gilden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jamison Grailer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Hartnett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mei Cong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhi-jie Jey Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

As of April 2021 there were five biosimilars for trastuzumab with regulatory approval. Trastuzumab&#8217;s efficacy, and success, comes from its phenotypic impact on multiple cellular mechanisms. These include induction of Her2 receptor internalization and degradation following cell surface binding; activation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) following recruitment of cytotoxic, innate immune cells to the tumor microenvironment; and suppression of cell growth and proliferation signaling via inhibition of RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. Using trastuzumab as a case study in cellular functional assays, we show trastuzumab is antiproliferative to head and neck, and lung cancer cell lines, suggesting a role for Her2 in other tumor types beyond breast cancer. Receptor occupancy, ADCC, and univariate genomic analysis indicate the importance of genomic status to drug sensitivity even in the presence of moderate cell surface receptor expression. OncoPanel genomic analysis indicated ERBB2 amplification as the most significant feature correlating with sensitivity to trastuzumab, almost 30-fold above the next most significant marker EIF4A2. Using the BioMAP&#174; Oncology Panel modeling tumor microenvironment (TME) biology, we profiled trastuzumab for impacts on protein biomarkers relevant for immune responses, inflammation, and matrix remodeling. Trastuzumab modulated immune and angiogenesis-related biomarkers, including increased IFN&#947; and decreased VEGF, both important for an anticancer response in patients. Profiling of trastuzumab in BioMAP Diversity PLUS&#174;, which provides insights on broad tissue and disease coverage as might be seen in a patient, indicted that the mAb trastuzumab, the Her2-EGFR small molecule kinase inhibitor lapatinib, and the broad-spectrum cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel differentially modified clinically-relevant protein biomarkers, as might be expected for these three different therapeutic classes. Interestingly, at concentrations near their Cmax, lapatinib and trastuzumab differentially modulated biomarkers associated with tissue remodeling and inflammation, supporting the potential for combination therapies of these anticancer agents. Combinations of the agents are in clinical trial. This current work demonstrates that multipronged assessment of candidate therapeutics using human cell-based <i>in vitro<\/i> models are needed to understand 1) inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, 2) differential TME responses, 3) genetic status before and after treatment as reported in the literature, and 4) impact on broader biology for safety.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6035a011-8fe7-4f69-bd96-771d3a075991\/@F03B8ZGn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Herceptin,Lapatinib,Microenvironment,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16960"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sheryl P.

This is largely due to metastasis, tumor relapse, and the vast heterogeneity of CRC tumors leading to treatment failure. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small population of tumor-initiating cells thought to act as immortal seeds that can form metastases and contribute to tumor relapse. CSCs have been shown to exhibit plasticity or the ability to transition between differentiated and undifferentiated states to evade treatment and to promote tumor progression. Epiregulin (EREG) is an EGFR family ligand that is highly expressed in both states, as well as in treatment resistant CRCs of various mutation statuses. We showed that knock-out of EREG in a CRC cell line resulted in significant tumor inhibition in vivo, suggesting EREG is a promising target for therapeutic development. Therefore, we generated EREG-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to act as guided missiles for the delivery of cytotoxic drugs into EREG-expressing tumors to overcome plasticity and resistance in CRC. To develop a novel EREG ADC, we cloned and produced three separate EREG monoclonal antibody (mAbs) and tested them for binding, the ability to internalize into CRC cells, and to neutralize EREG activity. All three EREG mAbs were shown to bind with high affinity to EREG tethered to the surface of CRC cells and internalize to the lysosome, which is important for processing the release of drug from the ADC. We then conjugated the highest affinity EREG mAb and a non-targeting isotype control antibody to a highly cytotoxic drug via a cleavable peptide linker. EREG ADCs were evaluated in vitro against a wide panel of CRC cell lines of various <i>Kras<\/i>, <i>Braf<\/i>, and <i>PI3CKA<\/i> mutational statuses and different levels of EREG expression. Drug efficacy was determined using cytotoxicity assays to measure changes in CRC cell survival with escalating doses of unconjugated control antibody and EREG mAb, as well as control ADC (cADC) and EREG ADC. EREG mAb alone did not result in significant CRC cell death. However, EREG ADCs exhibited potent cell-killing in EREG-expressing CRC cells, whereas minimal effects were observed with cADC. Future progress will involve testing the safety and efficacy of EREG ADCs against patient-derived tumor xenograft models of CRC in vivo. These preliminary results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of EREG ADCs for targeting plasticity and drug resistance in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d37cea3d-66e3-48e2-99ba-bc51cc34f19b\/@F03B8ZGn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Colorectal cancer,Antibody,Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16961"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joan Jacob<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengdong Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kendra Carmon<\/i><\/presenter>.

PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint that regulates anti-tumor T cell responses and is expressed on tumor cells as well as tumor-infiltrating immune cells across many tumor types. Here we show that PD-L1-targeted TLR7\/8 ISACs elicit robust myeloid cell activation and can act through PD-L1 on either tumor or immune cells to improve anti-tumor responses compared to anti-PD-L1 treatment in preclinical tumor models.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>A panel of proprietary anti-PD-L1 ISACs was evaluated for target-dependent in vitro myeloid cell activation by co-culturing PD-L1 expressing tumor cells with cDC-enriched primary myeloid cells. Anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 ISACs was evaluated in vivo in both syngeneic and xenograft tumor models. MB49-PD-L1 KO cells were generated by knocking-out PD-L1 gene using CRISPR\/Cas9 system.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced robust ADCP by myeloid effector cells and PD-L1\/PD-1 blockade in vitro and in vivo. The conjugated PD-L1 ISACs induced robust, target-dependent activation of myeloid cells when co-cultured with tumor cells expressing PD-L1 at physiological levels, as measured by increased secretion of such cytokines as IL-12p70, TNF&#945;, and IFN&#947;. Systemically administered surrogate PD-L1 ISACs were well tolerated in mice and showed improved anti-tumor efficacy over anti-PD-L1 antibodies, with significant tumor growth delay or complete responses frequently observed in syngeneic (e.g., MB49, MC38-hPD-L1) as well as xenograft (e.g., HCC1954-hPD-L1) tumor models. The improved in vivo efficacy of PD-L1 ISACs was sustained even in the absence of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in syngeneic MB49-PD-L1 KO model suggesting that PD-L1 ISAC can induce its mechanism of action also through PD-L1 on myeloid cells. No tumor growth was observed after rechallenging mice previously cured with PD-L1 ISACs indicating development of immunological memory following the ISAC treatment.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS: <\/b>These preclinical data demonstrate the potential of a PD-L1-targeted ISAC as a novel multifunctional therapeutic that may improve efficacy of PD-L1\/PD-1 inhibition by combining three mechanisms of action into a single molecule: TLR-mediated myeloid cell activation, T cell activation through immune-checkpoint inhibition as well as ADCP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c94e693b-3de9-454e-be88-4777cedd7316\/@x03B8ZGo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,TLR7,Immunostimulation,Dendritic cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16962"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Justin A.

The strategy of targeting dual tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) with a BsAb offers several advantages, such as improved efficacy due to synergistic effects, increased target cross-linking and internalization, increased tumor cell specificity and reduced side effects in normal tissues. HER2 is an established therapeutic target for approximately 20% of breast cancers, and its overexpression has been observed in a variety of other solid tumors. Trop-2 is another ideal tumor-associated target overexpressed on a wide variety of solid tumors. Co-expression of HER2 and TROP2 has been found in a number of tumors including gastric, colorectal, bladder and breast cancers. Therefore, co-targeting these TAAs using bispecific antibodies has clinical potential. YH012 is a novel first-in-class bispecific antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2-TROP2 (HER2-TROP2-ADC), which contains a novel fully human bispecific anti-HER2\/TROP2 antibody conjugated with Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable linker. The anti-HER2\/TROP2 BsAb showed increased endocytosis activity compared with its parental mAbs in tumor cells co-expressing HER2\/TROP2, whereas the monovalent HER2 or TROP2 antibodies showed reduced internalization. As expected, YH012 showed increased in vitro potency of cell killing compared to the monovalent HER2\/TROP2-ADC. These results suggest that YH012 increases the selectivity of payload delivery demonstrating the beneficial effects of targeting dual TAAs using BsAb-ADC. Moreover, YH012 showed robust anti-tumor efficacy in multiple cell line-derived none-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastric xenografts. Treatment with YH012 showed sustained tumor growth inhibition, which is more pronounced than the effects of the parental mAb-ADCs and monovalent ADCs. These preclinical data suggest that YH012 could potentially benefit patients with tumors co-expressing HER2 and TROP2 through improved drug selectivity and efficacy. Further investigations on the antitumor activity and safety profile of YH012 are ongoing in dogs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aed0735d-60fc-4106-b0b1-c39ff94e28fa\/@x03B8ZGo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bispecific antibody,Cancer immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16967"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chengzhang Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liu Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jiyong Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanfei Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhuolin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenyan Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gao An<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenqian An<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Charpentier<\/i><\/presenter>.

To overcome the fundamental challenge of developing an anti-CD47 antibody of an active Fc isotype for strong anti-tumor activities without the safety (e.g., anemia) and pharmacokinetic (e.g., antigen sink) liabilities, we set out to design anti-CD47 antibodies of active isotypes that allow us to decouple efficacy from safety and PK liabilities. Our NEObody<sup>TM<\/sup> technology enables us first to identify an anti-CD47 antibody targeting a novel epitope on CD47. Next, our SAFEbody<sup>&#174;<\/sup> technology for precision masking enables us to mask the CD47 binding sites to create the masked antibody in active IgG1 isotype called ADG153-G1 SAFEbody, which can be conditionally activated to bind and inhibit CD47 on tumor cells for potent tumor killing with much improved safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.<br \/><i>In vitro<\/i> studies showed that the activated ADG153-G1 SAFEbody blocked CD47 binding to SIRP&#945;, bound to the CD47 protein, CD47<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cell lines, and human RBCs, and induced strong ADCC\/ADCP activities. In contrast, the unactivated ADG153-G1 SAFEbody demonstrated high masking efficiency (ME) with significantly reduced activities (&#62;110-1300&#215; ME) in the same assays. While anti-CD47 antibodies such as the Hu5F9 analog caused <i>in vitro<\/i> human RBC hemagglutination, the ADG153-G1 SAFEbody in activated and unactivated forms did not show this effect at comparable concentrations.<br \/>Consistent with its enhanced ADCC\/ADCP potential in IgG1 isotype, in the CD47<sup>+<\/sup> Raji tumor model in SCID mice (with functional NK cells and macrophages), the unmasked ADG153-G1 and masked SAFEbody demonstrated better anti-tumor activities than their IgG4 unmasked and masked SAFEbody counterparts. In exploratory single-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, the ADG153-G1 SAFEbody showed significantly less reduction than the Hu5F9 analog in RBCs and hemoglobin. The Hu5F9 analog at 10 mg\/kg caused an ~49% maximum decrease in RBCs, while the ADG153-G1 SAFEbody at 10 and 30 mg\/kg showed only 8% and 40% maximum reductions, respectively. Consistent with a reduced antigen sink effect due to lower RBC binding, the ADG153-G1 SAFEbody had more favorable pharmacokinetic properties than the Hu5F9 analog (~8&#215; longer t<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>and ~5&#215; higher AUC) at 10 mg\/kg. Taken together, these results indicate that the ADG153-G1 SAFEbody is a differentiated anti-CD47 IgG1 antibody prodrug with strong ADCC\/ADCP potential and significantly reduced anemia-related and antigen sink liabilities, supporting its&#8239;advancement into clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ee548c1-9327-43d5-9c66-a3fe573610d4\/@x03B8ZGo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Anemia,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),antigen sink,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16968"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Bin Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Aaron N.

The first generation of anti-CD73 therapeutic antibodies currently in clinical studies have largely exhibited subdued clinical activities mainly due to several unfavorable characteristics such as incomplete enzyme inhibition and\/or &#8220;hook effect&#8221;. These weaknesses are caused by the unfavorable target binding sites and enzyme inhibition mechanisms, which explains why these molecules do not inhibit soluble CD73 enzyme activity, or why the enzyme inhibition depends on certain stochiometric ratios of CD73 and the antibody and exhibits &#8220;hook effect&#8221; in dose-response curves. Here we report a next generation humanized monoclonal antibody against human CD73 (hCD73), PT199, which binds to a unique site on human CD73 that confers a different mechanism of enzyme inhibition and consequently does not have the flaws associated with the first generation of anti-CD73 mAbs currently in clinic. By directly binding to an epitope that is in or near the CD73 catalytic domain, PT199 potently inhibits both soluble shed CD73 and membrane-bound CD73 activity to completion without &#8220;hook effect&#8221;. Enzyme kinetic studies demonstrate that PT199 inhibits CD73 enzyme activity in a noncompetitive manner, allowing complete CD73 inhibition even at high AMP concentrations reported in TME. In a cell-based functional assay, PT199 inhibition of CD73 alleviates the immunosuppression effect of AMP on T cell proliferation. Compared with the first-generation molecules, PT199 completely inhibits CD73 activity in cancer patient serum. Furthermore, when administrated to hCD73 knock-in mice, PT199 greatly elevates endogenous AMP level, demonstrating a robust pharmacodynamic effect in blocking the conversion of AMP to adenosine. Comparative mechanistic studies indicate that PT199 binds to both the &#8220;open conformation&#8221; (inactive enzyme state) and the &#8220;closed conformation&#8221; (active enzyme state) with high affinity but with shifted binding curves, suggesting that PT199 may inhibit the CD73 enzyme activity by preventing the transition of the enzyme from the &#8220;open conformation&#8221; to the &#8220;closed conformation&#8221;. PT199 did not cause B cell reduction in either acute or repeated dosing studies in NHP. In NHP toxicology studies, PT199 exhibits no clinical observations at up to 300 mg\/kg weekly repeated dosing and has an excellent PK profile typical of mAbs. Taken together, our data confirms PT199 as a potential best-in-class anti-hCD73 mAb. Phase 1 clinical trial is planned to start in the first quarter of 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d40ad08c-58e8-462e-a742-7d6871418f87\/@x03B8ZGo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD73,Gastric cancer,Anticancer therapy,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16970"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Haiqun (John) Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jack Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fen Pei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorraine Greenwood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Pejza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jessica Perer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Zou<\/i><\/presenter>.

CD47 is a well-established &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal and commonly overexpressed by many types of tumor cells as a mechanism for evading the innate immune system. It has been demonstrated in clinic that blocking CD47 from interacting with its ligand SIRP&#945; leads to reduced growth of certain hematological tumors, presumably by activating the innate immune system against tumor cells. Here we present a therapeutic strategy for targeting both CLDN18.2 and CD47 with a bispecific antibody to achieve cancer killing by two mechanisms: (1) Blocking the CD47-SIRP&#945; interaction and stimulating phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages. (2) Delivering robust effector effect (ADCC by NK cells and ADPC by macrophages) mediated by the functional Fc of the bispecific antibody. We report a native IgG-like anti-CLDN18.2\/anti-CD47 bispecific antibody, PT886, that was generated using our newly developed PACbody&#8482; and SPECpair&#8482; technology platforms. The PACbody&#8482; and SPECpair&#8482; technologies are designed to allow assembled bispecific antibodies to have excellent biophysical properties and to be manufactured by a conventional three-step platform process commonly used for mAbs. PT886 has high affinity monovalent binding to cell surface CLDN18.2 and low affinity monovalent binding to cell surface CD47. This combination allows for the preferential binding of PT886 to tumor cells which overexpress both CLDN18.2 and CD47, but reduced binding to normal cells that only express CD47. Consequently, PT886 exhibits higher activity toward CLDN18.2-expressing tumor cells and lower to no activity to normal cells that do not express CLDN18.2. This was demonstrated in a phagocytosis assay where PT886 stimulates stronger phagocytosis in the presence of CLDN18.2 binding<i> in vitro<\/i>. In addition to targeting both CLDN18.2 and CD47, PT886 has a fully functional Fc to directly recruit the tumor cell killing activities of NK cells and macrophages. The potent anti-tumor activity of PT886 was demonstrated <i>in vivo<\/i> in a pancreatic cancer xenograft model, where PT886 treatment resulted in a complete tumor clearance at doses as low as 1 mg\/kg. PT886 also demonstrated a good safety profile in NHP studies and exhibited regular mAb-like manufacturability in process development and CMC. These data support the proof of concept of the PACbody&#8482; and SPECpair&#8482; technology platforms and demonstrate the unique profile of our anti-CD47 arm that&#8217;s suitable for the bispecific antibody approach. PT886 is a first-in-class anti-CLDN18.2\/anti-CD47 bispecific antibody with native IgG-like structure and phase 1 clinical trial is planned for the first quarter of 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a8abb805-1787-4370-9cc7-d933105cfa81\/@x03B8ZGo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Bispecific antibody,Claudin 18.2,Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16971"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jack Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiqun Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erin Ramsey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huiwen Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Albert Lam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Zou<\/i><\/presenter>.

It plays a key role on T cell proliferation and differentiation after stimulation with its ligand CD70. The co-stimulatory signal of CD27 on T cell is mediated via the NF&#954;B pathway but also via the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and the protein kinase B. CD27\/CD70 co-stimulation has the potential to boost immunity by T-cell activation, clonal expansion and enhanced differentiation into antigen specific cytotoxic and memory T cells. CD27\/CD70 also influences the innate immune response via a direct activation of the NK cells and a subsequent secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-&#947;). Therefore, CD27 signaling promotes cytotoxic T cell based anti-tumor immunity. With its central role in an immunological response, CD27 is a promising target for antitumor therapy. Previous works have demonstrated the efficacy of an agonistic CD27 antibody in controlling tumor growth and metastasis in different mice models including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer and lymphomas. This anti-tumor effect is mediated in part by an effective recruitment of IFN-&#947; producing CD8+ T cells within the tumor. Moreover, CD27 stimulation of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) can lower their threshold of activation and provide a broader repertoire of Ag-reactive T cells within the tumor. We have selected a lead therapeutic antibody from our library of 147 fully human anti-CD27 monoclonal antibodies generated in the Trianni mice. After confirming its binding potency and selectivity as well as its cross-reactivity with Non-Human Primate (NHP)-CD27 but not with the mouse-CD27, this lead candidate demonstrated strong agonistic proprieties. This was shown by its ability to induce a strong NF&#954;B signal as well as to induce T cell proliferation and activation with secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This antibody demonstrated agonistic proprieties without cross-linking confirming its potency. T cell activation observed after treatment with our anti-CD27 antibody only occurs in the presence of TCR engagement, preventing the risk of spontaneous activation of na&#239;ve T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. The ability of our CD27 monoclonal antibody to increase an immune response was confirmed in a Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction assay with multiple donors. The role played by the NK cells and their activation via CD27 antibody was also demonstrated. To evaluate the anti-tumor functions of our lead antibody as a single agent or in combination with other immuno-therapies in vivo we have used human CD27 transgenic mice. We have demonstrated in the MB49 bladder tumor model as well as the EG7 thymoma model that our lead antibody induces a strong single agent anti-tumor activity and these tumors were totally controlled in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody.

Despite important advances in the field of OC therapy, recurrent OC still has very poor prognosis with a median survival of 1&#8201;year. Due to the close interaction between the ovarian cancer cells and tumor microenvironment, development of treatment strategies which not only target the tumor cells but also the components of the tumor microenvironment hold significance. Notably,<b> <\/b>a prime obstacle in the development of therapies is to identify targets with specific expression limited to the tumor surface and not the healthy tissues. The follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is one such target with selective expression in ovarian granulosa cells and thus, a potentially important therapeutic target in OC. Therefore, we developed monoclonal antibodies against FSHR and focused on studies of the most potent of these reagents. Anti-FSHR antibody bound to diverse FSHR expressing ovarian serous and clear cell adenocarcinoma cells suggesting these antibodies could be used to specifically target OC. We then designed a novel DNA encoded bispecific T cell engager targeting FSHR (FSHRxCD3) and evaluated this bispecific in therapeutic models for the treatment of OC. FSHRxCD3 bispecific in the presence of human PBMCs was highly specific in killing FSHR positive ovarian tumor lines. However, T cell approaches alone may not be fully effective in treating OC, referred as Immunologically &#8220;Cold&#8221; Tumors. Hence, we hypothesized that engaging the other components of immune system, would provide better tumor control. Increasing lines of evidence suggest that OC is receptive to Natural killer (NK) cell attack. We designed antibodies against human Siglec-7, an inhibitory receptor present on human NK cells and showed they could bind to NK cells. We then used these to create a novel class of bispecific NK engager (NKE) that simultaneously targets both Siglec-7 and FSHR (Siglec-7xFSHR). This NKE was potent at killing FSHR positive OC targets in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Multiple Ovarian tumors including BRCA mutated and PARPi resistant ovarian cancer cells could be targeted by this immune therapy. Our data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these two novel bispecific molecules and initial studies suggest that their combination may be valuable in patients with OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/892a30c8-94cb-44d4-ab9b-9eb44be9e159\/@x03B8ZGo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Bispecific antibody,Natural killer cells,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16973"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Devivasha Bordoloi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pratik Bhojnagarwala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhijeet J.

The goal of ADC technology is to resolve the toxicity issue inherent in potent small molecule drugs. Yet, the main problem facing current ADC technology is still a toxicity issue, evidenced by 9 out of 12 FDA approved ADCs carrying black box warning labels and many failed clinical programs due to their toxicities. Many factors contribute to the ADC&#8217;s toxicity including but not limited to random conjugation of payloads to the antibody, premature release of payload, Fc related toxicity, on-target\/off-tumor toxicity etc. In this study, we developed a novel pegylated BsAb-ADC formed by site-specific conjugating a fusion protein of two scFvs that target at two different epitopes of Her2, with PEG-MMAE, a pegylated cytotoxic payload MMAE. As expected, the compound is homogeneous without any Fc related toxicity. Although the compound showed lower affinity to Her2 positive cells, it demonstrated higher in vitro cytotoxicity than T-DM1, especially for Her2 low expressing cell lines when its DAR is 4. Furthermore, the compound was comparable to or better than T-DM1 or DS-8201 in inhibiting xenograft tumor models (including Her2+ low expressing models) even when DAR is only 2. The compound also demonstrated efficient internalization without detectable efflux, suggesting improved endosome and lysosome trafficking, most probably due to the lack of Fc promoted efflux mechanism and formation of complex between biparatopic Her2 antibody and Her2. In addition, unlike T-DM1 and DS-8201, the compound did not generate cytotoxicity to megakaryocyte cell line Dami, and is less toxic to the non-cancerous HaCaT cells than T-DM1 or DS-8201. The compound is stable with no detectable release of the payload when incubating with human Plasma for a week at 37&#176;C. The circulation T1\/2 of the compound in rat is about 30 hours. In conclusion, our pegylated BsAb-ADC compound demonstrated improved efficacy with better safety profile than T-DM1 and DS-8201.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b075d75-82b2-40fa-bf5a-c7ecc163fa60\/@x03B8ZGo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Pegylated,biparatopic,Low expressing Her2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16974"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shumin Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuqiang Yin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weidong Lyu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Lei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiudong Zhuo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zibin Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuangyu Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liling Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu (Yvonne) Wen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Wu<\/i><\/presenter>.
