[{"Abstract":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly disease characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment and a dense stroma that encapsulates the tumor, making therapeutic targeting particularly challenging. One of the main cellular components of PDA tumor microenvironment (TME) is cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), whose function is to sustain tumor growth and provide structural support to the TME. Previously, we established the existence of three transcriptional subtypes of CAFs, myCAF, iCAF and apCAF, each with distinct functions and location in respect to cancer cells. Two of these subtypes, myCAF and iCAF, display a highly plastic potential <i>in vitro<\/i> and can transdifferentiate into one another upon activation of specific signaling pathways. The plasticity observed supports the existence of transitional CAF sub-states that have previously eluded observation due to technical limitations to their isolation. Through a combination of spatial transcriptomics and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on tumor samples obtained from KPC (<i>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D<\/sup>; p53<sup>LSL-R172H<\/sup>; PDX-CRE<\/i>) and FPC (<i>Kras<sup>Frt-LSL-G12V-Frt<\/sup>; p53<sup>LSL-R172H<\/sup>; PDX-CRE; Rosa26<sup>FlpOERT2<\/sup><\/i>) mice, two PDA mouse models displaying a Kras G12D and G12V mutation respectively, we were able to confirm the presence of the previously identified CAF subtypes and two additional CAF sub-states. These sub-states are associated with the expression of specific markers and display different pathway enrichment. Notably, Kras G12D and G12V mutations generate similar organization of the stroma and heterogeneity of the CAF population. Subsequently, to understand the contribution of activating Kras mutation to these CAF phenotypes, we utilized the unique feature of the FPC mouse model which allows the excision of Kras G12V once the tumor has fully developed. Through FISH analysis, we observed deep reorganization of the stroma and a shift in marker expressions within the CAF populations upon Kras excision. Overall, the data here presented offers insight into the diversity of PDA CAFs and the role of mutated Kras in regulating CAF subtypes and stromal organization.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7fd3001-4e5c-4146-a781-3d954f042de4\/@y03B8ZHN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Stromal-epithelial interactions,KRAS,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13136"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Giuseppina Caligiuri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Thalappillil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliene Hinds<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elise T.

Notch1 receptors (N1ICD) are frequently activated in Endothelial cells (ECs) of human tumors to facilitate metastasis. Using VE-Cadherin-CreERT2 transgenic mice to induce gene recombination exclusively in ECs, we explored the role of Notch signaling in ECs in vivo. Rbpj<sup>i&#916;EC<\/sup> (VE-Cad-CrERT2xRbpj<sup>flox<\/sup>) mice inhibit the canonical Notch signaling upon tamoxifen administration. We modeled metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) by injecting the mouse ovarian cancer cell line ID8 intraperitoneally. After four weeks of tumor growth, we observed a significant decreased tumor burden and reduced infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the TME upon EC-specific Rbpj deletion. In vitro, we also confirmed a decreased infiltration of human monocytes through an EC barrier upon Rbpj deletion in human ECs. We isolated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from Rbpj<sup>&#916;EC<\/sup> tumor bearing mice and their littermate controls and performed microarray analysis. TCs educate TAMs through CD44-mediated cholesterol depletion. Several bioinformatic analyses showed that TAM from Rbpj<sup>i&#916;EC<\/sup> mice were not able to induce the expected signature of TAMs in metastatic EOC because cholesterol depletion cannot take place. This indicates that the TC-induced macrophage education requires the presence of Rbpj in ECs. In vitro experiments showed that CD44 expression was downregulated in monocytes co-cultured with ECs lacking RBPJ. Analysis of the angiocrine factors regulated by Notch signaling revealed CXCL2 as a novel Rbpj-mediated Notch target gene: activation of Notch1 in ECs <i>in vitro<\/i> induced the production of the chemotactic cytokine CXCL2, whereas Rbpj-deletion (CRISPR-Cas9 technology) in N1ICD transduced ECs abolished CXCL2 expression. In addition, CXCL2 stimulation increased CD44 expression. In keeping with this, the analysis of publicly available ovarian cancer patient&#8217;s datasets we found that CXCL2 expression correlates with CD44 expression, suggesting that CXCL2 induces CD44 also in patients. CD44 is a co-receptor of a complex involving CXCR2 and CD74, which without CD44 it is not possible to signal. CD74 expression has been associated with worse prognosis in metastatic ovarian cancer and associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype in macrophages. Bioinformatic analyses of publicly available data showed that Rbpj in ECs is necessary for the immunosuppressive role of CD74. Finally, T cells sorted from Rbpj<sup>i&#916;EC<\/sup> tumor bearing mice showed stronger cytotoxic activity (LDH-cytotoxicity assay) than those sorted from their littermate controls. In summary, ovarian cancer cells employ the tumor endothelium to secrete CXCL2 in order to facilitate an immunosuppressive microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Endothelial cells,Macrophages,Hyaluronan,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13137"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ronja Mülfarth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisenda Alsina-Sanchis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iris Moll<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Böhn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adrian Stögbauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca De Angelis Rigotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lena Wiedmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqueline Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Fischer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Juan Rodriguez Vita<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In our efforts to identify mediators of therapeutic resistance, we identified the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1&#945; (IL-1) to be critical in the activation and reprogramming of neighboring cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the stroma to a pro-inflammatory phenotype to promote myeloid cell chemotaxis. Our mechanistic studies have identified the p38 MAPK pathway as a novel mediator of IL-1-induced CAF activation from quiescent stellate cells into the inflammatory fibroblast. Our central hypothesis is that disruption of the IL-1\/p38 MAPK signaling cascade in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and CAFs can improve therapeutic resistance by remodeling the fibrotic stromal landscape and the overall immune microenvironment in PDAC tumors.<br \/>Methods: Inhibition of phosphorylated p38 MAPK was achieved pharmacologically with Pexmetinib and genetically with an shRNA lentiviral system in CAF and PSC cell lines. Inflammatory PSC\/CAF activation was determined by qPCR, immunofluorescence, and vitamin A assay. <i>Ptf1a<sup>cre\/+<\/sup>;LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>; Tgfbr2<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> (PKT) mice were treated with the p38 inhibitor, pexmetinib (30mg\/kg, daily PO), or vehicle control for 2.5 weeks prior to sacrifice. For survival studies, PKT mice were treated with vehicle, gemcitabine (20 &#956;g\/twice weekly), pexmetinib, or combination until moribund.<br \/>Results: Inhibition of p38 MAPK in PSCs prevented activation into an inflammatory fibroblast <i>in vitro<\/i> when stimulated with IL-1 or tumor cell cocultures. p38 MAPK inhibition <i>in vivo<\/i> resulted in signification reduction of PDGFR+ CAFs in a PDAC GEMM. Additionally, p38 MAPK inhibition resulted in a significant reduction of circulating myeloid cells (CD11b+) and intratumoral monocytic MDSCs (Ly6C+). p38 inhibition, in combination with chemotherapy, significantly improves overall survival in a PDAC GEMM.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings provide important mechanistic data to explore p38 MAPK inhibition to target the fibrotic stroma and reduce immunosuppressive myeloid levels in tumors and provide compelling preclinical evidence to combine pexmetinib with chemotherapy to improve overall survival in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b87498f-5d86-4434-986e-38a402884aed\/@y03B8ZHN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,p38 MAP kinases,Inflammation,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13138"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samara Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Austin R.

Melanoma progression is the concerted outcome of cellular and molecular changes that occur not just within the tumor cells but also within the milieu of the stromal cells (fibroblasts, immune cells, adipocytes), collectively referred to as the tumor microenvironment (TME). Moreover, TME-secreted growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) are vital to tumor progression and therapy resistance. Aging causes remodeling of the TME that becomes conducive to melanoma progression. In addition, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to transport lipids, mRNAs and functional proteins between different cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and across tissues <i>in vivo<\/i>. EVs have also been shown to play an important role in tumor progression in different cancer types, and aging can change their composition as well as their cargo. We performed proteomics on EVs released by young and aged dermal fibroblasts, the predominant stromal cell population of melanoma TME, to investigate how aging of the cells changes the EVs released by them. Moreover, we performed functional assays to investigate what influence this will have on the tumor progression. Our study shows that EVs secreted by dermal fibroblasts change in their composition as well as their cargo adding another dimension to age-associated increase in melanoma progression, and therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bfb725d6-d34f-47c5-ad6f-9631baf14d32\/@y03B8ZHN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular vesicles,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13140"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Laura Hueser<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yash Chhabra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olesia Gololobova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Fane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Witwer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashani Weeraratna<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite recent advances in in other cancers, the five-year survival rate of PDAC is still only 10%, with most patients succumbing to their disease within the first year. One of the main factors responsible for this poor outcome is the development of chemoresistance in nearly all clinical cases. While the intrinsic factors that facilitate chemoresistance in the tumor cells have been studied extensively, fewer studies have elucidated how the complex and unique microenvironment surrounding the tumor affects therapeutic responses. The abundant stromal cells and the stiff desmoplastic microenvironment constitute more than 90% of the primary tumor bulk. However, there is a lack of high-throughput, easily tunable models to recapitulate this complex microenvironment, in order to identify a critical cell-extrinsic factors that could drive acquired chemoresistance in PDAC cells. To address this issue, we have developed a Matrigel-based, orthogonally tunable 3-dimensional (3D) culture system to co-culture mouse derived PDAC organoids and host-matching cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Using this system, we found that matrix-activated CAFs readily remodel the desmoplastic matrix through lysol-oxidase dependent crosslinking. Moreover, our novel system demonstrates how collagen-I and matrix stiffness affect chemoresistance via the hypersecretion CAF-derived exosomes. Interestingly, our data show that it is CAF-derived exosomes, not the organoid-derived exosomes, that are most important in regulation of proliferation and chemoresistance. Lastly, we identified key cell surface integrins for collagen-I as therapeutic targets to prevent desmoplastic matrix-mediated chemo-resistance in PDAC. Our study provides insights into how matrix composition and stiffness affect therapeutic outcome in PDAC. Moving forward, therapies aimed at interrupting how PDAC cells and stomal cells sense the matrix microenvironment could be utilized to eventually overcome matrix-mediated chemoresistance in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cd6c2454-65aa-4635-8742-8f87e4501408\/@z03B8ZHP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Extracellular matrix,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13141"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Weikun Xiao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chae-Young Eun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinyu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlene DeKalb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahsa Pahlavan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bayan Mahgoub<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanaa Knaneh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alireza Sohrabi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie K.

TGF-&#946; is highly involved in tumor fibrosis and immune suppression, and several clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate anti-TGF-&#946; therapies for treating patients diagnosed with cancer and for which biomarkers are key for success. TGF-&#946; is produced in a latent complex with latency-associated protein (LAP), which needs to be cleaved by plasma kallikrein (PLK), releasing TGF-&#946; to enable receptor binding and initiating of signaling. We developed a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting PLK activated TGF-&#946; and measured it in serum from patients with PDAC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: An ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminal side of the PLK cleavage site of TGF-&#946; at R&#8217;58&#8595; was developed and validated for quantification of PLK activated TGF-&#946; (L59TGF-&#946;) in serum. To confirm that the ELISA was specifically measuring PLK cleaved TGF-&#946;, L59TGF-&#946; was measured in a TGF-&#946; dilution after incubation with and without kallikrein. L59TGF-&#946; was measured in pretreatment serum samples from patients with PDAC (n=39) and healthy controls (n=20). The prognostic value of L59TGF-&#946; levels was examined with Kaplan-Meier analysis and evaluated for association with overall survival (OS) by multivariate cox regression analysis adjusted for age and cancer stage.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: L59TGF-&#946; was only detected after incubation with kallikrein, demonstrating that the ELISA specifically detected kallikrein cleaved TGF-&#946;. L59TGF-&#946; was significantly elevated in patients with PDAC compared to healthy controls (p&#60;0.0001). High levels of L59TGF-&#946; (&#62;median) were significantly associated with poor OS (HR: 2.71, 95%CI: 1.23-5.97, p=0.0135) in patients with PDAC, and median OS was 5.5 months (95%CI: 1.50-20.0) compared to 26.3 months (95%CI: 15.3-28.1) for patients with low levels of L59TGF-&#946;. The association between high levels of L59TGF-&#946; and poor OS remained statistically significant after adjusting for age and stage (HR: 2.33, 95%CI: 1.05-5.18, p=0.0372).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Quantification of PLK activated TGF-&#946; (L59TGF-&#946;) in serum predicted poor OS for patients with PDAC. The biomarker value of L59TGF-&#946; should be validated and further investigated in a larger cohort to explore the clinical applicability of the biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d6cc5274-8b53-4408-b0e1-d850738ea955\/@z03B8ZHP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,Prognostic markers,Pancreatic cancer,Serum,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13142"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rasmus S.

Compared to MI lesions, HI BrM form abundant contacts with cells in the peritumoral brain, particularly GFAP+ reactive astrocytes (RAs). RAs expressing phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3+ GFAP+ cells) have been shown to be required for BrM colonization and outgrowth (Priego et al. 2018). Here, we investigate the role of pSTAT3+ cells in the brain microenvironment in promoting invasive growth.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed immunohistochemistry to identify pSTAT3+ GFAP+ cells in HI and MI human and patient-derived xenograft BrM. We assessed how pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of STAT3 affected HI and MI BrM growth <i>in vivo <\/i>with patient-derived xenograft and syngeneic models of BrM<i>. <\/i>The secretome of STAT3+ RAs was interrogated to identify STAT3 target genes that could drive invasive cancer growth. scRNA-Seq from patients with highly invasive brain metastases was used to examine the expression of candidate invasion factors in distinct cell types within the brain. Finally, cancer cell invasion was modeled <i>in vitro<\/i> using a brain slice-tumor co-culture assay.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> HI BrM displayed increased pSTAT3+GFAP+ cells compared to MI lesions.

However, despite the presence of macrophages in the prostate, prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent cancer in men. This suggests that PCa cells can evade M1 macrophage mediated cell-kill. We have shown that human THP-1 derived M1-like macrophages readily kill human prostate cancer LNCap cells, while in testosterone proficient conditions (Fraction Growth over Mono-culture (FGM): 0.1). However, in testosterone deprived conditions LNCap cells survive (FGM: 1.1). In addition, when exposed to M1-like macrophage conditioned medium, LNCap cells are killed in testosterone proficient conditions and not in depleted conditions (FGM: 0.2 and 0.7, respectively). This suggests that M1 macrophage mediated PCa cell-kill depends on Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling and the release of soluble factors by macrophages. This is supported by cell-kill of castration-resistant LNCap-abl cells with an AR amplification (FGM: 0.1) in testosterone deprived conditions and no cell-kill in both testosterone deprived and proficient conditions of castration resistant PC3 cells without AR expression when co-cultured with M1-like macrophages (FGM: 0.7 and 0.7. respectively). To dissect the mechanism of M1 macrophage mediated cell-kill evasion, a genome wide CRISPR knock-out screen was performed in LNCap cells in co-culture with M1-like macrophages. LNCap cells were transfected with the Brunello library and cultured in testosterone proficient conditions. After 72 hours of co-culture, cells were harvested and DNA was isolated and submitted for sequencing. After quality check analysis, five gene knock-outs with a significant (log2FcMedian &#62;1.5) survival advantage were identified, AR, PRKCD (Protein Kinase C Delta), IKBKA (Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit &#945;:), IKBKB (Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit &#946;) and IKBKG (Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit &#947;). The latter three genes are components of the I<i>k<\/i>B kinase (IKK) complex, which is essential for activation of members of the nuclear factor-<i>k<\/i>B (NF<i>k<\/i>B) family of transcription factors. The hits as identified in the CRISPR knock-out screen, were validated in single guide knock-out LNCap cells in co-culture with M1-like macrophages. Additionally, we have shown that AR signaling enhances PRKCD expression, both at the RNA and protein level. Moreover, expression of PRKCD is significantly lower in prostatectomy specimen of 56 patients treated for 3 months with the AR signalling inhibitor enzalutamide prior to surgery, than untreated matched controls. Furthermore, LNCap cells lacking PRKCD, IKBKB and IKBKG were significantly less affected in their growth by reactive oxygen species (H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>) than non-targeting LNCap cells. Ongoing studies are aimed to dissect how these critical factors are interconnected in LNCap cells, M1 macrophage mediated cell-kill evasion as a result.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/33f60cd7-b33e-4c7b-8a69-245466437f7b\/@z03B8ZHP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Prostate cancer,Cytotoxicity,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13144"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anniek Zaalberg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Minnee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wilbert Zwart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andries M.

CAFs have been shown to provide nutrients to \"parasitic\" PDAC cells including water soluble glucose and amino acids. In hypoxic tumor microenvironments, aggressive PDAC are functional auxotroph for lipids, and scavenge exogenous lipids to build cellular membranes. However, the mechanism by which PDAC cells obtain these water-insoluble essential membrane building materials remains poorly understood. To gain insights into the mechanism of lipid scavenging, we generated cholesterol-auxotrophic human and mouse PDAC PDAC cells since cholesterol is the major constituent of lipid cellular membranes. Here, we discovered that PDAC cells utilize CAFs as a main source of lipids in vivo through direct heterotypic cellular contacts. In this process, PDAC cells directly acquire the CAF plasma membrane (PM) via trogocytosis. In response to yet unidentified paracrine &#8220;feed me&#8221; signals activating CAF-dependent trogocytosis, CAFs upregulate phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on the outer leaflet of the PM. Consequently, blockade of PtdSer on CAFs partially deterred trogocytic transfer of CAF membranes to PDAC cells in vitro. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>-dependent phospholipid scramblase TMEM16F is a critical regulator of PtdSer externalization. TMEM16F is highly expressed in human PDAC CAFs compared to fibroblasts isolated from the matching adjacent non-malignant pancreatic tissues CAFs deficient in TMEM16F scramblase exhibited markedly reduced ability to support the growth of cholesterol-auxotrophic PDAC cells cultured in lipid depleted media. We propose trogocytosis as a new mode of lipid scavenging by PDAC cells from CAFs involving activation of Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>-dependent phospholipid scramblase TMEM16F in CAFs and increased expression of PtdSer as &#8220;eat me&#8221; signals on CAF PM. To inactivate trogocytosis, we nominate TMEM16F as a plausible PDAC therapy target using clinically available TMEM16 inhibitors with a potential for impact on treatment of PDAC patients in the near term.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bec35fef-41f7-4718-b7f0-2309117b8870\/@z03B8ZHP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Lipid metabolism,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13145"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Charline Ogier<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alena Klochkova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Battuya Bayarmagnai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linara Gabitova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Restifo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aizhan Surumbayeva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janusz Franco-Barraza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Debora Vendramini Costa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ralph Francescone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaye Gardiner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emmanuelle Nicolas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth A.

Development of effective therapeutics has been hampered by the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME), which contains dense desmoplastic stroma that likely impedes the ability of therapies to reach the tumor cells. We have found that aggressive, &#8220;basal-like&#8221; human PDAC tumors have high expression of proteins involved in planar-cell-polarity (PCP), a type of non-canonical Wnt signaling. We show that the increased expression of the PCP genes, including the putative non-canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt5a, the Frizzled 6 (FZD6) Wnt receptor, and RYK co-receptor negatively impact patient prognosis. Using a panel of FZD6 knock-down pancreatic cell lines, we show that loss of FZD6 increases expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and decreases cellular motility in Transwell assays. We also find that loss of Fzd6 dramatically inhibits tumor progression in two mouse models of PDAC, with a pronounced change to the TME; including the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells. Blinded histologic pathology review of tumor and immune cell infiltrates, by H&#38;E and alphaSMA staining, suggests that the CAF cell population is altered. We propose this is the cause of the looser stroma surrounding the tumors after Fzd6 loss, which also results in an increased abundance of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells surrounding and within the tumors. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining for other PCP proteins within the pancreatic tumors lacking Fzd6 suggests that Fzd6 loss reduces PCP-component protein levels. We hypothesize that the loss of Fzd6 reduces tumor cell EMT and PCP signaling, while the loose stroma allows more immune cells that further slow tumor growth and progression. We have also examined the expression of PCP proteins in a novel orthotopic xenotransplantation model of PDAC, intraductally grafted organoids (IGO). IGO is a powerful tool to study PDAC as the intraductal tumors that develop recapitulate patient to patient heterogeneity while displaying features of either classical or basal-like PDAC subtypes. FZD6 and RYK are both more highly expressed in the IGO basal-like tumors than the classical type. Introduction of fast-growing, basal-like human tumors into the murine pancreas also resulted in a TME that produces more Wnt5a, when compared to the stroma surrounding tumors formed by injecting the classical subtype. Taken together, we believe we have identified a Wnt5a\/Fzd6 driven PCP-like signaling pathway that makes tumors more mesenchymal-like, and results in PDAC tumor progression and worse patient prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/035c9680-042f-4e7f-a5a8-d87d153a252a\/@z03B8ZHP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Pancreatic cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13146"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Payton D.

Compared to the ample knowledge on the protumorigenic functions of iCCA intratumoral myofibroblasts (iMFs), little is known about the activation status of MFs in the tumor-surrounding liver (peritumoral myofibroblasts, pMFs) and their potential role in iCCA development.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We examined MF activation in both patient iCCA tumors and an iCCA orthotopic allograft mouse model. We found there was a significant, tumor-induced activation and accumulation of pMFs at the tumor border. Using an in vitro spheroid coculture system, we confirmed that iCCA-liver interaction induced rapid pMF activation at their interface. We found that MFs mixed within tumor spheroids as iMFs had a pro-proliferative effect on iCCA tumor cells similar to the previous reports. However, when the same MFs were seeded around iCCA spheroids as pMFs, they exerted a strong suppressive effect on tumor cells growth. Interestingly, prolonged iCCA-pMF coculture elicited marked tumor cell invasion and dissemination which did not occur in iCCA-iMF coculture. We found vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (Vcam1), a glycoprotein that has been implicated in solid tumor metastasis, was part of the dynamic regulation of tumor cell behaviors by iCCA-pMF interaction. Vcam1 was upregulated in the tumor cells at the early, growth-suppressing phase of iCCA-pMF interaction both in vitro and in vivo, and was then downregulated in tumor cells when they started to disseminate. Systemic blocking of Vcam1 activity in iCCA allograft mouse models using a Vcam1 neutralizing antibody slowed the primary tumor growth but promoted tumor cell dissemination.<i><\/i><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our data suggest that pMFs are beyond simple pro- or anti-tumorigenic in iCCA development. iCCA development induces rapid activation and accumulation of pMFs at the tumor border which suppress tumor growth at early stage but eventually elicit tumor cell dissemination at late stage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/33cf825c-7d36-4db4-8dbe-f0aaa3fbbb2b\/@A03B8ZHQ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cholangiocarcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13147"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Cheng Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liyuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yizhen Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wentao Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michelle Morrison<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun J.

Defects in the genes encoding hydrolases and transporters and enzyme activators are found in LSD&#8217;s, leading to the accumulation of macromolecules in the late endocytic system. And this disruption of lysosomal homeostasis increases the induction of endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress, proliferative signal transduction, extracellular matrix degradation, Integrin-&#946;4-mediated cell migration and invasion, and consequently can promote the development of oncogenic cells and malignant tumors. It is known that the function of lysosomes is very important in cancer diseases. Recently, through a preliminary study, we found that the incidence of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) increases statistically significantly when the LSD putative pathogenic germline variant (PPGV) is present. Based on this, we performed single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing using MPN patient samples of both LSD PPGV carrier and non-carrier. We tried to determine how the LSD PPGV affects MPN cancer progression at the single-cell level. To confirm functional differences between the two groups, DEG, pathway enrichment, LR-pair interaction, and transcription enrichment analyses were performed. In the analysis, immune cells were composed of T-cell, NK-cell, and Monocyte (in the order of frequency). It was confirmed that Lysosome-related (ER, Golgi, etc.) functions were upregulated in the carrier group compared to the non-carrier group across cell types. In addition, in the ligand-receptor (LR)-pair interaction analysis targeting Immune cells, it was possible to find a statistically significant difference (average log2 fold change&#62;0.7 and p-value&#60;0.05) candidate LR-pair (IL6-IL6R*IL6ST) that upregulates in the carrier group compared to the non-carrier group. The candidate LR-pair found by our team has been previously known as a cytokine-related gene that plays an inflammatory or fibrosis-related role in MPN and affects cancer progression. Also, in the Transcription Factor Enrichment analysis conducted together, it was confirmed that the statistically significant (NES&#62;2 and FDR&#60;0.01) candidate Transcription Factor (STAT1), which operates dependent on the candidate LR-pair, is upregulated. In conclusion, we found the possibility that genes and functions related to cancer progression can be up-regulated by LSD germline variants. In addition, we plan to conduct additional studies to determine the exact mechanism of contribution to cancer development by the LSD germline variant.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/451f98cd-e883-484b-bcba-827a69f91987\/@A03B8ZHQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer progression,Cancer genomics,Bioinformatics,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13148"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hyundong Yoon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seulki Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeeun Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngil Koh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>SungSoo Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Metastasis causes melanoma-induced death and 5-year survival rates, subsequent to metastasis to regional lymph nodes or distal organs, of 9% and 4%, respectively, hence novel therapeutic targets are required to control metastasis. Emerging evidence suggests that &#945;-synuclein, a 14.4 KDa protein, which is a key player in Parkinson&#8217;s disease, is significantly correlated with melanoma progression. Our hypothesis is that &#945;-synuclein positively regulates the release of extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to be important in tumor metastasis, immune modulation and chemoresistance. The rationale for this hypothesis is that &#945;-synuclein is a unique membrane-associated catalyst of endocytosis and exocytosis, and, specifically, synuclein regulates neurotransmitter release through SNARE complex assembly and the dilation of the fusion pore. The objective of the study is to measure the concentration of extracellular vesicles in the conditioned media from wild type SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, <i>SNCA <\/i>knock out cells, and rescued <i>SNCA<\/i>-KO cells (where &#945;-synuclein is re-expressed in KO cells via lentivirus) using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. The expected result was that knocking out <i>SNCA<\/i> would decrease the number of EVs released per cell relative to wild type control cells. To this end, we grew wild type, <i>SNCA<\/i>-KO and rescued <i>SNCA<\/i>-KO cells for 48 hours at 37&#176;C and collected conditioned media. EVs were extracted from each conditioned medium using the ExoQuick-TC kit (Systems Bioscience) and stored at -80&#176;C. EVs were characterized by PAGE followed by western blotting for common EV-markers and EV samples were shipped to the University of Colorado for Nanoparticle Tracking. Here we report a significant reduction in the concentration of EVs in <i>SNCA<\/i>-KO cell lines compared to control cells (P=0.0123), an effect that was rescued upon re-expression of &#945;-synuclein in knock-out cells (P&#60;0.01). Unpublished data from our lab suggests that invasion and migration are significantly reduced in <i>SNCA<\/i>-KO melanoma compared to control cells, a pathological outcome that returns in rescued <i>SNCA<\/i>-KO cells. These observations point to considering &#945;-synuclein as a therapeutic target for regulating the release of pro-metastatic factors in extracellular vesicles, an intervention that would have important health implications as a novel therapeutic approach in melanoma. Work is ongoing in our lab to elucidate the mechanistic details of how &#945;-synuclein promotes EV release.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fcd168e5-3129-4d2d-99dc-999edfee73cd\/@A03B8ZHQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Premetastatic niche,CRISPR\/Cas9,Exosomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13150"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"76e0ca68-fa6a-4b71-9493-c57798ead2b8","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/76e0ca68-fa6a-4b71-9493-c57798ead2b8\/@A03B8ZHQ\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nirjhar M.

We and others have previously shown that the breast cancers most likely to survive chemotherapy are <i>TP53 <\/i>wild-type, and these are among the most lethal breast cancers. For instance, chemotherapy treated TNBC patients with TP53 wild-type tumors have a median overall survival of 45 months, contrasting with 263 months for TP53 mutant tumors. TP53 wild type cells survive stress by entering a state of arrest and cellular senescence. But to persist in senescence, cells must survive in limited access to vasculature and nutrient sources while also supporting a high metabolic burden that includes production of cytokines and chemokines that drive pro-tumorigenic phenotypes and relapse.<br \/>We previously showed a novel cannibalism phenotype of chemotherapy induced senescent cells. Engulfment occurred after exposure to different chemotherapy drugs in vitro, in 9 different cell lines, and in vivo in syngeneic mouse mammary tumor models. Engulfed prey cells were processed to the lysosomes of predator cells and broken down. While we showed the phenotype was unrelated to entosis, and senescent cells expressed many phagocytosis\/macrophage related genes, the basic mechanisms of the engulfment are unknown.<br \/>Here, we use biosensors and live cell imaging to delineate the steps of whole cell engulfment in cells that have entered senescence to survive chemotherapy. We show predator cell filamentous actin was localized to the prey cell throughout the process of engulfment. Biosensors to various phosphoinositide (PI) species showed increased concentration and localization of predator PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 at the prey cell during early stages of engulfment, followed by a burst of PI(3)P before internalization. PIK3C2B, an enzyme responsible for generating PI(3)P, was required for complete engulfment. Inhibition or knockdown of Clathrin, known to associate with PIK3C2B and PI(4,5)P2, severely impaired engulfment. In sum, these data demonstrate the mechanism of cellular cannibalism used by breast cancer cells to survive chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1a492cdb-ef69-4008-9555-f5f0c93b9957\/@A03B8ZHQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Breast cancer,Chemotherapy,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13151"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wesley D.

Many studies have found this phenomenon as the hallmark of cancer progression and metastasis. In epithelial single cell migration, downregulation of adherens junction (AJ) molecule E-cadherin occurs at the initial step known as the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). However, in collective cell migration, E-cadherin junction is maintained to provide adhesion between cells. Moreover, it also mediates the cell-cell intercommunication that is critical, for instance, to alter the group polarization through actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Interestingly, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) was found to colocalize with E-cadherin in the cell-cell contact region, implicating that E-cadherin and EGFR might interact in the cell junction of collective cell migration. To address this, a human colorectal cancer cell line exhibiting epithelial phenotype HT-29 was used. The cell density and calcium presence were modified to infer the effect of differential expression and stability of E-cadherin on the cellular signaling of proliferation and migration. The results showed that stable and enhanced expression of E-cadherin downregulates EGFR expression and reduces its activity. Moreover, the Src phosphorylation increased when the cell-cell contact was strengthened via calcium addition and decreased when the cell-cell contact was diminished via calcium chelation. Overall, this indicates that E-cadherin expression at the cell-cell junction and contact stability determine the EGFR expression, activity, and Src phosphorylation. With the goal of deciphering the relationship of E-cadherin and EGFR in cell contact, proliferation, and migration, we intend to finally implement the knowledge as a strategy or approach in promoting alternative methods to inhibit metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4276512d-e3ed-46db-b08c-7bb117e977db\/@A03B8ZHQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Collective Cell Migration,E-cadherin,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13154"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Viriya Adhiguna Winarso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Wen Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Cheng Weng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang-Ling Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Min Koo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Lin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei-Ting Chao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Stromal fibroblasts, the predominant cell type within the tumor microenvironment, plays a critical regulatory role in prostate cancer (PC) by engaging in stromal-epithelial interactions to dictate cancer initiation, growth, and progression. Monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) catalyzes oxidative deamination of biogenic and dietary monoamines and generates hydrogen peroxide as a by-product, which can predispose stromal cells to a reactive, cancer-promoting state with elevated production of extracellular matrix molecules, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. This study investigated the clinical relevance and previously unrecognized function of stromal MAOB in PC.<br \/>Methods. The stromal MAOB expression levels were determined in PC clinical specimens by immunohistochemistry and in publicly available multi-omics cancer datasets, which were associated with different clinical parameters. The human prostatic stromal fibroblast PrSC cells engineered for stable overexpression or knockdown of MAOB were co-cultured with a panel of human PC cells in 2-D or 3-D fashion, followed by examination of cancer cell behavior by cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. MAOB-knockdown PrSC cells were co-inoculated with luciferase-tagged PC cells as subrenal tissue recombinant xenografts into mice for assessment of MAOB&#8217;s impact on tumor growth by bioluminescence imaging.<br \/>Results. MAOB expression was induced in the stroma associated with primary PC compared to normal prostatic tissues of clinical samples, which was corroborated by the same MAOB expression trend in three matched pairs of patient-derived fibroblasts. Following the analysis of three independent clinical cohorts, increased stromal MAOB levels were shown to be correlated with higher Gleason scores, castration resistance, survival, and appearance of neuroendocrine differentiation as evidenced by CHGA expression in the adjacent epithelia. Co-culturing MAOB-overexpressing PrSC cells with several human PC cell lines (C4-2, PC-3, DU145 and C4-2B<sup>ENZR<\/sup>) accelerated cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conversely, these cancer cell phenotypes were suppressed in the presence of MAOB-knockdown PrSC cells. Additionally, C4-2 tumor xenografts when co-inoculated with MAOB-knockdown PrSC grew to a substantially smaller size in mice, which was paralleled by reduced Ki-67 index and reactive stromal marker &#945;SMA expression in the tumor and stromal compartments respectively, compared to controls.<br \/>Conclusion. Our results suggest that the elevated MAOB expression in PC stromal cells is associated with poor clinical outcomes and further contributes to adjacent PC growth, which provides new insights into understanding the stromal support of PC pathogenesis and progression.<br \/>Funding provided by the NIH\/NCI grant R01CA258634 and WSU CPPS startup fund (to B.W).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e9b3eac-23b2-491c-99aa-ff073e0a310e\/@A03B8ZHQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor microenvironment,MAOB,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13156"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tainjie Pu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Hui Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tzu-Ping Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boyang Wu<\/i><\/presenter>.

Vessel co-opted lesions are characterized by highly motile cancer cells that move toward and along the pre-existing vessels in the surrounding non-malignant tissue and hijack them to gain access to nutrient. In order to access the sinusoidal vessels, the cancer cells must displace the hepatocytes and occupy their space. However, the mechanisms underlying this displacement are unknown. Herein, we examined the involvement of apoptosis, motility, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and autophagy pathways in hepatocyte&#8217;s displacement by cancer cells. We demonstrated that cancer cells induce the expression of the proteins that associated with upregulation of apoptosis, motility and EMT in adjacent hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, we observed upregulation of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and Actin Related Protein 2\/3 (ARP2\/3) in adjacent hepatocytes to cancer cells, while we noticed lower expression levels of E-cadherin. Importantly, Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) knockdown in the cancer cells has impaired their function towards adjacent hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our data indicating that cancer cells may exploit various mechanisms to displace the hepatocytes and access to the sinusoidal vessels to establish vessel co-option.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/882bd9a2-41f0-45b7-9ed2-a7771033fa8d\/@B03B8ZHR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Motility,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13157"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Miran Rada<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthoula Lazaris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Metrakos<\/i><\/presenter>.

Only 24% of NSCLC patients survive 5-years post diagnosis, which could be attributed to the lack of efficient treatment strategies at the metastatic stage. Thus, understanding the biological mechanisms that promote NSCLC metastasis is critical for developing effective cancer-specific therapeutic agents. The development of cancer metastasis is greatly driven and influenced by intercellular communication. Key mediators of cell-to-cell communication are small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) of approximately 100-150 nm in diameter, often referred as exosomes. Previous report revealed that increased levels of exosomes in NSCLC patients correlated with lower overall survival. Indeed, secretion of sEVs by cancer cells can induce malignant transformation of non-cancerous cells nearby or at distant locations through influencing pre-metastatic niche formation. Therefore, biogenesis and release of cancer derived sEVs are determinant steps for the development of tumor metastasis. However, the mechanisms through which sEVs are produced and secreted by cancer cells are yet to be determined.<i> <\/i>Here, we isolated and characterized sEVs from a panel of NSCLC cell lines (H358, Calu6, H460, SKMES-1) and non-tumorigenic cells (BEAS-2B and HBEC) to identify mechanisms involved in the elevated secretion of EVs by cancer cells. Contrary to what has been previously reported in literature, our data demonstrated that not all cancer cell lines release high levels of sEVs. Our data suggests that elevated secretion of sEVs could be driven by specific mutations and oncogenic signaling in cancer cells. Among all the cell lines tested, H358 cells which harbor the infamous G12C mutation in KRAS, had the highest sEV release. Therefore, we hypothesize that the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> can drive high sEV production and secretion in H358 cells. Our preliminary data suggests that siRNA mediated knockdown of oncogenic KRAS signaling in H358 cells significantly decreases secretion of sEVs. Ongoing studies aim to pinpoint the detailed mechanisms by which cancer cells utilize KRAS oncogenic signaling to promote EV biogenesis pathways and tumorigenesis. The current study will provide the foundation to developed new therapeutic strategies against tumor sEVs-driven metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f62207ac-50cc-44c3-aece-1dc40916fdb1\/@B03B8ZHR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,KRAS,Extracellular vesicles,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13159"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zulaida M.

In has been demonstrated epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is related to E-cadherin expression level. The loss of E-cadherin expression results in tumor proliferation and metastasis. Recently, studies have been demonstrated the collective cancer cell migration which expresses high E-cadherin is a powerful mechanism of metastasis. Therefore, the role of E-cadherin in cancer metastasis is still not clear. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) was shown to regulate E-cadherin turnover on the membrane and the function of lysosome is also associated with cell vesicle trafficking, however, the role of lysosome in collective cell migration is not known. This study is investigating the role of lysosome in regulating E-cadherin dynamics through vesicle trafficking in collective colon cell migration. In the experiment, we used colon cancer cells with epithelial morphology and observed the relation of E-cadherin with endocytic protein clathrin, Rab5 and the recycling protein Rab11 in collective migrated cells. In the result, inhibition of lysosome activity by chloroquine treatment has great suppression effect on anchorage independent cell growth and inhibited collective cell migration. We observed that nocodazole treatment inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which caused E-cadherin to accumulate on the cell membrane. Western blot and confocal microscopy demonstrated chloroquine treatment induced Rab11 expression and accumulated in the cytosol which affected E-cadherin turnover. Our results demonstrated inhibits lysosome activity can suppress colon cancer cell growth and collective migration through lysosome mediated E-cadherin translocation.

In this study, we observed that mesenchymal GCs comprising 30-40% of datasets showed elevated level of infiltrating stromal cells and worse clinical outcomes. The analysis of xenograft sequencing revealed that the transcriptional signals representing EMT mainly come from stromal cells instead of tumor cells. In addition, no evidence of tumor-originating, EMT-driven stromal cells was found in single cell RNA sequencing data. Interestingly, expression of EMT signature genes in primary tumor was highly correlated with that of mouse genes. Microenvironment profiling identified a specific T cell subtypes associated with mesenchymal GCs such as T cell gamma-delta. Finally, deconvolution-based tumor, immune and stromal cells in mesenchymal GCs showed the YAP1 activation, representing the consequences of interactions of stromal component and cancer as well as defining the intrinsic and extrinsic hallmarks of mesenchymal GCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3d38f0de-ff04-49f1-8b3e-9b3dcfca4cc0\/@B03B8ZHR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-07 Tumor-stromal cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stomach cancer,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Stromal-epithelial interactions,YAP1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13161"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seungho Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taemin Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaeho Cheong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyongbum Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunghwan Lee<\/i><\/presenter>.
