T cell exhaustion is an important factor involved in treatment failure, and can, in part, result from continuous stimulation of the CAR by tumor cells expressing the cognate antigen. To gain deeper understanding of CAR T cell exhaustion induced by chronic antigen exposure (CAE), we developed and validated a robust in vitro model, in which mesothelin-redirected CAR T cells (M5CAR) were continuously stimulated with mesothelin-expressing AsPC-1 pancreatic tumor cells such that tumor cells were never cleared, and we characterized these CAE CAR T cells by gene expression at population and single-cell levels, and by epigenetic analyses.<br \/>CAE M5CAR T cells recapitulate the hallmarks of T cell exhaustion, including reduced proliferation, down-modulation of surface CAR, decreased cytokine production, and reduced cytotoxicity. In addition, CAR T cells undergoing CAE have a transcriptional signature and an epigenetic landscape consistent with exhaustion. Further, transcriptomic analysis revealed that CAE M5CAR T cells undergo a transition from T cells to a post-thymic NK-like T cell phenotype. This plasticity was confirmed by TCR lineage tracing and was also detected in CD19 CAR T cells analyzed from post-infusion blood from DLBCL patients and in M5CAR T cells infiltrating relapsed tumors derived from a xenograft NSG\/AsPC-1 mouse model. The dysfunctional signature and the NK phenotype were further detected in vivo by transcriptomic analysis in Ly95 TCR-specific TILs infiltrating NY-ESO-1 tumors. Among the genes included in the dysfunctional signature, the transcription factors SOX4 and ID3 were identified as potential regulators of dysfunction by differential gene expression and pathway analyses. To determine their role in the establishment of a dysfunctional phenotype, we generated ID3KO.M5 and SOX4KO.M5 CAR T cells using CRISPR technology in primary human lymphocytes. The cytotoxic potential of the M5 CAR T cell product generated was not modified by the genetic disruption of the transcription factors. However, when CAR T cells were challenged with chronic antigen stimulation, KO CAR T cells showed a significant reduction of the dysfunctional signature and the NK-like T cell gene expression. Importantly, CAE KO CAR T cells exhibit improved cytotoxicity as compared to Mock.M5CAR T cells.<br \/>In summary, we have developed a robust in vitro model that recapitulates the hallmarks of T cell exhaustion and that facilitated the identification of a gene signature defining CAR dysregulation, a T-to-NK-like-T cell transition as a novel feature of CAR T cell dysfunction and the transcription factors SOX4 and ID3 as key regulators of CAR T cell exhaustion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Dysfunction,NK-like T cell,T cell exhaustion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>M.

Here, we sought to understand key T-cell intrinsic factors impacting efficacy, namely CAR T-cell expansion, persistence, and homing to the tumor. Using an approach called reverse fate mapping, we followed individual T-cell clones at the single-cell level from pre-manufacture apheresis to the infusion product, tumor-involved lymph node, and blood at peak and late expansion in 12 adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel, an FDA-approved CD19-CAR T-cell immunotherapy. The resulting CAR T-cell atlas comprises matched transcriptome (scRNA-seq) and surface protein expression (CITE-seq) for 322,028 cells from 44 samples, with 119,397 unique T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes identified. This atlas enabled us to ask questions like: &#8220;<i>What were the phenotypes of the most successful CAR T-cell clones at the time of infusion or pre-manufacture apheresis?<\/i>&#8221; We found that T-cell clonotypes with juvenile features at apheresis, including <i>IL7R<\/i> expression, were the most successful at expansion to higher frequencies in the infusion product, while clones with effector gene expression programs, such as those encoding perforin and granzymes, contracted between apheresis and product. Conversely, it was <i>GZMK<\/i>-expressing T cells in pre-manufacture apheresis that were dominant in the tumor early following CAR T-cell infusion. Further, T-cell clonotypes with active effector programs at infusion dominated at peak expansion. Finally, we defined active expression modules and pathways in the infusion product for CAR T-cell clones that homed to the tumor or became dominant at late expansion. These analyses pinpoint the molecular mechanisms that could be modulated to rationally steer CAR T-cell differentiation trajectories at the genetic or pharmacological level. <i>This work was supported in part by the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Kite Pharma, and Stanford Cancer Institute.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD19,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Adoptive cell therapy,Adoptive immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zinaida Good<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark P.

TCRs targeting public tumor associated antigens (TAAs) offer the widest potential coverage of patients within and across tumor types. TAA-specific TCRs, however, are rare in the blood and when detected are frequently of low affinity due to negative selection of high-affinity self-antigen reactive T cells in the thymus. Here, we present a TCR discovery platform based on <i>in <\/i>vitro generation of T cells from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) using the previously described artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system. We hypothesized that ATO-derived T cells offer several advantages for TCR discovery including a novel TCR repertoire and the absence of negative selection against TAAs during T cell development.<br \/>Sequencing of the TCR repertoire of polyclonal CD8+ T cells generated from a HLA-A*02:01+ PSC line confirmed low junctional diversity at both the TCR beta and alpha loci, consistent with our previous finding of low TdT expression during T cell development from PSCs and an enrichment for germline-like TCRs. We then interrogated this novel TCR repertoire for reactivity against two well-described HLA-A2-restricted epitopes of NY-ESO-1 and WT1, reactivities to which are rare in the blood. Following co-culture with artificial APCs, a surprisingly high frequency of antigen-specific T cells was detected by MHC-tetramer staining. From these, high frequency TCR clonotypes were functionally validated by reconstitution in Jurkat TCR-reporter cells. Interestingly, from a single experimental run multiple antigen-specific TCRs were validated (5 out of 10 tested clonotypes for NY-ESO-1, and 2 out of 5 for WT1). This finding was reproducible across independent experimental runs, yielding further validated TCRs against these targets.<br \/>To benchmark relative TCR affinities, we compared a panel of 5 ATO-derived NY-ESO-1 TCRs with 4 blood-derived TCRs with the same specificity, as well as the affinity-enhanced 1G4 TCR. ATO-derived TCRs showed not only superior performance to their blood derived counterparts in peptide dilution assays, but TCRs were identified with equivalent or superior cytotoxicity to 1G4, including against cell lines with endogenous NY-ESO-1 expression. Comparative <i>in <\/i>vivo anti-tumor efficacy studies are in process. A similarly high level of specificity and cytotoxicity was observed for ATO-derived WT1-specific TCRs.

Using mouse models, we previously described a chimeric orthogonal receptor (o9R) comprised of an orthogonal IL-2R&#946; extracellular domain (ECD) and an IL-9R intracellular domain (ICD). Adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells engineered with o9R showed superior anti-tumor activity in mice treated with orthogonal IL-2 (oIL2). To evaluate the translational potential of o9R signaling, we generated and evaluated a human chimeric orthogonal IL-2R&#946; ECD\/IL-9R ICD (ho9R).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We hypothesized that ho9R in tumor-specific T cells would result in distinct signaling, phenotypic and functional properties compared to the human orthogonal IL-2R&#946; (ho2R), mirroring our observations in the mouse system. Activated T cells were retrovirally transduced with two vectors: one encoding either ho9R or ho2R and another encoding a T cell receptor (TCR) specific for NY-ESO-1 in the context of HLA*0201. Transduced and sorted T cells were exposed to mouse serum albumin-bound human orthogonal IL2 (MSA-hoIL2) or wildtype IL-2 (MSA-hIL2) for 20 mins to evaluate STAT-1, -3 and -5 phosphorylation. We assessed proliferation and memory differentiation of transduced T cells cultured in MSA-hoIL2 or MSA-hIL2 for one week or after repetitive tumor challenge using an HLA*0201+ NY-ESO-1+ melanoma tumor cell line (M407-nRFP) in the presence of MSA-hoIL2 or MSA-hIL2. After four tumor challenges, T cells were restimulated to quantify intracellular cytokine production. Comparisons between ho2R and ho9R T cells were made using unpaired t-tests or 2-way ANOVA.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Consistent with the mouse system, human T cells signaling through ho9R activated pSTAT-1, -3 and -5, whereas ho2R signaling primarily activated pSTAT5. Similar to the mouse system, ho9R signaling resulted in weaker proliferation than ho2R or wildtype IL-2 signaling (p&#60;0.001). Despite weaker proliferation, ho9R signaling expanded a population of T<sub>SCM<\/sub> cells (CD45RA<sup>+<\/sup>CD27<sup>+<\/sup>CCR7<sup>+<\/sup>CD95<sup>+<\/sup>; p&#60;0.0001). The difference in T cell phenotype between ho9R\/NYESO1-TCR and ho2R\/NYESO1-TCR T cells persisted even after four challenges with M407-nRFP in the presence of MSA-hoIL2: ho9R\/NYESO1-TCR T cells retained more CD45RA<sup>+<\/sup>CD27<sup>+ <\/sup>and T<sub>SCM <\/sub>cells (p&#60;0.01), and expressed higher levels of CD62L (p&#60;0.05) and CXCR3 (p&#60;0.001). Upon re-exposure to antigen after four tumor challenges, ho9R\/NYESO1-TCR T cells expressed more IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, and IL-2 (p&#60;0.0001) and exhibited greater polyfunctionality than ho2R\/NYESO1-TCR T cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In tumor-specific T cells ho9R signaling activates STAT-1, -3, and -5, promotes stemness, and maintains effector polyfunctionality despite repetitive antigen stimulation, providing human evidence for its potential in adoptive T cell therapy of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Cytokines,Interleukin-2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mito Tariveranmoshabad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leon L.

However, some patients fail to have sustained responses, in large part to due limited persistence of their CAR T cells. Previous attempts to prolong CAR T cell survival have attempted to combine CAR T cell therapy and cytokine therapy (IL-2, IL-15) to increase persistence, but this combination of T cell activation and high levels of systemic cytokines can lead to toxicities. To enhance CAR T cell persistence and while mitigating potential cytokine toxicities, we present a bicistronic CAR T engineered to express a membrane-bound drug-degradable IL-7 (mbdIL7) on its surface in addition to a 2nd generation anti-CD19 CAR.<br \/>The mbdIL7 is composed of an IL-7 molecule anchored to the cell by a CD80 hinge\/transmembrane domain and followed by a cytoplasmic super-degron tag and drives JAK\/STAT5 signal transduction. Both mbdIL7 abundance and STAT5 phosphorylation can be efficiently suppressed with lenalidomide, an FDA approved drug, at sub-therapeutic doses. The mbdIL7 can supplant the requirement of exogenous cytokines during manufacturing and leads to a more central memory-biased T cell phenotype. mbdIL7 CAR T cell proliferation remains antigen-dependent. These novel mbdIL7 CAR T cells have similar <i>in vitro<\/i> effects to traditional CAR T against models of leukemia and lymphoma, but have distinct transcriptional profiles associated with lower levels of exhaustion. In an orthotopic xenograft lymphoma model, mbdIL7 CAR T cells demonstrate markedly enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to traditional anti-CD19 CAR T cells. In addition, mbdIL7 CAR T cells have increased expansion\/persistence in the blood, bone marrow, and spleen. The inclusion of a membrane-bound degradable IL-7 into the backbone of a traditional anti-CD19 CAR allows for spatial and temporal control of a pro-persistence cytokine leading to a more effective CAR T treatment. This presents a potential controllable CAR T for patients that are currently not responding conventional FDA-approved products.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Mantle cell lymphoma,Ubiquitination,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael C.

This was exemplified in a clinical trial of CD22-directed CAR T cells where despite inducing complete remissions in &#62;70% of patients, post-CAR relapses occurred in the majority of patients, driven by decreased expression of CD22 below the threshold required for adequate CAR T cell activation. To address this limitation of CAR T cells, we investigated the mechanism underlying suboptimal CAR responses to low levels of antigen. Using a SILAC\/mass spectrometry approach, we performed global phosphoproteomics to examine CAR T cell signal transduction in response to high- and low-levels of CD22 antigen. Low levels of CD22 antigen resulted in decreased utilization of several canonical T cell signaling pathways in CAR T cells. We hypothesized that LAT, a scaffolding protein integral to the T cell signalosome, was inefficiently utilized in response to low levels of antigen. Indeed, while signaling events proximal to LAT, such as Zap70, were unaffected by CD22 antigen density, phosphorylation of LAT at multiple activating residues decreased in response to stimulation with CD22-low leukemia cells. To overcome the inefficient LAT activation by low levels of antigen, we designed a bicistronic construct consisting of a clinically active 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation CD22-BBz CAR along with a novel <u>A<\/u>djunctive <u>L<\/u>AT <u>A<\/u>ctivating CAR incorporating the intracellular signaling domain of LAT (ALA-CART). ALA-CART cells expressed both CARs on the surface and demonstrated enhanced phosphorylation of LAT and PLC&#947; in response to CD22-low leukemia cells. In xenograft models, ALA-CART cells completely eradicated CD22-low leukemia, significantly extending survival of mice in comparison to the standard CD22-BBz CAR which only modestly slowed leukemia progression. Additionally, in mice engrafted with leukemia expressing WT-levels of CD22, we found the persistence of ALA-CART cell was significantly enhanced relative to standard CD22-BBz CAR T cells. Thus, by identifying deficits in CAR signaling, we rationally designed the ALA-CART platform to target antigen-low cells, overcoming a mechanism of resistance to standard CAR therapies with the potential to improve outcomes of patients receiving CAR therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Preclinical testing,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Catherine Pham-Danis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lillie Leach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Ebmeier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>M.

This rate has changed little in the last 30 years, highlighting the need for novel therapies. A promising new strategy with the potential to control tumor growth without toxicity to healthy tissues employs immune T cells engineered to target proteins uniquely overexpressed in tumors. Mesothelin (Msln) is overexpressed in high grade serous ovarian cancer, contributes to the malignant and invasive phenotype, and has limited expression in healthy cells, making it a candidate immunotherapy target in these tumors.<br \/><i>Methods: <\/i>The ID8<sub>VEGF<\/sub> mouse cell line was used to evaluate if T cells engineered to express a mouse Msln-specific high-affinity T cell receptor (TCR<sub>Msln<\/sub>) can kill murine ovarian tumor cells <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo<\/i>. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with TCR<sub>Msln<\/sub> T cells plus anti-PD-1, anti-Tim-3 or anti-Lag-3 checkpoint-blocking antibodies administered alone or in combination, ultimately allowing targeting up to three inhibitory receptors simultaneously. Single cell RNA sequencing was used to profile the impact of combination checkpoint blockade on both the engineered T cells and the tumor microenvironment.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: In a disseminated ID8 tumor model, adoptively transferred TCR<sub>Msln<\/sub> T cells preferentially accumulated within established tumors, delayed ovarian tumor growth, and significantly prolonged mouse survival. However, our data also revealed that elements in the tumor microenvironment (TME) limited engineered T cell persistence and ability to kill cancer cells. Triple checkpoint blockade, but not single- or double-agent treatment, dramatically increased effector cytokine production by intratumoral TCR<sub>Msln<\/sub> T cells. Single cell RNA-sequencing revealed gene expression changes in engineered T cells and myeloid cells in the TME consistent with activation and inflammation. Moreover, combining adoptive immunotherapy with triple checkpoint blockade prolonged survival in the cohort of treated tumor-bearing mice, relative to TCR<sub>Msln<\/sub> with or without anti-PD1, or double-agent treatments.<br \/><i>Conclusions:<\/i> Inhibitory receptor\/ligand interactions within the tumor microenvironment can dramatically reduce T cell function, suggesting tumor cells may increase expression of the ligands for PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 for protection from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In a model of advanced ovarian cancer, triple checkpoint blockade significantly improved the anti-tumor function of transferred engineered T cells and improved outcomes in mice in a setting in which single checkpoint blockade had no significant activity. These results suggest that disrupting multiple inhibitory signaling pathways simultaneously, which can be more safely pursued in a cell intrinsic form through genetic engineering, may be necessary for improved efficacy in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Advanced Ovarian Cancer,Immunosuppression,Engineered T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kristin G.
