Additional key eligibility criteria included ECOG Performance Statue (PS) 0-2, no active central nervous system metastases, autoimmune disease, or need for steroids at doses of <u>&#62;<\/u>10 mg of prednisone or the equivalent. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Disease assessments were performed every 12 weeks until progression. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicity. All patients were to submit a fresh tumor biopsy and whole blood for correlative endpoints prior to cycle 1 and again at week 5.<br \/>Results: 92 eligible patients were enrolled, 69 to ipi\/nivo, 23 to ipi. Median age was 64 and 69 in the ipi\/nivo and ipi arm respectively. 67% and 65% were male. 65% of patients in both arms had ECOG PS of 0. With a median follow up of 25.3 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was 0.63 (90% CI 0.41, 0.97) with a statistically significant 1-sided p-value of 0.04 favoring ipi\/nivo. The 6-month PFS estimates were 34% (90% CI: 25%-44%) and 13% (4%-27%) for ipi\/nivo and ipi respectively. ORR was 28% for ipi\/nivo (95% CI 17%-40%) and 9% for ipi (95% CI: 3%-34%). With a median follow up of 24.4 months, 39\/69 patients in the ipi\/nivo arm and 12\/23 patients in the ipi arm had died. 12-month OS was 63% (90% CI 52%-72%) in the ipi\/nivo arm and 57% (38%-71%) months in the ipi arm. HR for OS was 0.94 (90% CI 0.54, 1.62) in favor of ipi\/nivo with a p-value of 0.42. Adverse event rates were similar in both arms. One treatment related death was reported in the ipi\/nivo arm due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and one treatment related death was reported in the ipi arm due to colonic perforation.<br \/>Conclusions: This is the first prospective randomized study comparing ipi\/nivo to ipi alone in patients with melanoma without response to anti-PD1 therapy. Ipi\/nivo was associated with improved progression free survival as compared to ipi alone. The response rate of 28% to ipi\/nivo as compared to 9% to ipi alone implies that patients who do not respond to PD-1 alone can be rescued with ipi\/nivo. The toxicity of combination therapy was manageable. Ipi\/nivo is an appropriate standard in patients with metastatic melanoma who do not respond to single-agent PD-1 therapy.

Through dendritic cells activation, increase in CD8 T-cell infiltration and interferons induction, it produces an immunogenic cell death. Phase 1 study (NCT02828098) showed ORR 20% in patients (pts) with anti PD-1 resistant melanoma (mel). Hence phase 2 trial was designed.<br \/>Study design: Single arm study (NCT04570332) with intratumoral BO-112 plus intravenous pembrolizumab in pts with mel (cutaneous, acral or mucosal) and confirmed progressive disease (PD) while on anti-PD1 based therapy. Pts were treated with BO-112, 1-2 mg on a weekly basis for 7 weeks and thereafter Q3W in 1-8 different lesions. Pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered Q3W. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 by independent reviewer. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS) and safety. Exploratory objectives included radiomic signatures, itRECIST and evaluation of tumor microenvironment. At least 20% of pts had to achieve response in order to consider primary endpoint met.<br \/>Results: Recruitment was completed 24th August 2021 with 42 pts; female 43%; median age 66 (rank 27-88). Table summarizes basal characteristics.<br \/>With 40 evaluable for response pts, 10 achieved response (25%): 3 complete response (CR) and 7 partial response (PR). 17 pts (44%) achieved a stable disease (SD), meaning a DCR of 68% with 18 pts still on treatment. The 4 pts with a baseline LDH&#62;3xULN developed PD no later than week 8. Responses per histology were: 66% mucosal, 28% cutaneous, 0% acral. Responses per <i>BRAF\/NRAS<\/i> status were: <i>BRAF<\/i> mutant (Mut) 43%, <i>NRAS<\/i> Mut 31%, and <i>BRAF\/NRAS<\/i> wild type (WT) 17%. 33 pts (79%) had at least one BO-112 related adverse event (AE) being only in 2 cases grade&#62;3 (G4 infusion reaction and G3 myalgia). Most common related AEs were asthenia, pyrexia, diarrhea, vomiting and chills. Study treatment was not discontinued in any pts due to related AE.<br \/>Conclusions: The primary efficacy endpoint has been met. Additionally, disease control (PR+CR+SD) is meaningful and durable in a population with no current standard treatment options. Very high LDH levels (LDH &#62;3xULN) and acral mel could predict poor outcome. Safety profile was manageable without treatment discontinuation due to AEs. <table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{9F235BA7-305D-4E79-AE4F-95738262F590}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">N (ITT pts, 42) (%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AJCC8 M1C\/D<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">19 (45)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\"><i>BRAF<\/i><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mut<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">7 (17)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">35 (83)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">Previous treatment<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ipilimumab-nivolumab<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">6 (15)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Anti PD-1 monotherapy<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">33 (79)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other combo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">3 (7)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">Prior line indication<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Adjuvant<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">11 (26)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Advanced<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">31 (74)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">LDH<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;ULN<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">17 (41)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">Best ORR (IRCR evaluable pts, N=40)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Global<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mucosal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cutaneous<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Acral<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10 (25)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (66)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8 (28)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (18)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (33)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (21)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (33)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2* (7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SD<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17 (43)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (33)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (45)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (37)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (33)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8 (28)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (63)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>*2 pts had pathologic CR and RECIST SD","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,BO-112,immunotherapy,intratumoral,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Iván Márquez-Rodas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Dutriaux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Saiag<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis De la Cruz Merino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eduardo Castanon Álvarez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Robert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan F.

Preclinically, inhibition of CD39 by TTX&#8209;030, a first-in-class fully human anti-CD39 antibody, reversed immunosuppression by maintaining high levels of immune-stimulatory extracellular ATP while reducing suppressive adenosine. The addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy has recently become the standard of care of 1st&#8209;line (1L) treatment of locally advanced or metastatic (LA\/M) gastric cancer but further improvements are needed.<br \/>Methods: An expansion cohort of Study TTX&#8209;030&#8209;002 (ongoing, US and South Korea) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of TTX-030, budigalimab (anti-PD-1) and FOLFOX for the 1L treatment of patients (pts) with LA\/M HER2&#8722; gastric\/GEJ adenocarcinoma. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included ORR by RECIST\/iRECIST, and PFS. Correlative studies included the analysis of intratumoral expression of CD39 and PD&#8209;L1.<br \/>Results: Forty-four pts were enrolled with the median age [range] of 61 [30&#8722;81] years, 41% were female, and 57% were Asian. Pts had an ECOG of 0 (39%) or 1 (61%), 70% had gastric adenocarcinoma, 30% had GEJ adenocarcinoma. As of the safety data cutoff (Nov 19, 2021), 39 pts (89%) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent AE (any Grade, regardless of relatedness). Twenty-one pts (48%) experienced at least 1 AE considered related to TTX-030 (any Grade); five (11%) experienced a Grade 3\/4 AE considered related to TTX-030. There were no Grade 5 TEAEs. Eleven pts (25%) had experienced SAEs; none were considered related to TTX-030. The most common AEs by preferred term (any Grade, regardless of relatedness) in &#8805;10 pts were nausea (52%), neutrophil count decreased (39%), decreased appetite (30%), diarrhea (25%), and fatigue (23%). The most common Grade &#8805;3 AEs (regardless of relatedness) in &#8805;2 pts were neutrophil count decreased (27%), febrile neutropenia (5%), hypokalemia (5%). As of the efficacy data cutoff (Dec 2, 2021), the median time [range] on study was 139 [8&#8722;375] days. Among 38 efficacy evaluable pts, 23 pts experienced PR or better as best response (PR: n=21; CR: n=2; ORR=61%), 12 experienced SD, and 3 had PD. Thirty-six of the 38 efficacy-evaluable patients had known PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS); response rates were 4\/10 (CPS &#60;1), 8\/10 (CPS &#8805;1 and &#60;5), and 11\/16 (CPS &#8805; 5).<br \/>Conclusions: Preliminary results indicate that the combination of TTX-030, budigalimab and FOLFOX exhibited promising efficacy as 1L treatment of LA\/M gastric\/GEJ cancer regardless of CPS status and has a manageable safety profile without evidence of excessive toxicities. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of an anti-CD39 antibody in combination with chemo-immunotherapy in gastric cancer. Updated clinical and biomarker data will be included in the final presentation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL01-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,Cancer immunotherapy,Gastric cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zev Wainberg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon-Koo Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keun-Wook Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Tae Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Chao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Catenacci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sung Yong Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heloisa P.

The bispecific format is engineered to preferentially inhibit these two checkpoints on activated T cells in tumors, where co-expression is particularly abundant. This may maximize tumor-specific response and reduce the peripheral toxicity that is common when targeting these checkpoints independently. Here we present dose-escalation data from a phase I, open-label, multicenter study in advanced solid tumors (NCT03530397).<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients (pts) were &#8805;18 years old (ECOG PS 0-1) with tumors not amenable to standard therapy. Pts were treated at 10 dose levels from 2.25-2500 mg IV Q3W until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were safety and identification of maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives included preliminary antitumor activity by RECIST v1.1, PK and immunogenicity. Exploratory objectives included evaluation of pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers.<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (Sept 30, 2021), 86 pts (median age, 60.5 years; male, 75.6%; Asian, 57.0%) were enrolled. The most common tumor types were RCC (22.1%), NSCLC (16.3%), and head and neck cancer (8.1%); 95.2% had received prior systemic therapy and 90.7% were immunotherapy-na&#239;ve. MEDI5752 showed dose-dependent PK and sustained peripheral PD-1 receptor occupancy (&#62;90%) at doses &#62;225 mg. Dose-dependent increases in peripheral T cell proliferation (Ki67+) and activation (ICOS+) plateaued at doses &#8805;500 mg and demonstrated CTLA-4 specific blockade in the range of tremelimumab 6-10 mg\/kg. At doses &#8805;500 mg, MEDI5752 significantly expanded new and existing T-cell clones, likely broadening the tumor antigen-driven T-cell response. Across all doses, objective responses were seen in 19.8% of pts (n=17, 1 complete and 16 partial [PR]). Median duration of response was 17.5 months. Molecular response (defined as &#8805;50% reduction in ctDNA) occurred in 36.5%. Doses &#8805;1500 mg (n=53) were poorly tolerated with Grade (G) 3\/4 treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) in 50.9%; discontinuations due to TRAEs in 45.3%, and death in 1 (at 2000 mg). However, doses &#60;1500mg (n=33) had improved tolerability with G 3\/4 TRAEs in 18.2% and discontinuations due to TRAEs in 9.1%. An MTD was not reached by protocol-defined DLT criteria. Immune-related AEs were also less common at doses &#60;1500 mg than at &#8805;1500 mg (G 3\/4 in 18.2% vs 49.1%, respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: MEDI5752 showed encouraging antitumor activity with durable clinical benefit. Doses &#60;1500 mg were better tolerated than doses &#8805;1500 mg. Treatment led to robust dual checkpoint blockade, evidence of T-cell activation and expansion of new and existing T-cell clones at pharmacodynamic levels that exceeded what is clinically feasible with dosing of conventional anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. MEDI5752 is now being explored at doses &#60;1500 mg in multiple expansion cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Bispecific antibody,Anti-PD-1,Anti-CTLA-4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ben Tran<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Voskoboynik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang-We Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlotte Lemech<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enric Carcereny<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Young Rha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myung-Ju Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enriqueta Felip<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ki H.
