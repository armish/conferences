[{"Abstract":"Bacterial and viral species present in the human lung are associated with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) exacerbations, lung cancer initiation and response to immunotherapy by impacting immune cell recruitment. Recent studies have identified microbiomes present in normal and tumour low-biomass samples. These microbes, potentially present within cancer and immune cells, exist in niches specific to tumour types. These studies are often single-region and single-timepoint biopsy studies which promotes the question as to whether heterogeneity of the microbiome can exist within a tumour as well as progression of the microbiome from primary tumours to metastasis. Exploring microbial heterogeneity by leveraging the multi-region and longitudinal data from TRACERx, we aimed to identify microbes present clonally as well as studying enrichment of microbes in metastatic regions or associations with genotypes.<br \/>We conducted 16S (V3V4) sequencing of over 600 TRACERx samples including primary, adjacent normal and metastatic tissues. Stringent decontamination was applied using computational methods as well as completed at sequencing centre and extraction level sites. The 16S data was aligned to the SILVA-138 reference genome using the QIIME2 pipeline. We also performed analysis on matched RNA-sequencing data through tools such as KRAKEN2 and SHOGUN.<br \/>Diversity metrics across histological subtypes, COPD status or gender did not yield significant differences or show an enrichment of genus with patient characteristics. However, a trend of decreasing microbial diversity was associated with smoking which demonstrates that the effects of smoking can lead to dysbiosis of a healthy lung microbiome. Within primary tumours, increased tumour sampling improved the detection of microbial diversity and presence of microbes found at a lower abundance, revealing a heterogenous microbial landscape. Furthermore, matched primary and metastatic tumours are highly similar compared to tumours from unmatched patients (P = 0.017) This suggests that primary and metastatic tissues share a similar community within patients, however an enrichment of opportunistic microbes was found in metastatic tissue. Finally, we also measured the association of specific microbes with different driver genotypes and several significant associations were discovered such as NOTCH1+ LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma) patients were enriched for Firmicutes.<br \/>Studying the microbial landscape of NSCLC through an evolutionary lens provides insight into microbial dissemination from primary tumours to metastases and co-occurrence with genotypes. The multi-region and longitudinal approach to studying the microbiome has exposed levels of microbial intratumor heterogeneity. Moreover, recognising that metastatic tumours have an overlapping microbiome to the primary site offers potential for durable therapeutic utility, via targeting clonally present species.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e5f67971-3bca-4b56-941e-e5eddd7c505c\/@K03B8ZLj\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Heterogeneity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11523"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Krupa Thakkar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongchang Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Selvaraju Veeriah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Litchfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Swanton<\/i><\/presenter>, TRACERx Consortium.

In this study, we investigated the role of <i>C. albicans<\/i> infection in upper GI tract SCC development using an APECED-like IKK&#945; kinase-dead (KA\/KA) mouse model. We found that KA\/KA mice developed upper GI tract SCC after oral infection of WT <i>C. albicans<\/i> weekly for three months. Interestingly, while upper GI tract SCC development in <i>C. albicans <\/i>- infected KA\/KA mice is IL-17a-independent, EGFR pathway plays an important role in <i>C. albicans<\/i> infection-mediated tumorigenesis in KA\/KA mice, as evidenced by significantly lower SCC incidence in the upper GI tract of KA\/KA mice infected with <i>Als3<\/i><i><sup>&#916;<\/sup><\/i><i><sup>\/&#916; <\/sup>C. albicans<\/i>. Moreover, upper GI tract SCCs from WT <i>C. albicans<\/i>-infected KA\/KA mice exhibited robust p-EGFR and Ki67 signals.

Meanwhile, EGFR inhibition dramatically reduced <i>C. albicans<\/i> colonization in upper GI tract and the weight of stomach in KA\/KA mice. Furthermore, we found that aberrant infiltrations of neutrophils and macrophages with significant inflammatory signatures were present in the upper GI tract SCCs in KA\/KA mice. Interestingly, KA\/KA neutrophils exhibited a defect in <i>C. albicans<\/i> killing capacity due to functional defects in ROS generation, degranulation, NETs formation, and apoptosis. We reasoned that KA\/KA neutrophils&#8217; inability in <i>C. albicans<\/i> killing capacity may further enhance the tumor-promoting microenvironment.

However, the contribution of microbiome to brain tumors is yet to be understood. A crosstalk between the gut and oral microbiota and the brain microenvironment has been demonstrated in the context of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that distinct gut and oral microbial signatures are associated with primary and metastatic brain tumors.<br \/>Methods: Matched stool, saliva, and buccal swab samples were collected prospectively from patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors who underwent surgical tumor resection at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Samples were collected using the OMNIgene microbiome collection and stabilization kits (DNAgenotek, Kit Number OM-200, OMR-120, and OM-505 for stool, buccal swab, and saliva, respectively). Samples were then processed, aliquoted, and stored at -80 C. Samples from 10 patients for each disease type were sequenced via metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Taxonomic profiling was conducted through MetaPhlAn and Virmap, for bacterial and viral taxa, respectively. Beta diversity was analyzed using Bray-Curtis and UniFrac analyses. Biom files were further analyzed to identify the signatures associated with each disease type, using the Phyloseq and Microbiome packages in R and heatmaps were generated using the Pheatmap package.<br \/>Results: Microbiome beta diversity analysis demonstrated distinct clustering of stool, saliva, and buccal swab samples in both primary and metastatic brain tumor patients, which confirmed high sample quality and lack of cross-contamination between buccal swab and oral samples during sample collection. Analysis of oral microbiome samples demonstrated distinct bacterial and viral signatures that were enriched in metastatic brain tumors in comparison to primary brain tumors. In contrast, the composition of gut microbial taxa was comparable between metastatic and primary brain tumors and demonstrated enrichment in Bacteroides and Microviridae families.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>Our analysis of gut and oral microbiome in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors suggest that distinct bacterial and viral taxa within the oral microbiome are enriched in metastatic brain tumors. We are in the process of expanding our clinical cohort to further validate these findings. Moreover, mechanistic studies are ongoing to understand the contribution of microbial signatures to the development and progression of metastatic and primary tumors.

In a preclinical trial, oral vancomycin slowed the growth of cancer in <i>avatar<\/i> mice gavaged with stools of some pancreatic cancer patients but not of others. Statistical analyses reveal that the gut of JAX mice hosts a common human gram-positive gut commensal <i>Ruminococcus gnavus<\/i> that is associated with increased cancer growth in those mice. Monocolonization of germ-free mice with<i> R gnavus<\/i> directly increases tumor growth. Similarly, feeding <i>R gnavus<\/i>, but not a control bacterial species, brings the baseline tumor kinetics of CR mice up to that of JAX mice. Our experiments reveal that <i>R gnavus <\/i>needs sufficient dietary tryptophan (Trp) to promote tumor growth and in turn, catabolizes Trp into various metabolites including the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) ligand Tryptamine, which we find, is also tumor-promoting <i>per se. <\/i>The tumor-modulating effects of oral vancomycin, tryptophan catabolites and <i>R gnavus<\/i> are abolished when murine AHR is stimulated by an exogenous ligand or when it is knocked out.

LFS is caused by germline mutations in the <i>TP53<\/i> tumour suppressor gene. LFS patients develop cancer significantly earlier than the general population and may experience multiple malignancies in their lifetime. Studies have indicated that environmental influences like radiation exposure and tobacco smoke may further increase cancer risk in LFS patients. Currently, there is no cure for LFS, and screening for early tumour detection is the standard of care for LFS patients. Recently, microbes have been found to be involved in cancer development, progression, and treatment responsiveness. Moreover, microbes have anti-tumourigenic properties that can be harnessed for therapeutic intervention. The interaction between microbes and cancer can be through contact-dependent, contact-independent, and\/or immunological interactions. Profiling the microbiome in the context of cancer may provide prognostic and\/or diagnostic options for patients. However, interactions between the microbiome and mutant p53 in LFS has not been studied to date. We induced dysbiosis using a combination of antibiotics in LFS mice harbouring the heterozygous <i>Trp53 <\/i>R172H mutation. Following 7 days of treatment, we challenged mice with subcutaneous injections of the MC38 colon adenocarcinoma cell line. We observed an increase in tumour volume in LFS mice treated with antibiotics; this change was not observed in p53 wildtype mice. These findings highlight potentially unique interactions between mutant p53 and the microbiome which influence tumour growth in the context of LFS. We also found that LFS mice treated with metformin have smaller tumours compared to untreated mice. A particular genus of bacteria, <i>Faecalibaculum sp<\/i>., was found to be upregulated in a cohort of metformin treated mice, and the abundance of this bacterium is inversely proportional to tumour volume. Zagato et al. have shown that <i>Faecalibaculum rodentium<\/i> has anti-tumourigenic properties through the production of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA).

Next, CSI-Microbes is tested on Merkel cell and colorectal carcinoma where it identifies both reported and previously unknown tumor-specific intracellular microbes. Finally, CSI-Microbes is applied to analyze the intracellular microbiome of thirteen lung tumors where it identifies four tumors with bacterial taxa enriched in tumor cells and two tumors with bacterial taxa enriched in stroma or immune cells.

Equol is a microbial metabolite that is exclusively produced by the conversion of soy isoflavones in the diet by specific intestinal bacteria. Interestingly, equol has previously been shown to exhibit anti-androgen effects on prostate cells and likewise may act as a radiosensitizer. We analyzed the microbial composition of fecal samples collected from men receiving stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) versus observation to treat oligometastatic prostate cancer as part of the ORIOLE trial and found that patients harboring equol-producing bacteria had a lower risk of disease progression. We therefore aimed to study the effect of this compound on prostate cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>. MTT assay was used to assess the effects of equol treatment on cell viability in androgen receptor (AR) positive LNCaP cells and AR null PC3 cells over time. We assessed the ability of equol to reduce AR protein levels and\/or subcellular localization in LNCaP cells using immunohistochemistry. Finally, western blotting was used to assess the effects of equol treatment on prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels to assess effects on the AR signaling pathway. Cell viability was significantly decreased over time in equol treated cells, but only in prostate cancer cell lines that were AR positive. The effects of equol on LNCaP viability was abrogated in an AR knockdown LNCaP cell line. Interestingly, AR protein levels were found to be markedly decreased upon equol treatment of LNCaP cells. We likewise observed a decrease in PSA protein levels in AR positive cells after equol treatment. Our results support the notion that equol can inhibit prostate cancer growth by inhibition of the androgen receptor. We are currently investigating whether combining equol exposure with radiation treatment produces a synergistic effect on DNA damage and reduction of prostate cancer cell viability and survival <i>in vitro<\/i>. Our future studies will investigate the effects of equol and equol-producing bacteria on tumor growth in <i>in vivo<\/i> models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/af7aa661-a55d-4ff6-9749-6214648a5ceb\/@L03B8ZLk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Androgen receptor,Radiation therapy,Diet,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11530"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"7402b5c5-fe69-4846-b623-856d82e7b351","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7402b5c5-fe69-4846-b623-856d82e7b351\/@L03B8ZLk\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carli B.

We investigated the relationship of commensal microbiota with host DNA methylation (DNAm) and gene expression in colorectal adenoma, the major precursor of CRC.<br \/>This study included 72 participants from the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study. Microbiome, DNA methylome, and transcriptome data of fresh frozen conventional adenoma samples were generated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and RNA-seq, respectively. Among 35 participants with microbiome and matched DNA methylome data, microbial features were evaluated for their associations with DNAm at CpG sites (CpGs) via linear regression. False-discovery rate (FDR) correction was conducted separately for each microbial feature and significant associations were identified at FDR&#60;0.1. DNAm at microbiome-associated CpGs were then tested for their correlations with expression of flanking genes (500Kb) among 45 subjects with DNA methylome and matched transcriptome data. For genes with expression significantly (FDR&#60;0.1) correlated with DNAm at microbiome-associated CpGs, their differential expression between colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas were examined using microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, 363 conventional adenoma samples) and CRC Subtyping Consortium (CRCSC, 2,760 adenocarcinoma samples). The R package &#8220;<i>limma<\/i>&#8221; was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes at FDR&#60;0.1.<br \/>Four alpha diversity indexes, three beta diversity matrices, and 194 taxa were investigated for their associations with DNAm at 28,081 variable CpGs (variance&#62;0.02 across samples). Faith&#8217;s phylogenetic diversity index and abundance of 11 taxa were significantly associated with DNAm at 68 CpGs. Among them, the most significant association was observed between <i>Lactococcus<\/i> and cg03292388 (&#946;=-0.67, <i>P<\/i>=4.39&#215;10<sup>-9<\/sup>). DNAm at 11 of the 68 CpGs were significantly correlated with expression of 12 genes (551 genes tested). Six of these 12 genes were found in data from GEO and CRCSC, and three showed a significant differential expression between adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Integrating these results revealed potential bacteria-DNAm-gene-adenocarcinoma pathways in which <i>Bacteroides<\/i> <i>ovatus<\/i>, three CpGs, and three genes were involved. Specifically, increased abundance of <i>B.<\/i> <i>ovatus<\/i> was associated with decreased DNAm at cg19003815 (&#946;=-0.28, <i>P<\/i>=7.64&#215;10<sup>-5<\/sup>), which was correlated with increased expression of <i>RARB <\/i>(rho=-0.65, <i>P<\/i>=2.18&#215;10<sup>-6<\/sup>). These findings are in line with the higher expression of <i>RARB<\/i> in adenocarcinomas compared to adenomas (fold-change=1.51, <i>P<\/i>=8.58&#215;10<sup>-10<\/sup>).<br \/>In conventional adenomas, bacterial-related host DNAm changes may affect expression of nearby genes, which might be implicated in adenoma-carcinoma development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/206c6893-b488-491f-ac08-c575c3e34433\/@L03B8ZLk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Colorectal adenoma,Microbiome-host interactions,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11531"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yaohua Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jirong Long<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martha J.

Prior data from our group has demonstrated that these invasive biofilms are prevalent in colorectal cancer, are directly tumorigenic in germ-free and specific pathogen-free <i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i> mouse models, and are associated with enrichment of the polyamine N1,N12-diactylspermine (DAS) in patient samples. However, whether the composition of these biofilms impacts their pro-tumorigenic behavior and\/or metabolism is presently unknown.<br \/>Methods: Carnoy&#8217;s-fixed CRC resections from 115 patients from the University of Malaya in Malaysia were stained with the all-bacterial EUB338 probe and screened for mucus-invasive biofilms (BF). All BF+ samples were subsequently stained with oligonucleotide probes targeting Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Lachnospiraceae, and &#947;\/&#946;-Proteobacteria. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss780 confocal microscope with linear unmixing. Untargeted metabolomics was performed on 5-10 samples of each biofilm type using a Waters UPLC Xevo GS-XS quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer. Five <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum<\/i> (Fn) strains derived from CRC cohorts were singly gavaged into germ-free <i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice and colons were harvested for tumors 11 wk later.<br \/>Results: Seventy-nine of 115 Malaysian tumors (69%) were BF+ using EUB338 staining. As with our prior US CRC cohort, BFs were more prevalent on the tumors proximal to the hepatic flexure (35\/39, 90%) vs. those that were distal (44\/76, 58%) (Chi-square <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). Of the BF+ tumors (BF+T), 55% were polymicrobial (predominantly Bacteroidetes\/Lachnospiraceae), 40% were polymicrobial with fusobacterial blooms, and 5% were Proteobacteria dominant. Untargeted metabolomics of BF- healthy biopsies, BF-T, and BF+T with various BF composition subtypes revealed a gradient in levels of the polyamine DAS, with BF+T with fusobacterial blooms having the highest levels (p = 0.055 vs. Proteo-dominant BF+T, p = 0.043 vs. polymicrobial BF+T, p = 0.015 vs. BF-T, p &#60; 0.001 vs. BF- healthy biopsies), suggesting that fusobacteria may drive proliferation and polyamine production in CRC tissues. However, inoculation of 5 different CRC-derived Fn strains including a strain isolated from a Malaysia CRC patient did not promote tumorigenesis in germ-free <i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice.<br \/>Conclusions: Fusobacterial-dominant biofilms are prevalent in a Malaysian CRC cohort and are associated with high levels of the polyamine N1,N12-diacetylspermine. However, <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> strains were not tumorigenic in germ-free <i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice, suggesting that the association between Fn, DAS, and tumorigenesis may require other bacteria in order to confer a procarcinogenic state.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f18e713-a292-49d6-9966-2ffb27e60336\/@L03B8ZLk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),Metabolomics,Microbiome,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11532"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julia L.

Indeed, these studies have demonstrated that these microorganisms have beneficial properties that allow them to selectively colonize tumor and that they could also be considered as predictive drug efficacy biomarkers. Based on these results, bacteria are now used for delivering therapeutic components or for shaping the gut microbiota. Ultimately these approaches lead to the activation of an immune response against the tumor. Owing to our scientific and technological expertise in manipulating microbes, we propose tailor-made strategies for investigating the efficacy of bacteria-based treatments and\/or the effect of therapies on the microbiota both in vitro and in vivo. Different methods\/analyses can be used for culturing, detecting, quantifying, identifying and localizing live bacteria (e.g. counting of CFUs, PMA-qPCR, 16 rRNA gene sequencing, mass spectrometry, bioluminescence) in simple or complex samples (e.g. from culture of single bacterial species to rodent\/human stools or other tissues). In addition, a continuum of assays allows us to evaluate the impact of bacteria or derived products directly on tumor and\/or immune cells (e.g. immune infiltrate and phenotyping, cytokine\/chemokine profiling, tumor burden). We will highlight some results obtained in a cancer context such as the immunostimulatory properties of bacteria or their derivatives, the selective colonization of tumor tissue by bacteria, the benefits in delivery of therapeutic proteins or antigens by bacteria, the impact of tumor engraftment\/growth on gut microbiota, the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on intestinal microflora, the consequences of supplementation with bacteria or antibiotics treatment on the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Altogether these data demonstrate that bacteria are now allies in the treatment of cancer and that our comprehensive platform is suitable for evaluating both in vitro and in vivo therapeutics developed from bacteria (individuals, consortium or derived products; native or modified). All these technologies can be also applied to develop novel therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and infectious diseases known to increase the risk of cancer development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bb5c5721-bc48-46fd-8d9c-77532463beb7\/@j03B8ZLm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bacterial therapy,Microbiome,Cancer therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11534"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sylvie Maubant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Leblanc<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabeth Bertrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Bertaux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loic Morgand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Ramelet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Lux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Olivier Duchamp<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabrice Vivani<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently, a few studies have demonstrated that specific fungi may promote tumor progression, stressing the importance of comprehensively studying the tumor mycobiome and its effects. To address this, we have characterized the mycobiome in 1,183 human tumors and their adjacent tissues, originating from eight major solid tumor types. Staining and imaging demonstrated the presence of fungi in both cancer and immune cells, with tumor-type specific distribution patterns. Quantitative PCR of the fungal 5.8s rDNA revealed the presence of fungal DNA in all tumor types. To characterize the tumor mycobiome and address potential contamination during tissue handling and processing, we subjected all samples, as well as 295 negative controls of different types, to sequencing of the ITS2 region that is situated between fungal rRNA genes. We found cancer-type specific mycobial signatures with relatively high similarity between tumors and their adjacent tissues. While the fungal mycobiome had a lower species richness as compared to the bacterial microbiome of the same tumors, fungi showed significant co-occurrences with specific bacteria, suggesting the existence of ecological niches within the tumors. We also found significant correlations with clinical parameters such as patient&#8217;s age, tumor stage, progression-free survival, overall survival, and response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Characterization of the tumor mycobiome may add a biologically relevant, previously overlooked, component to be considered in the study of cancer, including its effects on tumor initiation, progression, diagnosis, and response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f428c5b-2757-4ade-a6cd-7bcdd39656f7\/@j03B8ZLm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11535"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lian Narunsky Haziza<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory D.

The overall goal is the identify functional relationships between the bronchial mucosa microbiome and the risk of developing lung cancer. We evaluated the proteome of the microbiome using mass spectrometry and specialized microbiome authentication software. This method was applied to a case-control study of plasma samples donors of physician health study who donated plasma at different times prior to the onset of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. We also examined bronchial mucosa tissue samples near to, and distant from, the tumor harvested from surgical lobectomy specimens. Highly significant protein biomarker differences were found in the plasma and in the tissue samples that were blindly associated with cancer. These included specific proteins from the mucosal microbiome that may have functional role in the carcinogenic process. These key diagnostic risk markers were shared between the premalignant bronchial mucosa tissue and the plasma, supporting the concept that risk markers of bronchial mucosa lung cancer carcinogenesis can be detected in the peripheral circulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5125064f-bb28-4112-98d1-d69f5b76c662\/@j03B8ZLm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Microbiome,Tumor,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11536"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rayan I.

Gut microbial co-metabolic interactions with the RCRC microenvironment are poorly defined and present a novel therapeutic target. Here, we present a multi-omics analysis of RCRCs.<br \/>A prospective observational pilot study was performed at Imperial College London NHS Trust, UK. Treatment naive patients undergoing elective resectional surgery for primary RCRCs were recruited. Fresh intra-luminal fecal samples were obtained at three anatomical sites: 5 cm pre-, tumor, and 5 cm post-tumor. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and CDX2 expression were immunohistochemically evaluated. Metataxonomic analysis was carried out on a MiSeq Platform (Illumina, USA). Metabolomics analysis was performed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (Acquity UPLC, Xevo G2-S Q-TOF, Waters). After pre-processing, univariate and multivariate statistics were carried out in MetaboAnalyst and RStudio.<br \/>20 patients (8 females, mean age 69.9(53-83)) were included. Of the n=20 RCRCs, n=2 were ileo-cecal valve, n=4 were cecal, n=4 were cecum\/proximal ascending colon, n=4 were mid-ascending colon, n=2 were ascending\/hepatic flexure, n=2 were hepatic flexure, and n=2 were transverse colon cancers. Tumor classification according to TNM 8 indicated n=4 T1, n=1 T2, n=11 T3, n=4 T4; n=12 as N0, n=6 as N1, and n=2 as N2; n=2 as M0, n=1 as M1c, and n=17 as MX. All n=20 were CDX2 positive and n=16 had normal expression of mismatch repair proteins, n=4 showed MSI. Triglyceride (TG) species were significantly associated with T3-4 rather than T1-2 (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01). Ceramide and diacylglycerol species were significantly associated with T1-2 rather than T3-4 (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01). Multiple TG, an acyl carnitine, and a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) species were associated with MSI status rather than no MSI status (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01). An integrative analysis pipeline was developed to investigate statistically significant covariance between specific metabolites and taxa (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01). Specifically, Procrustes similarity analysis of the multi-omics dataset revealed a negative correlation at pre- (<i>p<\/i>=0.606) and tumor level (<i>p<\/i>=0.738), but significant similarity at post-tumor level (<i>p<\/i>=0.045). This pattern in post-tumor may indicate cancer specific co-metabolism. At the post-tumor site, the LPA species increased in MSI, showed a negative correlation with members of the <i>Oscillospiraceae family<\/i>. Ceramide species, significantly increased in early-stage CRC, demonstrate negative correlation with the <i>Lachnospiraceae<\/i> family.

Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was applied to infer functional categories associated with taxonomic composition. The p values were adjusted using the false discovery rate. The a- and b-diversity analyses were performed using QIIME. The Mann- Whitney U test was employed to evaluate the statistical significance of b-diversity distances within and between groups of interest.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Across all the bladder cancer stool samples, estimation of relative abundance revealed of the five most dominant bacterial populations was Bacteroidales ( 46.21%), Clostridiales ( 32.29%), Burkholderiales (9.07%), Erysipelotrichales (3.20%) and Lactobacillales ( 2.20%). In contrast, healthy controls exhibited an increased relative abundance of Enterobacteriales ( 10.75% vs 0.52%) and Pseudomonadales (8.33% vs 0.18%) as compared to tumor samples. The microbial diversity differences between Bca and normal samples showed no differences across alpha diversity metrics (Shannon diversity p &#62; 0.05) as compared to normal tissue. However, there was significant difference in clustering of organisms as determined by principal coordinate analysis ( PCoA) ordination of unweighted UniFrac Distances, (p = 0.002).

Our cohort included 84 microsatellite stable and 5 microsatellite unstable (MSI) patients. We identified the presence of microbial species by mapping non-human RNA read sequences to a large catalogue of viral and bacterial microorganisms. Our methodology has been validated and determined to have comparable accuracy to reference microbial tests for both viruses and bacteria. We analyzed correlations between presence of specific microbial species and (1) clinicopathological variables such as age, stage, anatomic location and MSI status, (2) genomic variables such as tumor mutational burden, chromosomal instability and somatic alterations and (3) response to NAT. We identified 152 species with at least 100 mapped reads in 10% or more of our cohort. The median number of species per patient was 37 [IQR 16-66], with only 6\/89, 7% patients having no detected species at all. The most frequently detected species included well-known intestinal bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli<\/i>, <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum<\/i>, <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii<\/i> and several members of the <i>Bacteroides<\/i> genus. The <i>Parvimonas micra<\/i> coccus was more often detected in tumors from the lower rectum (13\/22, 59%, 0-4 cm from the anal verge) than the middle (8\/36, 22%, 4-8 cm) and upper rectum (5\/30, 17%, 8-12 cm) (p&#60;0.01). Several species from the <i>Gordonia<\/i> and <i>Rhodococcus<\/i> genera were associated with increased tumor mutational burden (p&#60;0.001) and significantly higher numbers of mapped reads in samples from the CMS1 molecular subtype (p&#60;0.01), which is enriched in MSI tumors. RNA-Seq based estimates of neutrophil abundance were positively correlated with detection of several <i>Ruminococcus<\/i> and <i>Prevotella<\/i> species (p&#60;0.001), highlighting the cross-talk between host immunity and microbiota. Opportunistic bacteria previously reported to benefit from a patient&#8217;s weakened immune system such as <i>Williamsia muralis<\/i> and several species of <i>Agrobacterium<\/i> were associated with lower rates of complete response (30% vs. 15%, n.s.) and significantly shorter disease free survival following NAT (3-year disease free survival was 25% in 8 <i>Williamsia<\/i> positive patients vs. 42% in 12 <i>Agrobacterium fabrum<\/i> patients vs. 87% in the rest of the cohort; pairwise log-rank p&#60;0.001).

Indeed, emerging data report a microbial presence in many cancer types, with breast cancer accumulating the most diverse bacterial population. Pathogen defense mechanisms, such as CHI3L1, contribute to bacterial elimination; however, CHI3L1 is overexpressed in several cancer types and correlates with poor prognosis and shorter survival. However, the connection between intra-tumoral bacteria and CHI3L1 and how they contribute to cancer growth has not been fully characterized.To investigate if microbiota and CHI3L1 are connected, female BALB\/c mice harboring 4T1-Luc cells were exposed to a broad-spectrum antibiotic mix to deplete the microbiota and to evaluate tumor growth and circulating CHI3L1 levels. 9 and 14 days after tumor inoculation, feces were collected and bacterial DNA isolated for 16S rRNA sequencing, and tumors were plated to identify intratumoral bacteria. To assess whether a specific bacterial strain could modulate CHI3L1 expression, we incubated 4T1 cells with supernatants from isolated bacteria, which contain metabolites and extracellular factors. Isolated bacteria that could upregulate CHI3L1 expression were then used to infect 4T1 cells prior to subcutaneous injection in the mammary fat pad of BALB\/c mice to evaluate if bacterial infection changes tumor growth rate.In the 4T1 mouse breast cancer model, a broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was able to: deplete host microbiota, abrogate tumor growth, and reduce CHI3L1 levels in the sera and in CD45<sup>+<\/sup> immune infiltrating cells in tumor and colon. When 4T1 cells were exposed to bacterial supernatants in vitro, we observed that CHI3L1 was upregulated by a specific strain of E. <i>coli<\/i>. To simulate the effect of intra-tumoral microbiota, we infected 4T1 cells with either the isolated E. <i>coli <\/i>or S. <i>aureus <\/i>(which did not induce any<i> <\/i>CHI3L1 modulation in vitro) prior to subcutaneous injection. Strikingly, E. <i>coli <\/i>infection increased tumor progression with respect to the control S. <i>aureus<\/i> infection (p&#60;0.01).Moreover, we observed an increase in CHI3L1 produced by tumor immune infiltrates in E. <i>coli<\/i>-infected 4T1, highlighting a key role for microbiota and CHI3L1 in tumor progression. Overall, our findings shed light on the important link between tumor associated bacteria and CHI3L1 in cancer progression. Identifying the mechanism of action through which microbiota and CHI3L1 influence cancer growth will open new possibilities for improved screening, prognosis, and survival for patients with breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/86503c6f-d7eb-49ac-b965-5cc152ab8eb9\/@j03B8ZLm\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Breast cancer,In vivo,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11540"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alessandro Mauro Mozzarelli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Carloni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Ferrrari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvia Giugliano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luca Tiraboschi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonino Lo Cascio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giulia Fornasa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniele Braga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Davide Golzato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicola Segata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppe Penna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Rescigno<\/i><\/presenter>.

Recently it has been reported that specific bile acids are accumulated in the breast cancer tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to a favorable prognosis for patients and reducing the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of the cancer. We hypothesized that breast cancers with increased bile acid metabolism may have a favorable clinical outcome due to the suppression of cancer cell proliferation.<br \/>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed total of 6285 patients from three independent breast cancer cohorts with TCGA as an exploring cohort and METABRIC, GSE96058 as validation cohorts. We divided each cohort into \"high\" and \"low\" groups by the top and bottom quartiles of the score following the previous reports.<br \/>RESULTS: High bile acid metabolism breast cancer enriched multiple metabolic pathway gene sets such as fatty acid and xenobiotic metabolism, as well as adipogenesis and protein secretion by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Adipocytes and preadipocytes were significantly infiltrated in the high score group. Considering the possibility that activation of bile acid metabolism is due to accumulation of microbiome-derived bile acids in breast cancer, we identified that four microorganisms (Anaerococcus, Collimonas, Gammaretrovirus and Hymenobacter) significantly correlated with the bile acid metabolism using TCGA 16s RNA seq data. Surprisingly, protein secretion gene set was significantly enriched to tumors that are abundant in three out of four of these bacterial species. This may suggest that bile acid metabolism are elevated in response to bile acids secreted by the microbiome present in breast cancer TME. The bile acid metabolism was highest in ER+HER2- and lowest in triple-negative, the most aggressive form of breast cancer. The score was negatively correlated with Ki67 gene expression and histological grade, consistent with previous reports that breast cancers with high bile acid accumulation were less proliferative. In agreement, breast cancers with low bile acid metabolism was associated with significantly high silent and non-silent mutation rates, Intratumor Heterogeneity, Proliferation score and Homologous Recombination Defects, and enriched G2M checkpoint gene set.

Meanwhile, higher microbial stochasticity has been introduced as the Anna Karenina principle (AKP) effect, which originates from the opening line of Leo Tolstoy and is translated in the microbiome as &#8220;all healthy microbiomes are similar; each dysbiotic microbiome is dysbiotic in its own way&#8221;. Here, we aim to elucidate the effect of modifiable factors on microbiome stochasticity related to dysbiosis in CRC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Fecal samples from 331 CRC patients, were collected prior to their surgery at Seoul National University Hospital. Bacteria that were enriched in early- and late-stage CRC groups were identified by linear discrimination analysis effect size (LEfSE) method, which was then used to calculate microbial dysbiosis index (MDI). The association of dietary choices with microbiome variability was addressed using the LEfSE analysis. The difference of intra-sample similarity index among lifestyle factors and metabolic diseases was tested to examine the AKP effect. A tree-based analysis of food choices was constructed. We then applied Procrustes framework to analyze the shape of dietary diversity and microbiome.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The LEfSE identified <i>Leuconostoc, Oxalobacter, Acidaminococcus,<\/i> and <i>Methanobrevibacter <\/i>were enriched in early-stage CRC, whereas <i>Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Clostridium, <\/i>and <i>Granulicatella<\/i> were enriched in late-stage CRC patients. The MDI derived from these bacteria had 64.2% predictive ability for CRC stages, with sensitivity and specificity of 61% and 69%, respectively. The AKP effect was found for history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetes, whereas obesity and hypertension showed anti-AKP effect. For dietary choices, the hierarchical tree of foods and nutrients did not shape the microbial between-sample diversity. Additionally, high MDI was related with a high intake of pizza\/hamburger, poultry, and light-vegetable combination.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our study contributed to current evidence of the microbiome structure and dysbiosis at different stages of CRC. Furthermore, history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetes showed AKP effect in CRC patients. Non-significant association between dietary choices and microbiome diversity supported a small variation of microbiome profiles explained by dietary intake at the population level.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c9a0bdbf-b8d1-4519-9036-9e76a785fdd5\/@k03B8ZLn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11544"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tung Hoang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Jung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji Won Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-Yong Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeeyoo Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aesun Shin<\/i><\/presenter>.
