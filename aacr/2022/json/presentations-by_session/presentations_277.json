Standard of care therapy for these patients relies on androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) to block testosterone production combined with small molecules that inhibit androgen synthesis and\/or the function of the androgen receptor (AR). Importantly, androgens are reported to be immunosuppressive; therefore, we postulated that androgen axis blockade might promote response to immunotherapy. In the recent years, the co-inhibitory receptor TIGIT has emerged as a promising immunotherapy target, and we observed that TIGIT is highly expressed on tumor infiltrating T cells and NK cells in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with the AR antagonist enzalutamide. Likewise, in a mouse model of CRPC, we show that tumor infiltrating T cells express TIGIT and that treatment with enzalutamide increases its expression. In this model, neither treatment with anti-TIGIT alone nor with chemical castration and enzalutamide affects tumor growth. Remarkably, the combination of anti-TIGIT with chemical castration and enzalutamide leads to delayed tumor growth and long-term cures in about 60% of the animals. Taken together, our data suggest that androgen receptor blockade sensitizes immune cells in the tumor to respond to anti-TIGIT immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Enzalutamide,Immunotherapy,TIGIT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fanny Polesso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiangnan Guan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zheng Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amy E.

However, it also increases the frequency and severity of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as cardiotoxicity. Our previous results showed that CTLA-4 Ig (abatacept), an inhibitor of T cell costimulation through CD28, can reverse those irAEs in patients with cancer, however, its effect on the antitumor response remains unclear. In the B16F10 melanoma model, we injected mice with CTLA-4 Ig antibody when: 1) mice were first treated with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or combination (early time point) and 2) the immunotherapy was finished (late time point). We demonstrated that CTLA-4 Ig at the early time point compromised the antitumor efficacy of the immunotherapy. In contrast, the antitumor efficacy of the immunotherapy was improved if mice were treated with CTLA-4 Ig at the late time point. We also found that the antitumor response induced by CTLA-4 Ig (late) was dependent on CD80\/86. Interestingly, the frequency of ICOS+ Foxp3+ Tregs was significantly reduced by CTLA-4 Ig at the late time point. Thus, we treated B16F10 tumors in Foxp3DTR mice with anti-CTLA-4 and then with CTLA-4 Ig (late). The antitumor tumor efficacy was similar between mice treated with or without Diphtheria toxin (DT) at the late time point. This suggests that the improved antitumor efficacy of CTLA-4 Ig at the late time point was Treg dependent. Collectively, we show that CTLA-4 Ig treatment has a differential role throughout the time course of immunotherapy treatments, and this work suggests a potential combination treatment strategy with checkpoint blockade and late CTLA-4 Ig treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CTLA-4,PD-1,T cell,Regulatory T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen Mok<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James P.

However, delivery of these ligands in a tumor-specific manner to avoid systemic toxicity has been a challenge. Many current efforts rely on direct intra-tumoral injection of RNAs or other stimulatory immune ligands, which is therapeutically sub-optimal, especially for metastatic disease. Here we report studies evaluating the utility of a lupus-derived, cell-penetrating antibody, to deliver nucleic acids to tumors <i>in vivo. <\/i>This antibody, a modified version of 3E10-D31N, designated GMAB, forms non-covalent complexes with RNAs and can mediate highly specific delivery into tumors via intravenous injection by targeting the nucleoside transporter ENT2, which is highly expressed in tumor cells. Studies with labeled RNAs showed tumor specific delivery and functional expression by imaging, with minimal delivery to healthy tissues. Following these proof-of-concept studies, we investigated whether our antibody could be used to deliver RIG-I agonists to tumors. Using a known agonist of RIG-I, 3p-hpRNA, we demonstrated single agent activity of our GMAB\/RNA complexes in multiple tumor models, including a mouse model of melanoma (B16) and an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer (KPC). Measuring 3p-hpRNA by RT-PCR, there was a 1000X fold difference in RNA uptake in KPC tumor cells relative to CD45+ cells isolated from tumors. In addition, synergy between our GMAB\/RNA complexes and anti-PD-1 was additionally observed in mouse models of breast (EMT6) and colon (MC38) cancer. Given the expression of ENT2 along the blood brain barrier (BBB), we demonstrate single agent activity of our GMAB\/RNA complexes in an orthotopic mouse model of medulloblastoma, resulting in suppression of tumor growth and spinal metastases. Together, these studies demonstrate that the GMAB antibody can 1) localize to orthotopic and flank tumor models, 2) cross the BBB, and 3) deliver RNA payloads to tumors, providing a novel platform for delivery of immunogenic RNAs, as well as mRNAs and siRNAs, directly to tumors with high specificity following systemic administration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,Immunomodulation,Retinoic acid receptors,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elias Quijano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Martinez Saucedo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minsoo Khang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanfeng Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dale Ludwig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce C.

ILT2 (aka LILRB1) and ILT4 (aka LILRB2) are distinct ITIM-containing immunosuppressive receptors that recognize the shared ligand MHC-I. Both ILT2 and ILT4 are highly expressed on tumor infiltrating myeloid cells, while ILT2 is also expressed on tumor-associated T and NK cells. Given their common expression on myeloid cells, we anticipated that ILT2 and ILT4 blockade would be redundant. However, assays showed distinct functional activities of ILT2 or ILT4, with limited overlap. Here we explore the relative contribution of ILT2 and ILT4 on in vitro immune activation and in vivo anti-tumor activity.<br \/>Methods: Anti-ILT2 and anti-ILT4 antibodies were assessed on T cells, NK cells and various myeloid cell subsets, including monocytes, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and dendritic cells. ILT2 and ILT4 do not have clear murine orthologs; thus, to characterize in vivo activity, we utilized humanized murine tumor models, including PBMC-reconstituted and CD34-reconstituted mice. Mice were engrafted with tumors and treated with anti-ILT2, anti-ILT4, dual antagonist NGM707 and\/or anti-PD-1 antagonist antibodies.<br \/>Results: The in vitro and in vivo biology of ILT2 and ILT4 was explored using mono-specific antagonist antibodies, as well as the ILT2\/ILT4 dual antagonist NGM707. Surprisingly, ILT2- and ILT4-specific antibodies showed distinct activities on myeloid cell populations, despite expression of both receptors. Using assays designed to induce optimal MHC-I engagement, both ILT2 and ILT4 contributed to myeloid suppression. ILT2 blockade further enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, CD8+ T cell cytolytic activity and activation of NKG2C+ memory-like NK cells. Humanized mouse models were used to characterize the in vivo anti-tumor activity of ILT2 and ILT4 blockade. Consistent with our in vitro findings, we observed a distinct effect of ILT2 and ILT4 blockade on tumor growth inhibition. Combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody further enhanced tumor suppression.<br \/>Conclusions: Despite high expression of ILT2 and ILT4 on myeloid cell populations, evidence from standard in vitro assays suggested that ILT2 and ILT4 have distinct functional activities. Here, we provide evidence that both ILT2 and ILT4 play key roles in myeloid immune suppression, and that blockade of these two receptors can be additive or synergistic. ILT2 blockade additionally enhanced T cell and NK cell function. Furthermore, in vivo studies delineated a role for both ILT2 and ILT4 blockade in promoting anti-tumor immune responses and demonstrated that blockade of ILT2 and ILT4 is complementary to PD-1 inhibition. These data support the clinical evaluation of the dual ILT2\/ILT4 antagonist antibody NGM707 alone and in combination with PD-1 blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Macrophages,Tumor immunity,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jane Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samir Qurashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lauren Rocha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kalyani Mondal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suzanne Crawley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Medfisch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peirong Krisney Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie Roda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon Sitrin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmence Ho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Aguayo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee Rivera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiawei Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vicky Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alan Kutach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Sissons<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel D.

However, a substantial proportion of patients have suboptimal outcomes and variability in response remains incompletely understood. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) correlate with survival for single agent anti-PD1\/PD-L1 therapy in NSCLC, suggesting benefits of systemic immune activation. Similarly, combined pharmacological blockade of a second checkpoint, such as Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Antigen-4 (CTLA-4), with PD-1 gives heightened immune activation, resulting in both improved cancer outcomes and more irAEs.<br \/>Inherited heterozygosity for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and surrounding <i>CTLA-4<\/i> is associated with autoimmune disease, including autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Many of these autoimmune diseases are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from anti-CTLA4-induced irAEs, suggesting equivalence of pharmacological and genetic blockade of the gene. We hypothesised that SNPs impacting CTLA-4 function would be enriched in a cohort of NSCLC patients exhibiting exceptional response to single-agent anti-PD1. For the purposes of this analysis, exceptional response was defined as progression free survival of at least 2 years and one or more irAE of CTCAE grade 2 or higher.<br \/>We performed whole genome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq X Ten) on germline DNA from 35 prospectively recruited patients meeting these criteria from a treatment pool of over 700 patients. In these individuals, frequency of a curated list of SNPs located within a 200 kilobase region encompassing <i>CTLA-4<\/i> was analysed and compared to patients with lung cancer within the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) and to cancer- and dementia-free elderly individuals in the Medical Genome Reference Bank (MGRB).<br \/>Using linear regression analysis, we identified several non-coding SNPs enriched within the exceptional responders compared with control populations. One SNP was present in 15.7% of exceptional responders; twice the frequency of comparable cases within PCAWG and almost four times more than MGRB, remaining statistically significant following rigorous adjustment. This non-coding SNP is reported to exhibit differential enhancer activity and has been associated with RA and T1D. Its enrichment within the exceptional responders suggests that the altered CTLA-4 function may cooperate with blockade of PD-1 to confer higher immune response. This common variant may provide a biomarker for single agent anti-PD1 treatment or a potential therapeutic target. Pre-clinical analyses and validation within an independent cohort are underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CTLA-4,Immunotherapy,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>India A.

Combining stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) to increase release of cancer cell antigens with an anti-CTLA-4 and PD-L1 inhibitor may lead to increased response rates. Due to tumor heterogeneity it may be important to irradiate the primary tumor (addressing trunk mutations), instead of its metastasis (branch mutations). No solid predictive biomarker for response and\/or immunotherapy related adverse events (TRAEs) is available. Electronic nose (eNose) technology measures the complete mixture of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath and can detect lung cancer based on pattern recognition of the breath profile. We hypothesize that eNose is able to predict TRAEs and response in patients with NSCLC.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b> In 3 sequential cohorts, immunotherapy regimes combined with SBRT were studied in stage IIIB\/IV NSCLC patients progressing on chemotherapy. All patients were irradiated on the primary tumor (1x20 Gy on 9cc) 1 week after the 1<sup>st<\/sup> dose of immunotherapy. The 1<sup>st<\/sup> cohort (n=3) received durvalumab. The 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 3<sup>rd<\/sup> cohort (both n=6) received a combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab followed by durvalumab monotherapy. Duplicate eNose measurements were performed by using the SpiroNose that contains 7 metal oxide semiconductor sensors. TRAEs were categorized using NCI CTCAE version 4.3. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline characteristics and TRAEs. The relationship between breath profiles and response and TRAEs was analyzed with advanced signal processing, ambient correction and Mann-Whitney U test. Linear discriminant and receiver operating characteristics analysis followed. Pearson correlation and regression assessed duration of response.<br \/>Findings:<b> <\/b>Fifteen patients were included as described above. Baseline characteristics of the groups were comparable. Median progression free survival was 2 months, overall survival 10 months (immature). No statistical difference was found in (duration of) response. There was 1 low grade TRAE (CTC 1-2) in cohort 1 and 10 in cohort 2\/3. High grade TRAEs (CTC 3) were only present in cohort 2\/3 (n=3) and 1 patient discontinued treatment. There was one dose limiting toxicity. At baseline, 12\/15 patients performed eNose measurements; 7 with TRAEs and 5 without. The TRAE group had a significant higher sensor 7 signal compared to those without TRAE (p=.042). The cross-validated accuracy for detecting TRAE was 67%. The ROC-AUC was .857 [.638-1].<br \/>Interpretation:<b> <\/b>eNose breath profiles at baseline may predict which patients will develop TRAEs. The small sample size increases the risk of overfitting, therefore another cohort of 34 immuno-monotherapy patients is being analyzed (15 with and 19 without TRAEs, pending). We demonstrated no new safety data.<br \/>Disclosure: This study was sponsored by a research grant from AstraZeneca.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immunotherapy,eNose,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>M Benthe Muntinghe-Wagenaar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanneke Kievit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucie B.

Thus, pharmacological activation of STING pathway is actively being tested in many clinical studies. However, the clinical efficacy was not that clear, probably due to the limited expression of STING protein, which is tightly regulated by TRIM29 (E3 ligase)-mediated protein degradation pathway. Here, we present a novel small-molecule drug candidate with strong antitumor response in murine syngeneic model by upregulating cellular levels of STING through the inhibition of protein-protein interaction.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The inhibitors of STING-TRIM29 interaction were identified using luciferase-complementation high-throughput screening system.
