[{"Abstract":"Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and young adults. Despite the use of multi-agents chemotherapy and aggressive surgery, the survival of patients with osteosarcoma remains at 60% over the past three decades. In addition, the survival of patients who develop metastasis is dismal and often less than 25%. We have previously reported that serum C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) is associated with survival in a large cohort of osteosarcoma patients. CXCL10 is an interferon-induced chemokine that binds to its cognate receptor CXCR3 to elicit its cellular effects via both autocrine and paracrine signaling. CXCL10 can promote tumor cell migration and metastasis via autocrine signaling, while it recruits CXCR3+ immune cells to exert a tumoricidal effect via paracrine signaling. However, little is known about the effect of circulating CXCL10 in cancer. To understand the role of CXCL10 in the pediatric bone tumor, we showed that a number of osteosarcoma cell lines expressed the CXCR3 protein. The addition of exogenous CXCL10 promoted tumor cell migration of three osteosarcoma cell lines but did not affect cell proliferation. However, the migratory effect of osteosarcoma cells is not specific to CXCL10, as other CXCR3-associated chemokines (CXCL4, CXCL9, and CXCL10) exerted similar effects. Using an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated intravenous injection of CXCL10 increased the development of pulmonary metastases of osteosarcoma. In contrast, expression profiling of osteosarcoma primary tumors showed that elevated expression of CXCL10 and CXCR3 was associated with a better prognosis, suggesting that a paracrine effect of CXCL10 by recruiting CXCR3+ immune cells to the tumor site. This notion is supported by our immune cell population deconvolution results, indicating that the predominant infiltrating immune cell types are macrophages and CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which CXCL10 may play both pro-tumor and anti-tumor roles in osteosarcoma. While a high level of exogenous or circulating CXCL10 may promote tumor cell migration and metastasis, the chemokine can also recruit CXCR3+ immune cells to exert a favorable prognostic effect. Further characterization of the sources of CXCL10 in the tumor site and circulation may lead to the development of a therapeutic approach that promotes CXCL10&#8217;s anti-tumor effects and minimizes its pro-tumor effects to improve the survival of osteosarcoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc084983-93c9-4b30-895c-9479f6d55e6e\/@y03B8ZTJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Chemokines,Metastasis,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18011"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiang Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Margaret Clement<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Hicks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Tsz Kwong Man<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Substantial limitations in the rate of response underscore the need for suitable combination therapies. SRC family kinases is overexpressed or activated in multiple human malignancies, as a candidate target in regulating antitumor immunity. Saracatinib, an orally bioavailable multi-kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in CML. Here, we proved saracatinib as SRC inhibitor that were capable of increasing the antitumor immunity in non-small lung cancer.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>Cytotoxicity assays were used to determined antitumor activities of saracatinib in non-small lung cancer cell lines. The expression of PD-L1 expression in saracatinib 1 treated cell lines was investigated by western blots, quantitative PCR and flow cytometry. The effect of saracatinib in antitumor immunity alone or in combination with immunotherapy was also determined in vitro and in vivo.

In contrast, uterine leiomyoma (uLM) is the most common benign tumor of the uterus found in women of reproductive age. Extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and remodeling are thought to be crucial for the development of these two tumors. To better understand the differences of ECM dynamics in these tumors, we have collected samples from 67 uLMS, 66 uLM and 68 normal myometrium (MM) which were analyzed by RNAseq (Illumina) and a high-resolution isoelectric focusing (HiRIEF) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based method (Dionex UltiMate&#8482; 3000 RSLCnano System coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer, Thermo Scientific). After meta-analysis between uLM and uLMS groups using DESeq2 and edgeR, 112 genes were defined as common shared differentiatly expressed genes (DEG). Specific uLMS DEG were analyzed by gene ontology, KEGG pathway, and Reactome pathway. In the top 10 ranking of most affected biological processes\/molecular functions\/cellular components, we identified the gene SMOC2<\/i>, a secreted calcium-binding protein of the BM-40\/SPARC family which is present in the ECM and has been shown to be involved in fibrosis by modulating TGF-&#946;1. SMOC2<\/i> is upregulated in uLM and is downregulated in both RNA and protein expression level in uLMS, compared to MM samples. We also observed that the TGFB1 pathway is downregulated in uLMS and upregulated in uLM, suggesting that this may induce high production of ECM which is related to fibrosis. In conclusion, this preliminary data shows SMOC2 as a potential biomarker to differentiate uLM and uLMS at the protein level and we plan to further study the role of SMOC2 in cell lines to improve our understanding on uLMS malignancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/26633637-437a-48bf-aa15-dae17afca268\/@y03B8ZTJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,SMOC2,uterine leiomyosarcoma,extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18014"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chen Cai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raul Falcao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georgia Kokaraki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Estefano De Souza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gustavo De Souza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Woodard Carlson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tirzah Braz Petta<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the impact of fibrillar collagens on mesenchymal tumors is less understood. While uterine leiomyomas, also known as fibroids, are characterized by high fibrillar collagen deposition and depend on ECM signaling for cell proliferation, the impact of fibrillar collagens on malignant uterine leiomyosarcomas has not been explored. Thus, identifying malignancy and aggressiveness-associated features of the fibrillar collagen-leiomyosarcoma crosstalk may provide novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for these aggressive tumors. We used publicly available RNAseq data and performed RNAseq and picrosirius red analysis of fiber microarchitecture in a cohort of normal myometrium (MM; n =68 ), leiomyoma (LM; n = 66), and leiomyosarcoma (LMS; n = 67) tissues. Furthermore, we cultured patient-derived primary cells (4 MM, 3 LM, and 4 LMS) on collagen I-functionalized polyacrylamide gels at stiffness ranging from 0.5 to 115 kPa, covering the physiological and pathological stiffness, to investigate distinct behaviors between cell types, including proliferation, migration, and activity of the ECM stiffness molecular rheostat YAP\/TAZ. At the protein level, analysis of fibrillar collagen microarchitecture revealed that LMS tumors present reduced fibrillar collagen density and hyphal growth units and enhanced fiber endpoints compared to both MM and LM. At the gene expression level, however, LMS tumors did not show reduced fibrillar collagen expression, instead they exhibited enhanced matrix metalloproteinase expression, particularly of MMP14. Furthermore, COL11A1 was specifically upregulated in LMS tumors and its expression was associated with poor prognosis. Finally, in vitro response of MM, LM, and LMS cells to collagen I at defined stiffness showed that LMS cell migration, proliferation, and subcellular localization of YAP\/TAZ are less sensitive to substrate stiffness than in MM and LM cells, although the response varied between distinct donors. In conclusion, we show that LMS tumors typically present low fibrillar collagen protein expression likely due to enhanced degradation. In addition, collagen I adhesion and stiffness have a lower impact on malignant LMS cells than on MM and LM, which may explain their ability to grow in low-collagen microenvironments. Furthermore, this study shows that COL11A1 is a potential biomarker with prognostic value in leiomyosarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cfab1861-a5e8-41d9-a044-25d03025c560\/@y03B8ZTJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Collagen,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18015"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jordi Gonzalez-Molina<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paula Hahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raul Maia Falcão<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georgia Kokaraki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Estefano De Souza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tirzah Braz Petta Lajus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaisa Lehti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph W.

However, some populations of carcinoma cells resist ferroptosis, especially those with an epithelial phenotype but the mechanisms that promote resistance are poorly understood. We discovered that ferroptosis resistance in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) with an epithelial phenotype is dependent on expression of the integrin &#946;4 and its ligand laminin 332 (LM332). LM332 and the integrin &#946;4 maintain an epithelial cell state by downregulation of the EMT factor ZEB1. We further demonstrate that repression of ZEB1 by integrin &#946;4 and LM332 promotes YAP\/TAZ-mediated transcription of the C2 subunit of LM332, activating a positive feedback loop. Lastly, we observed that disrupting the &#946;4\/LM332 signaling axis sensitizes epithelial TNBC cells to ferroptosis by inducing ZEB1 expression. Our findings reveal a novel role for the extracellular matrix in promoting ferroptosis resistance by sustaining an epithelial phenotype and they suggest potential therapeutic strategies for overcoming this resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/794e9242-c06e-43f2-b813-741cbb9a27f4\/@y03B8ZTJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Integrins,Extracellular matrix,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18016"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emmet R.

The mesenchymal phenotype contributes to invasion, metastasis and therapy response variation. In this study, we characterize the downstream effects of <i>ZEB1<\/i> expression based on cohort dichotomization of quartiles of expression comparing the 25% of tumors with high <i>ZEB1<\/i> expression to the 75% of tumors with lower <i>ZEB1<\/i> expression. Differential gene expression (DGE), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and immune cell abundance prediction were accessed using PCa expression data from TCGA (n=488). <i>ZEB1<\/i> high status based on gene expression was stratified based on <i>ZEB1<\/i> expression values higher than the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> expression quartile value (n=122). Contingency analysis showed that <i>PTEN<\/i> loss is more frequent in the <i>ZEB1<\/i> high group (Chi-square, p=0.0005) which supports previously presented data from our group that showed an inverse correlation between ZEB1 and PTEN protein expression but showed no difference between the groups regarding presence of the <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> fusion. DGE showed that more than 13,000 genes are differentially expressed in the <i>ZEB1<\/i> high group while GSEA showed that signaling pathways such as HALLMARK TGF BETA, HALLMARK IL2 STAT5, HALLMARK INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE and HALLMARK NOTCH were upregulated in the <i>ZEB1<\/i> high group compared to the low group. Yet inflammatory response related pathways were observed enriched in the <i>ZEB1<\/i> high group, CIBERSORT analysis showed that effector immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and T helper cells (Holm-Sidak, p=000003 and p=0.000613, respectively) were enriched in the <i>ZEB1<\/i> low group in comparison to the <i>ZEB1<\/i> high group, which supports previous studies that suggest that ZEB1 cooperates with <i>PTEN<\/i> loss and <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> fusion to promote an immune evasive phenotype in PCa. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that gene expression changes associated with increased <i>ZEB1<\/i> expression may involve clinically relevant pathways such as modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment and NOTCH-dependent tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/026ab619-8b95-4765-b0cf-ef93ac472567\/@y03B8ZTJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Tumor immunity,Transcriptomics,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18017"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"0d15ef99-2bb5-4fa5-aa61-0227d80ccecb","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d15ef99-2bb5-4fa5-aa61-0227d80ccecb\/@y03B8ZTJ\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Luiz Paulo Chaves<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>André Luiz Caliari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Lautert-Dutra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Cesar Souza Silva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camila Morais Melo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabiano Pinto Saggioro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodolfo Borges dos Reis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Andrew Squire<\/i><\/presenter>.

Inactivating mutations of the <i>PTEN <\/i>tumor suppressor are one of the most common events in human malignancies that contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting many cancer Hallmark pathways. The <i>CDK12<\/i>, <i>RB1<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>AR <\/i>and <i>ZEB1 <\/i>genes have been variously implicated in pathways of PCa progression and immune evasion. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas derived PCa cohort (n=488, 96 homozygous and 64 hemizygous <i>PTEN <\/i>loss). Differential gene expression (DGE) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed for all five genes using the DESeq2 tool from the Bioconductor package for R.

Although chemotherapy-ICB modalities have been shown to improve clinical responses over those observed with ICB alone, long-term disease control is achieved only in a small subset of patients. To provide a rational basis for combination therapy, and to potentially develop more effective approaches, in this study we investigated the impact of chemotherapy on the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the context of PD-1\/PD-L1 axis blockade. ICB refractory murine models were utilized, including the TNBC 4T1 model and the Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) model. Following treatments with anti-PD-L1, docetaxel, or the combination anti-PD-L1 plus docetaxel, tumors were collected 4 days after the last treatment to evaluate early changes in the TME. Analyses included the characterization of tumor immune infiltrates via flow cytometry, RNA expression profiling via RT-PCR, RNA in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry for detection of immune infiltrates, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and phospho-Smad2 signaling. RNA analysis of 4T1 and LLC tumors revealed a significant upregulation of several transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) downstream target genes in the anti-PD-L1 monotherapy group. This increase was associated with enhanced expression of TGF-beta in the TME, as determined by RNA in situ hybridization, together with enhanced TGF-beta signaling denoted by increased expression of phospho-Smad2. Tumors treated with anti-PD-L1 monotherapy also exhibited increased numbers of alpha-smooth muscle actin positive fibroblasts in the TME. The effects observed with anti-PD-L1 as a monotherapy were not observed in tumors treated with docetaxel monotherapy or in those treated with the combination docetaxel plus anti-PD-L1 therapy, suggesting that upregulation of immunosuppressive TGF-beta signaling in the TME could be prevented by the addition of chemotherapy. Ongoing and future studies are aimed at understanding the mechanisms involved in the upregulation of TGF-beta signaling in the TME in response to anti-PD-L1 therapy in non-responsive tumors, the effect of various chemotherapies in this phenomenon, and the study of additional tumor models for optimization of chemotherapy-ICB modalities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0c41bc04-c31e-4058-b5f1-4e72643d8dae\/@y03B8ZTJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18019"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Masafumi Iida<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucas A Horn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiyan Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristen Fousek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Schlom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Palena<\/i><\/presenter>.

In a previous study, we discovered the existence of a novel K6-K14 keratin fusion variant (K6-K14\/V7) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells which can promote cancer stemness and aggressiveness. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that overexpression of K6-K14\/V7 in OSCC cells can influence the mechanical properties of the cells, leading to cell protrusion and enhanced extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion. Consequently, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TGF-[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font &amp;#946;]]) in the culture medium can be also increased. Normal oral fibroblast cells co-cultured with K6-K14\/V7-expressing OSCC cells can be converted into a pro-inflammatory type of cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAFs). Those findings suggest the ability of K6-K14\/V7-expressing OSCC cells in remodeling tumor microenvironment. In this study, we will discuss how K6-K14\/V7-expressing OSCC cells educate iCAFs to promote cancer cell migration and invasion via intercellular communication by EVs. The key signaling cascades and the associated regulatory networks will be also discussed. Our study, therefore, uncovers the pro-tumorigenic functionality of K6-K14\/V7 by creating an inflammatory tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a663cf0f-6747-4f50-b885-b8f39a4359b7\/@z03B8ZTK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Keratin cytoskeleton,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18020"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian Yu-Ting Kuo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yen-Ting Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Senthilkumar Ravichandran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Jinn-Chyuan Sheu<\/i><\/presenter>.

By focusing on LUAD, we showed that patients aged above 46 responded better and had longer progression-free survival than younger counterparts. Further, we presented a 58,031-cell catalog of age-associated single-cell transcriptomes from LUAD patients. Our analysis revealed the accumulation of immune response and chronic inflammation with increasing age. Aged tissues (&#62; 60 years) displayed dominant exhausted natural killer (NK)\/T cells and T regulatory cells and were enriched with two subtypes of tumour-associated macrophages marked by SPP1 and CX3CR1 expression, respectively. Furthermore, the ageing dynamics of stroma cells created a pro-tumor microenvironment reflected by increased angiogenesis and collagen formation.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>These results revealed an increasing immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment with age, supporting an observation of improved ICB response in older LUAD patients. Our extensive single-cell analysis enhances the understanding of age-dependent molecular and cellular dynamics in LUAD.

PDAC is resistant to both conventional therapies and emerging immunotherapies (IOT), apart from tumors with mismatch repair deficiency. This may be explained in part by its low tumor mutational burden (TMB) but also by its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). It has been suggested that CD73, a member of the adenosine pathway, expressed on cancer cells contributes to immune escape and resistance to cytotoxic\/radiotherapy treatment. The adenosine pathway converts the immune activator ATP, released by dying cells during cell turnover or after treatment, to extracellular Adenosine (eAdo), which is immunosuppressive.<br \/>Using syngeneic, <i>in vivo<\/i> models by s.c. implantation of KPC-derived cell lines (courtesy of Ben Stanger, UPenn) with differential immune infiltration and response to IOT [resistant (IOTResi) or responsive (IOTResp)], we showed by flow cytometry that the adenosine pathway is enriched in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells (in particular myeloid populations) which co-express CD39 and CD73, enabling the formation of eAdo. Mass Spec Imaging (MSI) revealed that adenosine distribution is heterogeneous in the tumors with high concentrations in the hypoxic margins that surround necrotic areas. Subpopulations of myeloid cells infiltrating the lesions are a target for eAdo, expressing high levels of adenosine receptor Adora2a. We discovered that pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages have the highest expression of the receptor and significantly higher in the IOTResi model. Blocking the <i>in vivo<\/i> formation and function of eAdo in IOTResi tumors, using a combination of anti-CD73 antibody (2C5, murine IgG1-Fc) and an inhibitor of Adora2a (AZD4635) reduced the presence of eAdo, slowed tumor growth and reduced the lung metastatic burden. The combination remodeled the TME, reducing the infiltration by M2 macrophages, particularly those that are PD-L1 positive and diminished the frequency of infiltrating Tregs. Bulk RNAseq analysis demonstrated a profound dependency of the TME on the presence of eAdo. Genes related to cytokine\/chemokine signaling, immuno&#173;suppression\/inflammation, hypoxia, metastasis and collagen production are strongly downregulated following administration of anti-CD73Ab\/Adora2ai. In addition, blocking the adenosine pathway improved the efficacy of combinations of cytotoxics (gemcitabine\/ATR inhibitor) and immunotherapy (aCD40\/anti-PDL1Ab).<br \/>The formation of eAdo appears to be a factor in the development of the immunosuppressive TME in PDAC, contributing to its resistance to conventional and novel therapies. Therefore, inhibition of the adenosine pathway using a CD73Ab and an Adora2ai may represent a strategy to modulate the PDAC stroma and improve therapy response in patients with PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95ae7d9e-cbe1-4977-8d8e-717b43d3dc1f\/@z03B8ZTK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular Adenosine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18022"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vincenzo Graziano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Dannhorn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kate Williamson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heather Hulme<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannah Buckley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheng Y.

In the present study, we excluded the direct antitumor effect of radiation by comparing three different fractionation schedules --8*2Gy, 3*4.5Gy, 1*10Gy, which have the same biologically effective dose (BED). We found the fractionation schedules 1*10Gy had a significant higher antitumor effect, suggesting that a single high-dose induced a more enhanced anti-tumor immunity compared to the conventionally fractionation(8*2Gy) and moderately fractionation (3*4.5Gy). However, in STING deficiency mice, we failed to find a different tumor control effect among the three dose-fractionation schedules, suggesting cGAS\/STING signaling was involved in regulating immunomodulatory effects that leading to different anti-tumor immunity. Further mechanism investigation revealed that single high-dose irradiation induced up-regulation of iRhom2 in infiltrated macrophage, and iRhom2 promoted cGAS\/STING signaling via maintaining stability of STING and facilitating STING trafficking from ER to perinuclear microsomes. Meanwhile, a positive feedback loop between iRhom2 and TNF&#945; sharpened the signaling responses, and amplified antitumor immunity induced by cGAS-STING-IFN pathway after single high-dose irradiation. Taken together, these results suggest that single high-dose irradiation induced iRhom2 up-regulation promotes macrophage anti-tumor activity through cGAS\/STING signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5d4a5812-8e9c-49c4-8f31-6ab9c580aa1a\/@z03B8ZTK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Radiation therapy,Immunomodulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18024"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaomei Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shisuo Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Biao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhaochong Zeng<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, it is well known that cell line models studied <i>in vitro<\/i> do not fully capture the biology in patient tumors due to the lack of the tumor microenvironment. The primary objective of this study was to perform functional genomic screens in <i>in vivo<\/i> models to identify clinically relevant epigenetic vulnerabilities.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>We designed an EpiDrug sgRNA library that target 357 epigenetic regulators in human, and applied this targeted sgRNA library for essentiality screen in 2D cell culture and 3D xenograft models. We subsequently selected targets that can only be identified <i>in vivo<\/i> for validation. We also investigated the underlying mechanism of the <i>in vivo<\/i> specific phenotype caused by target knockouts. Finally, we explored the clinical significance of treating selected target with a small molecule inhibitor.<b><\/b><br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>We identified MEN1 as the top hit that confers differential essentialities between <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Knockout of MEN1 has no impact on cell proliferation in 2D cell culture but profoundly promotes tumor growth in human lung and colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line derived xenograft models. In syngeneic colon cancer model CT26, knockout of Men1 resulted in faster tumor growth in immune deficient mice, but reduced tumor growth in immune competent mice. Mechanistically, knockout of MEN1\/Men1 can cause the redistribution of its interaction partner MLL1\/Mll1, a histone methyl transferase, to repeat regions in chromatin and stimulate the expression of double stranded RNA. This resulted in viral mimicry response, which activates a group of genes involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Single-cell RNA-seq and CyTOF analysis revealed that activation of the cytokines induces tumor promoting neutrophil and tumor suppressing CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, respectively. Using patient data from TCGA, we identified that the expression level of MEN1 is negatively correlated with neutrophil and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell tumor infiltration in most cancer types including lung and colorectal adenocarcinoma. A small molecular inhibitor targeting Men1-Mll1 interaction dramatically reduced CT26 tumor growth in immunocompetent mice, but its phenotype was reversed by CD8 neutralizing antibody. Finally, we demonstrated the strong synergy of the inhibitor with anti-PD-L1 antibody.<b><\/b><br \/><b>CONCLUSION: <\/b>Our study demonstrated the utility of <i>in vivo<\/i> CRISPR screen in identifying therapeutic targets that modulate tumor-microenvironment interactions, and identified MEN1 as a promising therapeutic targets alone or in combination with immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0973fee-acba-48b9-acfe-d00b0164d091\/@z03B8ZTK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,CRISPR\/Cas9,Immunocytokines,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18027"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peiran Su<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming-Sound Tsao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Housheng H.

While high densities of TLSs were reported to be associated with longer patient survival in several cancer types, there is no direct evidence where B cells in TLSs(TLBs) are derived from and whether these clones are consistent with tumor infiltrating B cells (TIBs), in endometrial cancer.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed the pathological distribution of TLSs and TIBs in human endometrial cancer samples using immunohistochemistry of a series of B cell markers and evaluated the relationship with patients&#8217; clinical outcomes. Additionally, we micro-dissected six pairs of tumor nests and their neighbor TLSs and analyzed the clonal consistency between TLBs and TIBs using the sequencing of complementarity-determining region (CDR) of B cell receptor (BCR).<br \/>Results: In 104 patients with endometrial cancer, TLSs were detected in 81 patients (78%) , and the absence of TLS was related to worse progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 0.15, P &#60;0.01). Among TLS-detected cases, the high number of TIBs was significantly associated with better PFS (P&#60;0.05). BCR analyses in the six patients found that three patients with advanced stage had a unique B cell clones in common between TLBs and TIBs, while the other three patients with early stage did not have any common B cell clones. The frequency of common B cell clones in the former three patients were 10.3% (5250\/51146 reads), 9.7% (1873\/19369 reads) and 3.0% (1034\/34618 reads).<br \/>Conclusion: TLSs and TIBs are associated with better prognosis in endometrial cancer.

Fifty-three patients with neoadjuvant therapy (immunochemotherapy, n=22; chemotherapy alone, n=31), resectable stage I~III, age&#8805;18 years, and ECOG performance status 0-1 were recruited in the study. Fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry was performed by the automated quantitative pathology imaging system with tumor samples obtained in radical surgery. The major pathologic response (MPR) rate was significantly higher in patients with neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy than chemotherapy alone (p=.025; OR=4.222, 95% CI: 1.292~13.800). Patients received immunochemotherapy had higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rate than those with chemotherapy (p=.168; OR=3.150, 95% CI: 0.792~12.535). Compared with chemo alone, the tumor to stroma ratio of CD68<sup>+<\/sup>CD163<sup>-<\/sup> density was significantly elevated in patients subjected to immunochemotherapy (p=.0399). When patients were stratified by the pathologic response to neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, the CD56dim in stroma significantly increased in patients achieved pCR than non-pCR (p=.038). The density of CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup> cells (stroma, p=.039; total, p=.027) and CD20<sup>+<\/sup> (total, p=.027) immune cells was significantly higher in patients achieved MPR than non-MPR. In patients administered with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, the expression level of PD-1 (p=.036), the density of FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup> (stroma, p=.025; total, p=.013) and CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>+ <\/sup>(total, p=.042) cells significantly reduced in patients reached pCR. The density of CD20<sup>+<\/sup> cells in stroma (p=.034) and the number of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS; p=.006) were significantly higher in patients reached MPR. In conclusion, the therapeutic efficacy was improved by neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in patients with NSCLC, which may be associated with the TIME remodeling, especially the migration of M1 macrophage from stroma to tumor islet.

OBI-3424 is a highly selective prodrug that is activated by AKR1C3 to release a potent bis-alkylating agent. This study aims to investigate whether OBI-3424 can induce ICD and create a tumor microenvironment that benefits the combination therapy of OBI-3424 with immune checkpoint inhibitors. OBI-3424 induced ICD was examined <i>in vitro<\/i> by incubation of the prodrug with AKR1C3 positive cells followed by the detection of damaging-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The ICD-related immunity was assessed <i>in vivo<\/i> using advanced severe immunodeficient mice that were engrafted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Anti-tumor effect of OBI-3424 in combination with pembrolizumab was evaluated in a xenograft model using PBMC-humanized mice. Incubation of OBI-3424 with AKR1C3 positive cells H460 and HepG2 induced the release of DAMPs including calreticulin, HMGB1, and ATP, in dose- and time-dependent manners. The detection of the DAMPs indicated that OBI-3424 induced ICD <i>in vitro<\/i>. The OBI-3424-induced ICD and its related immunity were also assessed <i>in vivo<\/i>. PBMC-humanized mice were immunized with OBI-3424- or PBS-treated HepG2 cells and then challenged with live HepG2 cells. No tumor growth was noted in mice that were immunized with OBI-3424-treated cells, indicating that the dying HepG2 cells induced by OBI-3424 elicited an adaptive, tumor-specific immune response. Furthermore, OBI-3424 showed a synergistic anti-tumor effect in combination with pembrolizumab in HepG2 xenograft model using PBMC-humanized mice. OBI-3424 plus pembrolizumab exhibited significantly stronger inhibition on tumor growth (TGI 77.2%) when compared with the treatment of OBI-3424 (TGI 27.8%) or pembrolizumab (TGI -15.3%) alone. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) showed that OBI-3424 treatment induced the populations of activated cytotoxic CD8 T-cells (CD45+\/CD8+\/CD69+ and CD45+\/CD8+\/Granzyme), activated helper CD4 T-cells (CD45+\/CD4+\/CD69+), and mature dendritic cells (CD11b+\/CD86+). In addition, OBI-3424 treatment also increased PD-1 expression on CD8 and CD4 cells, which in turn potentiated the anti-tumor effect of pembrolizumab. We demonstrated that OBI-3424 was able to induce ICD as shown by the release of DAMPs <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor-specific immunity <i>in vivo<\/i>. OBI-3424 also created a tumor microenvironment that enhances the function of pembrolizumab, supported by the synergistic effect in animals with the cotreatment of the two drugs. The results suggest that a combination therapy of OBI-3424 and anti-PD-1 in human clinical study is warranted. OBI-3424 is currently in Phase 1\/2 clinical trials for solid tumor and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NCT03592264 and NCT04315324).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ed4ebbe1-95a8-4125-b259-84a6b0c5bf13\/@r03B8ZTL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Pembrolizumab,Aldo-keto reductase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18030"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chun-Chung Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wan-Fen Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Chan Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu-Tzu Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jhih-Jie Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiann-Shiun Lai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ming-Tain Lai<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the role of Tregs in colorectal cancer (CRC) is more controversial, possibly due in part to the effect of the gut microbiome on colorectal tumors. We explore the association between colorectal cancer (CRC) Treg density, cancer biology, and clinical outcome. The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical relevance of the fraction of Tregs within the colorectal cancer TME using xCell score with mRNA expression data across several CRC cohorts.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We used xCell to estimate intra-tumoral Tregs in 898 CRC patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GCE39582 cohorts. into two groups based on high versus low proportions of Tregs. We studied the correlation between intra-tumoral Treg density and cancer biology including host immune response, ICM expression, and the tumor microbiome by comparing gene ex-pression between the two groups. We further examined two CRC cohorts which contained data on response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab, in order to explore the association between Treg infiltration and response to treatment.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>High-Treg CRCs enriched immune response-related gene sets; inflammatory response, IFN-&#947; and IFN-&#945; response, IL2\/IL6 signaling, and allograft rejection, and had significantly high infiltration of CD8, CD4, M1\/M2 macrophage, and dendritic cells in both cohorts. While high-Treg CRCs enriched multiple pro-cancer signaling pathways compared to low-Treg CRCs, such as Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition, K-ras, Hypoxia, TGF-&#946;, TNF-&#945;, and angiogenesis, Treg infiltration was surprisingly associated with earlier CRC stage in TCGA. Metastatic CRCs with more Tregs showed a significantly better response to mFOLFOX6 versus low-Treg CRC metastases (88.9% response vs. 16.7%, p &#60; 0.001). Finally, high-Treg CRCs were associated with increased expression of immune check-point molecules PD-L1\/PD-L2, CTLA4, TIGIT and BTLA, implying susceptibility to immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We show that unlike in other cancers, Tregs in CRC are not necessarily a marker of poor prognosis. High-Treg CRC enriched not only cancer aggravating gene sets, such as EMT, KRAS, TGF-&#946; and angiogenesis, but also immune response-related gene sets, which is consistent with high infiltration of anti-cancerous immune cells. High Treg density was a predictor of response to chemotherapy in metastatic CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2695ed8f-c537-4805-980f-eb2faeb90f76\/@r03B8ZTL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Drug resistance,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18031"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Masanori Oshi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joy Sarkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rongrong Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoshihisa Tokumaru<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryusei Matsuyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Itaru Endo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuaki Takabe<\/i><\/presenter>.

Studying cell-to-cell variation within the tumour&#8217;s native context is crucial for fully understanding tumour heterogeneity and its impact on disease progression and therapy response. Tumour cells and their surrounding stromal cells can be spatially profiled using multiplex imaging with a growing number of detectable proteins. The methods currently used for identification of cell phenotypes from multiplex imaging data have been initially developed for cells in suspension. Therefore, more accurate and robust approaches are required to account for spatial signal overlap and to automatically detect the presence of biomarkers in spatial proteomics.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. We performed imaging mass cytometry on 221 tumour and adjacent normal regions from 81 untreated, non-small cell lung cancer patients in the TRACERx study. Two antibody panels with 35 markers were applied to include a range of phenotypic, functional, and structural biomarkers. Single cells were segmented using deep learning-based approaches, and the measured biomarker intensities per cell were further used to identify cell types and functional states.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. We developed a computational approach optimised for spatial proteomics for identification of cell types and functional states and automated detection of the presence of biomarkers on single cells. First, we demonstrated that current approaches for cell phenotyping lack reproducibility with subsampling and can produce ambiguous clusters of cells from different cell types. Using a multi-tiered analytical approach in combination with statistical tools, we showed reproducibility between technical and biological replicates. We estimated the performance using orthogonal measurements from flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry from matched tumour samples. This approach has been automated with a scalable and portable Nextflow-based implementation.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. We developed a streamlined approach that overcame limitations of current methods and quantified single-cell biomarker presence using multiplex imaging with TRACERx. Implemented as open-source, portable and customisable, this pipeline for spatially resolved TME characterisation will allow the study of drug targets expression within their spatial context for a better understanding of therapy efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/496604d8-9d0b-476b-89d5-4400ed288855\/@r03B8ZTL\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immune checkpoint,Imaging,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18032"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mihaela Angelova<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katey Enfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alastair Magness<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Colliver<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masako Shimato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David A.

Combination treatments are predicted to improve on these current immunotherapies including the targeting of the adenosine pathway (CD39, CD73 or A2AR), which has shown a lot of promise in preclinical and early clinical studies. CD73 is an ecto-5&#8242;-nucleotidase which transforms adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine. Adenosine is a soluble immunosuppressive metabolite that can suppress natural killer cells and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Blockade of CD73-mediated conversion of AMP to adenosine may therefore recover anti-tumor immunity through preventing the enrichment of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> In this campaign, two humanized and Fc-silenced IgG antibodies were generated named 7002-01 and 7002-04. The target binding epitopes of these candidates were revealed by binning experiments through bio-layer interferometry. Cell binding experiments were tested on human and cynomolgus CD73 overexpression CHO cell lines by flow cytometry. Cellular CD73 enzyme inhibition experiments were tested using A375, MDA-MB-231, H2030 and BT549 tumor cell lines via the CellTiter-Glo method. Soluble CD73 enzymatic tests were carried out on patient sera or recombinant CD73 protein using a similar method. T cell proliferation assays were performed using PBMC. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies were tested in B-NDG B2M-KO mice that were injected subcutaneously with A375 tumor cells and human PBMC.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Two candidates, 7002-01 and 7002-04, were selected based on their functional activity, that recognize different non-overlapping binding epitopes on CD73. Both candidates selectively bind to and can inhibit the activities of both membrane-bound and soluble human CD73 to high levels and seem to maintain inhibition at high dose-ranges without a hook effect. Both candidates can potently rescue adenosine-mediated T cell regulation. Additionally, 7002-01 and 7002-04 have combination synergy or additive effects for CD73 inhibition on soluble CD73, tumor cell lines that express CD73, and PBMC. 7002-01 and 7002-04 have single-agent anti-tumor efficacy and combination synergy with anti-PD1 antibodies in mice. 7002-01 has a typical antibody-like PK profile when rhesus monkeys were administered with a single intravenous dose at 25 or 50 mg\/kg. No drug-related toxicities have been observed in GLP toxicity studies with dosages at 50, 250, and 500 mg\/kg (QW, 4 weeks).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Highly differentiating anti-CD73 antibodies were discovered that show maximal inhibition of both membranous and soluble CD73 without hook effects at high concentrations. 7002-01 was chosen as the lead molecule for its better overall activity profile and should be entering clinical trials by early 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4d380cb3-c22b-4cb2-99ac-3c7340581f8d\/@r03B8ZTL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,CD73,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18034"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zhenqing Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunli Jia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoniu Miao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weifeng Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhijun Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenchao Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiyuan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liandi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Andy Tsun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) play an important role in the process of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM). A comprehensive investigation into TILs will provide more prognostic information for patients with colorectal liver metastases after liver resection.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: 15 CRC patients with liver metastases from our hospital were enrolled in the study. The density and percentage of the TILs [CD8+, CD3+, CD4+, CD20+, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), dim CD56+NK, bright CD56+NK, PD-1+etc.] in the liver metastasis samples from operation were analyzed by multiplex immunofluorescence technique (3DMedcines Inc.). The level of the density and percentage of immune cells were determined by dichotomy method. The correlation between recurrence free survival (RFS) and immune cells were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Log-rank test.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The existence of dim CD56+ NK cells in the stroma was associated with significant improvement in RFS (p=0.0461). The median RFS was 26.1 months (95% CI, 14.9 to 33.5) with the existence of dim CD56+ NK cells in the stroma versus 1.7 months (95% CI, -18.0 to 32.4) without dim CD56+ NK cells in the stroma. Nevertheless, dim CD56+ NK cells in the tumor-enriched segments was not significantly associated with improved outcome. The existence of bright CD56+ NK cells in the stroma was associated with significant improvement in RFS (p=0.0307) but not in the tumor-enriched segments. The median RFS was 34.6 months (95% CI, 15.0 to 35.2) with the existence of bright CD56+ NK cells in the stroma versus 7.9 months (95% CI, -5.3 to 23.1) without bright CD56+ NK cells in the stroma. However, low FoxP3+ cells in the tumor-enriched segments (p=0.0037) was significantly associated with improved outcome but not in the stroma.

The association of clinical and genomic features with tumor immune microenvironment in NSCLC patients remains unclear.<br \/>Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we profiled PD-L1 and immune cell marker expressions and performed targeted next-generation sequencing (Geneseeq Technology Inc., Nanjing) of baseline tissue samples from 100 NSCLC patients. The levels of CD8+, CD68+ and HLA-DR+ immune cells were assessed by multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) assay.

Patients with high PD-L1 expression showed a trend towards higher stromal CD8+ lymphocytes (P=0.1), Alterations in T cell and B cell pathways were also associated with increased stromal CD8+ T cells (P=0.03 and P=0.08, respectively). The infiltration of intratumoral CD68(+)HLA-DR(+) M1-like macrophages positively correlated with high PD-L1 high expression (P=0.07), Hippo pathway alterations (P=0.06). By contrast, the levels of intratumoral M1-like macrophages negatively correlated with alterations in the NRF2\/<i>KEAP1<\/i> pathway (P=0.005), which might account for the poor immunotherapy outcome in this subset of patients.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the complex relationship between gene mutations and aberrations in signaling pathways with the immune microenvironment in NSCLC.

GDF-15 is, however, strongly upregulated during pregnancy. It is further induced in stressed and damaged tissues, where it limits immune infiltration and inflammation. In solid tumors, GDF-15 was shown to be a key inhibitor of T-cell infiltration. While this might already explain the strong correlation between GDF-15 overexpression and poor survival with or without checkpoint-based immunotherapy, effects of GDF-15 on dendritic cells and monocytes may further shape the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Methods: To analyze the impact of GDF-15 in murine tumor models, GDF-15 was either deleted by CRISPR\/CAS9 gene editing or neutralized by administration of a blocking antibody. Effects on tumor growth were recorded and the composition of the tumor microenvironment was characterized by flow cytometry. More detailed insight into tumor-immune interactions was obtained via the CrownBio Mouse I\/O RNA-Seq Panel. Specific effects on polarization of innate and on antigen-specific priming of adaptive immune cells were confirmed in cellular assays <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>Results: Tumor-derived GDF-15 modulates the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting infiltration and activation of myeloid cells. GDF-15 thereby impairs the induction of antitumoral immune responses. Deletion of GDF-15 enhances infiltration of innate cells into immune-excluded tumors, supports the priming of na&#239;ve T cells by dendritic cells and generates a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. <i>In vitro<\/i>, GDF-15 inhibits DC maturation and synapse formation, thus preventing successful T-cell activation. Moreover, GDF-15 interferes with M1 polarization of macrophages.<br \/>Conclusion: GDF-15 secretion helps tumors to generate a microenvironment that is poorly infiltrated by immune cells. GDF-15 further polarizes myeloid cells towards a tumor-promoting, anti-inflammatory phenotype.<b> <\/b>By<b> <\/b>inducing a more pro-inflammatory tumor phenotype, anti-GDF-15 antibodies may synergize with other immunotherapeutic agents.

The JAK-STAT pathway mutant tumors with significantly higher inferred M2 macrophages than wild-type (mean density, mutation vs. wild-type = 2.755 vs. 1.407 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p= 0.036). The level of infiltration of PD-L1 expression macrophages was significantly increased in the JAK - STAT pathway mutated tumors compared with wild-type tumors (p =0.048). After median follow-up time was 5.4 months, 3 short-term recurrence events were recorded. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) of EP300 and\/or STAT3 mutation group (n=5) were longer than wild-type group (n=29) (median RFS, mutation vs. wild-type = 5.6 vs. NE months; HR 7.267[95% CI 0.46-113.8]; P = 0.057). While in TCGA cohort, the level of infiltration of M2 macrophages was increased in both STAT3 and EP300 mutant tumors compared with wild-type tumors (Wilcoxon test, p &#60; 0.05). The significance of STAT3 and EP300 expression in cancer cells were evaluated on samples stratified by tumor-infiltrating macrophages M2 cells, which were divided into 4 groups respectively. Both RFS of high gene expression and high macrophages M2 groups were significantly different among the four groups (log-rank P&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: STAT3 and EP300 are driver genes of JAK-STAT signaling pathway in HCC. The JAK-STAT pathway mutation was associated with M2 macrophage infiltration and increased PD-L1 expression of macrophages, suggesting a poor prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/176fc553-4078-423b-baed-523cb2932df9\/@r03B8ZTL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Tumor microenvironment,JAK\/STAT pathway,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18038"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dinghua Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheng Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baitang Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tingting Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Late diagnosis and chemoresistance represent the main hurdle in the effort to improve OC patient outcomes. Currently, immunotherapy is studied as an alternative to front-line therapy, but its use in the clinic remains limited due to its modest impact on patient outcomes. It is well known that the neuroendocrine system can modulate immune cell behavior. This study aims to determine how behavioral factors, such as chronic stress and an associated increase in stress hormone levels, impact T-cell infiltration and function in ovarian cancer. As T-cells play a central role in cancer recognition and killing, we hypothesize that stress hormones could decrease the efficacy of checkpoint blockade by inducing changes in T-cell populations and contribute to T-cell exhaustion (determined by the expression of PD-1, TIM-3, FOXP3, and CTLA-4). We obtained tumor samples from C57\/BL6 ID8 tumor-bearing mice subjected to daily restraint stress to dissect the interaction between the neuroendocrine system and tumor-associated T-cells. Unstressed mice were used as controls. Tumors from both groups were collected and preserved with paraffin for histological assessments. Immunohistochemistry analyses were used to evaluate the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. To measure specific CD4+ T-cell subtype, regulatory T-cells (T-reg), FOXP3 was used as a marker. In addition, we assessed for T-cell surface markers PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3. Results show a significant increase in PD1+ expressing cells (2.35x-fold; p= 0.0173) in tumors from the stress group. On the other hand, there was a non-significant decrease in CD4+ T-cells (0.78x-fold; p=0.4286) and non-significant increase in CD8+ T-cells (1.75x-fold; p= 0.1833) between groups. Although we did not observe significant differences in FOX-P3 (1.4x-fold; p=0.3152), we did observe a trend towards increased expression of this transcription factor, suggesting a predominance of T-regs in the tumor microenvironment. When comparing the presence of surface markers, there was a non-significant increase in TIM-3 (1.56x-fold; p=0.5273) and CTLA-4 (1.32x-fold; p=0.5303) positive cells in the tumor microenvironment of samples from the stress group. These data suggest that the neuroendocrine system may modulate T-cell activity, specifically the expression of PD-1 ligand. Furthermore, sustained release of stress hormones may promote an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, leading to T-cell exhaustion, immune evasion, and tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8811bc74-2061-400a-a33f-63aa7d87a738\/@s03B8ZTM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Ovarian cancer,Immune cells,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18039"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Camily Morales-López<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Aquino-Acevedo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie E.

Several studies showed that tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), mainly the tumor-infiltrating immune cells, may affect the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the comparison of tumor immune microenvironment between LUAD and LUSC is little known.<br \/>Methods: 14 patients with LUSC and 21 patients with LUAD were enrolled in the retrospective analysis of multiple immunofluorescence staining to assess the number of immune cells. Genomic profiling of DNA was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 3752 LUAD and 459 LUSC patients by NGS with 733 cancer-related genes panel. TMB is defined as the total counts of single nucleotide variants and indels in the exon region.<br \/>Results: Overall, as the most abundant tumor-infiltrating immune cells in both groups, CD3+ cells are more in LUAD [median (number\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> in LUSC vs in LUAD): 312 vs 918, <i>p = 0.02<\/i>]. However, there were no significant differences in CD8+ T cells (median: 48 vs 36, <i>p = 0.74<\/i>), indicating higher infiltration of T lymphocytes rather than cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in LUAD than that in LUSC. Unlike in tumor, LUAD patients had both more T lymphocytes (<i>p &#60; 0.001<\/i>) and CTLs (<i>p &#60; 0.01<\/i>) in stroma. Besides, LUSC was correlated with fewer M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and PD-1+ immune cells (<i>p &#60; 0.001; p = 0.02<\/i>), while no significant differences were found in tumor-infiltrating FOXP3+ cells (<i>p = 0.41<\/i>) and B lymphocytes (<i>p = 0.61<\/i>). In addition, natural killer cells were the fewest among the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes detected in both groups (median: 2 vs 13). Similar to the previous studies, TMB level was higher in LUSC (median: 8.94 vs 3.36, <i>p &#60; 0.0001<\/i>). Although LUSC patients had a larger proportion of positive PD-L1 expression (45% vs 30.5%, <i>p &#60; 0.0001<\/i>) and strong PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (20.9% vs 10.7%, <i>p &#60; 0.0001<\/i>), the number of CTLs and TAMs expressing PD-L1 is significantly lower than that in LUAD ( <i>p = 0.04<\/i>; <i>p = 0.0001<\/i>).<br \/>Conclusion: LUAD had more immune invasion, while LUSC was related to higher TMB and PD-L1 expression. It suggested that the mechanisms affecting the benefits of immunotherapy may be different. The immune microenvironment of tumor and stroma should be considered simultaneously to explore the mechanism of immunotherapy and the respective thresholds should be selected according to the types of immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ddd36ca-74d5-4aa8-911c-93daa236dc65\/@s03B8ZTM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Adenocarcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18042"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Na Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengna Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ding Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyu Ji<\/i><\/presenter>.

Diet is one of the main and manageable factors that cause obesity and regular intake of high-fat diets can induce obesity. In addition, fibroblasts, as the most abundant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment, are involved in cancer metastasis. However, the role of fibroblasts and the downstream mechanism in metastasis of patients with high-fat diet remains unclear. In this study, we fed MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice with high-fat diet to obtain a high-fat tumorigenesis model, and isolate primary lung fibroblasts and then coculture them with breast cancer cells to explore the interaction. We found that a high-fat diet can significantly promote progression of primary breast cancer and lung metastasis, and that before weight difference shows, there is a different chemotactic influence of lung fibroblasts on breast cancer cell between high-fat diet and normal diet group. And we observed increased chemotactic function of primary lung fibroblasts in high-fat diet group. Moreover, tumor cells treated with primary lung fibroblasts in high-fat diet group show increased ability of adhesion, suggesting that high-fat diet chemoattracts breast cancer cell colonization by activating lung fibroblasts. Collectively, we explored the functional differences of lung fibroblast and the key factors for the lung colonization of recruited breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that dietary patterns are associated with the risk of breast cancer metastasis and targeting activated fibroblasts in pre-metastatic microenvironment may serve as potential early therapeutic strategy to reduce breast cancer lung metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0790bfd-dc03-4282-943c-8ddc88239e6c\/@s03B8ZTM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,Diet,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18043"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Huiping Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Penghan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianing Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Erwei Song<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Previously, we found that serum serglycin (SRGN), a secretory proteoglycan, was an independent prognostic marker for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and that the autocrine pro-invasive effect of SRGN on ESCC cells was mediated by midkine (MDK). Here, we investigated the effects of cancer cell-derived SRGN on human esophageal fibroblasts (HEF) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that conditioned medium from SRGN-overexpressing ESCC cells (SRGN-CM) promoted the migration and proliferation of HEF. After SRGN-CM treatment, HEF showed increased expression of fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and amphiregulin, and could enhance tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. In addition, exosomes derived from SRGN-overexpressing ESCC cells (SRGN-Exo) enhanced the tube formation ability of HUVECs. We found that the effects of SRGN-CM on activation, migration and proliferation of HEF were mediated by MDK. To elucidate the mechanisms by which SRGN upregulates HGF and amphiregulin, and promotes endothelial tube formation, cytokine array and mass spectrometry were performed to analyze differentially expressed proteins in SRGN-CM and SRGN-Exo respectively. The results showed upregulated secretion of interleukin (IL)-1&#946;, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; in SRGN-CM, as well as enriched cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR), integrin alpha-5, teneurin-2 and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2 in SRGN-Exo, which were validated by Western blot. These effects were dependent on the glycosaminoglycan chains on SRGN. Our data also showed that the enhanced secretion of IL-1&#946; promoted the expression of HGF in HEF by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase\/activating protein-1. Treatment with SU11274, a c-Met (the receptor of HGF) inhibitor, attenuated the proliferation of ESCC cells co-cultured with HEF, which further indicates that IL-1&#946;-induced HGF from HEF plays a significant role in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the upregulated exosomal M6PR was found to mediate the enhancing effect of SRGN-Exo on endothelial tube formation ability. Notably, the expression level of M6PR in serum samples of patients with ESCC was positively correlated with that of SRGN and with poor survival. Taken together, SRGN overexpression in ESCC cells created a tumor-promoting microenvironment by altering the ESCC cell secretome including exosomes to exert influence on HEF and HUVECs.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy among the elderly male population, and it is typically fatal when the disease progresses to metastasis and castration-resistant stage (CRPC). We have previously demonstrated that ADAM9 increased during PCa progression, and ROS is the critical mediator regulating ADAM9 expression in CRPC cells to promote tumor growth. In addition to membrane-anchored ADAM9, a secreted variant of ADAM9 (sADAM9) was recently identified in activated liver stromal cells that facilitated colon cancer liver metastasis. However, it is not clear whether sADAM9 is expressed by prostatic CAFs and, if so, whether it contributes to aggressive tumor phenotypes through tumor-stromal interactions.<br \/><b>Objective: <\/b>To investigate the sADAM9 variants in CAFs and to elucidate the effects of CAF-derived sADAM9 on the aggressiveness of PCa cells.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Immunohistochemistry staining and ELISA of clinical samples were used to assess the expression of ADAM9 during PCa tumor progression. Laser microdissected tissues, primary cell lines, and experimental cell model of paired normal fibroblasts and CAF cells were analyzed. The effects of sADAM9 on CRPC progression were conducted in PC3 cells by WST-1 cell proliferation assay, transwell migration assay, and &#956;&#8208;slide chemotaxis assay. Immunoblot analyses of integrin &#946;1 and migration-related kinases were used to verify the possible downstream signaling pathway of sADAM9.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Increased overall intensity of ADAM9 protein expression in PCa patients with metastasis compared. Elevated ADAM9 expression was observed in both cancerous epithelial cells and the tumor stroma. The average serum ADAM9 concentration measured by ELISA was 6.253 &#177; 0.448 ng\/mL in BPH patient samples <i>versus<\/i> 10.89 &#177; 0.953 ng\/mL in PCa patient samples. A smaller molecular weight (~50-kDa) of ADAM9 was detected in CM from cultured CAFs but not normal fibroblasts or PCa cell lines except for DU145 cells. Treatment of PC3 cells with sADAM9 induced a significant chemotactic migration while did not affect cell proliferation. Furthermore, a stark increase in activated integrin &#946;1, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), and p-AKT, but not p-mTOR in PCa cells by sADAM9 suggested the induction of cell migration occurs through activation of the integrin &#946;1\/FAK signaling pathways.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Herein, we have provided <i>in vitro<\/i> evidence to demonstrate the pro-metastatic function of sADAM9 from CAFs that facilitate the migration of CRPC cells through integrin receptor signaling, which could be partly responsible for the promotion of CRPC metastasis. Further molecular identification of controlling spliced ADAM9 expression in CAFs remains to investigate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Malignant progression,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18046"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Weichieh Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Le Thi Huynh Trang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Ling Hsieh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katsumi Shigemura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masato Fujisawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leland W.K.

Phase II clinical trials have shown that the response rate of NPC patients to PD-1 inhibitors is only 20%, indicating the current immunotherapies are not optimal due to insufficient understanding of the tumor-immune interaction. In this study, we have applied an integrated transcriptome sequencing analysis to decipher immune dynamics, and have characterized a new target that can inhibit Treg-mediated suppression in NPC, and provided critical translational evidence to the precision immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We established an integrated NPC single-cell sequencing cohort containing 189,750 T cells from 50 patient samples. Spatial transcriptome sequencing was performed on frozen samples from eight NPC patients. The whole blood was collected from healthy donors and PBMCs were isolated using density gradient centrifugation. T cells were magnetically isolated from PBMCs. The humanized mouse model was established by tail-vein injection of CD3\/CD28 activated PBMCs.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Single-cell sequencing revealed the enrichment of suppressive Tregs in the NPC microenvironment. We found that the C666-1 cell line facilitated Treg differentiation and activation. Spatial sequencing identified CD70-CD27 interaction was upregulated between NPC cells and suppressive Tregs, indicating its role in regulating Treg function. CD70 was predominantly expressed on NPC cells and correlated to worse prognosis. CD70-knockout (KO) in C666-1 inhibited Treg differentiation. Decreased Treg activities further enhanced the cytotoxicity in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> effector T cells, leading to higher tumor apoptosis. Cusatuzumab also generated a comparable inhibitory effect in Treg-mediated suppression. In the humanized mouse model, CD70-KO and inhibition shrank the size of subcutaneous tumors by enhancing T cell immunity.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The enrichment and activation Tregs makes the NPC microenvironment highly immunosuppressive, which might jeopardize the clinical efficacy of anti-PD1 therapies in NPC patients. In this study, we revealed that CD70<sup>+<\/sup> NPC cells were highly resilient to immune surveillance since they were capable of modulating Treg differentiation and activation via the CD70-CD27 interaction to counteract CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Blocking CD70 has been shown to effectively induce tumor apoptosis by alleviating Treg-mediated suppression. The therapeutic efficacy and safety of the anti-CD70 therapy were tested in the humanized mouse model. These findings suggested that the anti-CD70 therapy exhibited a promising efficacy to kill NPC cells by deteriorating the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and it might synergistically enhance the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4a4d8b6a-016c-4d3e-ac55-fb3b306381cd\/@s03B8ZTM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Single-cell spatial sequencing,Regulatory T cell (Treg),Tumor immune microenvironment ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18048"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lanqi Gong<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuma Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin-Yuan Guan<\/i><\/presenter>.

While most single-cell RNA sequencing technologies could enable the exploration of gene expression heterogeneity at the single-cell level, they cannot reveal spatial information within the tumor for us to map the whole transcriptome with morphological context. Spatial transcriptomics is an<i> in situ<\/i> capturing technique, which profiles gene expression at the RNA level, whilst preserving the spatial information of histological tissue sections. Thus we try to develop our spatial transcriptomics assay through a serial of validation experiments and to explore the mechanism of immune therapy against tumors.<br \/><b>Material and Method:<\/b> Firstly, the tumor was frozen and sections were cryosectioned at 10 &#956;m thickness. Sections processing including H&#38;E staining, tissue optimization, permeabilization, reverse transcription, and cDNA library preparation was carried out following the user guide of Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits (10X Genomics). And the final cDNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq instrument. Using gene expression matrix and aligned H&#38;E image processed by Cell Ranger and Loupe Browser with default parameters, we performed data QC, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering by Seurat and cell components identification in tumor microenvironment based on a multistep approach. Differential gene expression and spatial heterogeneity were analyzed in each cluster.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Here we established a reliable system for spatial transcriptomics assay to elucidate the mechanism of anti-PD1 treatment in MC38 syngeneic colorectal tumor. Using this system, we constructed the gene expression spatial patterns of tumor cells and immune cells, including periphery and center of tumor cell, immune-cell enrichment area, and tumor cell surrounding the immune cell. Furthermore, we explored the cell-cell interactions in which the tumor cells directly interact with adjacent non-tumor cells, for example, macrophages. Using this system, we tried to investigate the mechanism of anti-PD-1 therapy against the tumors by comparing the spatial transcriptome profiles after the treatment with anti-PD-1 or isotype control in colorectal cancer models. Interestingly, changes in both gene-level and spatial levels were observed, and it will help reveal how the immune therapy may shake up the complex ecosystem.<br \/><b>Summary:<\/b> We established a reliable system for spatial transcriptomics analysis and explored the mechanism of anti-PD-1 treatment against the colorectal cancer by using this system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95f11878-ecc1-4be6-a282-a7d440c64226\/@s03B8ZTM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18049"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Panpan Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huacheng He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiyao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jingjing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Duan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiangqiang Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingyang Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qunsheng Ji<\/i><\/presenter>.

According to Ministry of Health and Welfare&#8217;s research, bladder cancer plays 15th leading causes of death in Taiwan in 2020. The patients who suffer from bladder cancer after undergoing resection surgery about 60% will relapse, and 80% of them will relapse in less than a year, 15% of the relapsing patients will aggravate and become invasive carcinoma spread all over the body. PD-L1 (Programmed death-ligand 1), also known as B7-H1 and CD274 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which interacts with PD-1 (Programmed death-1) receptor on T cells to elicit the immune checkpoint response. Overexpression of PD-L1 suppresses the function of CD8+ T cells and facilitate tumor progression. Targeting tumor PD-L1 may be a possible treatment option; however, PD-L1 expression was only detected in small amount of population. Regorafenib is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced HCC. In our research, we found that regorafenib may upregulation the surface PD-L1 expression in both mice and human cell line. Based on this finding, we suggested that regorafenib may show potential to enhance treatment efficacy anti-PD-L1. Therefore, we established MB-49 bearing animal model to identify the immune regulation and treatment efficacy of regorafenib combined with anti-PD-L1. In ours animal data we found that combination therapy effectively increased the tumor infiltrating population of NK cells and CD8+ lymphocytes which were determined by flow cytometry assay. Not only anti-tumoral leukocytes, we also detected the population of immune suppressor cells including regulatory T cells, MDSCs and M2 macrophage was suppressed by combination therapy. We also detected the tumor microenvironment related markers (VEGF, IDO-1, PD-L1, CD8, CD31, CD49b, FOXP3, granzyme B) to evaluate combination therapy effect by using immunohistochemistry staining.

Outcomes are poor for patients with advanced ALM, and novel treatment approaches are needed. Here, we seek to explore the global genomic and transcriptomic landscape of ALM.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A total of 699 primary CM (non-ALM cutaneous melanoma) and 18 primary ALM samples underwent next generation sequencing of DNA (592 Gene Panel, NextSeq, or WES, NovaSeq), and whole transcriptome sequencing (NovaSeq, WTS). Wilcoxon, Fisher&#8217;s exact test were used to determine statistical significance (displayed as p value without and q value with multi comparison correction). xCell, HLA subtyping, neoantigen load (HBA: high binding affinity; IBA: intermediate binding affinity; LBA: low binding affinity), Interferon gamma score (IFN&#947;), MAPK pathway activity score (MPAS), and Innate anti-PD-1 Resistance score (IPRES) were calculated by mRNA expression. Global differentially regulated genes were assessed via limma R package (C: log fold change).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The most common alterations in ALM included NRAS (22.2%), NF1 (20.0%), BRAF (11.1%) and CDKN2A (11.1%) mutations, and EMSY (22.2%), ELL (11.1%), MAML2 (11.1%), MRE11(11.1%) and PIK3R2 (11.1%) amplifications. ALM had lower TMB (1.5 v 9 Mut\/Mb, q&#60;.0001), lower rates of TERT (0 v 66.7%, q&#60;.01) and a trend towards lower BRAF (11.1 v 39.8%, p&#60;.05) mutations, compared to CM. Neoantigen load was lower in ALM compared to CM, regardless of MHC binding affinity (HBA: 1 vs 4, q &#60;.01; IBA: 2 vs 7, q &#60;.001; LBA: 7 vs 18, q &#60;.001). HLA-G RNA expression was upregulated in ALM with respect to CM (C = 1.14, q &#60;.001). ALM showed less CD4+ T cell Th1 (C = -0.8, p &#60;.05), B cell plasma (C = -1.8, p&#60;.05), and &#947;&#948; T cells (C = -5.9, p&#60;.05), but more CD4+ T cell central memory cell (C = 9.7, p&#60;.05), stroma score (C = 1.7, p&#60;.05), and endothelial cells (C = 1.7, p&#60;.05), versus CM. There was a trend towards lower IFN&#947; in ALM (-0.4 vs -0.3, p = .1), but no difference in IPRES, compared to CM (-0.09 vs 0.1, p=.9). MPAS scores were lower for ALM compared to CM (-1.6 vs -0.4, q&#60;.001), even when stratifying by BRAF (q&#60;.05) or NF1 (q&#60;.05) status, but not NRAS (p = .22). Pathways related to keratinization (p &#60;.0001) and amyloid fiber formation (p&#60;.0001) were enriched in ALM, due to overexpression of KRT16 (C = 3.5, q &#60;.01), KRT6B (C = 3.4, q &#60;.01), and KRT17 (C = 3.2, q &#60;.05), among others.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>ALM has distinct immunologic features, including upregulation of HLA-G, as well as lower MAPK activation in ALM, compared to CM, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of this rare subtype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6d599878-51d2-4f17-9f31-e491abf79b46\/@t03B8ZTN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,HLA class I,Immunomodulation,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18051"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gino K.

However, around half of melanoma tumors are initially resistant to treatment and a significant proportion of initial responders gain resistance later. This is in part because tumors are able to decrease their ability to be recognized by T-cells, an essential actor in immunotherapeutic action. There are two major types of T-cells: CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic. The most common method used by tumor cells to evade immune attack is to down-regulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which allow CD8+ T-cells to recognize cells to be eliminated. Thus, to increase immunotherapeutic efficacy, it is critical to identify how to safely restore MHC-I expression on cancer cells so that tumor antigens are presented to T-cells. I focused on finding potential adjuvants to immunotherapy for this purpose, and I found that resveratrol, a natural compound found in plants and associated with various medicinal properties, consistently elevated MHC-I expression in melanoma cells. Through a proteomics study, I identified that resveratrol also significantly affected pathways known to enhance MHC-I expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/76c997bc-3696-4c2b-ad45-90a82a1b0949\/@t03B8ZTN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18052"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lauren C.

IBC characterized by significantly higher infiltration of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs contribute to the metastatic process in IBC patients via secreting many cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 that enhance invasion and angiogenesis. To understand the role of TAMs in IBC, there is a need to firstly understand how IBC TME affect the polarization of tumor infiltrated monocytes via using sensitive and accurate analytical tool. Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy (SR-&#181;FTIR) is a highly advanced analytical approach has the ability to detect any biochemical changes even prior to any morphological changes. Herein we will use SR-&#181;FTIR to study the biochemical changes in tumor infiltrating monocytes after stimulation by the secretome of non-IBC and IBC breast cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: ten breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study (5 IBC and 5 non-IBC). tumor infiltrated monocytes were isolated from patient&#8217;s blood samples which collected during modified radical mastectomy surgery. The isolated monocytes were stimulated with the secretome of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cell line. Synchrotron FTIR Microspectroscopy (SR-FTIRM) single cell analysis was done at SESAME light source. The obtained raw spectral data were processed and analyzed using OMNIC&#169;, PeakFit&#169; V4.12, and Unscrambler&#169; X v.10.4 software.<br \/>Results: The obtained FTIR spectra showed very intense absorption bands in the region of 1700- 1500 cm<sup>-1<\/sup> attributed to the amide I (&#957;(C=O), &#38; &#957;<sub>AS<\/sub> (C-N), &#948; (N-H)<sub> <\/sub>and amide II &#957;(C-N), &#948; (N-H)<sub> <\/sub>proteins bands, with a strong broad signal in the 3600-3200 cm<sup>-1<\/sup> related to the &#957;N-H Amides A and B. In addition, three peaks of different intensity and area were detected in the lipids region of the vCH2 and vCH3 stretching modes positioned within the 3000 - 2800 cm<sup>-1 <\/sup>range. Curve fitting assignment clearly demonstrate some differences between the three stimulated monocytes in both amide I and II, and lipids regions. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scores plot of the second derivative spectra of the amide region explain 77% of the variance, with 63% explained by PC1 and 14% explained by PC2. On the other hand, the PCA scores plot of the lipid region explain a total of 92% of the variance with PC1 explaining 72% and PC2 explaining 20%.<br \/>Conclusion: The obtained results showed that there is different effect of non-IBC and IBC cells on the polarization of tumor infiltrating monocytes even with the cell surface markers look the same and from this, we may start to understand different roles of TAMs in IBC microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/36ab22fd-568c-40f1-85c5-779dd93fec36\/@t03B8ZTN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammatory breast cancer,tumor associated macrophages ,Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy ,tumor infiltrating monocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18053"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hossam T.

The field of cancer immunotherapy has rapidly evolved and made a significant impact on many tumor types, including gynecologic cancers. However, single agent immune therapies have not yet demonstrated significant clinical success in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We hypothesize that a combination of intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy (cisplatin) with dual agent immunotherapy using intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) and IP rintatolimod (TLR-3 agonist) will help overcome immune suppressive mechanisms for improved tumor response by promoting increased T cell chemotaxis and cytolytic function.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To test our hypothesis, we are running an investigator initiated, phase II, single arm, efficacy\/safety trial (NCT03734692). Peritoneal fluid aspiration (IP wash) was performed in 13 patients at multiple time points during each cycle of treatment. Washes were collected on Days 1-3 of each cycle, before and after each treatment. Washes from cycle 1, 4 and 6, were included in this analysis. The MesoScale Delivery (MSD) platform was used to profile different biomarkers in the peritoneal samples throughout treatment.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In this ongoing Phase II study, a total of 17 patients were enrolled and 13 were evaluable for response. The observed clinical responses were: 2 complete responses (15.4%), 3 partial responses (23.1%), 3 stable disease (23.1%), 5 progressions (38.4%) for an clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) of 61.6%. From 13 patients, 7 IP wash samples were collected at serial time points. MSD measurements in IP washes revealed an acute increase in granzyme B, perforin, TNF alpha, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 after treatment (p&#60;0.05). Longitudinal data revealed a progressive increase in some biomarkers in the locoregional environment; CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, perforin and TNF alpha were all increased from baseline levels at cycle 1 to baseline of cycle 6 (p&#60;0.05). CXCL12 was also increased acutely after treatment (p&#60;0.05).<br \/><b>Discussion: <\/b>This is a novel, triple drug combination for EOC that leads to a locoregional acute response with an increase in biomarkers associated with T cell chemotaxis and cytolytic function. Longitudinal comparison of these biomarkers showed a gradual, durable response over time in T lymphotactic CXCR3 ligands. While an acute response was also noted in CXCL12, a marker of secondary suppression, a progressive increase over time was not detected. While these are interim analyses and ongoing evaluation of additional samples from the trial are needed to confirm our findings, the preliminary results show promise for novel treatment regimen.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5b2c1244-550f-4e74-9bd9-a6ac05f019f4\/@t03B8ZTN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Tumor microenvironment,Ovarian cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18912"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mackenzy Radolec<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Orr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Strange<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lixin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haider Mahdi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Taylor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Willis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Edwards<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anda Vlad<\/i><\/presenter>.

The purpose of our study is to profile microbial diversity and composition through the various gastrointestinal environment of gastric cancer (GC). We performed V3-V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis for matched samples of gastric tumor, normal gastric mucosa, gastric juice and stool from 30 GC patients. Amplicon sequence variant (ASV) profile was compared among the four body sites at genus level. In this study, we found that mean alpha diversity was lowest in normal gastric mucosa and stool exhibited the largest amount of alpha diversity compared with others. Beta-diversity analysis showed significant differences in microbiota composition for each sample. The microbiome dysbiosis was significantly independent in gastrointestinal environment of gastric cancer. <i>Helicobacter<\/i> abundance in tumor tissue was significantly lower than in matched normal tissue and gastric juice while the trend was opposite for <i>Lactobacillus<\/i>. Additionally, the level of <i>Helicobacter<\/i> was considerably lower in patients with lymphatic invasion. The bacterial community that significantly correlated with tumor samples compared to normal mucosa, gastric juice, and stool were 49, 27, and 11 genus, respectively. <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> and <i>Delftia<\/i> had higher abundance and <i>Rothia<\/i> and <i>Collnsella<\/i> had lower abundance in tumor tissue compare with normal mucosa. Especially, <i>Delftia<\/i> was seen only in the tumor tissue not normal gastric mucosa, gastric juice and stool.

CAFs are the major effectors of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling through secretion of collagens, cross-linking enzymes and proteases, and in turn engagement of integrins. Although several tumor cell-secreted factors have been identified in generating tumor-promoting stroma, there has been a great interest to define factors and associated molecular mechanisms involved in promoting CAF premetastatic function. Tumor-related endothelin-1 (ET-1) has an important role in the crosstalk between cancer and stromal cells supporting serous ovarian cancer (SOC) progression. By binding its receptors (ETAR and ETBR), ET-1 favours the recruitment of the protein &#946;-arrestin-1 and the generation of signaling complexes regulating also cytoskeleton reorganization, thereby fine-tuning SOC cell invasion and metastasis. However, how the integration of ET-1 receptors might &#8220;educate&#8221; stroma to become permissive for invasion, supplying an altered ECM governing metastasis needs to be investigated. In this study, we identified endothelin-1 as a key factor in priming CAF conversion in SOC. We demonstrate that primary ovarian fibroblasts express ET<sub>A<\/sub> and ET<sub>B<\/sub>, along with &#946;-arrestin1, and secrete ET-1; b) the autocrine and cancer-secreted ET-1 promotes fibroblast proliferation, and an increase in the expression of CAF markers (&#945;SMA, vimentin and FAP), secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, collagen contraction ability and cell motility. Moreover, ET-1 induces activation of b1 integrin and downstream signaling. Mechanistically, ET1R\/intb1 signaling allows ECM remodeling, either by promoting and invasive protrusion formation, invadosome, and collagen secretion. Importantly, therapeutical inhibition of ET-1 receptors with Ambrisentan and int&#946;1 with ATN-116 markedly reduced the ability of SOC cells to adhere in the intraperitoneal organs and to metastasize. Our findings support a model in which ET-1 educates the stromal fibroblasts to become permissive for tumor invasion and demonstrate for the time the significance of an ET-1-dependent integrin signaling in this process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ce83095c-a44e-4ffb-8dbc-3ebad526a75c\/@t03B8ZTN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endothelin A receptor,Fibroblasts,Metastasis,Integrins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18914"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Danila Del Rio<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Caprara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilenia Masi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Spadaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Giannitelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Rainer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Bagnato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Rosanò<\/i><\/presenter>.

Globo-H (GH), a globo-series glycosphingolipid (GSL) antigen that is synthesized by key enzymes &#946;1,3-galactosyltransferase V (&#946;3GalT5), fucosyltransferase (FUT) 1 and 2, is highly expressed on a variety of epithelial cancers rendering it a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. GH is reported to associate the EGFR mutant and PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In addition, GH-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) OBI-999 has been demonstrated an excellent tumor growth inhibition potency in animal models across multiple cancer types including gastric cancer (GC). This study aims to further investigate the GH roles in GC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Prognostic roles of &#946;3GalT5, FUT1 and FUT2 in GC patients were accessed through the &#8220;Kaplan-Meier plotter&#8221; database. The level of GH expression was evaluated in clinical adenocarcinoma samples from 105 patients with GC by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using H-score. Microwestern protein array analysis was performed in sorted GC NCI-N87 cells. FACS methods were also employed to measure the levels of PD-L1 and phospho-EGFRs in multiple cancer cell lines.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Significant correlations were observed between high mRNA expression of synthesized key enzymes and worse overall survival (OS)\/post-progression survival for all 498 GC patients. Positive GH expression (H score&#8805;20; 33.3%) was significantly associated with a poor disease specific survival in all samples (at 15 years; <i>p=0.029<\/i>), a poor OS in poorly differentiated tumors (<i>p=0.033<\/i>), and invasiveness (<i>p=0.013<\/i>), indicating GH expression was a potential prognostic factor in GC. Sorted NCI-N87 cells with high level of endogenous GH expression showed a relatively greater proliferative activity compared with cells expressing low level of GH. Microwestern array analysis on sorted cells indicated upregulations of phospho-AKT\/P38\/JNK, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 protein in high GH expression NCI-N87 cells, which implicated a mechanistic link between high GH and tumor promoting signals in GC. In addition, GH level was shown to be correlated with cell surface expression level of PD-L1 in NCI-N87, SNU-16, HCC-1428, ACHN, and TKI-resistant H1975 NSCLC cancer cells. Higher phospho-EGFRs (Tyr1068 and Tyr1173) were detected in high GH level of H1975 cells, which is consistent with the results from previous studies showing association between GH level and EGFR mutant\/PD-L1 expression in NSCLC.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> GH level was associated with the survival of GC patients and positively correlated with cell surface PD-L1 expression <i>in vitro<\/i>.

Endothelial cell adhesion, blood vessel permeability, leukocyte infiltration, and angiogenesis are regulated by the proinflammatory functions of GPR4. Inhibition of GPR4 ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mouse models. GPR4 expression is upregulated in the intestinal tissues of IBD and colorectal cancer patients and is associated with a worse prognosis. Herein, we studied the role of GPR4 in colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) by inducing CAC in GPR4 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice using azoxymethane (AOM)\/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The severity of CAC development was higher in WT mice than GPR4 KO mice when treated with AOM\/DSS. Blood vessel density was significantly higher within the tumors of WT mouse colons compared to GPR4 KO mice. GPR4 KO tumors showed a significant increase in tumor necrosis in comparison to WT tumors. Fecal blood\/diarrhea score, colon shortening, and mesenteric lymph node size were aggravated in WT mice compared to GPR4 KO mice treated with AOM\/DSS. Our data demonstrate that GPR4 increases intestinal inflammation and angiogenesis, enhancing tumor development in the CAC mouse model, suggesting that GPR4 inhibition may reduce the risk of developing colitis-associated colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e144dd47-c598-4e26-9dc1-1b92fff76343\/@t03B8ZTN\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis inhibitor,Cancer prevention,Novel anticancer agents,GPCR-G-protein coupled receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18916"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mona A.

Although the genetic make-up initiating glioblastoma is increasingly better understood, a better understanding in the mechanisms that drive its evolution, heterogeneity and therapy resistance may reveal new directions for therapy development. To get better insights into glioblastoma evolution, we analyzed and de-convoluted transcriptomes of primary and recurrent glioblastoma resections.<br \/>Material and Methods: Matching primary and secondary resections from n=185 glioblastoma patients were collected as part of EORTC Study 1542. The study was extended with tumor pairs from n=51 patients from the international GLASS study. The datasets were subjected to differential and deconvolution analysis using in-house algorithms.<br \/>Results: When mapping the tumor samples into a reduced Glioblastoma Intrinsic Transcriptional Subtype space, we visualized subtype traversal, indicating that the CL subtype most often switches. As we found no more transitions from MES to other subtypes than to be expected by chance, we concluded that MES is an end-state. On average, tumor cell percentages decreased from ~67% to ~50% mostly due to an increase in TAM\/microglia. Differential expression analysis was performed with correction for tumor cell percentages. While expression of most known oncogenes did not change considerably over time, marker genes of TAM\/microglia, neurons and oligodendrocytes were up-regulated whereas endothelial cell markers were down-regulated over time. Furthermore, a cluster of ~30 extracellular matrix-associated genes increase significantly over time. A signature representing the gene-set was significantly associated with poor survival; high signatures were in particular associated to survival in secondary resections (P = 6.613e-06, Kaplan-Meier estimator). This suggests that the increase of extracellular matrix expression fulfils an important role in glioblastoma evolution.<br \/>Conclusion: Using a large cohort, we interrogated changes in the glioblastoma transcriptome over time and found that in particular the composition of the tumor and its environment changes. The tumor cell percentage drops, suggesting more invasion or recruitment of non-malignant cells or a combination of both. This change is independent of an increase in the prognostic increase in extracellular matrix expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Progression,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18917"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Youri Hoogstrate<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaspar Draaisma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santoesha A.

The purpose of this research was to understand how gp78 is associated with poor survival rates by studying tumor biology and gene expression. We hypothesize a positive correlation between the overexpression of gp78 protein in higher amounts for AA women than that of European ancestry women which may correlate with specific functional pathways.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Medical data was collected from a health disparities cohort in Eastern North Carolina. The patient&#8217;s race, ethnicity\/ancestry were self-reported at the initial visit; the study cohort was reported as 50% AA. Immunohistochemistry to measure protein expression, DNA mutation &#38; gene expression used with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(GSEA) of 147 patients to identify functional pathway differences in tumor biology between high versus low gp78 expression versus gp78 expression based on patient race. Hierarchical clustered heatmaps were used to compare overlapping genes that were differentially expressed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>49 common genes were identified as the overlap between the genes in the differential gene expression list for gp78 and the two different gene set enrichment analyses compared: GSEA based on patients expressing high versus low gp78 protein by IHC versus GSEA based on white vs black patients (race).

We will explore this gene signature\/biomarker that may predict survival based on race. This discovery provides new areas of research to explore the relationship of extracellular factors in the tumor microenvironment, mitochondria regulation, &#38; proliferation. Clinical &#38; nonclinical interventions addressing racial health disparity in mortality should target breast cancer-specific health determinants (both environmental and biological) among those of AA with efforts to decrease racial disparities in mortality rates. These new observations indicate gp78 may be a biomarker that can predict survival based on race using tumor biology, which can contribute to new strategies for reducing the rate at which women of AA disproportionately suffer from breast cancer mortality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/050665d8-8b2a-42ad-a13e-544396fd3535\/@t03B8ZTN\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18918"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sediqua Sherese Bufford<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We investigated the TIME as well as the tumor mutation burden (TMB) of each pathological type in surgical archival tissues obtained from 1999 to 2017 (7 patients in each type, stage III\/IVA\/IVB [UICC 8<sup>th<\/sup>]). TIME was evaluated by multiplexed immunofluorescent staining, including CD3, CD4, CD8, Foxp3, CD204, PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2. Tumors with &#62; 1% tumor cells expressing PD-L1 were considered positive for PD-L1. TMB was measured by the Oncomine Tumor Mutation Load Assay, and a high TMB was defined by 10 or more mutations\/Mb. Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson&#8217;s product moment correlation coefficient.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Multiplexed immunofluorescent staining was performed in all 35 archival tissues. ACC showed the lowest infiltration of immune effector cells (IC<sub>eff<\/sub>) and suppressor cells (IC<sub>sup<\/sub>) in both the tumor and stroma, and a low proportion of cases was positive for PD-L1 (14%). Compared with ACC, MEC high showed higher infiltration of IC<sub>eff<\/sub> and IC<sub>sup<\/sub> in both the tumor and stroma, and a higher proportion of cases was positive for PD-L1 (71%). Although ANOS, SDC, and MEC low showed modest infiltration of IC<sub>eff<\/sub> in the tumor, these subtypes showed higher infiltration of IC<sub>eff<\/sub> in the stroma than ACC.

Regarding multiplexed immunofluorescent staining, correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between TMB and CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the tumor (r=0.647, P&#60;0.0001). In addition, CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the tumor showed a positive correlation with PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (r=0.513, P=0.002) and with CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup>Foxp3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the tumor (r=0.399, P=0.018).

In primary GC, we used the UCSC Xena tool to analyze the TCGA Stomach Cancer cohort and compared transcriptional signature expression to histologic subtype and pathologic stage. We used log-rank test to compare Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival (OS) and disease-free interval (DFI) for high versus low signature expression. In our institutional cohort consisting of GC patients with a range of T and N stages as well as with and without metastatic disease (n=28), we evaluated peritoneal fluid samples using single cell RNA sequencing for high and low signature expression in CD68<sup>+<\/sup>CD163<sup>+<\/sup> monocytes and used log-rank test to compare OS.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 341 TCGA entries of primary GC were included. High expression of the M2 signature in GC was associated with diffuse- and mucinous-type adenocarcinoma, compared to tubular- and papillary-type adenocarcinoma (p&#60;0.001). High M2 signature expression was associated with later stage (Stage II or above) compared to early-stage GC (stage I) (p=0.02). Low M2 signature was associated with significantly improved 5-year OS (p=0.03) and DFI (p=0.04). M1 signature and T cell cytolytic signature were not associated with stage, OS, or DFI in primary GC. In GC peritoneal fluid samples, we identified patients with high (n=15) and low (n=13) signature expression in M2 cells. Independent of TNM-stage, high M2 signature expression in CD68<sup>+<\/sup>CD163<sup>+<\/sup> cells within the peritoneal fluid of GC patients was associated with worse OS (median OS not reached at 30 months for low signature expression and 5.5 months for high expression, hazard ratio 2.82, p=0.048).<b><\/b><br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our study validates a unique M2-associated transcriptomic gene signature as a biomarker of poor outcomes in both primary gastric tumors and peritoneal fluid of GC patients.

Curative treatments in early-stage HCC are hampered by high recurrence rates, and targeted therapies against HCC are rare. Little is known about the impact of tumor microenvironment (TME) in this tumor. Manipulation of the immune system by tumors leads to compromised antigen recognition and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. One immunomodulatory strategy employed by malignant tumors is the expression of the programmed cell death receptor 1 ligand (PD-L1), whose receptor is expressed on activated T cells (PD-1). The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has shown antitumor activity and unprecedented rates of durable clinical responses in various cancer types. In HCC, nivolumab and pembrolizumab are described as possible second line therapies. Expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in the TME has prognostic importance and can predict response to ICI. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on HCC recurrence and the relation to their cancer-immune phenotypes.<br \/><b>Materials and methods:<\/b> Immunohistochemical staining was performed on archival tissue from 91 HCC, primary and recurrence, using the following antibodies: NAT105 (PD-1) and Ventana SP263 (PD-L1). On the basis of protein expression, tumors were classified as immunologically active, excluded or deserted. PD-1 and PD-L1 immunoreactivity was evaluated as the proportion of positive staining of the total number of immune cells (0%, &#60;1% and &#62;1%).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Basic tumor characteristics were not related to recurrence of HCC. However, the immune-excluded subclass showed significant association with recurrence in HCC. The majority of non-recurrent HCC showed PD-1 expression &#62;1% (78%; 38\/49), also statistically significant. Conversely, recurrent HCC showed low PD-1 expression (0% or &#60;1%) in 42% (19\/45) of the cases. Of note, HCC classified as immune active were enriched for PD-1 positive (&#62;1%) (77%; 49\/64). An association between HCC recurrence and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was not found.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In concordance with previous reports, we found an association between low frequency of PD-1 expression and increased HCC recurrence, as well as the lack of impact of PD-L1 expression on HCC recurrence. Furthermore, our results suggest that HCC recurrence may be more frequent in immune-exclusive tumors. Pembrolizumab as adjuvant instead of 2nd line therapy should be further investigated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2551b44-92e6-423f-a091-3cfdc880bcff\/@u03B8ZTP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,PD-1 \/ PD-L1,Immune activation,Immune checkpoint inhibition,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18923"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gabriel Fridolin Hess<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mairene Coto-Llerena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jasmin Zeindler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silvio Däster<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Muenst<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jürg Vosbeck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caner Ercan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Otto Kollmar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Salavtore Piscuoglio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Savas Deniz Soysal<\/i><\/presenter>.

In addition to obesity&#8217;s role in TNBC pathogenesis, it is also recognized as a marker of poor prognosis for survival in pre- and post-menopausal women. However, the mechanism underlying how obesity leads to worsened TNBC progression remains unclear. In this study, we aim to characterize the immune population changes in mammary adipose during the development of obesity and their impact on TNBC progression. First, we utilized a diet-induced obesity mouse model to evaluate tumor growth under obese condition. Four weeks after E0771 (TNBC cell line) mammary fat pad injection, TNBC tumors volume were 1.6-fold larger in obese C57BL\/6 mice compared to their lean counterparts. To profile the transcriptome changes induced by obesity, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq on mammary adipose stromal vascular fraction and TNBC allograft from lean and obese C57BL\/6 female mice. In TNBC allografts, obesity upregulated genes enriched in the extracellular matrix and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways in cancer cells, creating a more aggressive phenotype. Consistent with the heavier TNBC tumor burden, lymphocyte infiltration decreased while myeloid population increased in TNBC allografts from obese mice, which indicated an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment. Macrophage was the dominant population among Cd45+ cells in tumors, constituting 41.2% in lean and 51.2% in obese mice. An increase of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) population (2.2-fold increase in obese vs lean adipose; 5.6-fold increase in tumor-bearing vs control adipose) was also observed in the obese or tumor-bearing mammary adipose stroma. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we found that ATM adapted to the obese condition by upregulating fatty acid metabolism and adipogenesis hallmarks while downregulating IFN&#947; response, allograft rejection, and TNF&#945; signal hallmarks. When encountering TNBC development, ATM downregulated similar proinflammatory pathways, while upregulated the hypoxia and glycolysis pathways. Through integrative analysis, we found that the complement pathway is the primary pathway upregulated in ATM under both obese and tumor growth conditions. Major components of the complement pathway, C1qa and C1qb, were significantly upregulated in ATM by TNBC and obesity. Interestingly, C1qa and C1qb were also upregulated in bone-marrow derived macrophage during M2 polarization and when co-culturing with E0771. Taken together, our data showed that the C1qa<sup>hi<\/sup>\/C1qb<sup>hi<\/sup> macrophage expanded in mammary adipose tissue during the development of obesity and TNBC, which created an immunosuppressed microenvironment to facilitate TNBC progression. This suggests that the complement pathway may serve as a potential immune therapy target for obese TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4671bb43-e617-4d6f-849a-542f00ad3728\/@u03B8ZTP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Macrophages,Triple negative breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18924"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shimeng Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myles Brown<\/i><\/presenter>.

Relative to recent advances in immunotherapy of advanced-stage LUAD, there are very limited strategies for early immune-based treatment or interception of the malignancy in its primitive stages. This is largely due to a poor understanding of the roles and functional phenotypes of distinct immune cell subsets and how they evolve early in LUAD pathogenesis. For instance, while T cells have been a central focus of cancer immunopathology and immunotherapy, the roles of tumor-infiltrating B and plasma cells (TIBs) in the activity of the adaptive immune response along the pathogenic course of solid tumors such as LUAD are extremely poorly understood. To fill these voids, we conducted pan-cancer single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of TIBs using public and in-house cohorts of &#62;15 cancers and matched normal samples. We found that fractions of TIBs, including plasma cells (PCs), were evidently high in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of LUADs, particularly in smokers. We then performed multi-region paired scRNA-seq and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) of tumors and three matched normal lung (NL) tissue samples with varying spatial proximity from each of the tumors of 16 early-stage LUAD patients. Fractions of TIBs including PCs and memory B cells were immensely increased in the TME of early-stage LUADs compared to uninvolved NL, and conversely, the abundance of na&#239;ve B cells was markedly decreased. TIB fractions were progressively increased along the pathologic continuum of NL, premalignant lesions (PMLs), up to invasive LUAD. Consistently, expression of the B cell chemotactic CXCL13 - CXCR5 axis in T cells and TIBs, respectively, was increased in both PMLs and LUADs relative to NL. Simultaneous scBCR-seq revealed markedly reduced clonality of BCR repertoires in LUAD compared to NL. Multi-region NL tissues showed progressively increasing BCR clonotype diversity and immunoglobin somatic hypermutation (SHM) with increasing proximity to tumors. BCR clonality was strikingly lower in smoker LUADs relative to non-smoker tumors as well as progressively attenuated with increasing pathologic stage. TIBs in the LUAD TME were mostly composed of terminally differentiated IgA+ or IgG+ PCs and memory B cells with an immunosuppressive phenotype. To understand how TIBs shape the LUAD TME, we also profiled interactions of TIBs with other TME cell components and identified TIB subsets showing strong co-occurrence patterns with immunosuppressive T cell subsets. By comprehensively defining transcriptional profiles, SHM and antibody repertories, as well as cellular interactions of TIBs at single-cell resolution, our results map out the geospatial landscape of TIBs in early-stage LUAD and provide a valuable resource to leverage targets for innovative immunomodulatory strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68598024-b114-4d44-b330-c6f9bed76172\/@u03B8ZTP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,plasma cells,immune microenvironment,B cell clonality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18925"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dapeng Hao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guangchun Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ansam Sinjab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorena Gomez Bolanos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rossana Lazcano Segura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enyu Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luisa Maren Solis Soto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edwin Parra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Wargo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Swisher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tina Cascone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Sepesi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junya Fujimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Dubinett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignacio Wistuba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Stevenson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avrum Spira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Humam Kadara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linghua Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Positive clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC further highlight the TME&#8217;s importance, but its single-cell composition and relationship to patient survival has not been well described. Therefore, we generated highly-multiplex cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) data from 59 TNBC in tissue microarrays. Our CyCIF dataset served as a discovery cohort; the data included 35 protein markers and clinical outcomes for 18 patients. For a validation cohort, we analyzed 32 markers imaged with multiplex ion beam imaging (MIBI) in 38 TNBC patients (Keren et. al., Cell 2018). In the CyCIF cohort, we used markers&#8217; single-cell mean intensity to generate a Umap manifold, which we clustered with the unsupervised Leiden algorithm. We annotated the resulting 28 cell types as epithelial, immune or stromal. In the MIBI cohort, we similarly clustered and annotated 21 cell types as epithelial, immune or stromal. Next, we clustered the patients based on the fraction of epithelial, immune or stromal cells in the tissue. In the CyCIF cohort, patients fell into three subtypes: epithelial-rich, stroma-rich and immune-rich. The patients in the epithelial-rich group had significantly shorter survival than the other two subtypes (log-rank p-value = 0.0008) and had shorter recurrence-free survival (log-rank p-value = 0.048). In the MIBI cohort, patients fell into the same three subtypes. As in the CyCIF cohort, the epithelial-rich patients had shorter survival than the other subtypes (log-rank p-value = 0.021), although there was no difference in recurrence-free survival (log-rank p-value = 0.47). Finally, we identified protein biomarkers with significantly different expression levels between the subtypes in one or both cohorts. The poor-prognosis, epithelial-rich subtype had higher CD31 expression in both cohorts, and in the CyCIF cohort, Glut1 was elevated, indicating a hypoxic, angiogenic TME. The immune infiltrate was primarily CD68+ macrophages and the stroma was activated, with higher levels of Ki67 in both cohorts. In contrast, the stroma-rich, good prognosis subtype had low immune infiltration, including fewer macrophages, low CD31 expression and a quiescent, non-proliferating stroma. Lastly, the good-prognosis, immune-rich subtype had high T and B cells levels, as well as markers of immune regulation, memory cells, and antigen presentation cells. In conclusion, we generated and analyzed a new multiplex CyCIF dataset with clinical annotation and confirmed our analytical findings in a second multiplex imaging dataset. We delineated three TME subtypes in TNBC with different outcomes, cell types and biomarker expression, potentially leading to better patient stratification and informing new drug targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/532e70ae-1015-44a6-96eb-9053a0f9132e\/@u03B8ZTP\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Prognostic factors,Image analysis,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18926"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer R.

These include engagement of inhibitory receptors expressed in tumor-associated, exhausted CD8 T cells, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), 2B4 (also known as CD244), and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT). While immune checkpoint blockade therapies aimed at reversing the dysfunctional state of tumor-associated T cells have demonstrated clinical effectiveness, not all cancer patients achieve long-term disease control. This is due, at least in part, to the refractory nature of what are categorized as terminally exhausted CD8 T cells to be reinvigorated by, for example, PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade. As CD8 T cell exhaustion (or dysfunction) is a major therapeutic challenge, gaps in our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the T cell exhaustion (or dysfunction) program in cancer warrant further study of pathways that program T cells toward exhaustion (or dysfunction). Through comprehensive immune profiling of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), we found that CD47 expression in CD8 TILs isolated from melanoma patients significantly correlates with expression of several checkpoint inhibitory molecules (e.g., TIM-3, PD-1 and LAG-3). Additionally, our re-analysis of single cell data from melanoma patients revealed that terminally exhausted T cells (Tex) and TCF7hi Tex precursor cells exhibit high levels of CD47 transcripts, suggesting phenotypic association of CD47 with T cell exhaustion. We confirmed our observations in murine B16-F10 melanoma where CD47 expression is significantly upregulated in exhausted CD8 TILs. We also show that CD47 functions as a negative regulator for T cell proliferation and function during T cell priming. To address the role of CD47 during the development of CD8 T cell exhaustion\/dysfunction in cancer, we performed adoptive T cell transfer of the na&#239;ve-sorted Cd47+\/+ (WT) and Cd47+\/- (Het) antigen specific Pmel-1 CD8 T cells (but not Cd47-deficient Pmel-1 CD8 T cells as they would be subject to innate immune clearance) into B16 tumor-bearing mice and found that Cd47-Het Pmel-1 CD8 TILs, as compared to the Cd47-WT Pmel-1 CD8 TILs, exhibit less expression of exhaustion-related genes (e.g. Pdcd1, Lag3 and Tox), and increased expression of genes associated with T cell activation and proliferation (e.g. Mki67, Lck, Cd69, Gzma, Gzmk). We further confirmed that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), as an extracellular matrix protein and a ligand of CD47, contributes to driving the differentiation of CD8 T cells toward exhaustion. Our data highlight for the first time the potential of extracellular matrix protein TSP-1 in programming CD8 T cell exhaustion in cancer through its interaction with CD47 expressed on CD8 T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/30f03672-66da-4b8e-980c-f3b5a7ac2271\/@v03B8ZTQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18927"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chien-Huan Weng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fadi Samaan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sadna Budhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Levi Mangarin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sébastien Monette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cailian Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephane Pourpe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda Hamadene<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xia Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Schroder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberta Zappasodi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pamela Holland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jedd D.

Here, we utilized multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and microarray gene expression to quantitatively assess, using the BostonGene automated pipeline, the immune microenvironment composition of clinical stage 2 or 3 primary estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) HER2-negative (HER-) breast tumors (n = 29) from patients treated with neoadjuvant palbociclib in combination with anastrozole. Microenvironment characteristics of pretreatment tumor biopsies were associated with molecular subtype, cytokine signatures, and Ki67 response. MxIF analysis (21 markers, 2-13 ROIs per slide) of the tumor immune composition revealed that while the cellular composition was similar for each tumor region of the same patient, significant cellular heterogeneity was observed in tumor biopsies from different patients. The spatial heterogeneity was found in the distribution of both immune infiltrate cells and stromal components. T cells, CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages, and B cells were the predominant cell populations in the stromal component. Further MxIF analysis showed an increase in Ki67+ tumor cells in nonresponders (NR) versus responders (R). The number of immune cells was similar between Luminal A and B breast cancer molecular subtypes. A lower number of Ki67+ tumor cells was found in Luminal A compared to Luminal B tumors, as expected. MxIF analysis of cell-to-cell interactions revealed that distinct groups of cellular neighborhoods were significantly increased in NR compared with R: the immune inflammation cluster with a high density of CD4 T cells, Tregs, and CD8 T cells in the stromal component (p = 0.03); CD163+ macrophage-enriched cluster (p &#60; 0.001); and tertiary lymphoid structures cluster (p &#60; 0.001). Transcriptomic analysis showed that while CXCL1, CCL17, CCL13, CXCL9, and CCL5 expression correlated with the high density of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the stromal component cluster, VEGFA, IL1B, CXCL16, CCL3, and CCL7 were increased in the CD163+ and CD68+ macrophage-enriched clusters, indicating that differential cytokine expression is associated with the tumor architecture.Comprehensively characterizing, via MxIF, the immune microenvironment of ER+ HER2- breast cancer provided resolution of cellular architecture and elucidated spatial relationships among the immune and stromal cells of the tumor. Quantitatively assessing breast tumor cell-to-cell interactions has the potential to identify imaging markers of response, ultimately leading to the development of effective therapy options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0450bf6e-9c3c-4739-a5de-115714533169\/@v03B8ZTQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Palbociclib,Breast cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Chemokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18928"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"940896d2-ef33-4ee3-b220-12704fc90451","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/940896d2-ef33-4ee3-b220-12704fc90451\/@v03B8ZTQ\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Bruttan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Souzan Sanati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Belozerova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilia Galkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akshaya Ramachandran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pavel Ovcharov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grigory Perelman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viktor Svekolkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ekaterina Postovalova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Bagaev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krystle Nomie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shana Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Hoog<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravshan Ataullakhanov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Hsieh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cynthia Ma<\/i><\/presenter>.

While neoadjuvant immunotherapeutic strategies have recently shown anti-tumor effects in resectable NSCLC, their mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Here, we explore immune programs that inform of tumor immunity and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in localized NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Targeted immune gene sequencing using the HTG Precision Immuno-Oncology panel was performed in localized NSCLCs from three cohorts based on treatment: na&#239;ve (n=190), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=38) and neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (n=21). Three tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) phenotypes (inflamed, cold, excluded) were derived based on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration. Signatures of immune cell abundance and immune genes were statistically compared based on tumoral PD-L1 expression, immune phenotypes, associated with pathological response, and were cross-compared across the three cohorts.<br \/>Results: PD-L1 positive tumors exhibited increased signature scores for various lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets (both, p&#60;0.05). TIME phenotypes exhibited disparate frequencies by stage, PD-L1 expression, and mutational burden. Inflamed NSCLCs displayed overall significantly heightened levels of immune signatures with the excluded group representing an intermediate state. A signature of cytotoxic T cells was associated with favorable survival in neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated NSCLCs (p&#60;0.05). Major pathological response to chemoimmunotherapy was positively associated with CD8 T cells (p&#60;0.05) and Th1 cells were significantly reduced post-chemoimmunotherapy (p&#60;0.001). Among the three cohorts, chemoimmunotherapy-treated NSCLCs exhibited highest scores for various immune cell subsets including T effector and B cells (both, p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings highlight immune gene programs that may underlie host tumor immunity and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in early-stage NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/918a18c2-1018-419a-b444-13e64b7a39bd\/@v03B8ZTQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18929"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pedro Rocha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiexin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raquel Laza-Briviesca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Cruz-Bermúdez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katsuhiro Yoshimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmen Behrens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Apar Pataer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edwin Parra-Cuentas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cara Haymaker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junya Fujimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Swisher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Heymach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Don L.

Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used in clinical trials for patients with recurrent brain tumors, the efficacy of these treatments has been limited due to severe side effects and poor penetrance of these reagents through BBB. Published data as well as the results of our own study indicate that macrophage is the major component of infiltrated immune cells in the brain metastatic lesions, suggesting that engineering to reprogram macrophages is a viable therapeutic strategy for patients with brain metastasis. Given the unique ability of macrophages to cross BBB and exert their phagocytic function to tumor cells, we genetically engineered macrophage that expressed tumor-specific antibody (scFv) to Mesothelin (MSLN) and activated the anti-tumor immune signaling molecule, MyD88. We hypothesize that MyD-88-driven chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (MyD-CARMA) suppresses brain metastasis of lung cancer by phagocytosis and increasing anti-tumor immune response. To investigate the effect of MyD-CARMA on brain metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>, mice were intracranially transplanted with lung cancer brain metastasis cell (H2030BrM) which expresses a high level of MSLN followed by administration of MyD-CARMA every 2 weeks for 40 days. This CARMA indeed penetrated BBB and drastically decreased brain metastasis growth in our humanized mouse model. The MyD-CARMA showed antigen-specific phagocytosis activity against MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells. We then utilized NCI-H522 cell which lacks MSLN expression and overexpressed MSLN in this cell line followed by co-culturing with CARMA. We found that CARMA suppressed tumor growth of only MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> but not MSLN<sup>-<\/sup> cells. However, when CARMA was co-cultured with both MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> and MSLN<sup>-<\/sup> cells, CARMA exhibited a bystander killing effect even on MSLN<sup>-<\/sup> cells. When TNF-&#945; was knocked out in CARMA by CRISPR\/Cas9, CARMA lost the ability to show the bystander effect on MSLN<sup>-<\/sup> cells, suggesting that CARMA exhibited the bystander killing effect via up-regulation of TNF-&#945; upon engagement with MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Importantly, CARMA showed much less liver and neuron toxicities compared to CAR-T. In conclusion, our results showed that these unique features of MyD-CARMA represent significant advantage over other immune therapies, and therefore, MyD-CARMA may serve as a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/73903ef3-0afd-4354-bfdd-1edfe0e941f6\/@v03B8ZTQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Brain metastasis,Macrophages,Chimeric antigen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18930"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shih-Ying Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerui Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abhishek Tyagi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Xing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravindra Pramod Deshpande<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yin Liu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kounosuke Watabe<\/i><\/presenter>.

Colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) present as two major histological growth patterns (HGP) that predict response to treatment\/survival: 1. angiogenic tumors characterized by a desmoplastic stroma separating CRC cells from the liver parenchyma and are highly angiogenic and 2. co-opting tumors where tumor cells infiltrate the parenchymal cells in the liver and grow by co-opting the sinusoidal blood vessels between the liver cell plates without sprouting angiogenesis. Angiogenic tumors receiving neoadjuvant anti-angiogenics (anti-VEGF) and chemotherapy have more than double the 5-year overall survival compared to patients with co-opting tumors who have received the same neoadjuvant regimen. In addition, our clinical data revealed that anti-angiogenics could negatively affect outcomes in patients with co-opting lesions.<br \/>The goal<b> <\/b>of our study is to understand how the immune system affects the development of the two distinct CRCLM tumors. We used both Nanostring GeoMX spatial protein profiling platform, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, to identify the immune landscapes in chemona&#239;ve and treated human CRCLM tumors. We observed that angiogenic tumors were rich in both CD4 and CD8 T cells with a near absence of neutrophils and macrophages. These adaptive immune cells were also FOXP3 positive indicating an immunosuppressive phenotype. Interestingly, we observed that vessel co-opting tumors have far fewer infiltrating lymphocytes than angiogenic tumors, but interestingly have greater numbers of innate cells - mostly neutrophils and macrophages. The macrophages were further characterized as being M2, tumor promoting, leading to an immunosuppressive environment. We then went on to analyze treated tumors. For those patients treated with chemotherapy alone we observed a larger infiltration of T cells in the angiogenic tumors and the appearance of T cells infiltrating the co-opting tumors. Surprisingly, in patients treated with chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs (ie. anti-VEGF), which is part of the standard of care, the co-opting tumors no longer demonstrated the presence of T cell infiltration and had a similar profile to the chemona&#239;ve tumors. This could explain why chemotherapy in co-opting tumors had a higher overall survival compared to those treated with chemotherapy and anti-VEGF.<br \/>These results suggest developing treatments aimed at reshaping the different immune landscape in angiogenic and co-opting CRCLM to yield beneficial results for patient overall survival. Furthermore, the identification of immune cells or immune mediators facilitating the development of these two tumor would identify immune cell targets for immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/af82bda0-2896-45c0-9efa-58d75203e265\/@v03B8ZTQ\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy response,Colorectal cancer,Liver,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18931"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Diane H.

Infiltrating mast cells highly produced HDC protein, and mast cell counts around cancer foci were significantly increased in HFD-fed mice. Fexofenadine (Fexo), an H1 blocker, inhibited HFD-induced PCa growth, while ranitidine, an H2 blocker, had no inhibitory effect. Fexo reduced MDSC counts and suppressed IL6-STAT3 signaling in PCa of HFD-fed mice. In vitro, both histamine and Fexo did not affect the proliferation of DU145. HFD altered the composition of gut microbiota, and Shannon index suggesting diversity of gut microbiota was reduced in HFD-fed mice.

The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) can hinder the capability of cytotoxic T cells to fight cancer. In this regard, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are among the most abundant stromal cells in TME responsible for immunosuppression. Therefore, reversal of the immunosuppressive phenotype of CAFs and is a major therapeutic goal. Cancer cells secrete exosomes and other factors to reprogram fibroblasts and induce their differentiation into pro-tumorigenic CAFs. Also, cancer cells maintain the activated fibroblast phenotype via triggering major signaling pathways e.g., TGF&#946;1, FGFR, or &#946;-catenin pathways in the fibroblasts. Here, our goal was to maintain a normalized quiescent phenotype of fibroblasts to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. We demonstrated that a tumor-targeted EpCAM antibody modified shikonin\/GW4869 combination liposomes synergistically reduces the biogenesis and release of exosomes from A549 lung cancer cells which significantly inhibits differentiation of MRC5 lung fibroblasts into CAFs. In parallel, we showed the efficacy of TAS-120\/ICG-001 FGFR-Wnt\/&#946;-catenin inhibitor combination liposomes decorated with GPR77 and CD10 targeting antibodies to switch the acquired activated CAFs phenotype to a quiescent one. Co-administration of both liposomes in low drug doses significantly enhanced the infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and improved the antitumor efficacy of &#945;PD-L1 antibody in LLC syngeneic mice model of lung cancer. In conclusion, simultaneous blockage of the tumoral exosome-mediated activation of fibroblasts and FGFR-Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling may constitute an outstanding immunotherapeutic modality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/36dd106f-96e1-4f7b-90c3-c3e288d6e305\/@v03B8ZTQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Tumor-Stroma Interaction,Nanoparticle,Tumor targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18935"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ahmed Elzoghby<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>May Freag<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mostafa Mohammed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krishna Maremanda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hae Lin Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiladitya Sengupta<\/i><\/presenter>.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an initial systemic therapy for advanced PCa, but almost all cancer eventually becomes castration resistant. Recently, we introduced ferritin-based protein C nanoparticles (PCNs), known as TFG and TFMG, which enhance normalization of the tumor vasculature. However, the exact underlying mechanism how PCNs induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and anti-tumor activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of PCNs for CRPC development in endothelial cells. We found that TFMG inhibits prostate cancer castration resistance by activating AMPK through the Tie2-mediated signaling pathway. TFMG treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) at Ser79 in EA.hy926 cells. TFMG treatment also significantly increased the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with inducing nitric oxide (NO) production in EA.hy926 cells. In addition, TFMG treatment induced the vasodilatory effect in isolated rat mesenteric resistance arteries (MRAs), which was blocked by NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME. Interestingly, these effects were all abolished by pretreatment with Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), rebastinib (selective Tie2 Inhibitor), AMPK knockdown using siRNA, or dominant negative AMPK&#945; recombinant adenovirus. Finally, we found that TFMG functionally abrogates CRPC development in mouse model. In summary, TFMG exerted vasodilatation through activating Tie2\/AMPK\/eNOS signaling in endothelial cells, which leads to the overcoming vasoconstriction induced ADT. This study provides the potential value of TFMG in vasodilation of blood vessels leading suppression of CRPC development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ab2917b-9f71-4c2a-a019-7a4d9d15a1aa\/@v03B8ZTQ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen deprivation therapy,Nanoparticle,Prostate cancer,Endothelial cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18937"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>You Mie Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Hak Jeong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunha Jang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jihye You<\/i><\/presenter>.

Two breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were treated with patritumab (anti-HER3 antibody), polyclonal activated autologous T cells (PATCs) or a combination of patritumab and PATCs (P-PATCs) in order to test immunological modulation by the regulation of HER3 signals. RT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining and CyTOF were performed in tumors or liver tissue for CD3, CD4, CD8a, CD137, CD134\/OX40, CD80, IFN-&#947; and PD-L1, LAG3, TIM3, FOXP3.

Interestingly, the proportion of CD137 expressing T cell infiltration and mRNA expression of CD137 was significantly higher in P-PATCs group compared to patritumab or the PATCs group, while the proportion of CD4\/8 T cell infiltration was also higher in the P-PATCs group. CyTOF revealed that the proportion of CD137 and CD134\/OX40 expressing cells was higher in P-PATCs group compared to the PATCs group.

Recently, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has emerged as effective therapy across a range of malignancies but has shown limited efficacy in PNET patients partly due to what has been reported as a &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we aimed to characterize the TME among both localized and mPNETs and identify mechanisms to increase tumor immunogenicity and T cell recruitment among these patients. We analyzed tumor-infiltrating and peripheral T cells from patients with lPNETs and mPNETs by flow cytometry and found higher expression of CD69+ (activation), CCR5+ (recruitment), and PD1+ (exhaustion) in T cells isolated from TME compared to peripheral blood. Further, we identified a more profound degree of CD3+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration among mPNETs compared to lPNETs by immunohistochemistry analysis, suggesting that mPNETs are at least moderately enriched with activated T cells. RNA-sequencing performed on 22 sporadic, well-differentiated primary PNETs revealed distinct transcriptional signatures dependent upon metastatic potential. These divergent transcriptomes were analyzed by an L1000 computational algorithm, which classifies landmark gene signatures perturbed by drug treatments. We identified the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat as the drug most likely to perturb the PNET gene signature. A KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these vorinostat-target genes were commonly involved in both Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell differentiation and in the NF-&#954;B pathway. Vorinostat treatment of patient-derived mPNET resulted in increased T cell migration towards metastatic tumors across a semi-permeable membrane; cotreatment with a competitive CCR5 antagonist abrogated this effect. In addition, vorinostat treatment of BON-1 and QGP-1, two PNET cell lines, elevated both NF-&#954;B activity and CCR5 expression, with induction reduced following inhibition of NF-&#954;B nuclear localization. Our study demonstrates that T cell recruitment toward mPNET tissue is dependent upon CCR5 expression. These results reveal that PNET TME is regulatable by vorinostat and opens an avenue of potential sensitization to immune checkpoint blockade among patients with PNETs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/02d61261-68c2-4ee1-95da-38dae9f6e7fc\/@w03B8ZTR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Pancreatic cancer,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18939"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jacques A.

Melanoma tumor lesions have high glucose uptake due to metabolic reprogramming, which supports tumor cell growth and is partially mediated through elevated expression of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4). Resultant decreased glucose levels and low pH in the tumor microenvironment are detrimental to antitumor immune cell function. Here, we aimed to reverse metabolic reprogramming in melanoma through PDK inhibition, thereby inhibiting tumor cell growth while maintaining or potentially enhancing antitumor immunity. We used a panel of four melanoma cell lines with genetic backgrounds similar to those most frequently found in patients, namely the BRAF-mutant A375 and S-MEL-28 cell lines, the NRAS-mutant SK-MEL-2 cell line and the BRAF\/NRAS wild-type MeWo cell line. These were then treated with PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) to determine effects on viability and metabolic phenotype. Furthermore, we investigated whether DCA synergized with treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839. Finally, we determined the effect of DCA on viability, interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;) secretion and antitumor activity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. MeWo cells were most sensitive to DCA, while SK-MEL-2 was the least sensitive, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 13.3 to 27.0 mM. DCA led to an up to 6-fold increase in oxygen consumption rate:extracellular acidification rate (OCR:ECAR) ratio in all cell lines. SK-MEL-28 cells were not sensitive to CB-839, while the IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the other cell lines ranged from 7.9 nM in MeWo to 139.2 nM in SK-MEL-2 cells. DCA synergized with CB-839 in 2D and 3D culture, ranging from 2-fold sensitization compared to either drug alone in MeWo up to 5-fold sensitization in SK-MEL-2. In activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, viability was not affected by DCA treatment of up to 21 mM, whereas proliferation was only mildly inhibited. These cells also showed a 2.5-fold increase in OCR:ECAR ratio after DCA treatment. Interestingly, IFN-&#947; secretion by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was increased 2.8-fold after DCA treatment and tumor cell killing by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in a coculture with A375 cells was not impaired by DCA or CB-839 treatment. We conclude that DCA can indeed reprogram cellular metabolism in melanoma and synergizes with other metabolically targeted drugs in antitumor activity, while keeping the antitumor reactivity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells intact.

The tumor cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms of the immune-desert phenotype remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) core components, EED or SUZ12, a prevalent genetic event in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and sporadically in other cancer types, drives a context-dependent immune-desert TME. PRC2 inactivation reprograms the chromatin landscape that leads to a cell-autonomous shift from primed baseline signaling-dependent cellular responses (e.g., interferon &#947;) to PRC2-regulated development and cellular differentiation transcriptional programs. Further, PRC2 inactivation reprograms the TME, leads to diminished tumor immune infiltrates and immune evasion through reduced chemokine production and impaired antigen presentation and T-cell priming, and confers ICB primary resistance through blunted T-cell recruitment <i>in vivo<\/i>. We demonstrate that strategies that enhancing innate immunity via intratumoral delivery of inactivated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) leads to increased tumor immune infiltrates and sensitizes PRC2-loss tumors to ICB. Our results provide novel molecular mechanisms of context-dependent dysfunctional epigenetic reprogramming that underline the immune-desert phenotype in MPNST and other cancers with PRC2 inactivation. Importantly, our findings highlight genetic-inactivation of PRC2 as a novel context-dependent ICB therapeutic resistance biomarker in cancer, and caution that therapeutic strategies that non-selectively target PRC2 in the host may lead to undesirable context-dependent immune evasion and ICB resistance in tumors. Our studies also point to intratumoral delivery of immunogenic therapeutic viruses as an initial strategy to modulate the immune-desert TME and capitalize on the clinical benefit of ICB. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ddf16ae9-7692-405b-b4c7-193ed5287a00\/@w03B8ZTR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Tumor immunity,Immune checkpoint blockade,Vaccinia virus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18941"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juan Yan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuedan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amish J.

DARC\/ACKR1 is an atypical chemokine receptor that promiscuously binds both pro-inflammatory CC and pro-angiogenic CXC class chemokines and plays a role in chemokine gradient establishment both in circulation, and at sites of inflammation via chemokine transcytosis. In the BC context, we and others have reported DARC\/ACKR1 protein expression on breast tumor epithelial cells by IHC and have also shown a range of gene expression in breast tumors from bulk RNAseq data in the TCGA cohort. Specifically, alongside CIBERSORT deconvolution of tumor associated immune cell populations, we have shown a strong positive correlation between DARC\/ACKR1 gene expression and total tumor-associated leukocyte (TAL) abundance across all BC subtypes.<br \/>To investigate the role of DARC\/ACKR1 specifically in the TNBC tumor microenvironment (TME), we have analyzed (1) in silico bulk RNAseq data from two independent TNBC cohorts, (2) imaging mass cytometry data from TNBC patients and (3) murine model of DARC\/ACKR1 BC progression in a basal-like BC transgenic mouse model.<br \/>Our in silico data shows strong positive correlation of DARC\/ACKR1 expression and TAL abundance, when DARC\/ACKR1 expression is both dichotomized and analyzed as a continuous variable. Immune cell populations increasing with DARC\/ACKR1 expression include B cell, T cell, monocyte and macrophage populations, which was consistent with our previous findings across all BC subtypes. IMC analysis of TNBC FFPE sections to determine protein expression of various immune and structural markers on the single-cell level between DARC\/ACKR1 high or low expressing tumors show cells from DARC\/ACKR1 high expressing tumors clustered distinctly from DARC\/ACKR1 low expressing tumors. Image analysis also revealed increased infiltration among our DARC\/ACKR1 high tumors. Finally, our murine model of DARC\/ACKR1 in TNBC, shows that tumor development followed similar disease progression as human BC, following early through late-stage disease. DARC\/ACKR1 deficient mice were found to have larger tumor volume and more palpable tumors, where DARC\/ACKR1 expressing mice show co-localization of DARC and immune cell expression.<br \/>This is the first work to describe the role of DARC\/ACKR1 in the TNBC TME in bulk tumor transcriptomic data, spatial single-cell protein level data, and murine BC tumor model. Further investigation of factors that drive immune response in TNBC tumors, like DARC\/ACKR1, may lead the way to novel therapeutic options or biomarkers for better outcomes for women with TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/23f90cc8-8637-4183-9e22-54cc4d429514\/@w03B8ZTR\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor microenvironment,Chemokine receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18942"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachel Martini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiel Telesford<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brittany Lord<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiranmayi Ravichandran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Elemento<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nancy Manley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michele Monteil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Newman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Upender Manne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clayton Yates<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa B.

However, while much is known about how cell-intrinsic factors regulate tumor metabolism, the effects of cell-extrinsic factors remain poorly understood. In particular, despite evidence that tumor nutrient availability extrinsically regulates tumor metabolism, further investigation has been hindered by the lack of models to study physiological nutrient availability <i>in vitro<\/i>.To accurately model the tumor nutrient microenvironment, our group quantified nutrient availability in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor perfusate and created a medium to mimic this <i>in vitro, <\/i>called <u>t<\/u>umor <u>i<\/u>nterstitial <u>f<\/u>luid <u>m<\/u>edium (TIFM). We compare the effects of TIFM-culture to maintenance in conventional culture medium (RPMI-1640) as a control for standard laboratory conditions. Using this model, I found that TIFM-cultured PDAC cells downregulate lipid synthesis, making TIFM-cultured cells uniquely reliant upon extracellular lipid uptake for growth. Analysis of murine PDAC tumors confirms downregulated lipogenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>, suggesting cell-extrinsic nutrients render lipogenesis dispensable&#8212;and lipid uptake necessary&#8212;for PDAC tumor growth. Notably, this contrasts studies in conventional culture media that claim lipogenesis is critical for PDAC growth.I am currently working to: (1) understand how the nutrient microenvironment alters lipid metabolism and (2) determine the extracellular lipids and transporters pancreatic cancer cells require for growth. Regarding the first question, transcriptomic analysis of TIFM-cultured cells revealed significant deactivation of SREBPs, master regulators of intracellular lipid and sterol synthesis, suggesting cell-extrinsic nutrient cues suppress lipogenesis by altering SREBP signaling. I am currently investigating which TIFM nutrients alter this signaling. I am also performing lipidomics analysis and lipid transporter knockdown experiments to identify lipids and transporters that TIFM-cultured cells require for growth. Collectively, these experiments will clarify the role extracellular nutrients play in driving changes to PDAC lipid metabolism and may suggest novel therapeutic treatment options for PDAC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4690de92-633a-4482-8f53-2d6f1388fca7\/@w03B8ZTR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Metabolism,Lipid metabolism,Lipogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18944"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patrick Jonker<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Muir<\/i><\/presenter>.

This study sought to better understand the mechanisms of sorafenib activity in DF by defining downstream pathways dysregulated by &#946;-catenin.<br \/>Methods: Primary DF cell lines (DES9525, 3276, 8163) were developed from surgical specimens and validated by Sanger sequencing of <i>CTNNB1<\/i>. Gene expression in DF tumors was assessed with U133A arrays and in cell lines using RNA-seq. Lentiviral systems were used to deliver shRNA (or scramble control) and overexpression constructs. Luciferase reporter assay was employed to assess transcription activity. Cell proliferation, protein levels\/phosphorylation and gene expression were assessed by CyQuant DNA quantification, immunoblot, and RT-PCR, respectively. Endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation was quantitated manually using light microscopy.<br \/>Results: Gene set enrichment analysis of DES9525 <i>CTNNB1<\/i> knock-down (KD) showed decreased expression of genes commonly associated with hypoxia and angiogenesis. Unsupervised clustering confirmed <i>in vivo <\/i>relevance as expression levels of hypoxia-associated genes clustered 45 DF tumors separately from normal mesenchymal tissue (fat and muscle). Higher baseline levels of HIF1&#945; were observed in DF cell lines compared to mesenchymal stem cells and abrogation of <i>CTNNB1<\/i> reduced cellular levels of HIF1&#945; and HIF transcriptional activity. DF co-culture with endothelial cells induced VEGFR phosphorylation on HUVECs and tube formation; <i>HIF1A<\/i> KD inhibited VEGFR phosphorylation and reduced tube formation &#62;50% but had no effect on desmoid cell proliferation. Similar inhibition was observed after co-culture of DF <i>CTNNB1 <\/i>KD cells with endothelial cells (&#62;50% reduction in tube formation, p&#60;0.05), but not after overexpression of <i>HIF1A<\/i> in <i>CTNNB1 <\/i>KD cells. Sorafenib inhibited this tube-formation (60%, p&#60;0.05) induced by DF at lower concentrations (1&#956;M) as compared to those required to inhibit DF cell proliferation (IC50 10uM). While sorafenib directly inhibited VEGFR phosphorylation on endothelial cells, it also inhibited phosphorylation of PDGFRB and decreased HIF1&#945; levels in DF cells. Exogenous PDGF-BB conversely increased levels of HIF1&#945; in DF cells and endothelial tube formation (2 times, p&#60;0.05) when added to DF but not to endothelial cells grown in the absence of DF cells.<br \/>Conclusion: &#946;-catenin and PDGFRB signaling modulate cellular levels of HIF1&#945; in DF cells to affect endothelial cells via VEGFR. Sorafenib inhibits a PDGFR\/&#946;-catenin\/HIF1&#945; axis by modulating signaling pathways both on the DF cells themselves as well as RTK targets of sorafenib on stromal cells. Improved understanding of these interactions may allow for more specific therapeutic selection in DF patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7d2fa602-b6e3-4f55-94a6-289363d18e42\/@w03B8ZTR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"&#946;-catenin,Sorafenib,Tumor microenvironment,Hypoxia-inducible factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18945"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jia Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony Villano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachael Connor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuliy Rozenberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alankrta Venkatesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Socci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Singer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aimee Crago<\/i><\/presenter>.

In recent years, immune-stromal cell interactions have been the subject of research in a variety of diseases. Interestingly, natural killer (NK) cells are relatively understudied in PDAC and may be exploited to identify new treatment opportunities. We have explored how NK cell-PSC interactions are mediated by known NK cell ligands. Human PSC (hPSC, CRC-811) or PDAC (MIA-PaCa-2, PANC-1) cell lines were co-cultured with DiO stained NK cells (NK-92, donor NK cells) for 4 hours, then target cells were assessed for apoptosis by flow cytometry using AnnexinV and Sytox stains. We found that although NK cells lyse both PSCs and PDAC cells, there was more NK cell-mediated lysis against PSCs. Using flow cytometry, we found that PSCs express the well-known MICA\/B ligand, which binds the activating NKG2D receptor on NK cells to initiate its cytotoxic activity. In co-culture, neutralizing MICA\/B <i>in vitro<\/i> did not completely inhibit NK cell-mediated lysis of PSCs, suggesting other interactions need to be explored. To identify other molecular determinants, NK cell ligand and receptor expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR in human PSC, PDAC, NK, and other leukocytic (K562) cell lines. Cell surface validation of highly expressed NK cell ligands and receptors were confirmed by flow cytometry and\/or Western blot. NK cell ligands that were both highly expressed and localized to the cell surface were: NKG2D ligands&#8212;MICA and ULBP2 (both activating), KIR2DS4 (CD158I) ligand&#8212;HLA-A (activating), and NKp44 ligands&#8212;NKp44L and PCNA (activating and inhibitory, respectively). Their corresponding receptors were also expressed and localized to the cell surface by NK cells. These results highlight novel NK cell-PSC interactions that may mediate immune suppression in PDAC. These findings warrant further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1018a165-e8b9-4645-b0d9-ad4417bce6dd\/@w03B8ZTR\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Fibroblasts,Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18946"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zoe X.

Intensive multimodal treatment cures almost 75% of patients who present with localized disease. However, only 25% of patients who present with metastases become long term survivors, and those who suffer a metastatic relapse are almost never cured. Recently, a 3-cell assembly consisting of an invasive cancer cell, a Tie2-high expressing macrophage, and an endothelial cell (termed the Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis, or TMEM), has been described as the doorway through which breast cancer cells enter the vasculature and disseminate to distant sites. We hypothesized that EWS cells use a similar mechanism for dissemination, and that targeting TMEM offers a novel therapeutic opportunity to prevent metastatic recurrence.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples were obtained from 16 patients with EWS treated at our institution, and these were evaluated for the presence of TMEM structures by immunohistochemistry. We also evaluated samples obtained from our novel, clinically relevant murine model of spontaneous distant EWS metastasis. Fragments of EWS either from cell line-derived tumors or patient-derived xenografts (PDX) orthotopically or subcutaneously. After tumors grew, mice were injected with fluorescent dextran in the tail vein and tumors harvested 60 minutes later. Intravascular dextran remains inside blood vessels because the molecular weight is too large to allow diffusion between endothelial cells. As TMEM disrupts the endothelial barrier, dextran leaks out of blood vessels and can be detected and quantified using fluorescence microscopy. Tumors were evaluated for the presence of TMEM structures by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and for the presence of localized vascular leakiness, (the hallmark of functional TMEM), by fluorescence microscopy.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found TMEM assemblies in all patient samples, at numbers well in excess of those seen in samples of metastatic breast cancer. Interestingly, although there was no difference in TMEM counts from patients who were survivors compared with those who died from metastatic disease, there was an increase in TMEM counts in samples from tumors that were exposed to chemotherapy compared to diagnostic biopsy samples, something also reported in breast cancer patients. We also identified TMEM assemblies and localized vascular leakiness in EWS PDX tumors implanted orthotopically.<br \/><b>Discussion: <\/b>TMEM assemblies are present in both EWS patient samples and PDX models, suggesting that this important mechanism of tumor intravasation into the vasculature may be contributing to distant metastasis. Future work will focus on identifying drugs that inhibit the function of TMEM, with the goal of translating this work into clinical trials aimed at diminishing the burden of metastasis in EWS patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e183645-1ac9-47fe-adca-f7779095fc1e\/@w03B8ZTR\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Metastasis,Microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19047"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rachel Offenbacher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Karagiannis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maja Oktay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Loeb<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this study, we have performed single cell cloning experiment using 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cell line and compared the phenotypes of different clones. When compared to the parental 4T1 cell line, one clone (C12) showed markedly different phenotype by exhibiting less aggressive features <i>in vitro<\/i> and significantly slower tumor growth and metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. The tumor tissue of the C12 showed significant alteration in immune microenvironment as higher number of recruited immune cells including T and B cells. RNA sequencing of the C12 clones and parental 4T1 cells identified Macc1 as a significantly up-regulated gene in parental 4T1 cells. Metastasis&#8209;associated colon cancer 1 (MACC1) has been associated with poor prognosis and the promotion of metastasis within several types of cancer, especially colon cancer. The gene encoding the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, MET, is a transcriptional target of MACC1. Next, we established Macc1-silenced 4T1 cells using the parental 4T1 cells and observed that Macc1-silencing resulted in a similar phenotype seen in the C12 clone; decreased cell proliferation and migration <i>in vitro<\/i> and slow tumor growth and metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. To mimic the metastasis <i>in vitro<\/i>, intravasation was determined as which tumor cells were co-cultured with HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We discovered tumor cell penetration into HUVEC cells was blocked in Macc1-silencing 4T1 group. According to CD45, CD3, and CD19 immunohistochemistry, we also defined immune cells, especially T and B cells, were highly infiltrated in Macc1-silencing tumor like as C12 clone tumor. These results were also reconstructed in EMT6, another TNBC mouse cell line model. In this study, we show that MACC1 can regulate tumor progression and metastasis by remodeling of immune microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7855fc6-edcb-4be2-b538-fd32de456278\/@x03B8ZTS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immunomodulation,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20550"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hye-Youn Son<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woo Hang Heo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Song Bin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingji Quan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Jeong Her<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyu-Jin Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ju Hee Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han-Byoel Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wonshik Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeong-Gon Moon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Functional interpretation and biological mechanisms of these risk variants are not always clear. Many of the prostate cancer risk variants are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), but studies have mostly been performed in tumor or epithelial-enriched normal prostate tissue. Given emerging evidence supporting that stroma contributes to the carcinogenic process, we examined the associations of prostate cancer risk variants with the expression of genes in prostate stroma.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We generated mRNA expression data for 13,577 genes with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Exome library preparation kit from stromal samples in specimens from participants of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians&#8217; Health Study cohorts. Specifically, we profiled 172 stromal samples adjacent to tumor and 86 paired stroma distant from tumor. We included 264 prostate cancer risk variants genotyped data and imputed using a common reference panel (1,000 Genomes Phase I release). We performed cis- (&#8804;1 Mb from the SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) to the gene) and trans- eQTL analyses using a linear regression model in the R package Matrix eQTL.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Thirty-four SNPs were significantly (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01) associated with cis-expression of 41 nearby genes in prostate stroma adjacent to tumor, and 41 SNPs with 52 nearby genes for stroma distant from tumor. Genome-wide, 86 SNPs were significantly (FDR &#60; 0.10) associated with the expression of 126 genes in stroma adjacent to tumor, and 64 SNPs with 291 genes for stroma distant from tumor.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This is the first study to comprehensively examine associations between prostate cancer risk variants and gene expression in prostate stroma. We observed some previous reported associations but also novel associations which may suggest genes that contribute to prostate cancer risk within the stromal tissue. Identifications of eQTLs within prostate stroma may suggest potential mechanisms in specific cell types for their effect on disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d2de1e33-03bf-4fad-996c-0f7ad539ff3c\/@x03B8ZTS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,eQTL,Stroma,SNP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20551"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chaoran Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yinglu Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Plym<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giuseppe Nicolò Fanelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimo Loda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorelei Mucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svitlana Tyekucheva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathryn Penney<\/i><\/presenter>.

We examined the effects of activated neutrophils on chemotactic migration of activated T cells in vitro. Methods Neutrophils and mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from the blood of healthy donor. Neutrophils were stimulated with PMA (1uM) or LPS (10ug\/ml) for 15 min, washed extensively, and incubated for another 4 hours. PBMC were cultured on anti-CD3 mAb-coated plate with recomnibant-IL-2 (10ng\/ml) for 7-14days. The activated T cells were placed in culture inserts with 3&#956;m pore and migration to CXCL-11 (1000ng\/ml) placed in lower chamber with or without neutrophils was examined after 2 hours. Random migration of activated T cells on fibronectin coated plate was evaluated with timelapsed analysis using Biostudio system. Degradation of CXCL-11 was examined with western blotting. Results Neutrophils stimulated with PMA or LPS produced neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Migration of T cells to CXCL-11 was drastically inhibited in the presence of PMA-activated neutrophils. The inhibition was similarly detected when NETs was removed from PMA-activated neutrophils by ultracentrifugation. Timelapse analysis also showed the NET-depleted supernatant greatly inhibited random migration, which was totally canceled by the pretreatment with 800U\/ml catalase. When neutrophils were activated by LPS, T cell migration was also significantly inhibited (p=0.02) but not by NET-depleted supernatant (p=0.99). In western blotting, CXCL11 was totally degraded by LPS-stimulated neutrophils, which was greatly reduced by the depletion of NET component. CXCL11 degraded by NETs was restored by protease inhibitor, 5mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The reduced migration induced by LPS-stimulated neutrophils was mostly restored with 2mM PMSF. Conclusion Activated neutrophils inhibit chemotactic migration of activated T cells through multiple mechanisms including ROS production and chemokine degradation. TAN may have suppressive effects on the accumulation of TILs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e5e4fec5-a3a8-4377-ae5d-c76ef64d2d2b\/@x03B8ZTS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuropilins,T cell,Migration,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21194"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kohei Tamura<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Kaneko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yurie Futoh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuya Takahashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Kimura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akira Saito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mineyuki Tojo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideyo Miyato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideyuki Ohzawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasushi Saga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuji Takei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroyuki Fujiwara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joji Kitayama<\/i><\/presenter>.

Over the last decade, advances in surgical-, chemo-, targeted-, and immuno- therapies have significantly improved survival rates, but novel biomarkers are required for the design of better screening and therapeutic strategies for CRC patients. The tumor (T) and adjacent normal tissue (NAT) can capture tumor heterogeneity and assist in the molecular classification of the tumors. In this study, we explored the clinical and molecular features of Dipeptidase (<i>DPEP1<\/i>)-related gene expression in CRC. DPEP1 is an enzyme involved in the conversion of leukotrienes and functions as an adhesive receptor for neutrophil recruitment in inflamed tissue. Primary analysis using the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) dataset identified survival and tumorigenic role of DPEP1-related gene network in COAD (colon adenocarcinoma) dataset. Higher expression of DPEP1-interacting genes (<i>KIF1BP,<\/i> <i>GGT5, GGT1, DPEP2, <\/i>and<i> DPEP3<\/i>) was found to be associated with worse overall and progression-free survival (log-rank p-value &#60;0.01). To further characterize the distribution of the <i>DPEP1<\/i> as a hub gene, we quantified its expression in the Augusta University cohort (40 patients, 80 T\/NAT pairs). FFPE (Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) blocks were sectioned to extract tissue sections and were subsequently stained using H&#38;E (Hematoxylin and eosin dyes) to identify the tumor and normal regions. Total RNA was isolated from the tumor-rich and adjacent normal regions separately post macrodissection. The mRNA molecules were quantified using a medium throughput NanoString platform. The expression of <i>DPEP1<\/i> was found to be significantly higher (2.5-fold) in tumor-rich regions compared to adjacent normal. A similar trend of higher expression in tumors was observed in the orthologous TCGA-COAD dataset. Immune cell infiltration analysis identified a positive correlation between <i>DPEP1<\/i> expression and M2 macrophages (p-value &#60;0.01). Generally, the M2 subtype of macrophages has been known to exhibit immunosuppressive and pro-tumor properties. Additional gene set enrichment analysis identified an inverse association between <i>DPEP1<\/i> expression and the Interferon-gamma signaling pathway (NES = -2.4, p-value &#60;0.01). In conclusion, higher expression of DPEP1-related gene expression has a prognostic influence on CRC. Its positive association with M2 macrophages and negative association with anti-tumor cytokines forms a distinct subtype of CRC tumor that can benefit from emerging immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bdd13c6d-ebd5-4d7e-8e08-b138a1b8e65e\/@x03B8ZTS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21206"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"63824ee5-1d6f-4da0-b9e3-9df3c7696c29","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/63824ee5-1d6f-4da0-b9e3-9df3c7696c29\/@x03B8ZTS\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pankaj Ahluwalia<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashis K.

Adipocytes are metabolically active cells capable of secreting a variety of adipokines and free fatty acids, which can be utilized by tumor cells to enhance proliferation and cause resistance to chemotherapies. Our lab has shown that adipocytes promote PCa progression and therapy evasion through modulation of tumor metabolism and activation of pro-survival signaling; however, the molecular mechanisms behind tumor-promoting effects of fat cells are not understood. It is well known that high levels of iron within the tumor microenvironment help the growth of PCa cells. However, since iron overload can cause an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are harmful to cell structure, tumor cells have developed defense mechanisms to protect them from this oxidative damage. Intriguingly, our data show that the expression of ferritin, an iron storing protein, is reduced in PC3 and ARCaP(M) cells in co-culture with adipocytes. Since low ferritin levels have been associated with induction of ferroptosis, an iron and oxidative stress-regulated cell death process, we examined protein levels of ferroptosis markers GPX4 and NCOA4 in PCa cells. Surprisingly, our data show that interaction with adipocytes increases GPX4 and reduces NCOA4 expression in PCa cells suggesting an adipocyte-mediated defense mechanism against ferroptosis.<br \/>The aim of the present study was to establish that adipocytes promote a defense mechanism against ferroptosis in PCa cells by the upregulation of GPX4 activity via the mTOR pathway. GPX4 is known to be an essential antioxidant enzyme that utilizes glutathione (GSH) to reduce lipid-peroxidation-induced ROS. We demonstrate that PCa cells exposed to adipocytes have reduced lipid-peroxidation induced ROS, which can be reversed with ferroptosis inducers. We also show that exposure of PC3 and ARCaP(M) cells to adipocytes leads to depletion of GSH, which may be indicative of higher GPX4 activity. It has been suggested that an increase in GPX4 can result from an interplay between ferroptosis and mTOR pathways, specifically mTORC1, which may mediate cysteine-induced GPX4 protein synthesis. Surprisingly, treatment of PCa cells co-cultured with adipocytes with mTORC1 inhibitor Everolimus (EVO) increases the protein and gene levels of GPX4. This coincides with reduced mRNA and protein expression of SLC7A11, transporter involved in the cysteine\/glutamate antiporter system, which typically fuels GPX4 activity by bringing in the GSH precursor cysteine. Understanding the mechanisms of fat cell contribution to dysregulation of the mTOR pathway and escape from ferroptosis may have therapeutic implications for metastatic PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dcf05751-718e-4722-8caf-1a8500a26885\/@x03B8ZTS\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Prostate cancer,Bone metastasis,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21342"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexis Wilson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shane Mecca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mackenzie Herroon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laimar Garmo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Izabela Podgorski<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although a treatable disease, with the survival rate improving due to enhancements in screening and treatment, cancer recurrence remains a dominant contributor to breast cancer related deaths. It has been suggested that systemic factors during the postoperative period, such as surgical site infection (SSI), may increase the risk of recurrence, although the exact role that these infections play in breast cancer recurrence has yet to be elucidated.<br \/>To investigate the influence of these SSIs in breast cancer recurrence following primary breast cancer surgery, we conducted a systematic literature review<sup>1<\/sup> to examine both the incidence and risk factors related to SSI after primary breast cancer surgery and the contribution of SSIs to breast cancer recurrence. Data were extracted from 99 studies for the SSI-focused searches, and 53 studies for recurrence-focused searches and we found that there was a 13.07% mean incidence of SSIs. 638 Gram-positive and 442 Gram-negative isolates were identified, with <i>Staphylococcus<\/i> <i>aureus<\/i> and <i>Escherichia coli <\/i>appearing as the most abundant bacteria in SSIs of breast cancer patients.<i> <\/i>11.8% cases of cancer recurrence were noted, however confounding factors of retrospective study design, surgery type and SSI definition make results challenging to compare and interpret. Only five studies investigated the association between SSI and breast cancer recurrence, three of which highlighting a positive correlation between SSI and breast cancer recurrence.<br \/>To further explore this link, we are using <i>in vitro<\/i> models to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria affect the phenotype of breast cancer. Using LTA (a component of the cell wall of <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i>) to model Gram-positive bacteria and LPS (a component of the <i>Escherichia coli<\/i> cell wall) to model Gram-negative bacteria, we examined the effects of LTA and LPS on the behavior of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and ZR-75-1 cells. Using qRT-PCR, we found that treatment of cells with LPS and LTA dysregulates the expression of pro-tumorigenic inflammatory markers TNF-a and IL-6 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Separately, using metabolomic profiling on LPS and LTA treated MDA-MB-231 cells, we observe significant metabolic reprogramming of the cells when stimulated with the bacterial mimics. We believe that these findings may lead to a better understanding of how SSI promotes breast cancer recurrence and may help design surgical procedures and target therapies. <sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>1<\/sup>O&#8217;Connor, R. &#205;., Kiely, P.

Because pancreatic cancer cells are glutamine dependent [1], we downregulated the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 in Pa04C cells to determine if metabolic changes induced in the spleen and pancreas by Pa04C tumors were normalized when SLC1A5 was downregulated in these tumors. Metabolic patterns were characterized using high-resolution quantitative <sup>1<\/sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of spleen and pancreas tissue obtained from normal mice and mice with Pa04C tumors and mice with Pa04C tumors with SLC1A5 downregulated.<br \/>Method: Patient derived cachexia-inducing Pa04C pancreatic cancer cells were lentivirally transduced to express shRNA to stably downregulate SLC1A5. Mice were euthanized once tumors were ~500 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, the spleen and pancreas were excised and snap frozen. Snap frozen spleen (normal n= 5, Pa04C n= 11, Pa04C_SLC1A5 n= 10) and pancreas (normal n= 4, Pa04C n= 16, Pa04C_SLC1A5 n= 10) tissue samples were pulverized for dual phase extraction. The aqueous phase was used for <sup>1<\/sup>H MRS analysis. Topspin 3.5 software was used for data processing and analyses.<br \/>Results and Discussion: Significant downregulation of SLC1A5 mRNA and protein was confirmed in Pa04C_SLC1A5 cells and tumors. SLC1A5 downregulation resulted in significant growth delay and attenuation of weight loss. A comparison of normal mice <i>vs<\/i> empty vector\/wild type tumor (EV\/WT) bearing mice identified significant changes in succinate, aspartate and fumarate in the spleen, lactate, acetate, pyruvate, methionine, asparagine, creatine, choline phosphocholine, uracil, histidine and phenylalanine in the pancreas, with leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine, glutamate, glutamine, glutathione, glycerophosphocholine, glycine, glucose and tyrosine commonly altered in the spleen and pancreas. A comparison of normal <i>vs<\/i> Pa04C_ SLC1A5 tumor bearing mice identified similar metabolic changes in the spleen and pancreas but these were reduced. Fumarate did not change in the spleen, and of the metabolic changes common to spleen and pancreas, glutamine did not change when tumor SLC1A5 was downregulated. Metabolite changes induced only in the pancreas were also similar to normal <i>vs<\/i> EV\/WT with the exception of a change in glutamine with SLC1A5 downregulation and no change in lactate. Our data highlight the profound metabolic changes in spleen and pancreas metabolism that occur with growth of a cachexia-inducing pancreatic cancer xenograft, and the impact on these metabolic patterns as a result of downregulating the glutamine transporter in these cancer cells. The metabolic patterns identified in the spleen and pancreas may provide novel targets to reduce the morbidity from cachexia.<br \/>Reference: 1.

Recently, patients with relapsed or refractory disease have been treated with a combination of the oncolytic reovirus Pelareorep, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, which was well-tolerated and led to prolonged progression free survival of over 3 years in a subset of patients. To understand the complex tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) and immune responses in patients before and after this treatment, we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to perform single cell, highly multiplexed, analysis of these patients&#8217; bone marrow samples.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> We comprehensively characterized the changes in the MM TIME in pre and post bone marrow biopsy specimens taken from patients treated on a Phase 1b study with a combination of Pelareorep, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. For analysis with IMC, a marker panel of 35 antibodies was assembled to interrogate the various immune subsets of the bone marrow biopsies; each of these antibodies were conjugated to a unique metal isotope. After validation, the antibody cocktail was used to stain the biopsies. Pixel-based classification was performed in Ilastik to generate cell probability masks and processed in Cellprofiler. PhenoGraph was run in HistoCAT to identify the unique phenotypes. Rstudio was used for t-stochastic neighborhood embedding (tSNE) plot generation, and nearest neighbor analyses. ImaCytE was used for image visualization and spatial analysis.<br \/><u>Results<\/u>: Initial visualization of the raw, unsegmented data showed increased infiltration of natural killer cells and T cells in the post-treatment samples when compared against the pre-treatment samples. These changes correlated with immunohistochemical findings, clinical response to treatment, and changes in T cell clonality. After segmentation, the marker expression heatmaps for each of the clusters identified by PhenoGraph and the further subphenotyping in Rstudio showed complex ecosystems of cell-cell interactions. Nearest neighbor spatial analysis of the post-treatment samples revealed that NK cells (NKG2D<sup>+<\/sup> and NKG2A<sup>+<\/sup> subsets), monocytes (CD14<sup>+<\/sup>), macrophages (CD68<sup>+<\/sup>), cytotoxic T cells (CD3<sup>+<\/sup>, CD8<sup>+<\/sup>), and T helper cells (CD3<sup>+<\/sup>, CD4<sup>+<\/sup>) were significantly closer to the Pelareorep-primed MM than the non-primed MM.

Up to 90% of MM patients develop MBD during the course of their disease, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. MM therapy focuses primarily on agents that seek to eradicate the tumor cells and others which inhibit bone resorption. In contrast, no drugs are currently available to promote bone formation in MM patients and reverse MBD. Towards addressing this unmet therapeutic need, we applied a modified version of our &#8220;humanized&#8221; bone marrow (BM)-like scaffold (huBMsc)-based xenograft model, where MM cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) are co-implanted. In this system, we investigated the impact of MM cells on BMMSCs to identify markers that can be targeted with the intent to reverse MBD. After confirming that MM cells indeed inhibit bone formation in vivo, we performed transcriptional analysis of ex vivo expanded &#8220;unexposed&#8221; control BMMSCs vs. &#8220;MM-exposed&#8221; BMMSCs and found 332 differentially expressed genes. Next, we compared these data with transcriptional profiles of BMMSCs after in vitro differentiation towards osteoblasts, as well as publicly available data of transcriptional profiles of BMMSCs obtained from MM, ALL, and AML patients. Combined, this analysis identified 8, MM-specific, differentially expressed genes, including the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs), <i>ASPN<\/i>, <i>OGN<\/i> and <i>OMD<\/i>, that are 1) suppressed in the presence of MM (xenograft model and patient-derived BMMSCs); 2) induced during in vitro osteogenic differentiation; and 3) not dysregulated in BMMSCs in other hematological malignancies. As reported previously, we observed that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)6 can upregulate the expression of these SLRPs in BMMSCs, while inducing osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, incubation of MM cells with BMP6 in either mono- or co-cultures with stromal cell lines, resulted in reduced MM cell viability. In addition, pretreatment of BMMSCs with BMP6 completely abolished their support of MM proliferation. Interestingly, BMP6, in contrast to BMP2 and BMP4, did not induce, but inhibited receptor activator of nuclear kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-dependent osteoclast generation. Collectively, our analyses identify BMP6 as a master regulator that promotes osteogenic differentiation, inhibits RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis and can directly induce MM cell death. Therefore, by reshaping the BM microenvironment to become less tumor-supportive, BMP6 represents an attractive candidate for MM treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/02f1ba83-6ab7-4f1c-8dcd-d08b82fcfe72\/@y03B8ZTT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal stem cell,Bone,cancer-induced bone disease,Bone morphogenetic proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21512"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiaxian Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Baardemans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ricardo De Matos Simoes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Dashevsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huipin Yuan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joost D.

Recent studies have shown that DPP-4 inhibitor(DPP-4i) can either promote or suppress cancer progression. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unknown. Here, in this study, we investigated the effect of DPP-4i on tumor microenvironment and its effect on the prognosis of cancer patients.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We retrospectively examined the outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with T2DM who received curative surgery in Jichi Medical University Hospital and asked the impact of DPP-4i intake on their outcome.

Among them, 260 patients had T2DM at the time of surgery, and 135 patients had been treated with drugs including DPP-4i. The postoperative disease-free survival rate (DFS) was significantly worse in the DPP-4i intake group compared with non-intake group (5 year DFS 18.5% vs 5.4%, HR=2.0, p&#60;0.05). The number of Zeb1-positive tumor cells significantly increased in DPP-4i intake group. (Median(M)=29.0 (0-189)\/mm2 vs 9.0 (0-71)\/mm2, p&#60;0.01). The number of CD3 (+) TIL in DPP-4i intake group was Median(M)=277.4(min 121.6-max 523.2)\/mm2 which was significantly lower than those in non-intake group (M= 319.6, min 493.0-max 823.6\/mm2).

This regimen, however, does not lead to complete cure with median survival lasting less than two years. To increase patient survival, research focuses on repurposing common drugs to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming to increase delivery of nanoparticles, antibodies and other drug regimens and improve immunostimulation. These drugs, however, exhibit certain dose-limitations and are associated with adverse effects. Here, taking advantage of the TME reprogramming capabilities of the approved antihistamine drug tranilast, we developed polymeric tranilast-loaded nanoparticles and explored their potential to modulate the TME more efficiently than the free drug. The results were striking as the micellar formulation of tranilast administered in a dose 100 times lower than that of the free drug reported superior reprogramming effects in two syngeneic triple negative breast tumor models. These effects were due to the enhanced intratumoral accumulation and cancer-associated fibroblast uptake of the nanoparticles compared to the free drug. Tranilast micelles were also found to promote significantly the delivery and efficacy of epirubicin micelles, overcome immune checkpoint resistance and induce tumor immunogenicity. Overall, the proposed micelles improved the efficacy of nano-immunotherapy in both breast cancer tumor models leading to complete cure. Furthermore, we employed the non-invasive and clinically applied ultrasound shear wave elastography method to monitor changes in tumor stiffness, which is the first effect caused by the tranilast micelles, and thus to determine an optimal dose-scheduling. Importantly, we found that tumor stiffness before the initiation of nano-immunotherapy was able to predict the efficacy of the treatment providing strong evidence for the potential of shear wave elastography to be used as a biomarker predictive of response. Our findings are very encouraging indicating that a) encapsulation of TME modulating drugs improves their pharmacokinetic properties, while allows for drastic reduction in the dose of administration, b) modulation of the TME can lead to complete cures of nano-immunotherapy in resistant to this therapy breast cancer tumor models, and c) ultrasound shear wave elastography can be employed for optimizing the use of TME modulating agents and for the prediction of tumor response to nano-immunotherapy allowing for optimized treatment protocols.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1e20f840-537a-400a-ba3f-439acc1b98a6\/@y03B8ZTT\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Polymer drug conjugate,Immune checkpoint blockade,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21556"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Myrofora Panagi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fotios Mpekris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pengwen Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chrysovalantis Voutouri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuhiro Nakagawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John D.

Current treatments can be associated with severe side-effects or lack of efficacy yet prognostic biomarkers are limited, slowing efforts to personalize treatment in HPV+HNSCC. Here, we describe the use of a transcriptomic-based analytical platform to analyze expression patterns of viral transcripts, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and viral genome integration, and associate these features with overall survival.<br \/>Functional gene expression signatures were analyzed on publicly available HPV+HNSCC expression data (n=266). Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed 5 distinct and novel TME types across patients (immune-enriched non-fibrotic, immune-enriched fibrotic, fibrotic, immune-desert, immune-enriched luminal). These microenvironment subtypes were highly correlated with both overall survival and patient prognosis. Tumors with an immune-enriched microenvironment showed the highest survival rates, whereas fibrotic TME types were associated with poor survival (p &#60; 0.05). Unsupervised clustering of a HPV+HNSCC cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n=53), based on HPV transcript expression, revealed 4 HPV-related subtypes. Each subtype was enriched for distinct viral transcripts: E2\/E5, E6\/E7, E1\/E4 and L1\/L2. We then validated TME and HPV transcript-related classifications on an independent HPV+HNSCC cohort (n=132). Utilizing both viral transcript and TME subtypes, we found that the E2\/E5 HPV subtype was associated with an immune-enriched TME and had a higher overall survival compared to the other subtypes. The E2\/E5 subtype was also enriched for samples without HPV-genome integration, suggesting that HPV episomal DNA status and E2\/E5 expression pattern may drive an inflamed microenvironment and improved prognosis. In contrast, E6\/E7 subtype samples were associated with the fibrotic and depleted TME types, with lower values of T-cell and B-cell gene expression signatures and a lower survival rate. Both E1\/E4 and L1\/L2 subtypes were associated with the immune-enriched luminal TME types.<br \/>These findings suggest that HPV-transcript expression patterns may drive modulation of the TME, and hence impact prognosis. Further validation of the relationships between viral gene expression, TME, and prognosis is warranted to understand if such subtypes could aid in the development of prognostic biomarkers for treatment selection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Head and neck cancers,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21769"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Daria Kiriy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitry Tychinin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikita Kotlov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Kudryashova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anastasia Nikitina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrey Tyshevich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naira Samarina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ksenia Demina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandrine Degryse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan Raju Paul<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Poznansky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krystle Lang Kuhs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James S.
