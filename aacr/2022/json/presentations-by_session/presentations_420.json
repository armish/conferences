[{"Abstract":"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., disproportionally affecting African American (AA) men. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are administered to PCa patients and have been implicated in therapy resistance. This may be critical to AA men with PCa since they have elevated endogenous GCs levels compared to Caucasian American (CA) men. GCs bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to exert their actions. The mechanisms of GR-mediated chemoresistance, and its possible contribution to PCa mortality disparities are unknown. We demonstrated that GCs upregulate the chemoresistance-associated protein and transcription co-activator LEDGF\/p75 in PCa cells and identified consensus GR binding sites in the promoter region of this protein. Given that both GR and LEDGF\/p75 are components of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex, we hypothesized that GR transcriptionally upregulates LEDGF\/p75 and then interacts with it to enhance taxane resistance in PCa cells. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of GR in a panel of docetaxel (DTX)-sensitive and -resistant PCa cells decreased the expression of LEDGF\/p75, confirming its status as a candidate GR target gene. However, silencing of LEDGF\/p75 had no effects on GR expression. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that GR and LEDGF\/p75 interact in DTX-resistant PCa cells. This interaction was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Immunohistochemical analysis of GR and LEDGF\/p75 expression in normal and tumor prostate tissues was performed, and the results are currently being analyzed. Our studies use a mechanistic approach to evaluate the potential contribution of the GR-LEDGF\/p75 axis to PCa chemoresistance. Evaluating the co-expression of these proteins in racially diverse PCa tissues may also reveal race-related differential expression, providing insights into the potential contribution of this axis to PCa chemoresistance and mortality disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2b15bee0-b263-4306-99b9-bc2d1f875fe9\/@y03B8ZJJ\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Glucocorticoid receptor,Oncogene,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16225"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Evelyn S.

Despite an intense treatment regimen, the prognosis for high-risk neuroblastoma patients remains poor, with less than 40% survival. So far, MYCN status\/amplification is considered the most prognostic factor but corresponds to only 25% of neuroblastoma patients. Therefore, it is essential to identify a better prognosis and prediction marker of therapy response in neuroblastoma patients. The identification of master regulators with good prognostic and drug response abilities are not successful due to the complexity and lack of data-driven bioinformatic workflows. We applied robust bioinformatic data mining tools such as Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, <i>cisTarget<\/i>, and Single-Cell rEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering on three neuroblastoma patient datasets (n=1252). We found Sin3A Associated Protein 30 <i>(Sap30), <\/i>a driver transcription factor positively associated with high-risk, progression, stage 4, and poor survival in high-risk neuroblastoma patient cohorts. Tumors of high-risk neuroblastoma patients and relapse-specific patient-derived xenografts showed higher Sap30 levels. The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer, The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and CRISPR-Cas9 screens indicated that Sap30 essentiality is associated with Cisplatin resistance and further showed higher levels in Cisplatin resistant patient-derived xenograft tumor cell lines. The silencing of Sap30 in cells reduced cell growth, induced cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential loss<b> <\/b><i>in vitro,<\/i> and reduced tumorigenicity <i>in vivo<\/i>.

Currently, it is well documented that mechanisms driving PDAC progression involve epigenetic and transcriptional rewiring. Here we combined assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and enrichment for H3K27 acetylation chromatin immunoprecipitation (H3K27ac ChIP-seq) measures to explore the epigenetic landscape of different mouse primary pancreatic tumor (PPT) cell lines.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Kras-driven (n=36) and PI3K-driven PPT cell lines (n=9) were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco). DNA was extracted using manufacture protocols (Qiagen, MinElute PCR Purification Kit) then DNA libraries and high-throughput sequencing were performed. Bioinformatics analysis (ROSE2 Python script) was conducted on H3k27ac ChIP-seq data to define super-enhancer (SEs) and SE-associated genes. Then, ATAC-seq data was explored using Coltron Python package to distinguish enriched Transcription Factor (TF) motifs into SEs. Transcriptomic data was used to slim down the list of potential cis-regulatory elements. We developed knockout (ko) PPT cell lines using CRISPR\/CAS9 gene editing method to better characterize the role of Foxj1 as a novel potential master regulator in pancreatic cancer. Lastly, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for FOXJ1 was conducted on human PDAC cohort.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> By k-means clustering, we identified 463 SE-associated genes. Many of them are associated with Kras-driven (epithelial or mesenchymal) or PI3K-driven cell lines exclusively. Surprisingly, we found Foxj1 as SE-associated TF exclusively in PI3K-driven PPT cell lines. Consistent with the epigenetic data, transcriptomic analysis confirmed higher expression of Foxj1 in PI3K-driven PPT cell lines. Then, RNA-seq data revealed downregulation of predicted Foxj1 target genes and enhanced EMT and Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signatures in Foxj1 ko cells. These data suggest that epithelial properties of PDAC cells are stabilized by Foxj1 activity. Consistent with these results we detect a higher potential of TGF&#946; treatment to induce mesenchymal features in Foxj1 ko cells. Furthermore, overexpression of &#946;-catenin protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Enhanced Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling could be responsible for the higher proliferation of Foxj1 ko cells as revealed by proliferation assay. Finally, we investigated FOXJ1 protein level in our PDAC human cohort. Interestingly, we found high nuclear FOXJ1 expression in 23% of cases which is linked with better overall survival.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> In summary, our data revealed Foxj1 as a novel PDAC associated TF with the ability to reduce the cancer aggressiveness blocking epithelial to mesenchymal transition and &#946;-catenin activity elucidating the better prognosis into the FOXJ1 high expressed patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b01c0233-808b-4d7e-ac02-4a3949a7d1c2\/@z03B8ZJK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Foxj1,Super Enhancer,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16228"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrea Terrasi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Swathi Subramanian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Klement<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sruthi Ramesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heike Bollig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Falcomatà<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Steiger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rupert Öllinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dieter Saur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roland Rad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maximilian Reichert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Günter Schneider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gunnar Schotta<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is however not yet very clear what drives and sustains the growth of pancreatic cancer cells under an adverse hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Previously we reported that MYB was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells and supported the tumorigenicity and metastatic progression of pancreatic cancer cells. Here, we examined the role of MYB in hypoxic survival of pancreatic cancer cells. We found that the silencing of MYB expression in pancreatic cancer cells severely reduced their growth under hypoxia whereas its forced overexpression promoted hypoxic survival. We also observed that MYB was upregulated under hypoxia and its silencing was associated with a reduced accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 &#945; (HIF1&#945;). Additionally, we confirmed HIF1&#945; as a direct transcriptional target of MYB and its transcripts level and promoter activity correlated positively with MYB expression under both normoxia and hypoxia. Interestingly, restoration of HIF1&#945; expression in MYB-silenced cells was not sufficient to rescue their survival under hypoxia. MYB knockdown pancreatic cancer cells failed to optimally reprogram their metabolism under hypoxia to meet their energetic and biosynthetic demands despite restored HIF1&#945; overexpression. Specifically, MYB knockdown cells exhibited a large decrease in intracellular glucose and several metabolic intermediates of glycolysis, TCA cycle, and amino acid metabolism, whereas glycogenolysis and pentose phosphate pathway metabolites were increased. MYB silencing also altered the expression of several metabolic genes, including established hypoxia-responsive gene targets. MYB co-occupied the promoter regions of GLUT3, HK2, PFKL, ENO2, and MCT4 with HIF1&#945; and its silencing reduced HIF1&#945; binding to these promoters despite its forced overexpression. We also confirmed MYB interaction with HIF1&#945; and p300 and demonstrated enhanced recruitment of p300 to these gene promoters in MYB-overexpressing pancreatic cancer cells. Altogether, our studies suggest that MYB acts as major regulator of metabolic reprogramming and HIF1&#945; signaling and thus acts as an important driver of hypoxic survival of pancreatic cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/beae0be4-8adb-41e4-ae5b-cb5412fe8795\/@z03B8ZJK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Hypoxia,Metabolism,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16229"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shashi Anand<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammad Aslam Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haseeb Zubair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarabjeet Kour Sudan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kunwar Somesh Vikramdeo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sachin Kumar Deshmukh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shafquat Azim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjeev Kumar Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seema Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Pratap Singh<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is also the second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men. Androgen signaling plays a central role in prostate cancer development but results in growth inhibition at high doses. Mechanisms underlying such biphasic effect of androgens are not well understood. We recently identified MYB as an aberrantly expressed gene in prostate cancer cells, which promoted their growth and aggressive behavior. We also observed that MYB induced ligand-independent activation of androgen receptor (AR) and influenced its binding to selective target genes to promote castration-resistance. The goal of the present study was to examine the regulatory crosstalk between MYB and AR in prostate cancer cells. We observed that while MYB had no significant effect on AR expression, androgen (dihydrotestosterone, DHT) treatment resulted in a dose-dependent biphasic regulation of MYB at both transcript and protein levels correlating with its effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, we observed that the treatment of prostate cancer cells with either low (1 nM) or high (100 nM) doses of DHT enhanced the transcriptional activity of MYB promoter. <i>In silico<\/i> analysis identified two potential androgen-responsive elements (AREs) in MYB promoter and AR bound more efficiently to the proximal sequence as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). In a time-course experiment, we observed that both low and high doses of DHT increased MYB transcript and protein levels at early time points, which decreased sharply after 12 h in high dose DHT-treated prostate cancer cells. RNA stability assay following treatment with actinomycin D (inhibitor of transcription) showed decreased MYB mRNA half-life in prostate cancer cells at late time points when treated with high dose DHT. Profiling of MYB-targeted miRNAs showed significantly greater induction of miR-150 in high-dose DHT-treated prostate cancer cells than those treated with low-dose DHT. Two AREs were predicted in the 1000 bp upstream sequence of miR-150 transcription start site and AR binding was confirmed by ChIP assay. Functional inhibition of miR-150 using anti-miR relieved MYB suppression by high-dose DHT and promoted the growth of prostate cancer cells. Further, transfection of prostate cancer cells by miR-150 mimic reduced endogenous MYB levels and led to repression of growth of prostate cancer cells. Overall, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of MYB regulation that mediates, at least in part, the biphasic effect of androgens on the growth of prostate cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/065ce7ef-59bc-423a-9ff4-e73fb0a2fa5b\/@z03B8ZJK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Transcriptional regulation,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16232"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Srijan Acharya<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shashi Anand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammad Aslam Khan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haseeb Zubair<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjeev Kumar Srivastava<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seema Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ajay Pratap Singh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite recent advances in detection and therapeutics, patients with breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) survive only 6-18 months after diagnosis. HER2-enriched breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes have the highest propensity to metastasize to the brain. Mechanisms that drive BCBM remain unclear, contributing to limited effective treatments and poor prognoses for HER2-enriched breast cancer and TNBC patients. Truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (tGLI1), a gain-of-function GLI1 transcription factor discovered in our lab, promotes BCBM of circulating tumor cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. We previously reported that tGLI1 enriches the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) subpopulation, and that tGLI1-positive BCSCs strongly activate astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the brain. The mechanisms by which tGLI1-activated astrocytes promote BCBM have not been investigated. Since tumor-associated astrocytes have been reported to secrete specific cytokines, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), to activate astrocytes and cancer cells by binding to IL-6R and CNTF receptor-alpha (CNTFR&#945;), we determined whether astrocytes activated by tGLI1-positive breast cancer cells secrete elevated levels of CNTF. Results of CNTF ELISA revealed that conditioned media from tGLI1-positive breast cancer cells increases the ability of astrocytes to secrete CNTF compared to GLI1-positive or control cells. Furthermore, we found that exogenous CNTF significantly activates astrocytes and promotes BCSCs, important mediators of tumor progression and metastasis in breast cancer. Analysis of patient datasets reveals CNTFR&#945; is more highly expressed in brain metastases compared to breast cancer and normal breast tissues, suggesting that CNTF secreted by activated astrocytes can promote the growth of BCSCs in the brain. We further found that CNTF and CNTFR&#945; gene signatures are significantly associated with worse brain metastasis-free survival, suggesting an important role for the tGLI1-CNTF-CNTFR&#945; pathway in BCBM development. In summary, our study demonstrates for the first time that astrocytes activated by tGLI1-expressing BCBM secrete CNTF, CNTF further activates astrocytes and promotes BCSCs, and that this tumor-astrocyte interaction could be a novel mechanism for BCBM development and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f7f068e-1afa-4e0f-8ebb-06419273ba62\/@z03B8ZJK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Brain metastasis,Cancer stem cells,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16233"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Grace L.

Tumors with t(2;13) are associated with greater disease severity and mortality than t(1;13) positive or translocation negative patients. We demonstrated that ARMS tumor samples contain intratumoral genetic heterogeneity with respect to the presence of t(2;13). Further, we demonstrated that this heterogeneity had an inverse correlation with tumor aggressiveness, with tumors containing higher translocation positivity having lower failure-free survival of patients. However, it is not yet known whether a correlation exists between percent t(2;13) positivity and changes in gene expression, in particular genes whose function contributes to immune invasion in the tumor microenvironment. Of fifty-five rhabdomyosarcoma patient tumor samples received from Children&#8217;s Hospital in New Orleans, nine were confirmed to contain t(2;13) ranging from 16 - 98% cells positive for the translocation. We used aged-matched normal muscle tissue derived from autopsies as a control. RNA was isolated from whole tissue samples and analyzed using the Nanostring nCounter&#174;&#65039; PanCancer IO 360&#8482; Panel. This panel contains 770 genes that specifically analyze tumor immunogenicity, tumor sensitivity to immune attack, inhibitory immune mechanisms, stromal factors, inhibitory metabolism, anti-tumor immune activity, inhibitory immune signaling, immune cell population and abundance, and tumor inflammation. We found 487 genes have an average change in expression &#8805; 1.5-fold relative to the control. Of these genes 31 (6.4%) have a statistically significant positive correlation and nearly 25% (114 genes) had a statistically significant negative correlation to percent intratumoral translocation positivity. A closer examination indicated that genes with a negative correlation had biological functions that target a variety of different immunological processes. These include the recognition of antigen by T cells; the activation, maturation, and differentiation of lymphocytes and myeloid cells; adhesion of immune responsive cells; promotion of the inflammatory response; and activation of the innate immune response. These results suggest that increased intratumoral t(2;13) positivity negatively impacts the immunological response thereby increasing the ability for immune evasion of the tumors with higher levels of the translocation, a result consistent with our previously published work.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Immunosuppression,Translocation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16234"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew D.

CCS is a translocation-driven sarcoma subtype meaning a genetic fusion event defines and drives the malignancy. The chromosomal translocation occurring between <i>EWSR1 <\/i>on chromosome 22 and <i>ATF1<\/i> on chromosome 12 results in the <i>EWSR1<\/i>-<i>ATF1<\/i> fusion oncogene (hereafter abbreviated <i>EA1<\/i>) which drives more than 90% of CCS cases. The EA1 oncoprotein is a transcription factor that reprograms gene expression to drive CCS. However, the target genes of EA1 and how EA1 affects target gene expression levels are largely unknown. Elucidation of these effectors is critical in order to understand how the EA1 oncoprotein drives the epigenetic reprogramming in CCS. We utilized a robust mouse model that recapitulates CCS in which mice express TATCre-inducible <i>EA1<\/i>. Using CCS tumors that form in these mice, ChIP-sequencing identified where EA1 is binding along the genome. Analysis in combination with RNA-sequencing data revealed target genes that are bound by EA1 and either upregulated or downregulated compared to control tissue. Target gene expression levels were corroborated in a human context by RNA-sequencing of human tumors and a CCS human cell line. RNAi knockdown of EA1 in the human cell line confirmed functionality of the fusion protein at these target genes. We show that EA1 can bind at promoter regions to directly regulate transcription of target genes. These binding sites include the canonical ATF binding motif. The EA1 target genes overlap with known wildtype ATF1 target genes. Many upregulated genes are involved in cell cycle and proliferation as expected. Alternatively, EA1 can bind intergenic regions including H3K27ac-defined super enhancers to distally regulate target genes. These binding sites contain unique DNA motifs that are different from the canonical ATF binding motif by 1 base pair. One highly recurrent motif identified matches the motif of the AP1 complex, a putative co-factor that may be functioning with EA1. These so-called variant motifs appear to define enhancer regions where EA1 can bind along with AP1. In summary, EA1 binds the expected ATF motif at promoter regions to directly regulate target gene expression. Secondly, EA1 binds intergenic enhancer regions defined by variant motifs including the AP1 motif. Target genes can either be upregulated or downregulated by the fusion, suggesting that there are secondary epigenetic mechanisms. One such model involves differential co-factor composition, such as AP1 co-binding, that dictates where EA1 binds or subsequent transcriptional effects. This research sets up the foundation for how EA1 functions as a transcription factor including the distribution of EA1 across the genome, the motifs that EA1 binds, and the key genes that are regulated by EA1. These epigenetic findings are crucial to understanding how a powerful fusion oncoprotein drives this aggressive, under-studied malignancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/218238c3-9ad8-41a8-bbac-9b616dd4e6b8\/@z03B8ZJK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Epigenomics,Fusion genes,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16236"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"245ba5f5-db5c-457e-90a4-91056bf23e58","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/245ba5f5-db5c-457e-90a4-91056bf23e58\/@z03B8ZJK\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin B.

Metastatic CRPC remains incurable, and the most potent new drugs prolong survival by only a few months. There is an urgent need for novel agents against advanced CRPC. CDK8 and CDK19 are two isoforms of Mediator kinase, which regulates transcriptional reprogramming, a key process in cancer development, metastasis, and drug resistance. Bioinformatic analysis of clinical prostate cancers shows that CDK19 expression increases during PCa development and progression reaching higher levels than in any other cancers, whereas CDK8 expression increases when PCa becomes CRPC. We have investigated the effects of CDK8\/19 Mediator kinase inhibition on gene expression and tumor growth in several CPRC tumor models, growing subcutaneously or in the bone, the principal cause of PCa lethality. CDK8\/19 inhibition decreased androgen-stimulated expression of the most strongly androgen-regulated genes, including PSA, in androgen-responsive PCa <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. CRISPR knockout of both CDK8 and CDK19 in 22Rv1 CRPC cells that express both full-length AR and its androgen-independent V7 variant, had little effect on the tumor growth in intact male mice but strongly suppressed tumor growth in castrated animals. Moreover, re-expression of CDK19 but not of its kinase-dead mutant partially restored tumor growth in castrated mice. Similarly, SNX631, a selective CDK8\/19 inhibitor, had little effect on 22Rv1 growth in intact mice but strongly suppressed the growth of these cells (but not of their knockout derivative) in castrated mice. Prolonged (up to 300 days) treatment with SNX631 induced tumor shrinkage and disappearance in a subset of 22Rv1 tumors grown in castrated animals. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CDK8\/19 inhibition or knockout suppressed castration-induced transcriptional reprogramming in tumor cells and affected stromal gene expression. SNX631 also inhibited the growth of a CRPC PDX derived from a PCa patient who failed casodex, abiraterone, and docetaxel, in castrated mice. SNX631 also significantly inhibited <i>in vivo<\/i> growth of AR-negative PC3 cells both in the flank and in the bone, the principal metastatic site of PCa. These results warrant the development of CDK8\/19 inhibitors for the presently incurable metastatic CRPC.

Because of the increasing incidence of melanoma and its resistance to many therapies, insights into melanoma progression are needed. FOXC2, a member of the forkhead box family of transcription factors, has been shown to have oncogenic activity in many epithelial cancer types, and we have recently reported a role for FOXC2 in melanoma progression as well. To gain insight into the role of FOXC2 in melanoma progression, we analyzed publicly available RNA-sequencing data from tumor biopsies of melanoma patients, including a cohort of 479 patients catalogued in The Cancer Genome Atlas as well as additional cohorts from other independent studies. We performed Spearman correlation analyses to identify genes positively and negatively co-expressed with FOXC2, and we performed Impact Pathway Analysis and Gene Ontology Analysis to determine which biological pathways and processes are most impacted by FOXC2-associated genes in melanoma.

Compared to other cancers, PDAC is remarkable for its relatively uniform set of DNA alterations; unfortunately, these hallmark events are not currently targetable and other mutations known to confer sensitivity to specific drugs are uncommon. Consequently, cytotoxic combinations remain the standard of care, with most patients quickly exhibiting primary or secondary chemoresistance.<br \/>Previous studies have shown that transcriptional regulatory proteins can form small, highly interconnected and autoregulated modules that can initiate and maintain malignant tumor cell state, and that the Master Regulator (MR) protein they comprise represent a novel class of non-oncogene dependencies. We used the VIPER algorithm to identify MR proteins representing mechanistic regulators of the transcriptional state for 200 laser microdissected PDAC epithelial compartment samples, collected at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC).<br \/>To systematically identify synergistic pairs of MRs, we designed a combinatorial CRISPR-Cas9 screen based on the Big Papi dual SaCas9\/SpCas9 system which was used to systematically target all possible pairs of the top 50 MRs identified by VIPER analysis across 6 PDAC cell lines (KP4, PATU8988S, PANC1, HPAFII, BXPC3, MIAPACA2) with three guide-RNAs per gene, thus differentiating between potentially idiosyncratic, cell line-specific and highly conserved genetic interactions.<br \/>We also developed a novel nonparametric statistical method for inferring genetic interactions from this data based on the use of conditional Mann-Whitney U tests; our new analytical method significantly improved over a previously developed parametric model of synergy inference, demonstrating increased correlation between genetic interactions inferred from biological replicates of the same cell line while simultaneously prioritizing four established synthetic lethal gene pairs in the top 10 gene pairs following integration across all 6 cell lines: BCL2L1-MCL1, BCL2L1-BCL2L2, MAPK1-MAPK3, and SEC23A-SEC23B. The methods also identified 314 additional highly significant (FDR &#60; 0.05), yet never previously reported synthetic lethal interactions that are being validated using an array-based, low-throughput screening platform. We expect that the results of this screen will help elucidate mechanisms controlling the state of PDAC tumor cells and identify potentially druggable gene pairs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/94f8dcc7-56b6-445d-8479-3b5edbe99448\/@z03B8ZJK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Systems biology,Synthetic lethality,CRISPR\/Cas9,High-content screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16239"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aaron T.

SCLC is treated as a clinically homogenous disease, but evidence of its intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity is increasing. This is partly attributed to expression of neurogenic transcription factors (TFs) <i>ASCL1 <\/i>and <i>NEUROD1,<\/i> which correlate with SCLC pathogenesis and NE status, and are now included in a consensus for SCLC classification<sup>1<\/sup>. Our Circulating tumor cell patient Derived eXplant (CDX) models recapitulate disease heterogeneity in terms of neurogenic TF expression; furthermore, we recently identified a previously unrecognized subset within our CDX biobank expressing another neurogenic TF, <i>ATOH1<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>. ATOH1 function has been inferred from mouse embryonic and neonatal developmental mouse models, where Atoh1 governs the formation of cerebellar granule cells, auditory hair cells and Merkel cells. In human settings, ATOH1 reprograms pluripotent stem cells to a neuronal lineage and has context-dependent activity in cancer, being considered an oncogene in medulloblastoma and a tumor suppressor in the intestine<sup>3<\/sup>. I am investigating the role of ATOH1 in SCLC, to refine disease classification and explore new therapeutic approaches stratified to SCLC phenotypes. To interrogate the role of ATOH1 in SCLC, we developed an in-house antibody and established stable SCLC CDX and cell lines in which ATOH1 can be inducibly depleted<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. To understand the transcriptional profile mediated by ATOH1, we performed ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq in ATOH1-competent and depleted cells and integrated the datasets to infer ATOH1 direct transcriptional targets.<b><\/b> In concordance with its role in development, ATOH1 direct transcriptional targets are enriched for processes regulating neurogenesis and inner ear hair cell differentiation. ATOH1 depletion <i>in vitro<\/i> in CDX17P resulted in elevated expression of Non-NE marker genes and NE to Non-NE phenotype transition, confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis, which implicated a possible role for ATOH1 in regulating neuroendocrine plasticity in SCLC. ATOH1 depletion resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis-independent cell death (p &#60; 0.003), and whilst ATOH1 depletion did not affect cell proliferation in CDX17P, there was decreased S-phase progression in CDX30 and HCC33 cells. Depletion of ATOH1 in CDX17P <i>In vivo<\/i> did result in slower tumor growth and further studies will investigate the impact of ATOH1 on cell death, proliferation and NE to Non-NE transition <i>in vivo<\/i>.<b><\/b> In summary, we have characterized a rare subset of SCLC expressing ATOH1 and found that ATOH1 is necessary for cell survival <i>in vitro<\/i> and ablation of ATOH1 slows tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Ongoing studies focus on investigating possible therapeutic approaches to modulate ATOH1 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d63b1f6c-e8bd-403e-896f-0decbbd083b9\/@z03B8ZJK\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Tumor biology,Drug sensitivity,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16240"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alessia Catozzi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitchell Revill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Roebuck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Humphrey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie Galvin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fiona Blackhall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathryn Simpson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alastair Kerr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristopher Frese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Dive<\/i><\/presenter>.

Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) typically have increased metastasis, decreased response to therapies, and poor outcomes, <b>highlighting MYC&#8217;s causal association with disease aggressiveness and low survival rates.<\/b> Unfortunately, MYC is not considered directly pharmacologically tractable. Therefore, we sought to identify collateral &#8220;genetic dependencies,&#8221; downstream of oncogenic MYC. Using comparative genome-scale CRISPR\/Cas9 screening in isogenic human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), we have identified two mitochondrial membrane transporter genes, <i>TIMM17A <\/i>and <i>MTCH2, <\/i>specifically required for MYC-dependent proliferation and survival.<br \/>Since MYC is suspected to drive metabolic reprogramming in cancers, we assessed how MYC affected mitochondrial protein content by quantitative mass spectrometry. This revealed an increase in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in HMECs with <i>MYC <\/i>amplification compared to other genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, increased NAA levels are dependent on <i>TIMM17A<\/i> and <i>MTCH2<\/i> presence. Loss of either of these genes results in cell death coupled with decreased NAA. NAA supplementation in the media of <i>MYC<\/i>-HMECs following loss of <i>TIMM17A <\/i>or <i>MTCH2 <\/i>can rescue the cell death. Importantly, NAA supplementation in cells with guides targeting <i>GFP <\/i>(negative control) or general essential gene <i>RPL11 <\/i>did not show increased cell growth\/viability - showing that the NAA supplementation is specifically compensating for loss of mitochondrial transport function in <i>MYC-<\/i>HMECs.<br \/>Based on these data, it appears that <b><i>MYC<\/i>-amplified TNBCs are uniquely dependent on <i>TIMM17A <\/i>and <i>MTCH2 <\/i>mitochondrial transporter function because they drive metabolic reprogramming resulting in addiction to N-acetylaspartate production. <\/b>To conclude these studies, we are evaluating the dependence on mitochondrial transport and NAA synthesis in <i>MYC<\/i>-amplified TNBCs by assessing the function of <i>TIMM17A <\/i>and <i>MTCH2 <\/i>as <i>MYC<\/i>-specific genetic dependencies in patient derived xenografts of TNBC and determining if TNBCs are addicted to increased NAA synthesis by overexpressing aspartoacylase to breakdown NAA.

One common way that this occurs is through chromosomal translocations such as the the t(2;13)(q35;q14), which creates the oncogenic transcription factor, PAX3-FOXO1, in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS). Identification of the direct transcriptional targets and mechanisms of control by translocated transcription factors is critical to our understanding of disease etiology and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. However, defining the genes directly controlled by DNA binding proteins and the mechanisms of regulation at those direct target genes is challenging, because traditional genetic approaches to inactivate transcription factors cannot distinguish direct from indirect changes in gene expression.<br \/>Methods: A CRISPR-based approach was used to engineer the endogenous <i>PAX3-FOXO1<\/i> locus to incorporate the FKBP12<sup>F36V<\/sup> degron tag. This allowed degradation of PAX3-FOXO1 within 2 hr of treatment with the proteolysis targeting chimera, dTAG-47. We performed short time courses to analyze nascent transcription (precision nuclear run-on sequencing; PRO-seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), and genome-wide mapping of transcriptional complexes (CUT&#38;RUN). This identified a small cohort of high-confidence PAX3-FOXO1 gene targets and associated PAX3-FOXO1-regulated enhancer elements. In addition, we used CRISPR editing to add APEX2 and 3XFLAG tags to PAX3-FOXO1 to enable deep proteomics to identify PAX3-FOXO1-associated transcriptional complexes in aRMS cell lines.<br \/>Results: Degradation of PAX3-FOXO1-FKBP12<sup>F36V<\/sup> led to growth inhibition, hallmarks of myogenic differentiation, and reduced growth in soft agar. PAX3-FOXO1 binding was detected at over 44,000 sites throughout the genome using CUT&#38;RUN, and loss of chromatin bound PAX3-FOXO1 was observed within 2-4hr of PAX3-FOXO1 degradation. PRO-seq analysis defined a core transcriptional network that rapidly collapsed upon PAX3-FOXO1 degradation.<br \/>Unexpectedly, loss of PAX3-FOXO1 impaired RNA polymerase pause release and transcription elongation at regulated gene targets. Deep proteomic analysis showed that PAX3-FOXO1 was in close proximity to many transcriptional regulatory complexes, but appeared to coordinate the activity of these complexes at only a few hundred sites. Moreover, the continued presence of PAX3-FOXO1 at these elements was required to maintain chromatin accessibility.<br \/>Conclusion: This work demonstrates the utility of using rapid degradation of endogenous transcription factors to define their direct transcription targets and the mechanisms by which these factors control gene expression. Overall, this work provides a detailed mechanism by which PAX3-FOXO1 maintains an oncogenic transcriptional regulatory network, and emphasizes the utility of PAX3-FOXO1 as a therapeutic target in aRMS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b6c83676-f5fc-4cf7-9a85-02956f4f4781\/@A03B8ZJL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Transcription factor,Chromatin remodeling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16242"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susu Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hayes McDonald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Monica Bomber<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hillary Layden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Ellis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Borinstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Hiebert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristy Stengel<\/i><\/presenter>.

Breast cancer patients with brain metastasis have a poor prognosis, with a median survival time of less than 1 year despite treatment. Decreasing the prevalence of brain metastasis would improve the overall prognosis of patients. We previously built a novel mouse model of breast cancer brain metastasis by intracardiac injection of the MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer cell line) cells in mice. The brain colonizing counterpart of the parental cells primarily metastasizes to the brain, which is called the MDA-MB-231Br cell line. We have also shown that keratin 18 (an epithelial marker) plays a crucial role in the brain metastasis process as the MDA-MB-231Br cells have lower expression of the keratin 18 gene compared to their parental MDA-MBA-231 cells. Therefore, it is important to understand the transcriptional control of the keratin 18 gene, in order to fully understand the role of keratin 18 in regulating brain metastasis of breast cancer. We hypothesize that keratin 18 gene expression differs between these two cell lines due to the differential occupation of the gene by transcription factors such as Fli-1 or ETS-1. In this study, we analyzed the pattern of chromatin occupation of transcription factors ETS-1 and Fli-1 to determine whether they are responsible for the altered expression of the keratin 18 gene in MDA-MB-231Br cells.The Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using the Pierce Magnetic ChIP Kit to analyze the presence of transcription factors Fli-1 and ETS-1 with enzymatic and mechanical shearing combined. The ChIP Kit included the positive control anti-RNA Polymerase II Antibody and GAPDH control primers. We optimized the experimental conditions including ChIP analysis for MDA-MB-231Br cells, detection of expected positive control results, and sonication settings to break apart the chromatin. We measured the ChIP mediated enrichment of the intron 1 region of the keratin 18 gene, as the DNA is hypermethylated in this region in MDA-MB-231Br cells. The primers were designed and used as follows: forward: 5&#8242;-GATCATCGAGGACCTGAGGG-3&#8242; and reverse: 5&#8242;-GGGGAGCAGATCCTTCTTAGC-3&#8242;. Our results indicated that an ETS transcription factor occupies intron 1 of the keratin 18 gene in the MDA-MB-231Br cells, also showing that ChIP is an effective method to examine transcription factor binding. For future studies, we plan to perform similar experiments with the parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Then a quantitative PCR will be used to measure DNA binding sites of the transcription factors and determine if there is a significant difference in the level of chromatin occupation between the regular and brain-colonizing breast cancer cells. Our studies are necessary to understand the role of the keratin 18 gene in regulating tumor metastasis at the molecular level.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9aa4d421-9f69-4675-b265-acdf7086923b\/@A03B8ZJL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-03 Mechanisms of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Mouse models,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16247"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anissa Elice Johnson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sagardeep Singh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Lockman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tuoen Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabor Szalai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Adaptor protein ABI1 is a tumor suppressor in PCa as evidenced by its loss or downregulation in high grade and metastatic tumors. STAT3 activation is a hallmark of high-risk prostate tumors. ABI1 loss is associated with STAT3 activation leading to transcriptional reprogramming and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) of prostate cancer cells (Nath, Li <i>et al.<\/i> 2019 <i>Cell Commun Signal<\/i>). EMT changes involve several homeobox transcription factors. The fact that ABI1 contains a homeobox homology region (HHR) suggested the possibility that it plays a role in EMT through directly regulating transcriptional activity by DNA binding.<br \/>Methods: To examine this hypothesis we set out to analyze ABI1-DNA binding. We purified ABI1 HHR and demonstrated its <i>in vitro<\/i> interactions with different homeobox DNA-binding consensus of double-stranded DNA sequences. We created DU145 ABI1 CRISPR KO cell line and rescue ABI1 expression using retroviral transfection with either ABI1 wild type or Abi1 HHR mutants. DU145 cell lines STAT3 cellular localization was studied by Immunofluorescence staining and the STAT3 transcription activities was studied by Firefly Luciferase Assays with STAT3 specific luciferase reporter plasmid.<br \/>Results: We found that the presence of alternatively spliced Exon 4-encoded sequence, located in the C-terminus of HHR, regulates binding of ABI1 to DNA. Structural NMR studies confirmed ABI1 binding to DNA. Subsequent functional studies using DU145 CRISPR KO cell lines expressing wild type or HHR mutants of ABI1 demonstrated that HHR regulates the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of STAT3.<br \/>Conclusion: We propose that ABI1 is a critical regulator of STAT3 activity during prostate cancer progression by the ABI1 HHR mediated DNA binding mechanism.<br \/>Funding resources: NCI R01 CA161018; R21 CA260381<br \/>Conflicts of Interest Disclosure Statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/385d91cb-f0c3-4777-b435-092d9f1381c5\/@A03B8ZJL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Tumor suppressor,DNA binding,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16248"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baylee Porter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allysa Kemraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alaji Bah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcin Kortylewski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Leszek Kotula<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

TP53 is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in cancer, with mutations in this gene occurring in nearly 50% of all cancer cases. Once mutated, p53 loses its tumor suppressive function while simultaneously gaining oncogenic function. One of the functions that mutant p53 loses is the ability to directly bind to chromatin, however, it has been reported that mutant p53 can still affect the transcriptome of cancer cells via interactions with other transcription factors. One of these interacting partners is ETS2. ETS2 belongs to the ETS transcription factor family, which has 28 family members. This family is characterized by their affinity for an ETS binding site (EBS). EBS&#8217;s are present in 50% of all mutant p53 occupied promoters. Other ETS family members have also been linked to mutant p53 but these interactions have either been deemed as weak (ETS1) or have yet to be identified as direct (ERG). To determine which ETS proteins interact with mutant p53 I conducted affinity pull-down assays using purified ETS proteins and purified mutants of p53. My data shows that several ETS proteins interact with mutant p53 better than ETS2. I then sought to determine which residues are important for this interaction through truncation studies in which I used purified truncations of ETS proteins and purified mutants of p53. I found that ERG, one protein that strongly interacted with mutant p53, had two interaction interfaces. This may explain why the interaction is strong. My next step was to determine which ETS proteins are responsible for the targeting of mutant p53 to the genome. To address the requirement for ETS to recruit mutant p53 to chromatin I performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing studies in the presence or absence of different ETS factors to determine differences in mutant p53 binding. For these studies I knocked down ETS2 or ERG prior to performing p53 ChIP-Seq to determine differences in p53 binding to chromatin under these conditions. My analyses of these data indicate that each of the conditions resulted in different p53 binding patterns in the ChIP-Seq and that there is a requirement for ETS in mutant p53 binding.My studies have demonstrated that ETS proteins interact with mutant p53 and that this interaction seems to be required for mutant p53 binding to the genome. My future work will test phenotypes related to ETS\/mutant p53 interactions. Ultimately, if ETS\/mutant p53 interactions are deemed important for oncogenic function, these will be attractive targets for future drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1feafc13-178f-4179-b774-2e53a53e5a69\/@A03B8ZJL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,ETS transcription factors,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16249"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephanie Metcalf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stevie Morris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Hollenhorst<\/i><\/presenter>.

Ref-1 and its transcriptional targets are highly active in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) which often presents with tumor metastasis and therapy resistance. The redox activity of Ref-1 is determined by the redox status of the relevant cysteine residues (Cys), particularly Cys residue 65 (C65), which is critical among seven Cys residues for Ref-1&#8217;s redox activity. Using CRISPR editing in PDAC cells, we changed the C65 to Ala (C65A) in Ref-1 to evaluate the effects of loss of Ref-1 redox activity on cell signaling pathways and how Ref-1 activity regulates critical transcription factors. Using Ref-1 redox inhibitor, APX3330, we previously investigated interactions between Ref-1 and APX3330 in a cell-free system in which Ref-1 underwent conformational changes in the presence of APX3330. This resulted in complete exposure of all seven Cys residues causing oxidation of the Ref-1 protein and redox signaling inactivity. However, how these events translate in the cell has not been completely established. Using a gel-based mobility shift assay, we examined the redox-modified Cys residues of Ref-1 in response to APX3330 in PDAC cell lines over time. We observed a gradual increase in labeling of Cys in Ref-1 following APX3330 treatment between 10min to 6h which returned to control levels at 48h in both wild-type control (Cas9) and C65A-expressing cells. This reduction in the redox status of Ref-1 was likely due to unfolding alteration like the cell-free system. To confirm this, both cell lines were treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prior to cell lysing, which blocks free thiols in the protein. We detected dramatic decreases in reduced forms of Ref-1 after APX3330 treatment (between 10min-6h) in both cell lines, demonstrating that C65 is not essential for the unfolded conformational changes of Ref-1. However, C65A-Ref-1 protein demonstrated a distinctly different redox pattern upon APX3330 treatment in comparison to WT Ref-1 in the Cas9 control line. C65A-expressing cells also had reduced mitochondrial function compared to Cas9 control PDAC cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies demonstrated significant reduction in tumor size, weight, and growth in C65A PDAC cells compared to the Cas9 control lines, further demonstrating the critical role of C65 in the Ref-1 redox signaling and downstream pathways including metabolism and proliferation. In conclusion, we demonstrate direct interactions between Ref-1 and APX3330 in PDAC cells and subsequent biological results confirm a critical involvement of Ref-1-C65 in the redox signaling and tumor phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/291c63e4-cb8d-4265-8675-012fb6d2bd87\/@A03B8ZJL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Ref-1\/APE1,APX3330,Protein redox status,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16250"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mahmut Mijit<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivia Babb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Silpa Gampala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Randall Wireman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Millie M.

Therapies for advanced PCa primarily target the androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, which is a key driver of PCa tumor growth. Our previous research demonstrated that ABI1 acts as a tumor suppressor in PCa. ABI1 is a scaffold protein for the WAVE Regulatory Complex, positively regulates cell adhesion, and inhibits integrin activation through sequestering key kinases. We have observed a physical interaction between AR and ABI1. In this study, we aim to characterize the ABI1-dependent AR regulation in PCa.<br \/>Method: We generated an ABI1 KO cell line model in LNCaP cells using CRISPR-Cas9. We then used mutagenesis to develop ABI1 binding mutants (W485N and &#8710;SH3) and generated ABI1 rescue cell lines in ABI1-KO. We performed qPCR, co-immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, western blotting,<i> in vitro<\/i> assay, live-cell imaging, and PLA. We purified both AR and ABI1 proteins for <i>in vitro<\/i> analysis, performed turbidity and liquid-liquid droplet formation assays under DIC.<br \/>Results: <i>In cellulo<\/i> binding assays indicate interaction of AR-NTD with the ABI1-SH3 domain. Expression of ABI1-W485N in KO cell line showed decreased binding, while ABI1-&#8710;SH3 showed no observable binding to AR in co-IP assays compared to wildtype control. We then performed subcellular fractionation assays and saw decreased AR nuclear localization compared to ABI1-WT control. Decreased nuclear localization in ABI1-W485N was associated with decreased mRNA expression of hallmark AR target genes, <i>KLK3 and FKBP5<\/i>. <i>In vitro<\/i> turbidity assays indicated the conditions in which AR and ABI1 have propensity to phase separate. We then performed a liquid-liquid droplet assay. AR and ABI1 formed liquid-liquid droplets individually. We labeled ABI1 with Alexaflour 488 and saw that ABI1 was recruited to AR droplets indicating that AR and ABI1 can co-phase separate. PLA assays <i>in cellulo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> patient tumor samples showed positive interactions of AR-ABI1 in the nucleus. We then used live-cell observation and saw co-localization of biomolecular condensates for AR and ABI1.<br \/>Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that ABI1 plays a role in AR transcriptional pathway. Loss of ABI1 resulted in decreased nuclear AR and subsequent decrease in mRNA expression of AR target genes. Due to the intrinsically disordered structure of AR and ABI1, they were both able to phase separate individually as well as together. AR stimulation increased PLA interactions in nucleus of cells. The co-localization of AR and ABI1 in biomolecular condensates was changed upon androgen deprivation conditions. Future studies will investigate if anti-AR treatments could lead to the dysregulation of ABI1 and promote reactivation of AR pathway through ABI1-AR axis.

TNBCs have a very poor prognosis and have few targeted therapy options. Therefore, the development of new TNBC treatment strategies is an urgent and unmet clinical need. Our previous studies have demonstrated that knockout of the SOX9 transcription factor decreased TNBC cell growth and tumor metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. <b>Hypothesis: <\/b>SOX9-binding proteins include upstream activators of this transcription factor which regulate SOX9 activity and control TNBC growth.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b> Immunoprecipitation (IP) in combination with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis was used to identify SOX9 binding proteins, with support from MD Anderson&#8217;s proteomics core. The Mascot Score is a statistical score was used as the reference of targeted protein, and the data was summarized based on the Mascot Score. IP-Western Blotting analysis was used to confirm that the identified proteins bound SOX9 in TNBC cells. RNA-Seq analysis was used to identify SOX9 regulated genes in MDA MBA-231 and MDA MB-468 cells after SOX9 knockdown or in MCF-7 after SOX9 overexpression, with support from MD Anderson&#8217;s genomic biostatistics core. We then treated TNBC cells with or without siRNAs of these identified proteins to evaluate their effect on SOX9-regulated gene expression and TNBC growth. Cell growth was measured using an automated cell counting assay. Protein and mRNA levels were examined by western blotting and qRT-PCR assays. SOX9 transcriptional activity was measured using a reporter gene activity assay, and qRT-PCR assay. Data are presented as mean values &#177; SD. Statistical significance (<i>p<\/i>-values) was calculated using the Student&#8217;s <i>t<\/i>-test unless otherwise indicated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Using immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis, we identified multiple SOX9 binding proteins. Among them, proteins that demonstrated high Mascot Scores include Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP), protein S100A10 (S100A10); Caveolin 1 (CAV1). Knockdown of each of these SOX9-binding proteins (VCP, S100A10, or CAV1) decreased TNBC cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i>. Using mRNA-Seq analysis, we next identified 38 genes down-regulated by SOX9 knockdown in TNBC cell lines, and up-regulated upon SOX9 overexpression in MCF-7 cells. Using these genes as markers of SOX9 transcriptional activity, all three of these SOX9-binding proteins regulate SOX9 activity. Thus, VCP, CAV1, and S100A10 all are potential upstream proteins of SOX9 that can be targeted to inhibit TNBC growth.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b><b>:<\/b> Our results demonstrate that VCP, S100A10, and CAV1, are SOX9-binding proteins that regulate SOX9 activity and control TNBC cell growth.<br \/><b>Implications<\/b>: These proteins represent potential targets for the treatment of TNBCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f4aa8ce-2aad-4535-b102-88325a1c3236\/@A03B8ZJL\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),Protein-protein interactions,Tumor growth,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16252"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanxia Ma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David H.

Persistent activation of NRF2 and STAT3 is considered to stimulate the aggressive behavior of BLBC. An online database, NRF2-ome predicted the possibility of interplay between NRF2 and STAT3 based on domain motif interactions. However, cooperation between NRF2 and STAT3 and its implications for breast cancer progression remain elusive. Immunoprecipitation and <i>in situ<\/i> proximity analyses revealed that NRF2 and STAT3 directly interact with each other, which predominantly occurred in the nucleus of human breast cancer cells. After confirming the physical interaction between STAT3 and NRF2, we examined whether this could influence the expression or stability of each transcription factor. While silencing of NRF2 failed to alter the STAT3 expression, STAT3 knockdown facilitated degradation of NRF2. Of note, silencing of STAT3 did not affect the mRNA expression of NRF2, suggesting that STAT3-induced accumulation of NRF2 is attributable to stabilization of the preexisting protein. As the NRF2-STAT3 complex was found to accumulate predominantly in the nucleus, we speculate that NRF2 could bind to a functionally active phosphorylated form of STAT3 (P-STAT3<sup>Y705<\/sup>). The substitution of Y705 of STAT3 with the non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine (STAT3<sup>Y705F<\/sup>) abolished interaction with NRF2. Notably, the dimeric form, but not a monomeric form, of STAT3 interacts directly with the Neh1 and Neh3 domains of NRF2. Next, we investigated the functional significance of STAT3- NRF2 interaction in BLBC growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. STAT3 knockdown significantly reduced expression of NRF2 in the xenograft tumor tissues derived from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Tumors derived from cells transfected with the non-specific control siRNA showed a pronounced interaction between STAT3 and NRF2, whereas such interaction was abolished in the STAT3-silenced xenograft tumor. Analysis of the TCGA multi-omics data showed that high levels of <i>STAT3<\/i> and NRF2 mRNA transcripts were correlated with elevated expression of P-STAT3<sup>Y705<\/sup> and NRF2 target proteins in breast cancer patients. Next generation RNA sequencing analysis identified the gene encoding interleukin-23A (IL-23A) upregulated by concurrent binding of STAT3 and NRF2 to its promoter. IL-23A is markedly overexpressed in BLBC, compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Combined silencing of NRF2 and STAT3 inhibited BLBC growth to a greater extent than that achieved with single siRNA transfection. <i>IL-23A<\/i> depletion by siRNA also showed the similar phenotypic changes to those caused by double knockdown of both transcription factors. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the STAT3-NRF2 interaction accelerates BLBC growth and progression by augmenting IL-23A expression, which underscores the importance of subtype-specific molecular pathways in human breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/87ec5d76-55d4-435d-863c-37e99582b744\/@B03B8ZJM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nrf2,STAT3,IL-23A,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16253"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Su-Jung Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soma Saeidi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nam-Chul Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Hyeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han-Byoel Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wonshik Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hye-Kyung Na<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young-Joon Surh<\/i><\/presenter>.
