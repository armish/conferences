[{"Abstract":"Introduction: The number of deaths occurring among cancer survivors continues to be an outcome of concern. Our survivorship clinics provide risk stratification care for patients who have completed their curative treatment and are seen annually in a site-specific clinic. Here we describe mortality rates among adult patients receiving care in eleven site-specific survivorship clinics.<br \/>Procedures: We conducted an analysis of 29,418 adult patients seen in our survivorship program from 2008-2021. Medical records were reviewed and categorized by each survivorship clinic. Eligibility criteria were: patients &#8805;18, treated for curative intent, completed their primary course of treatment, past the highest risk of recurrence, and transitioned based on site-specific survivorship algorithms. Descriptive statistics summarize the results.<br \/>Results: There were 26475 survivors alive and 2943 deaths (Table 1). Of those alive, the greatest number were diagnosed with breast, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal malignancies. Death rates ranged from 2% to 38%, with the highest percent in stem cell transplant, head and neck, and gynecology malignancy survivors. 29% of deceased patients had died within one year of their transition from oncology care to survivorship clinics.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results indicate differences in mortality risk among different cancer survivors; those who received transplants or were diagnosed with gynecologic or head\/neck cancers had higher death rates. Survivors in these groups have short and long-term health risks which may require more proactive care. Current analyses are underway on the cause of death among patients who passed away within the first year of the transition to survivorship.<br \/>Table 1.

There are few reports on the pathogenesis and pathological search in the terminal stage of glioblastoma. In this study, we report the pathological analysis of glioblastoma cases that we were able to perform from initial treatment to confirmation of death at our hospital. We analyzed 26 glioblastoma cases (including 18 autopsied cases) treated at our hospital from initial treatment to death. The mean age of the 26 patients was 60.7 years, and the mean overall survival was 16.7 months. The duration of clinical symptoms was 36.2 days from coma to death, and 12 days from the appearance of respiratory depression to death. Psychiatric symptoms and central fever were observed in patients with intrathecal dissemination. Steroids and antiepileptic drugs were often continued after completion of active treatment. Patients with intrathecal dissemination progressed rapidly and presented with a variety of symptoms, including psychiatric symptoms, headache, neck pain, and central fever. In addition, there was a case of diffuse infiltration from the brain parenchyma to the periventricular area in a patient treated with bevacizumab, suggesting the possibility of a change in the form of recurrence. In the terminal stage of glioblastoma, hypoxemia due to disturbance of respiratory center progresses from impaired consciousness to death. Convulsive seizures are rare in the dying stage, and continuation of antiepileptic drugs should be considered. Although many patients develop from local recurrence, it was suggested that new treatment may change the mode of recurrence or alter the trait of tumor cells. In recent years, the number of patients receiving home care and end-of-life care has been increasing due to the improvement of medical systems such as home care. Further investigation of the pathophysiology is necessary for better end-of-life care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8bcfa15c-0078-4daa-a35b-9be4828b47d7\/@v03B8ZQz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-08 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Palliative care,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17534"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Norihiko Saito<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nozomi Hirai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naoki Kushida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sho Sato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Hiramoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Fujita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haruo Nakayama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Morito Hayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keisuke Ito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takatoshi Sakurai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Iwabuchi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Physical activity interventions have been conducted to improve psychological outcomes in cancer patients. Our goal with this scoping review was to synthesize evidence on the association of exercise interventions on depression and anxiety symptom presentation among men diagnosed with a genitourinary cancer.<br \/>Methods: We undertook a structured search of PubMed and Embase databases to identify physical activity interventional studies (randomized and non-randomized) and depression or anxiety among male genitourinary cancer patients. Study inclusion criteria included: studies must have been interventional, within a population of male genitourinary cancer patients (prostate, bladder, kidney, testicular), with reported quantitative measures of depression or anxiety, separately for individual cancer sites and males for non-male-specific cancer sites. Using these criteria, records underwent a first-stage title-and-abstract screen followed by a second-stage full-text screen. Records meeting all eligibility criteria were included. Following standardized data extraction, data were synthesized in narrative format. All study procedures were performed by two reviewers, with conflicts resolved by consensus.<br \/>Results: The search yielded 1,465 records. Following screening, 22 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the synthesis. Of the outcomes of interest, 21 studies assessed depression (20 prostate and 1 testicular cancer), 16 studies assessed anxiety (15 prostate and 1 testicular cancer), and 1 study assessed depression and anxiety combined (prostate cancer). No trials in kidney or bladder cancer met eligibility criteria. Exercise interventions in included trials ranged from high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to stretching-based practices. The included testicular cancer study found a non-significant between-group decrease in depression (effect = -0.2) and anxiety (effect = -1.6) scores following HIIT intervention. Nearly all studies in prostate cancer found improvements following the exercise intervention, several with statistically significant results. Of note, the results from 2 Qigong exercise interventions reported promising therapeutic benefits, with one study reporting a significant decrease in anxiety from baseline comparing Qigong vs stretching control interventions (p=0.003); results were non-significant for depression (p=0.09).<br \/>Conclusion: Available evidence demonstrates suggests a beneficial impact of exercise interventions on reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in men with genitourinary cancer. More research is needed on the role of exercise interventions on psychological condition reporting in patients of kidney, bladder, and rarer genitourinary cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fade5041-a90e-465f-93f4-e8f8d303089a\/@v03B8ZQz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-05 Psycho-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genitourinary cancers: prostate,Genitourinary cancers: testicular,Genitourinary cancers: bladder,Genitourinary cancers: kidney,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18483"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sydney Grob<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Colleen B.

At present, there is no other methodology to evaluate QOL other than patients reported outcomes using QOL questionnaires. Therefore, management of QOL is not performed clinically because there is no objective and easy method to evaluate QOL. In this study, we extracted the worst symptom of QOL in gynecological cancer patients and examined whether QOL can be evaluated by lifelogs objectively.<br \/>Lifelogs (diets, sleep duration, the number of steps, pulse rate, voice, and so on) and QOL questionnaires (EORTC-qlq-c30, PHQ9, and so on) were collected from 139 gynecological cancer patients at our hospital using mobile applications. Scales of symptoms and functions were calculated from EORTC-qlq-c30. Logistic regression analyses and calculation of feature impact in the predictive model depicting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to extract symptoms and functions that contributed most to global health status (GHS) indicating a general QOL status. Fatigue-related metabolites in patient serum were measured by ELISA. Correlations between each lifelog, fatigue scale, and fatigue-related metabolites were examined. A computational model to detect high fatigue scale status was developed using lifelogs.<br \/>The fatigue scale was the highest among all treatment periods. The fatigue scale, appetite loss scale, and physical functioning scale were symptoms that deteriorate QOL frequently in gynecologic cancer patients (odds ratio: 0.9708, 0.9797, and 1.0374, respectively; 95% CI: 0.9493 to 0.9927, 0.9677 to 0.9919, and 1.0155 to 1.0597, respectively). ROC curve indicated that an accurate prediction of GHS using scales of symptoms and functions (area under the curve, AUC: 0.85). From the scales of symptoms and functions, the fatigue scale showed the highest feature impact to predict GSH. Several lifelogs were significantly correlated with fatigue scores (p&#60;0.05, r=-0.25 to -0.15 for each), and with the blood concentration of fatigue-related metabolites (p&#60;0.05, r=-0.44 to -0.37 for each). A computational algorithm using the fatigue-related lifelogs was successful to detect high fatigue score status (AUC=0.79). We found that two cases with persistent high fatigue scores and a low fatigue-related lifelog during chemotherapy led to depression and depressive relapse.<br \/>In summary, fatigue is a significant problem contributing to the decline in QOL of gynecological cancer patients. Fatigue can be monitored and diagnosed using digital data using lifelogs. These findings lead to the development of future management strategies of QOL for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/62386d68-85a0-4b14-87fd-8f8a74c83c37\/@v03B8ZQz\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-06 Supportive care, palliation, and pain management,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Palliative care,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18484"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3732243a-48a4-4875-8fd4-45489bee0c45","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3732243a-48a4-4875-8fd4-45489bee0c45\/@v03B8ZQz\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ken Yamaguchi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nozomi Higashiyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akihiko Ueda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiro Takamatsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masayo Ukita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mana Taki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koji Yamanoi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junzo Hamanishi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masaki Mandai<\/i><\/presenter>.

Median age at survey return was 82 years (range 77-100), and the median time since cancer diagnosis was 12 years. Excellent or very good overall health, mental health, and physical function were reported by 48%, 63.5%, and 77.1%, respectively. Older age was associated with poorer self-reported overall health, as were heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease, reported by 18%, 14%, and 7%, respectively (p&#60;0.05 for all; see Table). Only heart disease was statistically significantly associated with poorer mental health (p=0.03). Physical function was reportedly better in survivors without a history of diabetes, stroke, or lung disease (p&#60;0.05 for all), and in those who were closer to their cancer diagnosis (p=0.03). Tumor characteristics were not associated with overall health, mental health, or physical function.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Comorbidities are common and impact self-reported overall health, mental health, and physical function in older breast cancer survivors.<br \/><b>Table: Multivariate logistic regression model for overall health<\/b><table class=\"AbstractTable\"
