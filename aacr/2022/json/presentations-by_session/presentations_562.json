[{"Abstract":"Adipose expansion during obesity has remarkable similarities with the growth of solid tumors. These similarities are the following: the capability to unlimited expansion; reversible plasticity; induction of angiogenesis; chronic inflammation; remodeling and disfunction; systemic influence on the organism; hormone production; production of miRNAs that influence other tissues; immunosuppression; DNA damage and resistance to apoptosis; infiltration in other organs and tissues. The existing similarities between adipose and tumors suggest the possible evolutionary origin of mammalian adipose from some ancestral benign mesenchymal hereditary tumors.<br \/>Transgenic inducible zebrafish tumor model was used to verify the above hypothesis.<br \/>We described several genes, which originated in fish and were expressed in fish tumors. Their human orthologs <i>LEP<\/i>, <i>SPRY1<\/i>, <i>PPARG<\/i>,<i> ID2<\/i>, and <i>CIDEA <\/i>acquired functions connected with human adipose. They are also involved in tumor development in humans.<br \/>If the hypothesis of the evolutionary origin of mammalian adipose from the ancestral benign hereditary tumors is correct, it may open new opportunities to resolve the oncological problem and the problem of the obesity epidemic. New interventions targeting <i>LEP<\/i>, <i>SPRY1<\/i>, <i>PPARG<\/i>,<i> ID2<\/i>, and <i>CIDEA <\/i>gene network, in addition to what already is going on, can be designed for treatment and prevention of both obesity and tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/79a4261c-59fb-4d37-8e35-f488040b1a03\/@A03B8ZU5\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Complex adaptive systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor biology,Adipocytes,Gene expression analysis,Obesity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18068"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrei P.

We aimed to develop a tool that can evaluate the intratumoral epigenetic heterogeneity using the DNA methylation profiles from bulk tumors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Ggenomic DNA of three laser micro-dissected tumor regions, including digestive tract surface (DTS), central bulk (CB), and invasive margin (IM), was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of 98 colorectal cancer patients. The genome-wide methylation profiles were generated with methylation array. The most variable methylated probes were selected to construct a DNA methylation-based heterogeneity (MeHEG) estimation tool that can deconvolve the proportion of each reference tumor region with the support vector machine model-based method. A PCR-based assay for quantitative analysis of DNA methylation (QASM) was developed to specifically determine the methylation status of each CpG in MeHEG assay at single-base resolution to realize fast evaluation of epigenetic heterogeneity.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the discovery set with 79 patients, the differentially methylated CpGs among the three tumor regions were found. The 7 most representative CpGs were identified by random forest analysis and subsequently selected to develop the MeHEG algorithm. We validated its performance of deconvolution of tumor regions in an independent cohort with 19 patients. In addition, we showed the significant association of MeHEG-based epigenetic heterogeneity with the genomic heterogeneity in mutation and copy number variation in our in-house and TCGA cohorts. Finally, we found that the patients with higher MeHEG score had worse disease-free and overall survival outcomes.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> By constructing a 7-loci panel with a machine learning approach and QASM assay to facilitate its use in a PCR manner, we developed a valuable method to evaluate the intratumoral epigenetic heterogeneity. The MeHEG algorithm provides innovative insights into the intratumoral heterogeneity from the epigenetic perspective that may add valuable sources to current knowledge about tumor heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0e055641-cb30-4471-b5cd-a2b272ed75a9\/@A03B8ZU5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Methylation,Heterogeneity,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18070"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yumo Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guannan Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meijin Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanxin Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Huichuan Yu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The evolutionary relationships between NETs of different grades remain poorly understood, here we seek to use the TRACERx study to explore the genomic evolution of these lung cancers.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tissue and blood samples were taken from a cohort of 20 patients with pulmonary NETs in a sub-study within TRACERx. Multi-region sampling (84 total regions) and whole exome sequencing was performed on fresh frozen tissue from each tumor. Histological classification of each tumor region was confirmed and scoring of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was performed. The data were then analyzed using the established TRACERx bioinformatics pipeline.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Phylogenetic evolutionary histories were generated, illustrating the genomic divergence in each tumor and identifying points at which specific known drivers were acquired during tumor evolution. Lower grade classical and atypical carcinoids were characterized by a low mutational and copy number burden wi&#173;&#173;th a high fraction of subclonal mutations, with 5\/12 cases having no apparent somatic mutational driver mutation. In contrast higher grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and small cell carcinomas had higher mutational and copy number burden&#173;&#173;, as well as higher rates of genome instability and whole genome doubling. We identified no evolutionary link between subtypes such as commonly shared clonal drivers, suggesting that atypical or classical carcinoids later evolve into higher grade carcinomas. Dn\/ds was used to investigate for evidence of selection in the carcinoid tumors; while there was no evidence for selection in known cancer driver genes associated with NETs or lung cancer, there was a high global dn\/ds value suggesting the existence of unknown drivers for this cancer type. Furthermore, there was evidence of parallel evolution in one atypical carcinoid case with two distinct subclonal MEN1 frameshift mutations co-occurring with loss of the other allele. One small cell carcinoma patient was identified as having two genetically unrelated tumors. A germline predisposition for this tumor was suspected since we identified a variant in BRCA2 (rs11571833) that was maintained under loss of heterozygosity in one tumor with a corresponding somatic BRCA2 mutation in the other, suggesting two independent double hit events.&#173;&#173;<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Genomic differences are identifiable between different members of the pulmonary NET family, with high grade tumors showing increased whole genome instability indices and phylogenetic divergence than low grade tumors. This work has shed light on the genomic landscape of pulmonary NETs and enabled the identification of distinct evolutionary trajectories in the different subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0d99d840-e803-488d-b716-6a3c55cd556b\/@A03B8ZU5\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Heterogeneity,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18959"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robert Bentham<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David A.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we reveal multiple tumor subpopulations distinguished by their differentiation state and associated with different stages of tumor progression. We identify SPDEF as a factor required for tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer cells of epithelial and mucinous nature. SPDEF levels correlate with glandular differentiation and high secretory activity, which are characteristic features of human PDA of the classical subtype. SPDEF can drive mucus production in pancreatic cancer cells and is essential for the growth of mucus-secreting tumors by regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activity.

The subtype conversion from luminal to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype fuels endocrine resistance and disease aggressiveness. In this study, we analyzed mechanisms of luminal to basal subtype conversion by clinical sample sequencing and molecular study.<br \/><b>Method <\/b>We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of primary and metastatic tumor tissues from breast cancer patients with luminal to basal [from HR(+)\/HER2(-) to TNBC] subtype conversion (experimental, n=14) and patients with subtype maintenance (luminal to luminal subtype, control, n= 36) after adjuvant endocrine therapy. For RNA-sequencing, the subset of patients (experimental, n=14; control n=7) was further analyzed. The differences in genetic alterations and gene expression were compared between two patient groups to identify genetic predictors of subtype conversion. We also manipulated genetic factors related to subtype conversion in MCF7 cells to identify molecular signaling to drive lineage change.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>In WES analysis, TP53 mutation was more frequently observed in luminal breast cancer patients with subtype conversion to TNBC [60% (12 out of 20 tissues in experimental group) versus 20% (8\/40 tissues in control group)]. Whereas, GATA3 mutations were only observed in patients of subtype maintenance (0% versus 20%), and the mRNA level of GATA3 was downregulated after luminal-to-basal conversion. The TP53 and GATA3 mutations were both observed in the matched primary and metastatic tissues, suggesting that these mutations predisposed subtype conversion but were not acquired during the adjuvant endocrine therapy. In expression signature analysis, the patients with subtype conversion showed the upregulation of KRAS signaling and the suppression of GATA3 signature in metastatic TNBC tumors compared to primary luminal tumors. In primary tumors, RELA and MYC signatures were only upregulated in tumors that underwent subtype conversion later. We found ESR1 expression was decreased by knockdown of TP53 and GATA3 in MCF7 cells. The knockdown of TP53 and GATA3 also induced basal marker expressions, cytokeratin 5 and 14, in MCF7 cells. ESR1 expression and luminal markers were also decreased by GATA3 suppression in T47D harboring TP53 mutation.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>In luminal-type breast cancer, the subtype conversion is the one of the major obstacles for their treatment and preventing recurrence. We found the genetic alterations of TP53 mutation was the key predisposing factor of luminal to basal subtype conversion, whereas GATA3 mutation is a protecting factor for subtype conversion in luminal breast cancers. Thus, targeting TP53-GATA3 axis would be a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome endocrine resistance and block the subtype conversion in luminal type breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/814cf292-0228-4712-bb7f-115d40bea44a\/@B03B8ZU6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Endocrine resistance,TP53,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18961"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Won-Ji Ryu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun-Yi Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Yeong Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeona Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Ju Hahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seul-Gi Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gun Min Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ja Seung Koo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Il Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joohyuk Sohn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hwan Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

This study aimed to elucidate the evolutionary trajectories of GBAC using multi-regional and longitudinal tumor samples.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on tumors and matched normal samples with the coverage of 300x and 200x, respectively. Using PyClone, CITUP, MapScape, and TimeScape, phylogenetic trees were visualized in each patient considering each tumor&#8217;s location and timing of acquisition. Mutational signatures were analyzed using Mutalisk.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 11 patients (male, 5) including 2 rapid autopsy cases were enrolled. The median age was 70 (range, 59-75) years. The dataset consisted of 11 normal samples, 4 biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN), 11 primary tumors, and 30 metastatic tumors. The most frequently altered gene was <i>ERBB2<\/i> (54.5%), followed by <i>TP53<\/i> (45.5%) and <i>FBXW7<\/i> (27.3%). Of 6 patients with analyzable tumor ploidy, 2 patients (33.3%) had whole genome doubling (WGD) in both primary and metastatic tumors, and 1 patient (16.7%) had WGD not in the primary tumor but in the liver metastasis. In the BilIN analysis (n=4), most mutations in frequently altered genes in GBAC were detectable from the BilIN stage, but some of them were subclonal. In these 4 patients, the fittest subclone in BilIN underwent linear and branching evolution by acquiring additional subclonal mutations and thus expanded in the primary tumor, suggesting a selective sweep phenomenon. In combined analysis with metastatic tumors (n=11), branching and linear evolution was identified in 9 (81.8%) and 2 (18.2%) patients, respectively. Of the 9 patients with branching evolution, eight (88.9%) had a total of 11 subclones expanded at least 7-fold in regional or distant metastasis. These subclones harbored putative metastasis-driving mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as <i>SMAD4<\/i>, <i>ROBO1<\/i>, and <i>DICER1<\/i>. Metastases were polyclonal in all patients. However, metastatic lesions in the same or adjacent organs showed similar clonal compositions and there was evidence of metastasis-to-metastasis spread. In mutational signature analysis, we identified 6 mutational signatures: signatures 1 (age), 3 (DNA double-strand break-repair), 7 (ultraviolet), 13 (APOBEC), 22 (aristolochic acid), and 24 (aflatoxin) (cosine similarity values &#8805; 0.9). Among them, signatures 1 and 13 were dominant at the carcinogenesis stage while signatures 22 and 24 were dominant at the metastasis stage.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We have constructed evolutionary trajectories of individual patients, highlighting the role of each clone and the dynamics among clones during carcinogenesis and metastasis. This novel approach may help us move forward to precision medicine that enables early detection of carcinogenesis and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/106b8d30-75bf-4202-8496-010d72b8d145\/@B03B8ZU6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: other,Clonal evolution,Carcinogenesis,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18962"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Minsu Kang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hee Young Na<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soomin Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ji-Won Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sejoon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soyeon Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ju Hyun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeonghwan Youk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haesook T.

The only potentially curative therapy involves en bloc resection with negative margins, which is not always appropriate. Even therapy with curative intent is associated with poor overall survival for both sporadic and NF1-related MPNSTs. The development of novel therapies has been largely hindered by a poor understanding of the molecular events underpinning MPNST pathogenesis. We report a comprehensive multi-omic study of MPNST evolution based on whole genome sequencing, transcriptomic and methylation profiling data on 95 tumors (64 NF1-related; 31 sporadic). In all cases, the early events in MPNST evolution involve biallelic inactivation of <i>NF1<\/i> followed by inactivation of <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, as well as mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> or PRC2 complex genes in a subset of cases. Analysis of the genomic architecture revealed distinct pathways of tumor evolution that can be identified through H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) status. Integration of these data allows us to propose several mechanistic tumor evolution models. Tumors with H3K27me3 loss evolve through extensive copy number aberrations (CNAs) including haploidization followed by whole genome doubling and chromosome 8 amplifications, whereas tumors with H3K27me3 retention evolve through extensive chromosome instability and chromothripsis. Taken together, these genome-wide CNA profiles act as a surrogate for the loss of H3K27me3 status and correlate with prognosis, suggesting that CNA profiling of cell-free DNA could be incorporated in clinical decision-making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3a568fdd-ef91-4df5-aa15-5d69e2c90d15\/@B03B8ZU6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,MPNST evolution,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour,Neurofibromatosis 1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18963"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Isidro Cortes Ciriano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris D.

However, the clonal structure of normal epithelial cells and their clonal history during evolution to cancer are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed genetic profiles of normal epithelia and proliferative lesions in the cancer-borne breast to illustrate the clonal evolution of cancer from a normal epithelial cell.<br \/><b>[Methods]<\/b> Single cell-derived normal epithelial organoids (n=47) were established from breast milk of 4 healthy women aged 22-36 and surgical specimens of 15 BC patients aged 29-83 to evaluate somatic mutation rate. Multiple normal lobules or proliferative lesions together with cancer cells were collected using laser-capture micro-dissection (LCM) from fresh frozen (n=3) or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (n=6) surgical specimens in 9 premenopausal BC patients. Somatic mutations and copy number alterations were evaluated using whole-genome sequencing.<br \/><b>[Results]<\/b> On the basis of single cell-derived mammary gland-derived organoids, somatic mutations increased in mammary gland cells at a constant rate of 19.4\/genome\/year before menopause, which then decreased to 6.9\/genome\/year after menopause. Parity was negatively associated with mutation number (-49.3 per life birth). In total, we analyzed 113 LCM samples, including those from 66 normal lobules, 28 proliferative lesions, and 14 non-invasive and 5 invasive cancer samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the neighboring normal lobules (53\/66) from 3 BC patients shared no somatic mutations with each other and therefore were clonally independent. In other 13 normal lobules, shared mutations including a <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutation were observed across multiple adjacent samples, although they were still confined to &#60;10 mm regions. By contrast, we found a large expansion of proliferative lesions sharing a substantial number of somatic mutations with cancer in 5 out of the 6 remaining BC cases. They were expanded over a distance of 25-85 mm, sharing tens to hundreds of mutations including those in BC-related driver genes, such as <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, <i>AKT1<\/i>, <i>GATA3<\/i>, <i>CBFB<\/i> and <i>PTEN<\/i>. Of interest, Tumors in 4 out of these 5 cases was Luminal-A type and characterized in common by the presence of 1q gain and 16q loss (1q+\/16q-) in both cancer and proliferative lesions. Phylogenetic analysis adapted with the mutation rate in normal cells predicted that 1q+\/16q- had been acquired during adolescence to mid-20s, where the clonal expansion had occurred years to decades before the onset of cancer.<br \/><b>[Conclusions] <\/b>Our results suggest that in some BC cases, particularly in those with 1q+\/16q-, the clones with the founder driver mutations expanded macroscopically long before the onset of cancer, in which further clonal evolutions recursively occur multi-focally, giving rise to multiple proliferative lesions and ultimately, invasive cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/016f14a8-a86e-4dcd-b9b3-60b9db7621da\/@B03B8ZU6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Clonal evolution,Carcinogenesis,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18964"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tomomi Nishimura<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuyuki Kakiuchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenichi Yoshida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuhide Takeuchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirona Maeda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yusuke Shiozawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masahiro M.

The tumor suppressor NF2 constitutes a frequent, positively selected somatic alteration warranting synthetic lethal approaches to target this driver. NF2 inactivation drives nuclearization of YAP to mediate TEAD dependent oncogenic transcriptional program. YAP is stabilized by CDK7 through phosphorylation of S169\/S128\/S90, inhibiting the E3 ligase complex CDL4<sup>DCAF12<\/sup>. We hypothesized that biallelic NF2 inactivation would be vulnerable to augmentation of CRL4<sup>DCAF12<\/sup> through inhibition of CDK7.<br \/>Methods: 50 Patients (the MEDUSA cohort) undergoing routine extended pleurectomy decortications consented to have multiregional sampling of their mesotheliomas at resection at 4-5 stereotyped locations, followed by multiregional whole exome sequencing (mWES 200x), phylogenetic deconvolution and transfer learning to examine evolutionary trajectories. Bulk RNA sequencing enabled gene set enrichment analysis, and spatial YAP phenotyping using tissue microarrays were conducted on the mWES profiled cohort. Primary cell lines were generated from a subset of mesotheliomas and whole exome sequenced.<br \/>Results: NF2 exhibited biallelic inactivation involving copy number\/mutation allelic heterogeneity in 42% of mesotheliomas. Double hits were predominantly clonal. Hippo signalosome exhibited additional clonal somatic alterations in 26% of mesotheliomas, with biallelic inactivation being observed in LATS2 (8%) and LATS1 (4%). Transfer learning identified NF2 inactivation as a predominantly secondary clonal event, constituting an evolutionary bottleneck. Random forest analysis revealed YAP dependent transcription, epithelial mesenchymal transition and spindle checkpoint transcriptional signature enrichments in NF2 double hit mesotheliomas. We conducted drug screening of NF2 wild type versus inactivated primary mesothelioma cell lines, which revealed selective sensitivity to CDK7 inhibitors THZ1 and YKL-5-124 in NF2 inactivated but not wild type MEDUSA cell lines.<br \/>Conclusions: NF2 biallelic inactivation constitutes an evolutionary bottleneck during early mesothelioma evolution, associated with a specific vulnerability to CDK7 highlighting a potential path to clinical stratified therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d36d8dd1-d102-490f-ba84-945caca50b33\/@B03B8ZU6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelioma,Hippo pathway,Machine learning,CDK7,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18965"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Essa Y.

ITH allows the tumor to adapt to microenvironments and to resist therapies and has been shown to be a prognostic marker. In this work we show the characterization of ITH in Multiple Myeloma (MM) at single cell resolution from a pool of Circulating Multiple Myeloma Cells (CMMCs) and we study the relationship between number of sampled cells and diversity detected.<br \/>Peripheral blood was collected from 3 patients affected by MM. Using CellSearch<sup>&#174;<\/sup> system, blood was enriched for target CMMCs, with immuno-magnetic selection of CD138+, and immunofluorescently stained cells, positive for CD38-PE, DAPI and negative for CD45\/CD19-APC, were enumerated. The samples were then analyzed and CMMCs were isolated with DEPArray platform. The DNA of each single cell (n=261) was amplified with <i>Ampli<\/i>1&#8482; WGA kit and the WGA output was used for genome-wide single cell copy number alteration analysis with <i>Ampli<\/i>1 LowPass kit.<br \/>Copy number profiling revealed from 2 to 3 coexisting subclones per patient, with minor clones size going from 6.5% to 33%. ITH was assessed by determining the Shannon index, which showed a range of values from 0.44 (low diversity) to 1.01 (high diversity) depending on source sample. We evaluated the effect of number of cells\/profiles on Shannon index by bootstrapping (200 times) a number of copy number profiles ranging from 2 to the total number of profiles available per patient. Results showed that the mean Shannon index almost reaches a plateau at 15-20 cells\/profiles in the case of lower diversity samples and at about 30 cells\/profiles for the highest diversity sample. Moreover, as few as 10 cells allowed to differentiate low vs. high diversity samples.<br \/>Cell enrichment and sorting by CellSearch and DEPArray platforms allow to quantify ITH at diversity level with high precision even from a limited number of initial single-cells and provide a promising method to objectively measure heterogeneity, as required in order to study its clinical implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4c46b845-7e4b-425d-bd83-2414b3de5fcb\/@B03B8ZU6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Single cell,Copy number alterations,Multiple myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18966"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"adeb707f-5fb7-4e18-8aa2-0daef583f67f","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/adeb707f-5fb7-4e18-8aa2-0daef583f67f\/@B03B8ZU6\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alberto Ferrarini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudio Forcato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Del Monaco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mario Terracciano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marianna Garonzi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Massimiliano Pellicano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Genny Buson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Fontana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paola Tononi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolo Manaresi<\/i><\/presenter>.

To overcome this issue, we developed a Multi-Patient-Targeted (MPT) scDNA-seq sequencing method. MPT involves first performing bulk exome sequencing across a cohort of cancer patients to identify somatic mutations, which are then pooled together to develop a single custom targeted panel for high-throughput scDNA-seq using a microfluidics platform. We applied MPT to profile 330 mutations across 23,500 cells from 5 TNBC patients, which showed that 3 tumors were monoclonal and 2 tumors were polyclonal. From this data, we reconstructed mutational lineages and identified early mutational and copy number events, including early TP53 mutations that occurred in all five patients.

Intra-tumoral heterogeneity contributes strongly to clinical outcomes. In fact, heterogeneity is often cited as a driver of therapeutic failure, chemo-resistance, and recurrence of disease. Current bulk profiling analysis of tumors is limited in its ability to provide the level of granularity necessary for uncovering aspects of heterogeneity that contribute to poor outcomes. Thus, it is imperative to gain a deeper understanding of tumors at the single-cell level. To properly analyze tumor heterogeneity at the single-cell level it is critical that quality methods for tissue dissociation and cell purification be utilized. While the most frequently used workflows rely on a combination of enzymatic and mechanical dissociation of the tissue followed by RBC lysis to remove contaminating red blood cells, these approaches tend to be harsh on cells leading to activation of cell stress pathways or even the loss of target cells due to their death during processing. The analysis of tumor heterogeneity has long been hampered by issues with low yield and sample preparation-induced alterations in cell physiology. To alleviate these issues, we present a workflow that couples Cellsonics&#8217; SimpleFlow&#8482; with Akadeum&#8217;s Buoyancy Activated Cell Sorting (BACS&#8482;) Microbubbles for gentle and effective tumor dissociation and clean-up that does not compromise precious samples. Cellsonics&#8217; SimpleFlow&#8482; system features the proprietary Bulk Lateral Ultrasonic&#8482; (BLU&#8482;) energy to generate single cells from solid tissue with unparalleled speed, quality, and sample integrity. SimpleFlow&#8482; is engineered to enable any lab to obtain the full spectrum of heterogeneous cell populations while maintaining the native gene expression patterns across all cell types. Single cell samples can be generated from solid tissues in 4-10 minutes under cold temperature without the use of enzymes. Akadeum&#8217;s BACS&#8482; Microbubble technology features low-density microbubbles that are functionalized to capture an array of analytes including particular cell types. Akadeum&#8217;s BACS&#8482; Microbubbles enable the purification of cell types of interest quickly, easily, and without sacrificing cell health and physiology. In this study, The SimpleFlow&#8482; system was used to dissociate fresh tissues from mice to obtain a heterogeneous suspension of single cells. Following the dissociation, up to 99% of RBCs were removed from samples using Akadeum&#8217;s Mouse RBC Depletion. In subsequent studies, cancer cells were spiked into tissue samples prior to processing to assess their recovery and physiology. The novel workflow presented here combing SimpleFlow&#8482; and microbubbles demonstrates the recovery of the full spectrum of cells and did not harm tumor cell recovery or health.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0e15507b-b74b-4b5b-95d6-eb7fccf29c42\/@B03B8ZU6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor heterogeneity,Single cell,Cell isolation,Tissue dissociation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18968"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chananat Klomsiri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Edward Grimley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jon Roussey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolina Livi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Casey Wegner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon H.

As new mutations arise, the potential for new cellular phenotypes, or subclones, with varying degrees of fitness also increases. This intratumor clonality is known to be an important factor in predicting cancer progression, survival, therapeutic response, and drug resistance. Yet, parsing and quantifying the underlying subclones that drive ongoing adaptation poses challenges in noisy single timepoint, single site bulk sequenced tumor biopsies.<br \/>Considering noisy sequencing data, a general framework for understanding subclonal dynamics in single tumor biopsies has been to use variant allele frequency (VAF) distributions to capture ongoing selection in tumors. With that said, the range of existing VAF-based methods suffer from unique limitations. Namely, single statistics compress data into a single value without accounting for noise, classical likelihood-free methods such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can be very slow as simulations are required for each patient, and mixture models are dependent on the presence of qualitatively clean, distinct peaks within the VAF distribution to detect subclones and assign parameters.<br \/>Method: We developed a method that combines stochastic cancer evolution simulations with Bayesian neural networks to estimate subclonal dynamics in bulk sequenced single tumor biopsies using only mutation frequency information. Compared to existing methods, our simulation-based deep learning approach allows us to limit data compression as observed with single statistics (utilize the complete dimensionality of VAF distribution), to perform simulation and training independently from prediction (fast estimates via amortization), and to learn concise embeddings of the underlying data leading to more accurate predictions relative to existing methods (representation learning).<br \/>Results: We find our approach to be significantly more accurate at differentiating between positive selection and neutral evolution, estimating the number of subclones, and estimating subclone frequency. Furthermore, our neural network-based approach enables the use of transfer learning to re-optimize our models for additional evolutionary predictions. In this regard, we make additional estimates on subclone fitness, subclone emergence time, and mutation rate with mean percentage error &#60; 5% in all cases.<br \/>Conclusion: The integration of explicit cancer evolution simulations with Bayesian neural networks provides a new avenue for disentangling the subclonal dynamics in growing tumors. Application of our method recovers positive selection and neutral subclonal dynamics in whole-genome and exome-sequenced tumors from 10 different cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5968b84d-53be-44cb-84d7-b735effb81d8\/@B03B8ZU6\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor evolution,Machine learning,Modeling,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18969"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tom W.

The prognostic impact of LUAD histological patterns have been described, such as solid growth pattern and poor outcomes, though their underlying biology is poorly understood. Furthermore, the genomic characteristics and evolutionary constraints in relation to the inter- and intra- tumoral variance of histological patterns in primary and metastatic disease are unknown.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pathological classification of 246 patients with LUAD from the TRACERx 421 cohort was performed at the whole tumor (diagnostic samples) and multi-regional sample level (matched for tumor whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) data was also integrated to determine the relationship between pathological subtypes and ctDNA detection.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Chromosomal instability, characterized by fraction of the genome affected by subclonal copy number alterations was significantly correlated with proportion of high-grade patterns, namely solid, cribriform and micropapillary (Spearman&#8217;s Rho 0.27, p&#60;0.001). Analysis of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) and driver mutation profiles showed that specific SCNAs were associated with a predominant growth pattern, such as 3q arm gains in predominantly cribriform and solid pattern tumors. Multiregional analysis of tumors with mixed patterns showed higher grade regions to be associated with a higher frequency of LOH and expression of proliferation-related pathway genes, suggesting intra-tumoral sequential evolution from low to high grade growth patterns. No recurrent subclonal mutations or SCNAs were found to associate with progression from low to high grade patterns. The growth pattern in metastatic tumors tended to show similar or a higher-grade pattern compared with primary tumor regions harboring metastasizing clones (seeding regions). The growth pattern of the seeding regions in the primary tumor was not necessarily higher grade compared with their non-seeding counterparts. Finally, the proportion of solid pattern in the primary tumor and the presence of necrosis were found to be strongly associated with pre-operative ctDNA detection, while histological &#8216;spread through air spaces&#8217; (STAS) was identified in 92% (12\/13) of pre-operative ctDNA-negative tumors that subsequently were associated with recurrence. Patients with both pre-operative detectable ctDNA and STAS had a particularly poor prognosis.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These data reveal insights into the association between morphological and molecular heterogeneity in LUAD, describe key features of tumor evolutionary tendencies and demonstrate the utility of detailed tumor morphological assessment integrated with molecular characterization and ctDNA detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fe1ca35e-27b9-4acb-8277-0206d048e483\/@t03B8ZU7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Adenocarcinoma,Histopathology,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18970"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Takahiro Karasaki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David A.

Mixed responses, where individual tumor lesions within the same patient respond differently to treatment, contribute to early treatment failure and indicate the involvement of multiple genomic alterations. <i>TP53<\/i> loss of function has been associated with both tolerance to chromosomal instability (CIN) and with shortened progression free survival in EGFR-driven tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that CIN, together with loss of p53 function, may lead to diverse genotypes that underlie the mixed responses observed in EGFR-driven LUAD.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures: <\/b>We used genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), driven by EGFR with or without concomitant <i>Trp53 <\/i>loss and human isogenic cell lines to investigate cellular evolution and the effect of whole genome doubling on targeted therapy responses and mechanisms of resistance. Next generation sequencing and shallow whole genome single cell analyses, together with longitudinal imaging analysis from the Aura clinical trials (AURA2, AURA3 and the AURA extension cohort, Identifiers: NCT02094261, NCT02151981 and NCT01802632) was used to investigate the effect of p53 loss on tumor evolution.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> EGFR mutant tumors with clonal <i>Trp53<\/i> loss or TP53 pathway disruption displayed increased Weighted Genome Integrity Index (wGII) and higher cell to cell variation in both the mouse and TRACER<sub>x<\/sub> data sets. We found that TP53 loss of function increased the incidence of mixed responses and resistance to targeted therapy in both mouse and human tumors leading to early treatment failure and reduced survival. Whole-exome sequencing (median depth of 92x, range: 58-169x) of nine erlotinib-resistant EGFR mouse tumors identified four EGFR bypassing mutations (oncogenic <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations; Q61H, Q61R, and two G12D mutations) and one likely driver mutation in FGFR2 (C286R). We could only identify one known resistance associated mutation, EGFR<sup>T790M<\/sup>, in EGFR mutant tumors with concomitant loss of <i>Trp53<\/i>. In depth analysis revealed no major copy number differences in treatment na&#207;ve vs resistant EGFR mutant tumors. In contrast, 70% of all tumors with concomitant Trp53 loss had amplified a region of mouse chromosome 7, harboring <i>MET <\/i>and<i> BRAF<\/i>.

Cell DNA barcoding, demonstrating high sensitivity and resolution, allows monitoring effects of drugs on the number of tumor and metastatic clones. However, this technology is not suitable for comparison of sizes of metastatic clones in different animals, e.g. drug treated and untreated, due to high biological and technical variability upon tumor and metastatic growth and isolation of barcodes from tissue DNA. Yet, both numbers of clones and their sizes are critical parameters for analysis of drug effects. Here we developed a modification of the barcoding approach for monitoring drug effects on tumors and metastasis that is quantitative, highly sensitive and highly reproducible. This novel cell double barcoding system allows simultaneously following the fate of two or more cell variants or cell lines in xenograph models in vivo, and also following the fates of individual clones within each of these populations. This system allows comparing effects of drugs on different cell populations, and thus normalizing drug effects by drug-resistant lines, which corrects for both biological and technical variabilities and significantly increases the reproducibility of results. Using this barcoding system, we uncovered that effects of a novel DYRK1B kinase inhibitor FX9847 on primary tumors and metastasis is clone-dependent, while a distinct drug osimertinib demonstrated clone-independent effects on cancer cell populations. Overall cell double barcoding approach can significantly enrich our understanding of drug effects in basic research and preclinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2cdf0e71-6a8f-4010-ad8c-691e3c6b2d79\/@t03B8ZU7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,Osimertinib,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21055"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arkadi Hesin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santosh Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valid Gahramanov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Becker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Vilenchik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilya Alexandrov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Yaglom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Sherman<\/i><\/presenter>.

The heterogeneity of ESCC resulted in poor therapeutic effect and tumor recurrence. To investigate the heterogeneity of ESCC at the single-cell level and the oncogenic evolution, we performed single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcrtiptomics analysis in ESCC samples from different patients and position.<br \/>Methods: We performed single-cell RNA-seq of tumor, adjacent normal tissue and the junction of cancer and normal tissues from 4 ESCC patients. We also performed spatial transcriptomics of paired cancer, normal and junction of ESCC patients. Unsupervised clustering was performed to find different cell clusters of ESCC and marker genes of different clusters were determined. Inferred copy number variation was performed to identify malignant cells and pseudotime analysis to investigate the development of different cell clusters. Combined analysis of single-cell and spatial data was performed to reveal the spatial characteristics of different cell types.<br \/>Results: We successfully determined different cell types including epithelial cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells and so on. And we also reclustered epithelial, myeloid and T\/NK cells to investigate different subtypes and their marker genes. We also distinguished malignant cells from heterogeneous cellular populations using inferred copy number variation analysis. Pseudotime analysis revealed the evolution of different cell types of ESCC. We identified key signatures associated with oncogenic evolution of ESCC and the spatial characteristics of key cell clusters.<br \/>Conclusion: These findings reveal the heterogenesis of ESCC and key signatures in ESCC tumorigenesis.<br \/>Keywords: ESCC, single cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, heterogeneity, tumorigenesis","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/af8915e2-414d-4188-9af7-8522825141fb\/@t03B8ZU7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Heterogeneity,Tumorigenesis,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21056"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xiaoyang Yin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baosheng Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

Even though chemotherapy is initially effective, SCLC patients relapse quickly with therapy resistant tumors. Genome studies revealed universal loss of TP53 and RB1; recent transcriptional studies categorized SCLC tumors based on the expression of 4 lineage transcription factors (TFs). We aimed to dissect how genomic cues impact transcriptional phenotypes, tumor cell plasticity and the dynamics of tumor and immune cell interactions, to thus decipher molecular mechanisms of phenotypic divergence and therapy resistance in SCLC.<br \/>We performed genome sequencing and single cell transcriptome profiling on 61 SCLC patient tumors, including primary tumors, metastases and paired relapse tumors acquired throughout therapy. Single cell RNA-seq was performed with the 10x Genomics platform for patient tumors to study cancer cells and the tumor micro-environment (TME)(n=17), and on xenograft models to study tumor cell intrinsic heterogeneity (n=44). Single cell and genome sequencing data were processed with an in-house pipeline. To further validate our findings on the transcriptional level, we performed imaging mass cytometry (IMC) of matched tissue samples to delineate the spatial context of cellular subsets.<br \/>Single cell transcriptome profiles were determined for 211,446 cells from 61 tumors. Transcriptome profiling at single cell levels revealed co-expression of at least two of the lineage TFs ASCL1, NEUROD1 or POU2F3 for each SCLC tumor. Furthermore, tumor subsets without any expression of the four described TFs were found. Instead of distinct subgroups, our data points to a concerted regulation of a multitude of lineage factors and transcriptional programs in each SCLC tumor. To specifically investigate how underlying genetic alterations affect molecular phenotypes, integrative studies across all patients were performed. This revealed shared transcriptional programs in tumors with MYC family member amplifications; trajectory inference for cases with low and high-level copy gains of MYCN pointed to distinct transcriptional states. We performed multi-regional and longitudinal studies of matched patient cases. We reconstructed genomic patterns of clonal evolution from bulk genome sequencing data, and projected genomic subsets to transcriptional trajectories at single cell level, thus analyzing the effect of genome diversity on the transcriptional landscape. Additionally, tumor intrinsic profiles of heterogeneity were mapped to single cell data of patient tumors to elucidate the effects on the TME, focusing on tumor-immune cell interactions. All together our data provides a first comprehensive framework for the study of underlying genetic alterations that shape the transcriptional landscape and phenotypic plasticity in SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/68c72921-4923-49c0-a11c-caa99918b870\/@t03B8ZU7\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Heterogeneity,Sequencing,Expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21125"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marcel Schmiel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roman K.
