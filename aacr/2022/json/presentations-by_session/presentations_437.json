[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant condition of multiple myeloma (MM) traditionally identified by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation (IFX). Recently, novel, ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches have allowed for monoclonal (M)-protein detection at concentrations below SPEP levels.<br \/>MGUS has only few known risk factors implicated in its development and progression. Thus, we analyze MS results of the PROMISE nationwide U.S. screening study to evaluate risk factors for (1) MGUS at traditional SPEP\/IFX levels of detection and (2) low-level monoclonal gammopathies, which bear uncertain etiology and clinical significance.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>PROMISE enrolled individuals age &#8805;40 who are Black and\/or have a first-degree relative with a blood cancer or MM precursor condition. Those with &#8805;2 first-degree relatives were eligible at age &#8805;18. Participants were screened for monoclonal gammopathy by MALDI-TOF MS and provided a survey querying metabolic comorbidities and lifestyle. M-protein concentrations &#8805;0.02 g\/dL were considered traditionally-defined MGUS, whereas M-proteins &#60;0.02 g\/dL are hereafter referred to as monoclonal gammopathy of indeterminate potential (MGIP). Multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for exposure and MGUS\/MGIP associations.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>1,893 screened participants completed the survey. MGUS and MGIP were detected in 13.4% and 22.0% of Blacks and 8.6% and 26.7% of individuals with family history. Adjusting for sex, age at screening, income, and education, obesity or BMI of &#8805;30 was associated with MGUS (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.08-2.21), compared to BMI &#60;30. Clinician-diagnosed hypertension (yes\/no) and diabetes mellitus (yes\/no) were associated with MGUS with ORs 1.44 (95% CI, 1.01-2.04) and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.004-3.51). There were no significant associations between MGUS and high cholesterol, high triglycerides, heart disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Short sleep of &#8804;6 hours\/day was associated with MGUS (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01-2.03), compared to &#62;6 hours\/day. Physical activity (metabolic equivalents\/week), smoking status (current, past, never), alcohol consumption (g\/day) had no associations with MGUS. No risk factor associations were found for MGIP.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In screening a high-risk population by mass spectrometry, we found associations of both traditionally established (obesity) and novel risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, short sleep) with MGUS. None of these exposures were associated with MGIP despite finding a high prevalence of MGIP in Blacks and individuals with family history, suggesting that these risk factors may not be etiologically involved in MGIP development but possibly its clonal expansion to more advanced stages.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/db88467e-061d-4398-81ed-94a75b6cff98\/@F03B8ZKM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Prevention,Premalignancy,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13373"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David J.

The overall health care quality perception of patients in Lima, the capital of Peru, was reported to be 68.9% according to the SERVQUAL questionnaire, which grades as acceptable. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Peru. This study aims to determine the perception of health care quality for breast cancer patients in Lima. This is a cross-sectional study. The perspectives of 182 breast cancer patients about the quality of care at the largest hospital in Lima were assessed. One hundred seventeen patients (64.29%) were only seen at the Oncology Department, and 65 patients (35.71%) were seen at both the Oncology Department and Complementary Medicine Department. The quality perception is based on five dimensions: Reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibility. The percentage has to be 60 to be an acceptable level. The average age was 58.81 years. The overall and oncology-only groups quality perceptions were not acceptable, 57.32%, and 53.65%, respectively. The oncology and the complementary patient group reported adequate general perception (63.92%). Perception of empathy and assurance were at acceptable levels for both groups. Reliability and tangibility did not receive a satisfactory grade in any group. The responsiveness level was only adequate in the complimentary and oncology group. The breast cancer patients&#8217; perception of the health care quality who received Complementary Medicine services was significantly higher than the oncology-only group. We did not find a significant difference between the dimensions of quality and educational level, type of insurance, and the professional who attended the patient. In conclusion, the patients who were seen at the oncology and complementary medicine reported a better perception of the quality of healthcare.

Few studies evaluate mental health disorders comprehensively among prostate cancer patients with long-term follow-up. The primary aim of our study is to assess the incidence of mental health disorders among prostate cancer patients compared to a general population cohort. A secondary aim is to investigate risk factors for mental health disorders among prostate cancer patients.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>Cohorts of 18,134 cancer patients with prostate adenocarcinomas diagnosed between 2004 and 2017 and 73,470 men without cancer matched by age, birth state and follow up time from the general population were identified. Mental health diagnoses were identified from electronic medical records and statewide healthcare facilities data. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs).<br \/><b>Results. <\/b>Prostate cancer patients had increased risks of mental illnesses for the first five years after cancer diagnosis (0-2 years: HR=1.81, 95%CI=1.75-1.87; 2-5 years: HR=1.05, 95%CI=1.01-1.08) compared to the general population, but not in the later follow up periods. Elevated risks of anxiety disorder among prostate cancer patients were observed during across follow-up periods (0-2 years: HR= 1.59, 95% CI= 1.49-1.70; 2-5 years: HR= 1.20, 95% CI= 1.12-1.28; 5-10 years: HR= 1.20, 95% CI= 1.12-1.29; 10- 16 years: HR= 1.29, 95% CI= 1.14-1.45). Likewise, mood disorders, including depressive disorders, among prostate cancer survivors were found for all follow-up periods (0-2 years: HR= 1.59, 95% CI= 1.50-1.69; 2-5 years: HR= 1.21, 95% CI= 1.14-1.29; 5-10 years: HR= 1.20, 95% CI= 1.13-1.28; 10-16 years: HR=1.25, 95% CI= 1.12-1.38).The risks of any mental illness were increased with PSA&#62;20ng\/ml, high Gleason score, high-level risk group (intermediate, high, and very high), higher AJCC staging, and androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) therapy within 10 years after prostate cancer diagnosis. Surgery, radiation, ADT and tumor characteristics were also important risk factors for depression at 0-2 years after prostate cancer diagnosis. A baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 1+ and unmarried status were associated with increased risk of any mental illness and depression across all time periods. We also observed that increased risks of any mental illness were associated with Hispanic, black or multiple races, underweight or obese, and family history of prostate cancer for all time periods. Prostate cancer survivors had a 26% increased risk of death associated with a mental illness diagnosis and a 61% increased risk of death with a depression diagnosis.<br \/><b>Conclusion.<\/b> Prostate cancer diagnosis is associated with poor mental health, which was observed as long as 16 years after cancer diagnosis. Providing long-term mental health support may be potentially beneficial to increasing life expectancy for prostate cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1c1f382e-027c-4531-aa47-6c64b5063d56\/@F03B8ZKM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-07 Quality of life\/late effects\/survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Mortality,Risk factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13328"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Siqi Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

While cancer treatment-induced late effects vary due to patient-related risk factors, cancer survivors who received chemotherapy or radiation may develop conductive or sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The purpose of this project is to determine which neuroinflammation-associated genes and biological pathways are affected by pediatric cancer treatments, and which treatment protocols are associated with increased ototoxicity. We hypothesize that cancer treatment causes abnormal gene expression of neuroinflammation and deafness-associated genes. The hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. Aim I is to perform a retrospective review of diagnostic audiograms from pediatric cancer survivors enrolled in the Treatment After Cancer and Late Effects Center at Children&#8217;s Hospital New Orleans, Louisiana (CHNOLA). Aim II is to perform Nanostring neuroinflammation gene expression analysis followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of brain autopsy specimens from deceased pediatric patients who have previously undergone cancer treatment (Pathology Department, CHNOLA). Preliminary results revealed abnormal upregulation or downregulation of key genes, some of which are related to hearing loss and cochlear neuron degeneration when compared to age-matched controls (e.g., GJA1 and CASP3). The present study may provide information regarding which cancer treatment agents are ototoxic and reveal the candidate risk genes and pathways that contribute to auditory late effects. The long term goal of this project is to identify the needs of cancer survivors who are affected by treatment-induced hearing loss and provide them and their families with access to educational materials, medical resources, and social support to increase their health-related quality of life.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0d682d1-059e-4735-84e7-1ab9ddf9f51c\/@F03B8ZKM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR03-07 Quality of life\/late effects\/survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Gene expression analysis,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13329"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brittney T.

There is currently no standardized program for follow-up of RIHD in cancer survivors. Therefore, there is an acute need for developing detection of RIHD at a stage that offers potential for early intervention and reversibility.<br \/>The gold standard for detection of global cardiac dysfunction is echocardiography. However, this current paradigm detects cardiac changes in metrics such as Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), which are relatively late manifestations in the pathology of cardiotoxicity, decreasing the possibility of reversing such damage. We sought to assess radiation-induced changes significantly earlier than the current standard of care by measuring the efficiency of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in cardiac mitochondria; we hypothesized that radiation leads to impaired mitochondrial function, causing increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the cytosol and decreased conversion in the mitochondria. In order to non-invasively measure this impairment, we utilized Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to track the fate of hyperpolarized (HP) C-13 pyruvate.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Sprague-Dawley rats underwent baseline and post treatment echocardiography and HP C-13 pyruvate MRS at multiple timepoints. Half of the animals underwent image-guided cardiac radiation with cone-beam CT, to a total dose of 40 Gy in 5 fractions, a paradigm similar to a common dose given to lung cancer patients.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In the cardiac radiation group, C-13 pyruvate MRS demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in cardiac function (determined by bicarbonate-to-lactate ratio in myocardial mitochondria) compared to pre-radiation baseline (p=0.02, one-tailed paired t-test) as early as 1 week post treatment. No significant decrease in this ratio was observed in the non-irradiated, age matched controls (p=0.95). Comparatively, no significant changes in LVEF or global longitudinal strain were observed in either the cardiac irradiation or control group of rats until 2 months post treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Radiation-induced myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event that can be characterized and detected <i>in vivo<\/i> by hyperpolarized C-13 pyruvate MRS within 1 week after radiation prior to onset of echocardiographic changes. For the first time, we have demonstrated feasibility of employing HP C-13 pyruvate MRS for detecting radiation-induced myocardial mitochondrial metabolic changes in a pre-clinical rat model. This technology has the potential to serve as a platform for building radiation-focused cardio-oncology programs for early detection and mitigation of radiation-induced cardiac injury in hundreds of thousands of patients receiving thoracic radiation annually.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a1bc1ec4-59a7-448d-91a6-26e5159a1049\/@F03B8ZKM\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-01 Application of molecular pathology in clinical prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13719"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jayesh Sharma<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuliang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junjie Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriele Schiattarella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Hill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaemo Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Craig Malloy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vlad Zaha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prasanna Alluri<\/i><\/presenter>.
