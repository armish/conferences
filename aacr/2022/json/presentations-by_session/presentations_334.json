[{"Abstract":"An estimated 5-10% of breast cancer cases carry germline mutations in genes associated with a moderate to strong breast cancer risk, like <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i>. These mutations can influence disease onset, progression, biology of the tumor, potential for therapy, risk of recurrence and cancer risk of close relatives. This warrants clinical germline screening for such gene variants according to national guidelines on patient selection. In this study we aimed to molecularly and clinicopathologically contrast clinically screened patients and their tumors against unscreened patients. For this we used a population-based breast cancer cohort from southern Sweden with 6660 patients (14% of which had been screened) with accompanying RNA-sequencing and clinicopathological registry data. Screening subsets were analyzed within five clinically relevant breast cancer subgroups based on hormone receptor and lymph node status. Among other features, we investigated clinicopathological characteristics, risk of tumor recurrence, survival outcomes, tumor proliferation markers, immune cell content, genes differentially expressed and the pathways in which they were involved. Most differences were found in the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroup: when compared to patients that had not been screened, the screened subset contained younger individuals showing better overall survival, more proliferative tumors with upregulated genes that belong to DNA replication and double-strand break repair processes, lower proportion of M2 macrophages and higher proportion of T-helper 2 cells. As so, Swedish screening guidelines divide TNBC cases into two separate subsets possibly by selecting distinct underlying biological and mutational mechanisms associated with DNA repair deficiency (e.g., through BRCA1\/2-deficiency), a disparity not seen in other breast cancer clinical subgroups. Understanding the molecular landscape of defined screening populations may improve future guideline updates, which in turn would also improve patient and resource handling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0fa6049-8273-43dc-8000-d77bc14d1e78\/@y03B8ZCF\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Hereditary cancer,Molecular subtypes,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13548"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Deborah F.

CH is associated with secondary blood cancers and other adverse health events, although the minimum clone size at which these risks become evident and factors that could mitigate them are unknown. To explore these questions, we examined associations of CH patterns with demographic and treatment-related factors using highly sensitive, duplex UMI-based error-corrected sequencing (ECS) of whole blood DNA samples from breast cancer survivors enrolled in the Reach for Health (RFH) study, a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial of metformin and weight loss.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Whole blood DNA was isolated from banked samples collected at 2 time points (baseline and 6 months) from 332 RFH participants. Targeted ECS of 70 myeloid malignancy-associated genes was conducted to identify somatic mutations with variant allele frequency (VAF) &#62;0.2%. Likely germline polymorphisms and variants with &#60;5 mutant consensus read families were excluded. Analysis of mutation frequency, number, and type; VAF distribution and stability; and co-mutation were performed. Demographics and clinical data, including pre-enrollment cancer treatment, were correlated with mutation patterns.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 1035 mutations in 37 genes were identified across 305 RFH participants (91.9%) of which 78 (23.5%) had a maximum VAF &#8805;2% and 28 (8%) with maximum VAF &#8805;10%. 826 mutations were detected at both time points with 102 and 107 found only at baseline or 6-months, respectively. Mutation VAF was highly correlated across time points (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.99). The most frequently mutated gene was <i>DNMT3A<\/i> in 68% of RFH participants followed by <i>TET2<\/i>, <i>PPM1D<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, and <i>ASXL1<\/i>. Mean number of mutations per individual was 3.1 (range 0-19), which increased with age. The mean number of mutations was significantly lower in RFH participants who prior to study enrollment received no cytotoxic therapy (1.4) compared to chemotherapy alone (2.6), radiation alone (2.6), or both (3.0) with p-values of 0.0467, 0.0093, and 0.0002, respectively. RFH participants who had received both chemotherapy and radiation were more likely to have mutations in <i>PPM1D <\/i>and <i>TP53 <\/i>compared to participants who had received neither treatment (&#935;<sup>2<\/sup> p-values &#60;0.0001 and 0.014, respectively). Average clone size increased with age and was greatest among RFH participants who had received both chemotherapy and radiation. Analysis of CH and associations with study interventions and clinical outcomes is ongoing and will be presented at the meeting.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our findings show that CH is extremely common among breast cancer survivors at VAF &#62; 0.2%, and that prevalence of CH and mean number of mutations increases with age.

To further our understanding on this topic, we assessed ambient air pollutants in relation to prostate cancer incidence in a large multi-ethnic population. We included 33,830 men aged 45 years or older at baseline (1993-1996) who resided in Southern California at enrollment in the Multiethnic Cohort (24.5% African American, 15.1% Japanese American, 48.4% Latino, 0.2% Native Hawaiian, and 11.8% White). Until 2016, with a median of 20 years of follow-up, 4,540 prostate cancer cases were identified by linkage to the California SEER cancer registry. Monthly exposures to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &#8804; 10 &#956;m (PM<sub>10<\/sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x<\/sub>) per participant were estimated by Kriging interpolation based on air-monitoring data and residential addresses. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between time-varying air-pollutant levels and prostate cancer risk, using age in months as the time metric. We adjusted for neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) at baseline and current nSES at event, education, race\/ethnicity, smoking pack years, BMI, diabetes status, asthma history, and family history of prostate cancer, using age at cohort entry as the strata variable. The average NO<sub>x<\/sub> and PM<sub>10<\/sub> over the study period was 73.1 parts per billion (ppb) and 38.1 &#956;g\/m<sup>3<\/sup> in prostate cancer cases, respectively, and 60.9 ppb and 35.5 &#956;g\/m<sup>3<\/sup> in men without prostate cancer, respectively. Across racial\/ethnic groups, African Americans had the highest average NO<sub>x <\/sub>levels (74.3ppb) and Latinos had the highest average PM<sub>10 <\/sub>levels (39.0 &#956;g\/m<sup>3<\/sup>) over the study period. In the overall population, NO<sub>x<\/sub> per 50 ppb was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer [hazard ratio (HR)=1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.25] and PM<sub>10<\/sub> per 10 &#956;g\/m<sup>3<\/sup> was associated with a suggestive increased risk (HR=1.07, 95%CI: 0.99-1.16). In analysis by race\/ethnicity, statistically significant positive associations with NO<sub>x<\/sub> (HR=1.25, 95%CI: 1.07-1.46) and PM<sub>10<\/sub> (HR=1.21, 95%CI: 1.07-1.38) were detected among African American, but not consistently in other racial\/ethnic groups. In a subset of 21,537 men with no residential moves over the follow-up period, we observed positive associations for both NO<sub>x<\/sub> and PM<sub>10<\/sub> similar to those among all men. In conclusion, our results suggest that both NO<sub>x<\/sub> and PM<sub>10<\/sub> are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.

Genotype and protein levels moderate the uptake of androgens into prostate cells, a process competitively inhibited <i>in vitro<\/i> by statin medications. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <i>SLCO2B1<\/i> influence <i>SLCO1B2<\/i> expression and efficacy of androgen uptake <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Among men of self-reported European ancestry diagnosed with prostate cancer during prospective follow-up of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, diagnosed 1986-2017) and the Physicians&#8217; Health Study (PHS, 1982-2010) combined, we evaluated four <i>SLCO2B1<\/i> SNPs identified in prior studies and time from diagnosis to lethal disease (metastases\/prostate cancer-specific death), adjusting for age, calendar year of diagnosis, and principal components of genetic variation to account for local ancestry. We also conducted a systematic review and harmonized allele coding in prior studies for a two-stage dose-response meta-analysis with additive allele coding.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the 3208 men in the prospective cohort study, 96% were diagnosed with clinically localized (T1\/T2) prostate cancer. Most were treated with radical prostatectomy (47%) or radiation (36%); 33% ever received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Over up to 32 years of follow-up (median, 14.4 years), 382 lethal events occurred. The intronic SNP rs1077858 had the strongest association with lethal disease (hazard ratio [HR] per minor allele 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.33). Data were suggestive of potential differences for the four SNPs by use of statins and ADT but were not conclusive. The systematic review identified 2 additional population-based studies of primary disease and 4 hospital-based studies of advanced disease, none of which studied effect modification by statins or ADT. Among these 2377 men, 1088 events of recurrence, metastasis, or prostate cancer death occurred. In a meta-analysis of all 7 studies, the genotype of the exonic SNP rs12422149 (minor allele frequency 15%) that results in lower androgen uptake was associated with better outcomes (HR per minor allele 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.93), with little between-study heterogeneity (<i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> 0.27).

In Bangladesh, &#62;57 million individuals are chronically exposed to iAs through drinking-water. There is inter-individual variation in arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME) due to inherited genetic variation, and this variability impacts individuals&#8217; internal dose of arsenic and their susceptibility to toxicity. Identifying genetic determinants of AME to help identify individuals at higher risk for toxicity has been a focus within genetic epidemiology research. Consumed arsenic enters the blood in as iAs. Sequential reduction and methylation reactions are catalyzed by glutathione and arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) respectively, producing monomethylated (MMA) and dimethylated (DMA) forms of arsenic. Generation of DMA is beneficial because DMA is more easily expelled from the body in urine compared to MMA or iAs.<sup> <\/sup>AME is often represented by the percent of the arsenic species in urine that exists as DMA. Previous studies have identified genetic variants in the AS3MT (10q24.32) and FTCD (21q22.3) regions as showing clear association with AME. However, additional regions containing variants showing robust and replicable association with AME have not yet been identified, although studies of AME heritability suggest that additional variants are likely to exist. We used data from &#62;7,000 participants from two studies of Bangladesh individuals with varying levels of exposure to arsenic through drinking water (The Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study, HEALS, and the Bangladesh Vitamin E and Selenium Trial, BEST) to identify genetic variation that impacts individuals&#8217; ability to metabolize arsenic and their susceptibility to toxicity (i.e., arsenic-induced skin lesions)<i>. <\/i> Our preliminary results suggest novel associations with AME in the 1q24.3 region (p= 5.16 x10<sup>-14<\/sup>) and with skin lesion risk in the 6p21.33 region (p=1.37x10<sup>-9<\/sup>). The identified variants in the 1q24.3 region reside in and around the<i> FMO3<\/i> gene. FMOs are enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism; therefore, it is plausible that they may play a role in arsenic metabolism. The 6p21.33 signal is in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which contains numerous key immune response genes (e.g., HLA genes). These results suggest the existence of additional variants associated with AME and arsenic toxicity risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/db67d421-9c78-4939-a3c7-af86209d9546\/@z03B8ZCG\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Arsenic,Genetic susceptibility,Environmental exposure,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13554"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lizeth I.

The aim of our study is to characterize genetic determinants of PSA levels in cancer-free men in order to personalize PCa screening. We hypothesize that test accuracy may be improved by accounting for PSA variation that is due to genetic factors and does not reflect PCa.<br \/>We conducted the largest ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSA in men without PCa (N=95,768; 85,924 predominantly European ancestry) using data from the UK Biobank, BioVU, PLCO, and Kaiser Permanente cohorts. Our GWAS discovered 129 PSA-associated variants (<i>P<\/i>&#60;5&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>), 82 of which were novel. A polygenic score (PGS<sub>PSA<\/sub>) comprised of these 129 variants was successfully validated in two cancer prevention trials: PCPT (n=5737) and SELECT (n=22,247). PGS<sub>PSA <\/sub>explained 7.3% (p=7.0&#215;10<sup>-98<\/sup>) of variation in baseline PSA in PCPT and 8.7% (p=7.0&#215;10<sup>-476<\/sup>) in SELECT. Importantly, PGS<sub>PSA<\/sub> was not associated with PCa status in PCPT (OR=0.98, p=0.71) or SELECT (OR=1.04, p=0.98), which confirms that it reflects benign PSA variation.<br \/>Potential clinical utility of PSA genetic adjustment was explored by examining reclassification at thresholds used for biopsy referrals in a real-world setting at Kaiser Permanente. We estimated that correction using PGS<sub>PSA<\/sub> would have avoided 21.2% of negative biopsies in non-cases. Reclassification below the biopsy referral threshold was also more common in cases, particularly with low-grade disease with Gleason score &#60;7 (7.3% below vs. 2.6% above). Overall, genetic correction of PSA appeared to improve the accuracy of referral decisions, with a Net Reclassification Index of 0.148.<br \/>Next, we evaluated genetically adjusted PSA in the context of detection of aggressive PCa, defined as Gleason score &#8805;7, PSA&#8201;&#8805;10&#8201;ng\/mL, T3-T4 stage, and\/or distant or nodal metastases. Genetically adjusted baseline PSA was more robustly associated with aggressive PCa than observed PSA and yielded a higher area under the curve (AUC) in PCPT (OR=3.03, p=3.5&#215;10<sup>-7<\/sup>; AUC: 0.72 vs. 0.68) and SELECT (OR=3.37, p=3.5&#215;10<sup>-11<\/sup>; AUC: 0.78 vs. 0.74) when added to a baseline model with age and trial arm. Furthermore, genetically adjusted PSA provides complementary information to PCa risk variants. In PCPT, a logistic regression model that included genetically corrected PSA and the 269-variant PGS<sub>PCa<\/sub> achieved a significantly higher AUC than PGS<sub>PCa-269<\/sub> alone for aggressive PCa (AUC: 0.73 vs. 0.65, p=3.3&#215;10<sup>-4<\/sup>) and overall PCa (AUC=0.69 vs. 0.66, p=3.3&#215;10<sup>-6<\/sup>).<br \/>Our work provides evidence that accounting for genetic determinants of PSA has the potential to reduce unnecessary testing and overdiagnosis of low-risk PCa, as well as increase detection of aggressive disease. Larger and more diverse study populations are required to fully characterize the genetic basis of PSA variation and optimize its clinical utility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13f1de98-2d74-44ca-b4a7-3b744812a102\/@z03B8ZCG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA),Precision medicine,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13556"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Linda Kachuri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca E.

PCa is one of the leading malignant tumors in US men. This research aims to investigate various molecular regulatory pathways triggered by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to discover Hub genes as diagnostic or therapeutic targets to improve PCa prognosis. We used eight PCa Microarray datasets (GSE46602, GSE38241, GSE69223, GSE3325, GSE32571, GSE55945, GSE104749, and GSE26126) from the NCBI\/GEO. We identified DEGs from datasets by comparing PCa (n=247) and control prostate tissues (n=221) using GEO2R with the criteria of |log2FC| (fold change) &#8805; 1 and P-value &#60; 0.05. We implemented volcano plot analysis and generated Venn diagrams to identify overlapping genes. We then applied DAVID.6.8, Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis to potentially associate DEGs' with biological functions and pathways in PCa pathogenesis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the recognized DEGs and the significant nodes were constructed by STRING and visualized by Cytoscape and GeneMANIA. Finally, module analysis of the PPI network was performed by MCODE and CytoHubba to identify the Hub genes. The eight GEO datasets include total DEGs = 11595, upregulated = 3795, and downregulated genes = 3548. We identified 472 DEGs overlappings (the Key Genes) among the eight datasets with 357 downregulated and 115 upregulated genes. The GO and KEGG analysis for genes showed that they were principally involved in cell adhesion, focal adhesion, cell proliferation, calcium signaling pathway, extracellular exosome, and cancer pathways. The top significant (P-Value &#60;1.20E-03) transcriptional factors (TFs) connected with downregulated (BACH1, AP1, BACH2, LYF1, SRF, and NF1) and upregulated (MYOD, NFKAPPAB, MSX1, ROAZ, PAX5, and MYCMAX) genes. The PPI networks and the significance analysis were performed (STRING local clustering coefficient of 0.37, average node degree 4.53 and PPI enrichment p-value &#60; 1.0E-16), GeneMANIA maximum resultant genes = 20, and maximum resultant attributes=10.

Results discovered eleven Hub genes (BDNF, CCK, GRIA2, NTRK2, SNAP25, SYN1, SYT1, ACTG2, ANXA2, ANXA6, and MFGE8). The 11 Hub genes among 472 DEGs directly correlate to the recurrence and prognosis of PCa. The discovered Hub genes and pathways may be potentially involved in PCa etiology in different patients. Recognizing these Hub genes may further assist in understanding molecular pathology to develop diagnostic and treatment regimens for a better prognosis of PCa patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Differential gene expression,Transferrin receptor,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13600"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Diaaidden Alwadi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alok Deoraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quentin Felty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deodutta Roy<\/i><\/presenter>.

Ubiquitous environmental heavy metal (HM) exposure\/toxicity appears pro-carcinogenic in several human cancers. However, studies in the current scientific literature have not elucidated specific connections between HM exposure and mammographically detected increases in breast density.<br \/><b>Objective: <\/b>To determine whether increases in heavy metals (ie, chromium, arsenic and cadmium) measured in urine as a biomarker for long-term exposure, associate with increased MD in a female study cohort in Arkansas.<br \/><b>Design, Setting, Participants: <\/b>One hundred thirty-nine participants in the Arkansas Rural Community Health (ARCH) study cohort, recruited through a mobile mammography unit at baseline, were included in this pilot study. Demographic\/health history questionnaire data, urine, blood and saliva samples and incident mammograms classified by BI-RADS were ascertained after informed consent. Study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).<br \/><b>Main Outcome and Measures:<\/b> Urinary chromium, arsenic and cadmium levels were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The concentrations of HM were adjusted for urinary creatinine and specific gravity and the results categorized into tertiles. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between HM exposure and MD. Association of both continuous and categorical variables were examined. Confounding variables in the multivariable models including age, race, BMI, age at menarche and smoking history were determined by <i>a priori<\/i> knowledge and statistical assessment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between each tertile of HM exposure and MD were used for the assessment. For the unadjusted model, increasing ORs for MD were noted with increased levels of both Chromium and Arsenic exposure. Increased ORs for MD were observed with increased levels of Chromium, Arsenic and Cadmium exposure in the multivariable adjusted model. However, none of these associations demonstrated statistical significance in this limited pilot study.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Positive associations between HM exposure and MD were noted after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, age at menarche and smoking history in this pilot study.

This relationship is only partly explained by unhealthy behavioral habits and inadequate access to health care. Chronic life stress is more prevalent in low SES communities and has been shown to affect DNA methylation and the immune system. Yet, the biological processes that mediate the impact of SES on health to promote the development of chronic diseases like cancer remain poorly understood. Our study aims to uncover whether DNA methylation is linked to neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and to a biology that causes inflammation and changes to the immune environment, thereby promoting breast cancer progression and affecting response to therapy. These differences have been characterized in 181 breast tumors (108 African American (AA), 73 European American (EA)). We geocoded the addresses of our participants and linked these data to a Census-level neighborhood deprivation index (NDI). Statistically significant associations between NDI, race and methylation beta values were determined using linear regression followed by Benjamini-Hochbergcorrection. Of the 18 CpG sites that differed between individuals with low and high neighborhood deprivation, 3 were hypermethylated in women with high neighborhood deprivation. We also used methylCIBERSORT to estimate immune subpopulation differences by race group, breast cancer subtype, and ND. For AA women with aggressive triple negative breast cancer, neighborhood deprivation was significantly positively correlated with absolute immune cell scores (p=0.011), including a higher absolute score for endothelial cell expression (p=0.006) and eosinophils (p=0.049). Our findings give insight into how socioeconomic position and neighborhood deprivation may affect cancerous mammary gland biology by altering DNA methylation patterns.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f6f7b32e-59a4-4e90-9439-1bba4ee4c9dc\/@z03B8ZCG\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Breast cancer,Environmental exposure,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13560"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brittany D.

While several hereditary cancer syndromes are known, genetic risk factors for multiple primary cancers in an individual are not well understood. Identification of susceptibility variants to multiple primary tumors could enhance screening for subsequent cancers among those at highest risk.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a pan-cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS) of multiple primary cancers among participants from 2 prospective cohorts: Kaiser Permanente and the UK Biobank. The primary GWAS within cohorts used logistic regression to estimate associations for diagnosis with &#8805;2 invasive or in situ primary cancers other than non-melanoma skin (N=11,773, 8,928 invasive only) compared to cancer-free controls (N=420,101). Case-case analyses were conducted to distinguish associations with multiple cancers from single-cancer (N=90,576) susceptibility signals. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, first 10 genetic ancestry principal components, and array. Cohort-specific GWAS results were meta-analyzed. We highlight genome-wide significant (p&#60;5&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>) results with consistent effect direction across the 2 studies.<br \/>Results: We identified 8 variants associated with multiple

Individuals with a prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer who have not received genetic testing represent missed opportunities to identify individuals with inherited high risk cancer variants. The Genetic Risk Assessment in Ovarian Cancer (GRACE) study aims to address this significant healthcare gap using a &#8220;traceback testing&#8221; approach to identify individuals with a prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer and offer genetic risk information to them and their family members. Tumor registry data at two integrated health care systems (Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Colorado) was used to identify individuals diagnosed with ovarian cancer from 2008 to 2019 who either did not receive genetic testing or had genetic testing limited to <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i> and could benefit from more recent testing and testing using a comprehensive panel of cancer risk genes. Of the 180 eligible individuals contacted for participation, 51 have enrolled and consented to testing, reflecting an uptake rate of 28%. Of the 34 participants with genetic testing results, 7 (21%) have been found to carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a cancer risk gene. The study genetic counselor supported these participants in sharing their genetic test results with at-risk relatives to facilitate cascade testing. Of the 20 at-risk relatives eligible for cascade testing, 10 have undergone genetic testing (50% cascade testing uptake) of which 4 have been found to carry the familial variant. Overall, these findings indicate the promise of such traceback testing approaches in providing potentially life-saving information to individuals and their family members at increased genetic risk for cancer who may otherwise be missed. Future efforts of the GRACE study will focus on the feasibility of leveraging archived pathology tissue to provide genetic risk information to family members of individuals with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer who are deceased. The GRACE study can inform broad implementation of future traceback programs across health care systems, providing life-saving information to prevent and mitigate the burden of ovarian and other hereditary cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad598ebe-1df9-4a8e-bd7a-c207b0395fc5\/@A03B8ZCH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hereditary cancer,Genetic factors,Ovarian cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13596"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Heather S.

The published GWAS have been largely performed on pooled histological subtypes of glioma and most of these studies have been conducted primarily for adult tumors. Therefore, we aimed to perform the first GWAS specifically for ependymoma to identify the genetic variants associated with the risk of these tumors and to investigate the similarities\/differences between the genetic architectures of adult and pediatric ependymomas.<br \/>Germline SNP-array data of ependymoma cases were obtained from nine studies or biobanks across the United States and Europe. Controls were randomly selected with the ratio of 10:1 from three of those studies and a separate publicly available database. Additionally, germline whole genome sequencing data on cases and controls from St Jude Cloud were utilized. In total, 483 pediatric cases and 265 adult cases and 5592 controls were included. The same quality control procedures were applied to all studies. Data were imputed based on the Haplotype Reference Consortium using EAGLE. Meta-analyses were performed based on GMMAT and logistic regression. The results were adjusted for sex, ancestry and PCs. PAINTOR was used to identify the plausible causal variants, and eQTL and gene enrichment analyses were performed.<br \/>We identified 16 independent significant SNPs which were specifically associated with pediatric ependymoma risk, of which 10 SNPs were plausible causal. The significant variants were located on 1q32.2 (<i>KCNH1<\/i>), 2p14 (<i>MEIS1-AS3<\/i>), 4p15.32 (<i>LDB2<\/i>), 6p21.32 (<i>HLA-DQA<\/i>), 6p21.33 (<i>BX927178\/CR759828<\/i>), 7p21.3 (<i>UMAD1<\/i>), 11p12 (<i>LRRC4C<\/i>), 11q24.2 (<i>KRT18P59<\/i>), 14q24.3 (<i>SPTLC2<\/i>), and 21q11.2 (<i>LOC112268283\/FEM1AP1<\/i>). The 18 identified independent significant SNPs associated with risk of adult ependymoma were located on 4p16.1 (<i>SORCS2<\/i>), 6p11.2, 6p21.31(<i>KCTD20<\/i>), 6p21.32 (<i>HLA-DQA1<\/i>), 7q31.32, 8p23.1 (<i>LOC157273<\/i>), 8q24.3 (<i>PLEC<\/i>), 10p13 (<i>PTER<\/i>), 11q23.3 (<i>GRIK4<\/i>), 19q13.11 (<i>CEP89<\/i>), and 22q11.1 (<i>XKR3<\/i>), of which 8 variants were plausible causal. One intronic variant associated with susceptibility of both pediatric and adult ependymomas was detected; rs68160486 (<i>CCDC85A<\/i> 2p16.1 <i>P<\/i><sub>Pediatric<\/sub>=3.41x10<sup>-8<\/sup>, <i>P<\/i><sub>Adult<\/sub>=2.12x10<sup>-8<\/sup>).<br \/>The genetic architectures of adult and pediatric ependymomas appear to largely differ from one another.

We previously found that intratumoral expression of one protein, the vitamin D receptor, was associated with better prognosis among men with prostate cancer. Little data exists about long-term outcomes according to a more comprehensive profile of intratumoral vitamin D signaling.<br \/>Methods: We undertook a comprehensive assessment of intratumoral vitamin D-related gene expression among men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians&#8217; Health Study (PHS) by creating a score based on gene expression. Of 11 literature-derived candidate genes, 6 genes had sufficient mRNA expression in tumor tissue to include in this study. The equally-weighted vitamin D pathway-related score captured genes that are upregulated (<i>VDR, RXRA, CYP2R1, CYP27A1<\/i>) and downregulated (<i>DHCR7, CYP24A1<\/i>) with activation of vitamin D signaling. Higher pathway-related scores reflected expression associated with increased vitamin D signaling. The association between the vitamin D score in prostate tumors and lethal disease (metastases\/prostate cancer-specific death) <i>vs<\/i>. indolent disease (no metastases after &#62;8 years of follow-up) was assessed using logistic regression.<br \/>Results: Among 404 men with prostate cancer, there were 119 lethal events over up to 30 years of follow-up (median: 17 years). Correlations in expression between the six vitamin D-related genes were weak in both tumor tissue (Spearman |<i>r<\/i>|: 0.03&#8211;0.18) and tumor-adjacent histologically normal-appearing tissue (Spearman |<i>r<\/i>|: 0.00&#8211;0.24), consistent with their involvement in multiple signaling pathways. Vitamin D-related genes and the vitamin D pathway score were downregulated in tumor tissue compared to tumor-adjacent histologically normal-appearing tissue (mean difference for the score: -0.35, 95% confidence interval: -0.52 to -0.19). Higher intratumoral vitamin D signaling based on the pathway-related score was inversely associated with lethal prostate cancer even after adjusting for age at diagnosis and Gleason score (odds ratio for the highest vs. lowest quartile: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.86). This inverse association was similar in tumors with and without the <i>TMPRSS2:ERG<\/i> fusion as well as those with high or low vitamin D receptor protein expression.<br \/>Conclusion: This study of prostate tissue vitamin D-related gene expression provides novel evidence in support of the hypothesis that more active intratumoral vitamin D signaling may lead to better prostate cancer outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b85932d8-0f01-4a4a-97aa-ad696dc3d0c6\/@A03B8ZCH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Vitamin D,Mortality,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13591"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jane Bailey Vaselkiv<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sydney T.

Many studies have demonstrated that genetic variants in DNMT genes play a role in cancer development, including breast cancer. However, the impact of SNP-SNP interactions for DNMTs associated with breast cancer risk is unclear. The objective is to evaluate SNP-SNP interactions associated with breast cancer risk.<br \/>Methods: We selected 14 SNPs in 3 <i>DNMT<\/i> genes (<i>DNMT1<\/i>, <i>DNMT3A,<\/i> and <i>DNMT3B<\/i>) for the 4,195 women (1:2 match for breast cancer cases and controls), including 1,085 African Americans (AAs) and 3,110 European Americans (EAs) in the Arkansas Rural Community Health (ARCH) cohort. We included different inheritance models (dominant, recessive, and additive) for individual SNP effects, using logistic regressions with breast cancer status (yes\/no) as the outcome. Two-way SNP-SNP interactions associated with breast cancer risk were analyzed using the SNP Interaction Pattern Identifier (SIPI) approach developed by our research team.<br \/>Results: Out of the 14 DNMTs SNPs, we found two SNPs (rs7605753 and rs10196635 in <i>DNMT3A<\/i>) were individually associated with breast cancer risk (p&#60;0.05) in EAs, however, none was statistically significant in AAs. Interestingly, we applied the SIPI approach, targeting SNP-SNP interactions,19 SNP-SNP interaction pairs for EAs, and 6 pairs for AAs associated with breast cancer risk. These promising SNP interaction pairs had an interaction p-value less than 0.05, far less than the p-values of the 2 constituent SNPs. Also, these promising SNP-SNP interaction pairs are different between races. For example, the EA women with the CC + AT\/TT genotype in rs12991495 + rs10196635 (both in <i>DNMT3A<\/i>) had a higher risk of breast cancer risk than other genotype combinations (Odds ratio [OR]=2.2, p=0.011). On the other hand, the AA women with the TT+AA genotype in the SNP pair of rs2304429 (<i>DNMT3A<\/i>) + rs2290684 (<i>DNMT1<\/i>) tend to have a higher breast cancer risk than other genotype combinations in the same pair (OR=4.3, p=0.034). Notably, the individual effects of the two constituent SNPs are not significant (p=0.537 and 0.547).<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings support that the SNPs in <i>DNMT <\/i>genes play an essential role in breast cancer risk. SIPI is an excellent tool to evaluate SNP-SNP interactions, which can better predict breast cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71473805-9e48-4ec2-9d08-2480bb4aa4df\/@A03B8ZCH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-10 Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Polymorphisms,SNP,DNA methyltransferase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13570"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hui-Yi Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>L.

To date, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) shows substantial overlap with basal type cancer and it is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, poor prognosis and <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutations. In the present study, we screened for the prevalence of <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i> germline mutations in a cohort of 169 TNBC patients using PCR-Sanger sequencing and NGS with a cancer panel of 30 hereditary cancer genes or BRCA1\/BRCA2 genetic test.<br \/>Materials and Methods: 169 TNBC patients and their relatives were referred trough several public hospitals from six years (2013-2019). <i>BRCA1<\/i> germline mutation was screened using PCR-Sanger sequencing in 66 TNBC patients with strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer and 103 sporadic TNBC patients including all exons where a mutation was previously found in Algerian population (exons 2, 3, 4, 10, 17 and 19). <i>BRCA2<\/i> germline mutation was screened using PCR-Sanger sequencing in 24 TNBC patients with strong family history of breast cancer including all exons where a mutation was previously found in Algerian patients (exons 10 and 22). In addition, nine (9) TNBC patients with strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer were analyzed by NGS using <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i> test or a cancer panel of 30 hereditary genes (Colors genomics).<br \/>Results: The analysis of the genomic DNA samples of 169 TNBC patients revealed that 15 patients carried pathogenic germline variants in <i>BRCA1<\/i> gene and three patients carried pathogenic variants in <i>BRCA2<\/i> gene (10.65%). Eight distinct germline mutations in BRCA1 have been detected in this study: c.83_84delTG, c.181T&#62;G, c.798_799delTT, c.505C&#62;T, c.923_924delGC, c.2125_2126insA, c.5257A&#62;G and deletion of exon 15. Interestingly, the recurrent and specific mutation c.83_84delTG has been detected in 4 unrelated TNBC patients. The pathogenic variant c.2125_2126insA has been detected in three unrelated families and also in the first relatives of 2 patients. The rare likely pathogenic variant BRCA1 c.5257A&#62;G\/p.Arg1753Gly has been detected in young female TNBC patient. The Del exon 15 in BRCA1 has been detected in two unrelated patients. Three distinct germline mutations in <i>BRCA2<\/i> have been detected in three TNBC patients: c.1813dupA, c.7654dupA and c.8485C&#62;T. Interestingly, these three mutations are reported for the first time in Algerian population. The c.1813dupA and c.8485C&#62;T pathogenic variants have been detected in two young female TNBC patients with a family history of male breast cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: In the current study, we detected recurrent germline mutations in BRCA1 gene in early onset TNBC patients. BRCA2 pathogenic variants have also been detected in young female TNBC patients. TNBC immunophenotype should be considered as an additional criterion for genetic counselling and testing of BRCA genes in Algerian women with early onset breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/deb526d6-2ec1-4ff5-aaee-1867dc5e33aa\/@A03B8ZCH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),BRCA1,BRCA2,Hereditary cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13572"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"b7ca4b75-7c0f-43b1-9281-e0b93f735976","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b7ca4b75-7c0f-43b1-9281-e0b93f735976\/@A03B8ZCH\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Farid Cherbal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiraz Mehemmai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hadjer Gaceb<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hassen Mahfouf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kada Boualga<\/i><\/presenter>.

While environmental factors play an important role in its development, LC risk also exhibits a high degree of heritability. Linkage analyses and genome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci associated with increased LC risk; however, much of the heritability has yet to be explained by these loci. Structural mutations, including copy number variations (CNVs), contribute to phenotypic diversity through dosage and\/or cis-regulatory effects. Unbiased CNV mapping is only possible with the use of high-depth, short-read sequencing and remains much more complicated and prone to false positives than SNP detection. As the tools necessary for CNV detection have improved, both somatic and germline CNVs have been shown to play an important role in disease, especially cancer, and often they account for a significant proportion of pathogenic variants. Little has been done to understand the role of germline CNVs in the biological pathways of hereditary lung cancer (HLC). The goal of the current project is to utilize the whole exome sequencing (WES) data in identifying the CNVs in the HLC families (&#8805;3 LC\/family) recruited by the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium (GELCC). This work uses germline WES data from 203 individuals (60 with a LC diagnosis) from 25 HLC families (&#8805;3 LC affected\/family). We limited our investigation to CNVs called by two independent tools using read depth to infer copy number changes and genomic breakpoints: GATK 4 (https:\/\/gatk.broadinstitute.org) and XHMM (https:\/\/atgu.mgh.harvard.edu\/xhmm\/). We have identified CNVs (deletions) in the following protein coding genes: KIR2DL1 (19q13.42; OR=1.77), DMBT1 (10q26.13; OR=1.56), SIBPB1 (20p13; OR=1.53), LILRA6 (20p13; OR=1.53), and HLA-DRB5 (6p21.32; OR=1.64) in &#8805;3 families in at least two individuals\/family. All of these genes with the exception of HLA-DRB5 were previously reported in LC studies; HLA-DRB5 was reported in other cancer studies. DMBT1 was reported to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene and frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed in several human tumors. It is highly expressed in lung and loss of expression was reported in LC cell lines. All CNVs identified in our study are consistent with Mendelian expectations and appear to be uncommon in the general population. CNVs in these genes may contribute to the lung cancer risk in the HLC families. Further validation of the identified variants is ongoing. We will consider overall CNV burden and disease association with identified deletions and duplications. The enrichment of rare variants in oncogenically associated genes that co-segregate with LC provides specific mutations for future work and improves our understanding of the inheritance and pathogenesis of LC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fc6b6dac-05f7-4f46-b87f-abfaffb6ceb7\/@A03B8ZCH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Hereditary cancer,Copy number variation,Whole exome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13576"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"3339028f-cf70-4cf3-916f-04c709306fb4","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3339028f-cf70-4cf3-916f-04c709306fb4\/@A03B8ZCH\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Waldron<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirsten W.

Moreover, genes that underlie observed GWAS associations are often uncertain or unknown. We address this gap through a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS), where we uncover potential genetic mechanisms (germline -&#62; expression -&#62; Subtype) for BC subtype at known and novel loci. Importantly, we incorporate both local and prioritized distal variants (MOSTWAS) across TWAS analyses, and leverage this feature of MOSTWAS for integrated discovery of tissue-specific genetic mechanisms across etiologically relevant (mammary breast, adipose, fibroblast, immune) tissues for BC.<br \/>Methods: MOSTWAS predictive models of gene expression were constructed in etiologic tissue using GTEx v8 (all available matched genotype-expression samples), and integrated with GWAS summary statistics (N=101,820) for BC molecular subtypes. We considered genes TWAS-significant if they passed a global Bonferroni threshold of <i>p<\/i> = 2.2 x 10<sup>-7<\/sup> (0.05\/183,260 gene-tissue-subtype combinations) and an additional permutation test (FDR <i>p<\/i> &#60;0.05) and gene mappability assessment.<br \/>Results: Across etiologic tissue, we identified 293, 186, 201, 153, and 171 unique TWAS genes for Luminal A, Luminal B\/HER2-, Luminal B, HER2, and Basal-like subtypes, respectively. Majority of these genes were identified at loci not uncovered in BC GWAS. Across subtypes, only 73, 46, 39, 32, and 38 genes, respectively, were identified in breast tissue, suggesting that germline-regulated gene expression in adipose, fibroblast, and immune tissue is also integral to risk of BC subtypes. The percentage of TWAS genes shared across 2 or more subtypes ranged from 29.7% for Luminal A to 38.6% for Basal. Moreover, among genes significant across more than one subtype for a given tissue, a sizable proportion (e.g., ~25% in Breast tissue) had discordant direction of associations. Together, these suggest divergent germline etiology for BC subtypes. We additionally identified genes such as <i>CBX8<\/i> which confer increased risk for all subtypes, in line with <i>CBX8<\/i>&#8217;s documented role as an oncogene for breast and other carcinomas. Lastly, we observed that the proportion of TWAS genes with a significant distal component to the TWAS association was highest among adipose tissue (~30%). Validation of these distal components for identification of shared and tissue-specific upstream regulatory elements is underway.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings suggest divergent germline etiology for BC subtypes, and suggest that germline-regulated gene expression in tissues other than breast (i.e., adipose, fibroblast, immune) is also integral to risk of BC subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6936f514-b5bf-43ce-b741-1e07fba22273\/@A03B8ZCH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Breast cancer,Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS),Molecular Subtypes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13590"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Achal Patel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Troester<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bogdan Pasaniuc<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Olshan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Love<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arjun Bhattacharya<\/i><\/presenter>.

Obesity and physical activity are well-established risk factors for colorectal cancer. Studies have shown that as a consequence of energy metabolism, imbalance between energy intake and physical activity can lead to obesity. In order to precisely examine the close interrelationship between obesity, energy intake, and physical activity, we conducted a genome-wide interaction study of obesity with energy intake and physical activity. We also evaluated the interaction between obesity susceptibility loci with energy intake and physical activity for colorectal cancer using the nested case-control design. We analyzed data on participants in the UK Biobank. Genome-wide interaction analyses of obesity with energy intake and physical activity was performed on 65,514 and 250,369 participants who have information on genotype, body mass index, and energy intake\/physical activity, respectively. We assessed the effect of obesity loci in the participants comprised 3523 colorectal cancer cases and 10,522 matched controls. The logistic regression model was used for finding obesity loci under a p-value threshold of 10<sup>-4<\/sup>. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colorectal cancer were estimated using a conditional logistic regression model. We found 21 loci and 44 loci of obesity with energy intake and physical activity, respectively. We also observed significant interaction of obesity loci with energy intake and physical activity for colorectal cancer. The obesity loci interacting with energy intake, including rs10828896 and rs7099260, were significantly interacted with physical activity for colorectal cancer. Rs426345 and rs12551684, which were the obesity loci interacting with physical activity, were significantly interacted with energy intake for colorectal cancer. The results of this study may provide evidence for bioenergetics in colorectal cancer carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/706a05db-411f-41c4-b605-7dd73637bc4d\/@A03B8ZCH\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-10 Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Obesity,Physical activity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/13579"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sooyoung Cho<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aesun Shin<\/i><\/presenter>.
