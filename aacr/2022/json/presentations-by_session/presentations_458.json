[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with limited systemic therapeutics. We have recently identified LCK, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, as a potential therapeutic target in select subtypes of cholangiocarcinoma. Proteomic profiling in other cancer types has proven beneficial in predicting response to systemic therapies. Herein, we present proteomic profiling of cholangiocarcinoma can predict sensitivity to a novel LCK inhibitor in patient derived xenograft models.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Proteins from 28 unique cholangiocarcinoma patient derived xenograft models (PDX) were isolated, labeled with tandem mass tags (TMT) and then analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (LC\/MS). Phosphopeptides were separately evaluated both by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography and pY-enrichment techniques. Following normalization, the global proteome, serine\/threonine phosphoproteome, and tyrosine phosphoproteome were analyzed and a proteomic signature was created for each tumor. These signatures were compared to PDX models with known response profiles to NTRC0652-0, an LCK inhibitor (1 resistant and 1 sensitive). The top 200 differentially abundant proteins (log2FC 2.6) were then utilized to develop a sensitive and a resistant signature. Correlation indices were then calculated across the 28 PDX model library. An additional predicted resistant and predicted sensitive model was expanded. Tumor bearing mice were randomized based on tumor volume to either treatment with NTRC (30mg\/kg PO daily), n=5, or vehicle, n=4, (10% Kolliphor, 10% DMSO, 80% Water, 2 mol equivalents HCl). Tumors were measured weekly with calipers and then weighed at the end of the study.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the top 200 differentially abundant proteins that represented the proteomic signature there was over representation of proteins with decreased abundance. There were only 12 proteins with higher abundance in the sensitive model as compared to the resistant. Utilizing the signature developed from the global proteomics data, nine tumors were predicted to be sensitive while 17 were predicted to be resistant to NTRC. PDX115 is a an intrahepatic CCA PDX known to contain an IDH1 mutation and was predicted to be resistant by modeling. The model was resistant to single agent NTRC with no demonstrable effect on tumor growth in vivo. PDX175 is a distal CCA PDX and was predicted to be sensitive by modeling. In vivo growth was inhibited by NTRC as compared to vehicle treated mice following two weeks of treatment (983% vs 435%, p=0.03). Additionally, final tumor weight was significantly lower in NTRC treated mice (0.651 g vs 0.317 g, p=0.04).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Cholangiocarcinoma proteomic signatures can be used to predict therapeutic response to a novel LCK inhibitor in preclinical models. Whether or not this could be applied to other treatment modalities in cholangiocarcinoma remains to be determined.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d7cfa580-730d-4f8c-b23d-f8219c6548a0\/@t03B8ZMh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Proteomics,Drug sensitivity,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14354"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan Watkins<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Alva-Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caitlin Conboy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong-Gi Mun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik Jessen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diep Vu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jos De Man<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rogier Buijsman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akhilesh Pandey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mitesh Borad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Gores<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rory Smoot<\/i><\/presenter>.

They are thought to mimic tumor biology more closely than traditional cell lines as a consequence of their<i> in vivo <\/i>heterocellularity and cell-matrix interactions, their 3D architecture and their relatively recent derivation. The genomic fidelity of PDXs is integral to their applications in both basic research and in translational medicine. We derived multi-region PDX models from patients enrolled in TRACERx - a study of the evolutionary dynamics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that uses a multi-region deep whole-exome sequencing (WES) approach - using more extensive spatial sampling to better understand the histological and genomic fidelity of the PDX approach.<br \/>We transplanted regional NSCLC tumor tissue subcutaneously into immunocompromised NSG mice. 134 regions were attempted, resulting in 60 passagable xenografts (44.8%). Of these, 44 regional xenografts (32.8% of all regions) were NSCLC-derived, while 16 (11.9% of all regions) were B-cell lymphoproliferative disease. Multi-region sampling revealed heterogeneous success of PDX derivation between regions within individual patient tumors. There was correlation between PDX derivation and tumor purity by WES. Overall, NSCLC PDX models were established for 22 patients (50%; range 1-5 regional models per patient; Table 1). Histologically, broad similarity was observed between PDX models and corresponding patient tumor regions, although in a small number of models, variability was noted between the patient tumor and the corresponding PDX model, or during PDX passaging. PDXs were subjected to WES for comparison with matched patient tumor regions.<br \/>Overall, our study demonstrates the feasibility of systematic multi-region PDX derivation and suggests that multiple spatial sampling of tumors could improve PDX take rates and generate PDXs that represent the intratumor diversity of heterogenous NSCLCs.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{0DA7797C-74A6-4850-BB2D-644EF361E6CD}\"><caption>Table 1: Engraftment rates of multiple spatial regions from non-small cell lung cancer tumors.<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Attempted<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>NSCLC PDX<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>B-Lymphoproliferations<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>No Xenograft: Regions<\/b><span style=\"font-family: -webkit-standard;

A better understanding of RCC biology is necessary to define the most efficient and personalized treatment or develop better antineoplastic drugs. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) have emerged as one of the most promising approaches for that. This tool was generated by using surgical specimens of 87 patients implanted in immunodeficient NOD\/SCID\/gamma (NSG) mice, 17 of those subcutaneously and 70 at the renal subcapsular space. A total of 19 PDX developed only after orthotopic implantation and included 15 cases of clear cell RCC subtype, 3 cases of papillary subtype, and one unclassifiable tumor. One case of a PDX of a clear cell RCC recapitulated the phenotype of vena cava tumor thrombus extension that had been diagnosed in the source patient. The overall take rate was 27%, and the time to observed tumor growth varied from 5 to 13 months. An association between tumor growth and take rate was suggested by increasing take rates of 18%, 36%, and 100% among pT1 (pT1a + pT1b), pT3a, and pT3b stage tumors, respectively. PDX take rate was unrelated to tumor size (p =0.071). Patients whose tumor fragments engrafted experienced worse overall survival (OS) than those whose tumor fragments did not engraft (p = 0.003). Data also suggested a similar trend of association with metastasis-free survival (MFS) (p = 0.063). The median MFS for patients with successful PDX was 21.6 months (95% CI: 14.9, 28.3;), compared to a median of 34.4 months (95% CI: 30.4, 38.5 p = 0.003) among PDX engraftment-negative patients. PDX characterization by immunohistochemistry and targeted sequencing of the 21 most frequently mutated genes in the kidney indicated that all PDXs preserved RCC identity and major molecular alterations. From 19 PDX, the sequences of 13 patients&#8217; tumor samples were compared with their respective PDX. In most patients (92% - 11\/12), at least one mutation in patients&#8217; tumor was identified in the PDX and in one case, no alterations were mapped. The most frequently mutated genes were <i>VHL<\/i> (50% - 6\/12) and <i>PBRM1<\/i> (41.7% - 5\/12), followed by <i>SETD2<\/i> (25% - 3\/12), <i>BAP1<\/i> and <i>KDM5C<\/i> (both 16.7% - 2\/12), and <i>ARID1A<\/i> (8.3% - 1\/12), indicating that all PDXs preserved RCC identity and major molecular alterations. These findings suggest that tumor engraftment capacity can identify patients at increased risk of relapse or death. Furthermore, pT1 stage tumors with the ability to engraft could also facilitate the identification of risk factors related to the rare pT1 cases with disease progression. These results suggest that the orthotopic xenograft model of RCC represents a suitable tool to study RCC biology, identify biomarkers, and test therapeutic candidates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a004837-1b9b-47cd-90aa-5ba7aec3bff3\/@t03B8ZMh\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,,Cancer risk,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14357"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vilma Regina Martins<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adriano Beserra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ethiene C.

Whilst progress has been made in understanding the biology of Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), the most studied NEC, research on NECs from other anatomical sites lags behind. In SCLC, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be used to generate patient-relevant mouse models; termed CTC-Derived eXplants (CDX) which are faithful in biology and chemotherapy response to donor patients<sup>1,2<\/sup>. A pilot prospective study is on-going to assess the potential utility of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and\/or CellSearch (CS) CTCs (EpCAM\/cytokeratin positive) as liquid biopsies and feasibility of CDX generation from patients with advanced stage extrapulmonary NECs undergoing palliative chemotherapy. CS CTCs are enumerated before and during treatment and marker-independent RosetteSep-enriched CTCs from parallel blood samples are implanted in immunodeficient mice to attempt CDX generation. Twenty-seven patients were recruited from Jun-19 to Nov-21. CS-CTCs were present in 19\/27; 70% pre-treatment samples (mean 57, median 2, range 0-685 CTCs per 7.5mL of blood). CDX generation was successful from a pre-treatment CTC sample from a patient originally diagnosed with a NEC of unknown origin who responded to Platinum\/Etoposide. Whole-exome sequencing of this CDX and matched pre-treatment cfDNA from the donor revealed largely overlapping copy number changes and common mutations including an activating PIK3CA mutation. In addition, there was no evidence of TP53 or RB1 loss (hallmarks of SCLC) in neither the CDX nor the donor&#8217;s cfDNA. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of this CDX showed a small cell NEC morphology, 90% Ki-67 positive cells, expression of EpCAM, pan-cytokeratins and neuroendocrine (NE) diagnostic markers, concordant with the donor&#8217;s biopsy. Further IHC and RNA sequencing revealed expression of the NE transcription factor atonal homolog 1 (ATOH1)2, CK20 and abundant Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) transcripts. These characteristics prompted reclassification of the original patient diagnosis as Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). There was only 1 CS-CTC in the parallel pre-treatment blood sample implying that EpCAM-negative CTCs may have given rise to the CDX. The CDX showed in vivo sensitivity to Platinum\/Etoposide, mirroring treatment response of the donor. Ex vivo cultures from CDX-derived cells grow as suspension clusters similar to &#8216;classic&#8217; SCLC and MCPyV-positive MCC cell lines. In summary, this first Merkel Cell Carcinoma CDX recapitulates the biology of the donor&#8217;s tumor. As the donor remains alive 25 months from diagnosis of advanced disease, their CDX can serve as an avatar to guide future treatment.<br \/><i>1.

A limit number of prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models hinders research to improve disease outcome. Some currently available PDX models were derived from the primary tumor samples are insufficient to recapitulate the clinical response at more advanced stages. In this study, we developed patient-derived models from patients with advanced disease and evaluated a novel AKR1C3 inhibitor in these models.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> Samples received from our Pathology Biorepository Shared Resource were divided into four groups and subjected to pathological staining, RNA extraction, xenografting in NSG mice <i>via<\/i> renal capsule and subcutaneous implantation in SCID mice and conditional reprogramed cultures (CRCs) or organoid culturing. The AKR1C3 inhibitor PB was modified from celecoxib. Androgen receptor (AR), AR-V7 and AKR1C3 expression were determined by western blot. The effects of the AKR1C3 inhibitor on enzalutamide sensitivity were characterized by growth assay and colony formation assay.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> Eight PDX models have been developed from prostate cancer patients with high Gleason score and\/or at the castration-resistant stages. Among the PDX models, one spontaneous indefinite cell line PS1172 was established. Early passage CRCs showed the epithelial morphology with AR positive expression. Through serially passaging PS1172 PDX with castration in SCID mice, the castration resistant cell line 1172CR was re-cultured from castration-resistant PS1172 PDX tumors. 1172CR cells were resistant to enzalutamide treatment and expressed high level of AKR1C3 and AR-V7. A novel AKR1C3 inhibitor (PB) which displayed superior potential to inhibit AKR1C3 activity and suppress enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cell growth was tested in these models. At the same dose, PB significantly suppressed 1172CR cell growth and colony formation compared to indomethacin and enzalutamide. PB also significantly suppressed AR\/AR-V7 protein expression compared to indomethacin in 1172CR cells.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> PS1172 and castration-resistant 1172CR cells are novel models with significant characteristics such as AR-V7 and AKR1C3.

The limited treatment options available for advanced STS patients underline the need for reliable preclinical models to test new therapeutic approaches. We established a panel of PDX models (XenoSarc) by subcutaneous implantation of fresh tumor specimens in athymic mice (nu\/nu NRMI). Once tumor growth was observed, pieces of tumor were re-transplanted to next generations of animals. At each passage tumor fragments were collected for histopathological and molecular characterization. In an ongoing effort 493 STS samples from 414 consenting patients treated at the University Hospitals, Leuven (Belgium) have been transplanted. A total of 67 PDX models from 20 STS subtypes have been established, meaning they have stable morphological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics over at least 2 passages. The PDX platform includes more common STS subtypes such as myxofibrosarcoma (n=12 models), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (9), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (10), and leiomyosarcoma (8), as well as models from ultra-rare subtypes, e.g. pulmonary intimal sarcoma, extraskeletal osteosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma and others. All relevant details about the donor patient and tumor characteristics, including sensitivity to the standard treatments, are known for every model. The models are well-characterized, with availability of molecular information on genomic profile (by low-coverage whole genome sequencing), and expression profile (by RNA sequencing). Xenografts are accompanied by ready to use tissue microarrays (TMA) from the models, which can be exploited for target identification and model selection for preclinical studies. Ex-mouse material can also be used to establish primary cell cultures and 3D organoids for in vitro screening purposes. The XenoSarc platform offers opportunities for studying the biology of various sarcoma subtypes including ultra-rare entities and was found to be a very reliable tool for early drug screening in STS in preparation of clinical testing of novel compounds. The platform is available for collaborative preclinical projects with academic and industrial partners.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8e2b1611-b5c7-436f-9dde-ddceedd710eb\/@u03B8ZMi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Preclinical testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14360"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Agnieszka Wozniak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luna De Sutter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lore De Cock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Britt Van Renterghem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Che-Jui Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yannick Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulla Vanleeuw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimberly Verbeeck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daphne Hompes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Friedl Sinnaeve<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hazem Wafa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baki Topal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joris Jaekers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dirk Van Raemdonck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Debiec-Rychter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raf Sciot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick SchÃ¶ffski<\/i><\/presenter>.

Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to find a tailored treatment alternative in the clinic. We need experimental models which really predict the efficacy of these alternative treatments. PDX and organoids are models that recapitulate more accurately the complexity of human cancer, therefore they are the best models we can use to address such clinically relevant questions. We aim to generate and characterize both NSCLC PDX, and PDX-derived organoids (PDXDOs) collections to perform preclinical assays, address to find alternative therapies for KRAS-mutant lung cancer. Among these therapeutic strategies we evaluated the efficacy of CDK4 inhibitors (CDK4i) in combination with ERK1\/2 inhibitors (ERK1\/2i). We studied the mechanism of action of the drugs in combination and identified possible predictive response biomarkers by RNAseq. We have established and characterized a collection of 45 NSCLC PDX models derived from early-stage patients, eight of them with KRAS mutations. All retained the principal histologic and molecular characteristics of their donors during the passages. We have also generated a collection of 15 PDXDOs, which maintained the same characteristics of their PDX donors. We evaluate the efficacy of CDK4i in monotherapy and in combination with ERK1\/2i in KRAS-mutated models. <i>In vitro,<\/i> using PDXDOs, the therapeutic combination tested reduced viability and downregulated signaling pathways involved in cell progression, this effect was observed in all PDXDO models tested, including those that were primary resistant to CDK4i in monotherapy. Similarly, <i>in vivo<\/i>, using the PDX models, the therapeutic combination tested produced a significant reduction in tumor growth compared to the drugs in monotherapy. The transcriptomic analysis showed CDK4i inhibited cell-cycle processes, whereas the combination therapy resulted in an increased inhibition and also reversed the CDK4i-mediated activation of PI3K or WNT pathways, which would explain the synergistic effect of the combination. In conclusion, we have established a collection of 45 NSCLC PDX models and 15 PDXDOs, which allow to evaluate (<i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>) the therapeutic efficacy of different drug combinations targeting different driver genes mutated such KRAS, which today has no effective treatments. These preclinical models will be really useful to integrate drug screening with biomarker discovery. Using our collections, we have demonstrated the combination of CDK4i with ERK1\/2i was more effective than the drugs in monotherapy, even for those cases which primary showed CDK4i-resistance. Therefore, we propose this therapeutic combination as a good therapeutic strategy to test in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/39fbb4cf-ccf0-436a-9a00-30ad4e9b9bf5\/@u03B8ZMi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,KRAS,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14361"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patricia YagÃ¼e<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Gomez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ãlvaro C Ucero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura GarcÃ­a<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Plaza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nuria Carrizo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JosÃ© Luis Solorzano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Paz-Ares<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Ferrer<\/i><\/presenter>.

We systematically evaluated and compared the response rates of MiniPDX assays and PDX assays pair-wise in 26 PDX models involving 3 types of cancers to 12 clinical relevant regimens, and found a high correlation between drug responses between the two assays, with sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 93%, respectively. LIDE has completed over 2,400 MiniPDX assays for precision medicine in clinical, including over 50 indications. Using MiniPDX for ranking the drug\/treatment approved in clinical practice facilitates prioritization of the best strategy for benefiting patient in precision medicine, while screening a series of small\/large molecules within the similar scaffold enables selection of the best candidate for further drug R&#38;D. Importantly, performing MiniPDX Mouse Trial using fresh tumor samples generated from clinic is beneficial for determination of potential clinical indication that would be fit for the investigating new drug. RNA or DNA can be extracted and enriched from only thousands of cells left from MiniPDX preparation by K cell technology, while RNAseq can be further analyzed via functional genomic imaging (FGI). The Omics data would be useful for determination of potential biomarkers to distinguish responders vs non-responders in population with certain indication(s) and further application in patient stratification to confirm inclusive\/exclusive criteria in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b4a42313-5610-45a8-b2ed-e99e0bbd2d2d\/@u03B8ZMi\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Organoids,Biomarkers,Gene profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14362"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Shuai Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Di<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rongyu Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaorong Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaimeng Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Danyi Wen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

RCC is the first solid tumor treated with immune checkpoint blockade and approved by the FDA for showing improvement of clinical outcomes. Immune checkpoints physiologically regulate immune response via appropriate signals to T cells and maintain homeostasis, while pathologically they can be co-opted by cancer cells to evade the immune system. Here we developed a humanized (Hu)-mice model with adaptive transferred human immune cells to test the role of ICB [anti-PD-1\/PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody (Ab)] in an orthotopic human RCC tumor-bearing xenograft mouse model and analyzed the correlation of innate immune cells with tumor burden.<br \/>Methods: Luciferase-tagged RCC cell line 786-O were injected intra-kidney into immune-deficient Rag2 mice. After tumor formation, mice were humanized by intraperitoneal injection of donor PBMCs (20&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup>\/per mouse). Treatment groups included control, anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 Abs or anti-CTLA-4 Ab (all Abs 200 &#181;g\/mouse, iv) weekly for 4 weeks. Tumor growth was measured by weekly bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and tumor weight at necropsy. The presence of human immune cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry staining. The significance of the differences between groups was determined by student <i>t<\/i> test. The Pearson correlation coefficient was obtained by analysis of correlation between different study parameters.<br \/>Results: BLI level showed a steady xenograft tumor progression for nine weeks. Anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 Abs treatment trended toward reducing tumor BLI level while anti-CTLA-4 Ab significantly decreased tumor BLI level (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01). Furthermore, anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 Abs reduced lung metastasis with a significant decrease of BLI level compared to control group (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). Meanwhile, humanization was evidenced by robust, elevated levels of human CD45<sup>+<\/sup> lymphocytes in the peripheral blood compared to non-reconstituted Rag2 mice. Infiltrated human CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells were found in mouse blood and spleen. Granzyme B<sup>+ <\/sup>cells, CD31<sup>+<\/sup> cells, and pan-cytokeratin<sup>+<\/sup> cells were found in tumors. Interestingly, we observed inverse correlation between circulating human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and mouse RCC tumor burden.<br \/>Conclusion: We successfully generated a humanized RCC mouse model which allows the RCC xenograft to grow steadily within the human immune system reconstituted Rag2 mice. Circulating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells are inversely correlated to tumor growth in this model. The PD-1\/PD-L1 or CTLA-4<b>-<\/b>targeted immunotherapies showed distinct therapeutic effects in our humanized orthotopic xenograft model, which may lead to personalized treatment targeting different immune checkpoints to reinvigorate anti-tumor responses in RCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,T cell,Orthotopic models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14363"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xin Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amita Bhattarai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravan Moret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Maresh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alicia Nicole Ray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Woods<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Graham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Latis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Bardot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

We link external resources like publication platforms and cancer specific annotation tools enabling exploration and prioritization of PDCM variation data (COSMIC, CIViC, OncoMX, OpenCRAVAT).<br \/>In addition to exploring PDCM metadata and data, the portal enables users to validate their PDX models against PDX MI standard, get a FAIRness score of the model of interest, explore originating resource data processing protocols, training materials and contact the model supplier\/provider.<br \/>PDCM Finder builds on the success of the PDX Finder resource (PMID:30535239). Critical PDCM attributes, such as diagnosis, drug names and genes, are harmonized and integrated into a cohesive ontological model based on the PDX Minimal information standard (PDX MI, PMID: 29092942). PDX MI has become established in the community for data exchange, adopted by the PDX providers, consortia and informatics tools integrating PDX data. We are working with the community on the PDCM Minimal Information standard in an effort to make PDCM datasets adhere to the FAIR data principles. We are driving the development of and promoting the use of descriptive standards to facilitate data interoperability and promote global sharing of models. We provide expertise and software components to support several worldwide consortia including PDXNet, PDMR and EurOPDX.

The natural progression of cancer in the immuno-competent host allows companion dogs diagnosed with sporadic glioma as an optimal model for preclinical testing of therapeutic approaches with human relevance, including immunotherapies. We have recently performed comprehensive genomic and epigenetic characterization of glioma in dogs to their human counterparts and found strong convergent evolution - shared somatic mutations and aneuploidies - among syntenic regions, including those of known pediatric glioma drivers, e.g., <i>PDGFRA, MYC, PIK3CA<\/i>. Here, using arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 imaging based phenotypic screen, we will probe potential oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressor genes within syntenic aneuploidies and thus outline functional versus non-functional heterogeneity of cancer aneuploidy. Specifically, we are conducting arrayed knockout screen (one gene per well) of 400+ genes within syntenic aneuploidies across primary cultured cells of canine glioma (n=2) and pediatric high-grade glioma cell lines (n=2). We will first capture images by high-speed confocal imaging system at three time points post-transduction of single guide RNAs (2 per gene) targeting each of 400+ genes in their separate wells. Then, using high-throughput image analysis and semi-supervised machine learning methods, we will measure well-based phenotypic features (viability, growth, and morphology) from these images. Genes will be ranked per cross-validated predicted probability in yielding either proliferating or slow-growing cell type based on learned phenotypic features using image data of knockout cells from and across wells. The top ranked genes will then be linked to oncogenes and tumor suppressors based on pathway and ontology analysis as well as further functional <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> (PDX) validation. We expect to find convergence of the most impactful molecular abnormalities (based on their knockout phenotypes) on candidate signaling pathways for the development of new drugs and repurposing of existing drugs for children and dogs with high-grade glioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f9dca528-cd43-466a-a0bd-e16f22fd6436\/@u03B8ZMi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,CRISPR\/Cas9,Aneuploidy,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14365"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samirkumar B.

However, most patients develop resistance and progress following long-term treatment. Thus, an ongoing clinical challenge has been the identification of biomarkers that predict response to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. There is also an unmet need to identify actionable targets for patients who have progressed. Currently, there are no clinically useful biomarkers to predict response and\/or resistance to anti-CDK4\/6 therapy. Hence, the goal of our study was to identify the therapeutic vulnerabilities of CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistant patient derived xenograft (PDX) models and identify key markers that longitudinally correlate with development of resistance and inform new treatment directions.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We obtained 4 different PDX models, two from patients who progressed after 2-4 months on treatment with palbociclib plus ET (i.e. intrinsic resistance) and the other two who developed resistance over time (i.e. acquired resistance) with disease progression between 12-18 months while on palbociclib plus ET. To elucidate mechanisms of resistance, we performed genome-wide expression analysis via RNA-sequencing.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The molecular assessment of the PDX models revealed different transcriptomic signatures for intrinsic resistance compared to acquired resistance. We identified 3,386 upregulated and 2,829 downregulated significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the acquired compared to intrinsic resistant PDX models. Further, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed enrichment of distinct driver pathways in the acquired-compared to the intrinsic resistant models.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Collectively, these results have identified potential unique targets for intrinsic and acquired resistance to guide treatment strategies. Thus, our ongoing studies are geared towards identifying and targeting distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities of intrinsic and acquired resistance to palbociclib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5859747-758e-4ecc-a3cc-ff5920828cee\/@u03B8ZMi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Molecular profiling,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14367"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicole M.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study found that 70% of all GCs have mutations that can be targeted with existing drugs, yet only four molecularly-guided therapies have been approved. GCs have strong disparities in incidence, mortality and survival that disproportionately affect different populations of color. No large-scale cancer genomic research has been carried out in U.S. minority populations. GC molecular data from U.S. minority residents is crucial to improve outcomes, as genomic phenotypes have been associated with differential prognosis and response to treatments. To our knowledge, minority patient-derived models have not been used to test GC therapies. In this study, several organoids lines from minority patients were established and used as an <i>in vitro<\/i> platform for screening effective therapies. After genomic data analyses, six minority patient-derived organoids with or without cell cycle regulator or PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway gene alterations were tested for responses to first-line therapies, targeted drugs and combination treatments. Among the 24 PDX models established, the efficacy study of PDX model PDX015 which has amplifications of CDK and AKT genes showed the targeting therapy (a CDKi) can effectively prolong overall survival of mice bearing xenograft treated with the CDKi (60 days), compared with those mice in control group (22 days). In addition, an AKT inhibitor was found significantly inhibited tumor growth in CDKi-resistant mice treated with the CDKi\/AKTi combination. In conclusion, investigating the efficacy of targeted therapies in these U.S. minorities will empower precision medicine applications in GC patients and improve GC treatment outcomes. Minority-patient derived tumor models have great potential in preclinical studies of chemotherapies and targeted therapies to address gastric cancer disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aa5cc6b6-1bfe-4bfd-96b1-42283336df80\/@u03B8ZMi\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Gastric cancer,Targeted therapy,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14369"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hongyong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ana Patricia Estrada-Florez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Lott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ted William Toal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexa Morales-Arana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alma Poceros-Coba<\/i><\/presenter>, UCaMP Consortium, <presenter><i>Ai-Hong Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Britney Halmai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Carvajal-Carmona<\/i><\/presenter>.

To this end, we have established and characterized a panel of XenoSTART patient-derived (XPDX) prostate models using both intact and castrated athymic nude mice. These models, designated ST1273, ST2347, ST4017, and ST4420, were characterized for receptor expression, genomic alterations, and in vivo drug sensitivity to relevant therapies.<br \/>Methods: XPDX models representing prostate cancer were established from primary (ST1273) or metastatic (ST2347, ST4017, ST4420) biopsy samples implanted into intact athymic nude mice supplemented with exogenous testosterone. Resulting models were passaged and further developed in both intact and castrated athymic nudes until growth stabilization. Resulting models were characterized using genomic analysis, including WES and RNA<sub>seq<\/sub>, receptor expression, and in vivo drug sensitivity studies. Models found sensitive to enzalutamide were conditioned to resistance in vivo by chronic drug administration and resulting models (designated STxxxx\/EZR) were characterized and compared with parent lines. For in vivo studies, activity of relevant treatments were benchmarked including enzalutamide administered once daily by oral gavage at 50 mg\/kg and docetaxel administered by intravenous injection once weekly at 10 mg\/kg. In vivo study endpoints included tumor volume and time from treatment initiation with %T\/C values and tumor regression reported at study completion; a %T\/C of &#8804; 20 versus control was considered sensitive.<br \/>Results: Each model developed in a castrate or conditioned setting retained similar receptor expression to the parent model including positive AR (2+\/3+) and PSMA (2+\/3+) staining. Genomic characterization identified a PIK3CA mutation in ST1273 models (PIK3CA<sup>E545A<\/sup>), AR mutations in ST2347 (AR<sup>T878A<\/sup>) and ST4017 (AR<sup>H875Y<\/sup>), and a TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in ST4420. In vivo, the ST1273 parent model was found sensitive to enzalutamide (%T\/C=11%) but insensitive in castrated mice (%T\/C=76%) and the ST1273\/EZR model was resistant to enzalutamide in intact (%T\/C=56%) or castrated (%T\/C=100%) mice. The ST2347 parent model was also found sensitive to enzalutamide (%T\/C=19%) but insensitive in castrated mice (%T\/C=50%).

This data has led to a better understanding of drug modulation and resistance mechanisms. Patient-derived tumor models, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid counterparts (PDXO), have been increasingly viewed as predictive preclinical cancer models. These models closely recapitulate tumor complexity, enabling the study of tumor identity for personalized medicine. Leveraging our large PDX collection models which are genomically and phenotypically annotated and validated, we have established and characterized a series of PDXO models to be used as scalable and high throughput compatible drug screening platforms. Here we conducted methodical analysis of drug response in paired PDX and PDXO models. In addition, trough deep whole- and phospho-proteomic analysis, we have analyzed and compared the effect of targeted therapies on protein expression and phosphorylation in both PDX and PDXO tumor models. Indeed, one of the most common post-translational modifications that is involved in cell regulation and intracellular signal transduction is reversible protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases. For this purpose, we have tested a KRAS inhibitor (AMG510), BCR-ABL TKI (Ponatinib) and EGFR TKI (Afatinib) respectively in lung NSCLC model carrying KRAS G12C mutation, colorectal model with RET fusion and Lung NSCLC model with EGFR exon 19 deletion. According to our historical data, a specific relationship between area under the curve value of organoid drug dose response and in vivo tumor growth has been observed, irrespective of the drug treatment. Furthermore, comparison between PDX and PDXO models deploying quantitative proteomic data enabled deep characterization of both global expression and signaling cascades modulated through small molecule inhibitors. Thus, we demonstrate the predictivity of organoid cultures to not only model in vivo drug responses but also to serve as a powerful platform to investigate target identification, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism via deep proteomics analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-04 Model organisms in drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Proteomics,Phosphorylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14371"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xiaoxi Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Tognetti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yuehan Feng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Limei Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leilei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessie Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roland Bruderer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludovic BourrÃ©<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henry Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

Risk factors include human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and phimosis. Molecular oncogenic pathways between HPV-Positive and HPV-Negative PeCa are difficult to validate because there are few preclinical models of PeCa and no models of HPV-Positive PeCa . Our goal was to establish PeCA patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to elucidate the molecular signature of HPV-Positive and HPV-Negative PeCa for therapeutic benefit.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>PeCa specimens from penectomies and inguinal lymph node dissections (ILND) were collected from 2019-2021. Tumor specimens were dissected and tissue coated in Matrigel and transplanted subcutaneously into NOD SCID gamma (NSG&#8482;) mice. Tumor growth was monitored and was harvested at &#8776; 1500m<sup>3<\/sup> for subsequent propagation. Short tandem repeat fingerprinting (STR) analysis was performed on genomic DNA from PDX tissue and parental patient tumor tissue. Immunohistochemistry was performed on all PDX models and original patient primary tumors to validate the expression of p16 protein, a surrogate marker for HPV-Positive disease. p16 positivity was determined using a 0-3 scoring where a score of 3 was assessed as positive and a score of &#8804;2 as negative. For HPV genotyping: PCR was performed using DNA ELISA kit HPV, followed by RHA Kit HPV SPF10-LiPA25.<br \/>Results: 8 PDXs were established from tissue from 7 patients. Age, race, and type of surgery were determined. SCC histology was confirmed in all the patients. Basaloid variant was present in 3 patients, and Verrucous variant was present in 1 patient. For pathological staging, 2 patients were staged as pT3N3Mx, 2 patients as pT2N1M0, 1 patient as pT3N0 and 3 patients as pT3Nx. One ILND had no evidence of disease. 2 PDX models (MDAPe3 and MDAPe7) were derived from two specimens from the same patient (1 pretreatment, 1 post-treatment). All models were matched to the patient's primary tumor by STR fingerprinting analysis. Squamous cell carcinoma histology was confirmed in all PDXs. 6 PDX models are currently in passage 3 and 6 PDXs were p16 positive. HPV genotyping in p16 positive PDXs detected high-risk HPV 16 and p16 negative xenografts were also HPV negative.<br \/>Conclusion: In our study, we established PeCa PDX models that recapitulated the patients' histology. We report to our knowledge the first HPV-positive penile cancer xenografts.

FH-deficient RCC most often occurs in individuals with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome (HLRCC) and is characterized by loss of FH activity, a key metabolic enzyme. Bevacizumab plus erlotinib (B+E) is a preferred first-line therapy for FH-deficient RCC. RMC is characterized by loss of SMARCB1, which is involved in ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. Platinum-based chemotherapy consisting of either cisplatin or carboplatin plus paclitaxel is the preferred first-line therapy for RMC. We developed patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of tumors exposed to the commonly used first-line therapies to allow functional characterization of the metabolic hallmarks of treatment-experienced RMC and FH-deficient RCC. Methods: Resected tumor tissue was immediately implanted into NSG male and female mice. After tumor engraftment, animals were euthanized, and the tumor tissue implanted into another set of NSG mice. PDX tissues were confirmed to be genetically identical to the original patient tissue by short tandem repeat analysis. Histology was confirmed to be identical between original patient tumor and PDX by a trained clinical pathologist. Four tumors from each PDX model and four normal human kidney tissue samples were analyzed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA). Expression of proteins shown to be highly expressed by RPPA were further validated by Western blots. Results: We successfully generated one PDX model for RMC and one for FH-deficient RCC, respectively. The RMC model was generated from a 28-year old male with sickle cell trait, who had previously received cisplatin plus paclitaxel followed carboplatin plus paclitaxel. His lesion was characterized as ypT3apN1pMx and histology was consistent with RMC. The FH-deficient RCC model was generated from a 24-year-old female with HLRCC, who had been previously treated with B+E. Her lesion was characterized as pT3apN1pM1 and histology consistent with FH-deficient RCC. Germline testing revealed a R233H pathogenic mutation in the <i>FH<\/i> gene. RPPA revealed higher expression of hexokinase II (10x HLRCC, 16x RMC), lactate dehydrogenase A (27x HLRCC, 17x RMC), and glutaminase (4x HLRCC) in PDX tissue compared to normal kidney tissue. Western blots confirmed higher expression of glutaminase 1 in both HLRCC and RMC compared to normal kidney. Furthermore, we observed substantially higher hypoxia inducible factor 2&#945; (HIF2&#945;) protein expression in PDX tissue from FH-deficient RCC compared to RMC PDX tumors and normal kidney. Conclusions: Our study revealed distinct metabolic features in PDX models of FH-deficient RCC following treatment with B+E, and of platinum-experienced RMC, these differences may confer targetable vulnerabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/794335ec-8204-4434-be3f-03d29f56ebca\/@v03B8ZMj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Metabolism,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14373"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manuel Ozambela<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Pieretti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Graciela M.

It is a highly heterogenous and complex disease, presenting serious challenges to preclinical drug development and biomedical research. Prostate normal development, growth and function, as well as most of its pathological drifts, are associated to androgen receptor (AR) pathway regulation. Most patients subjected to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) respond well to the treatment, however they usually progress into intractable castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) within 2 to 3 years. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of castration resistance underlying PCa progression is key to develop future therapies. Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX) are mouse models that recapitulate the disease more faithfully than any other in vivo model in terms of histopathologic, genomic and metastatic features, facilitating the translation of preclinical results in the clinical setting. PCa PDXs are challenging to develop, and only few are available to the scientific community. This lack of relevant preclinical models is a major limitation in PCa research. In particular, the development of PCa PDX models from castration-resistant tumors to explore new treatments against CRPC is a requirement. To fill this gap, XenTech and Gustave Roussy Institute are collaborating to develop a panel of PCa PDX models. In the framework of the MATCH-R clinical trial (NCT02517892), in which patients with disease progression under treatment are enrolled and switched to new targeted therapy based on the genetic alterations identified in biopsies, 8 PCa PDXs have been developed from metastatic lesions biopsy. In addition, we developed a PCa PDX model from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) obtained by leukapheresis at diagnosis. These 9 models, plus 4 PCa PDXs previously developed at XenTech, increases our PCa PDX panel to 13 models. All models were characterized at molecular level by whole exome and RNA sequencing and pharmacologically for response to standards of care, physical castration and response to the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide. This PDX collection is a valuable preclinical tool to identify pivotal mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to current therapies and develop novel treatment strategies against PCa and CRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6763c24c-8a28-4a7a-9864-fd49a74bde89\/@v03B8ZMj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14374"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Laura Brulle-Soumare<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludovic Bigot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katell Mevel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enora Le Ven<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luc Friboulet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Besse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>FranÃ§oise Farace<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean Gabriel Judde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefano Cairo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yohann Loriot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Olivier DÃ©as<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Four breast cancer PDX models from the Washington University Human in Mouse (WHIM) collection, ER+ WHIM20 and WHIM81, Her2+ WHIM43, and triple negative WHIM5, and one melanoma PDX models generated by the Wistar institute, WM4071-2, was utilized. For models WHIM20, WHIM5, and WM4071-2 all mice were injected with tumor cells on the same day, whereas for WHIM43 BND-G mice were injected in two separate batches. The WHIM81 studies were carried out at different times for the NSG&#8482; and B-NDG animal cohorts. Studies utilizing WHIM5, WHIM20, WHIM43 and WM4071-2, included a group of athymic nude mice as well. For all models, mice were injected with 1.5x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/mouse. The cells were mixed 1:1 with PBS:Corning Matrigel GFR and the injection volume was 100 &#181;L\/mouse. Mice were housed in Innovive individually vented cages and consumed Teklad Global Rodent Diet 2019 throughout the study. Tumors were measured multiple times per week using Biopticon&#8217;s TumorImager&#8482;. For all models except WHIM81, the tumors grew well and with very similar rate in both B-NDG and NSG&#8482; mice. WHIM20 and WHIM43 grew significantly slower in the Athymic nude mice compared to both of the ultraimmunodeficient mouse models, however, the growth of WHIM5 was comparable between all three models. The results from the WHIM81 model suggests faster growth in the B-NDG model compared to the NSG&#8482;, however, it is also possible that this is due to the different batches of tumor cells utilized at each implantation event. Thus, the B-NDG model represents a novel ultraimmunodeficient mouse model that can have great utility for tumor studies, particularly for hard to grow or slower growing tumor models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e666fdb3-7a76-4bf8-8823-1fa7a83d5f5c\/@v03B8ZMj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Tumor growth,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14376"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Michele Melton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hongmei Jiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma M.

At present, targeted therapy for breast cancers include endocrine blockage therapy for estrogen receptor positive (ER<sup>+<\/sup>) tumors and trastuzumab or lapatinib for HER2 positive (HER2<sup>+<\/sup>) tumors and CDK inhibitors for HER negative (HER<sup>-<\/sup>) tumors as well as PARP inhibitors for BRCA1\/2 mutations. There is still a high unmet need for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and relapsed breast cancers with specific mutations. Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and reliable breast cancer models are needed to develop new clinical therapies and better reflect tumor biology. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been widely used for understanding tumor characteristics and represent human heterogeneity more faithfully and thus are suitable for mouse clinical studies for predicting drug efficacy in the clinic. Here we report the establishment and characterization of a panel of breast cancer (BC) PDX for preclinical research.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>Tumor samples from patients&#8217; breast tumor or metastastic lesion obtained via surgery, biopsy, or pleural effusions\/ascites were engrafted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice to establish PDX models. The models were classified and characterized by histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and breast cancer specific biomarkers such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2. Genomic analysis of these models was performed by next generation sequencing (NGS). In these breast cancer models, the effects of estrogen on tumor growth and targeted endocrine therapy such as Fulvestrant were evaluated. The change of tumor volume over time was used to determine the growth rate and response to treatment in mice.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>A series of BC PDX models derived from primary patient breast tumor or metastatic lesions were successfully established and characterized. Key characteristics of parental tumors, such as histopathology, clinical markers, gene expression and copy number, as well as estrogen dependence was retained. The IHC data indicated various expression levels of ER, PR and HER2 across the panel, with TNBC being the dominant subtype. ESR1 mutation, which may play an important role in BC progression and endocrine therapy resistance, was also identified in an estrogen-independent model. <i>In vivo<\/i>, these models showed distinct tumor growth rates and different pharmacodynamic responses to standard of care agents. For example, ESR1 mutant model was responsive to Fulvestrant.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS: <\/b>The established BC PDX panel represent a range or ER\/PR\/HER2 expression status from primary and advanced cancer providing a series of preclinical models for breast cancer research and potential for mouse clinical trial enrollment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c090ca8d-bba6-47ab-bfc3-d5bac2b421cc\/@v03B8ZMj\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14378"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Leilei Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xueying Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Likun Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaobo Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henry Q.X.

Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are an increasingly accepted tool in oncology, providing biologically meaningful models of many cancer types, and potential platforms for the development of precision oncology approaches. Commonly, mouse models are used for the xenotransplant assessment of potential new therapeutic targets in cancers. However, animal models do not necessarily represent the real world scenario and are costly and time consuming. An attractive alternative to such animal experiments is the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay.<br \/>Methods: In this study, primary cultures from circulating cancer stem cells were established using sphere-forming assays. Subsequently, tumorspheres were transplanted onto the CAM membrane of fertilized chicken eggs to form secondary microtumors.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>We have developed an innovative reliable <i>in vitro<\/i> platform for cultivation of CSCs from peripheral blood of cancer patients. The number of tumorspheres increased significantly with tumor progression. Patients with metastatic disease had statistically more tumorspheres as compared to patients without metastasis (30 vs 10\/100&#181;l blood, p&#60;0.05). Patients with multiple metastases had more tumorspheres compared to patients with single metastases (60 <i>vs<\/i> 30\/100&#181;l blood, p&#60;0.05). The number of tumorspheres was positively correlated with Ki-67, Her2 status and grade score in primary breast tumors. Tumorspheres showed self-renewal, growth potential, invasion and differentiation <i>in vivo<\/i>. Tumorspheres could be successfully grafted onto the CAM and grafting positively correlated with aggressiveness and proliferation capacity of the primary tumor. These tumors growing on the CAM pathologically closely resembled the primary tumor.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>The number of tumorspheres cultured from peripheral blood of cancer patients and the success rate of establishing PDX directly reflect the aggressiveness and proliferation capacity of the primary tumor. Our results support the CAM model using cCSC as a valuable alternative for xenotransplant models. It allows establishing new PDXs and providing a fast, low-cost, easy to use preclinical platform for cancer biology research, new drug development, treatment individualization, and biomarker discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9888f3ec-74e3-4223-87a4-62bf55b00781\/@w03B8ZMk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14485"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Monika Pizon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dorothea Schott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrich Pachmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rainer Schobert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katharina Pachmann<\/i><\/presenter>.

These models are early passage, genetically characterized and associated with limited patient treatment history. As part of this effort, the NCI PDMR worked with the University of Nebraska Medical Center Rapid Autopsy Program and Johns Hopkins University Legacy Gift Rapid Autopsy Program to develop and optimize methods for collection, processing, and shipping of autopsy tumor material to maintain viability during overnight transit for use in patient-derived model development. These methods have been successfully transferred to two other participating rapid autopsy programs. To date, 412 autopsy tumor samples from 76 consented patients have been received for model development; 348 shipped overnight in media for next day implantation into NSG host mice and 64 cryopreserved prior to shipping for a comparative assessment of take-rate versus fresh tumor samples. On average 3-8 tumor samples, primary and metastatic, were collected post-mortem from the truncal region of each patient. Histologies include Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=43), Cholangiocarcinoma (n=6), Prostate adenocarcinoma (n=6), and 21 others with 1-2 patients\/histology. The overall age range of enrolled patients was 5-88yo. The post-mortem cold ischemic time for collections ranged from 1.5 to 20 hours with a median of 3h (avg. 3.75h; outlier &#62;11h removed). Collection methods were optimized to reduce contamination and increase viability of tumor tissues for successful PDX model generation. Of 348 fresh tumor samples collected to date, 69 PDX models from 33 patients have been generated (range 1-6 models\/patient) and an additional 55 samples are being monitored for growth in passage 0. The largest public single-patient PDX model sets are for melanoma (899932-113-R, n=6) and two pancreatic adenocarcinomas (521955-158-R, n=6, 217524-143-R, n=4). Important methods for reducing contaminants in autopsy tumor material include sterilization of the surface of the body prior to opening, use of sterile fields, using separate sterile instruments for each collection site, rinsing the surface of the resected tumor tissue, and use of antibiotics in the collection media. The now established SOPs are publicly available on the NCI PDMR website (pdmr.cancer.gov\/sops). We recommend incorporating as many of these methods as possible within the limitations of your individual site. Of the 69 models developed to date, 48 are publicly available from the NCI PDMR while the rest are undergoing quality control process prior to public release. Models developed from autopsy material provide a research tool to investigate tumor evolution, differences between primary and metastatic lesions, and assessment of differences in therapeutic response based on differences in the tumor biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6fb17f93-4934-4ab3-9e95-b26cce5fbadc\/@w03B8ZMk\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Modeling,Tumorigenesis,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/14501"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yvonne A.
