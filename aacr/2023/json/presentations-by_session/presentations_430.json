[{"Abstract":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mucin 1 (MUC1) are tumor-associated antigens that are highly co-expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and triple negative breast cancers, among others. MUC1, a glycoprotein essential for the formation of the epithelial mucous barrier, is hypoglycosylated and dimerizes with EGFR, a potent oncoprotein, in transformed cells. Dual-targeting of both tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) represents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat common malignancies. We generated a fully human anti-EGFR\/MUC1 bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (BSA01) from RenLite&#174; humanized, common light chain mice. BSA01 is conjugated with Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). BSA01 targets the extracellular domain of MUC1-C (C-terminal domain of MUC1), which is the membrane-bound MUC1 cleavage product that remains after MUC1 is cleaved, providing more access to the tumor antigen<i> in situ<\/i>. In addition, we generated affinity and internalization optimized binders targeting EGFR that increases the tumor selectivity, to avoid potential skin toxicity due to ubiquitous basal EGFR expression. Internalization assays demonstrate that the anti-EGFR\/MUC1 bispecific antibody used to generate BSA01 was endocytosed in tumor cells co-expressing EGFR\/MUC1 more efficiently than mono- or bivalent antibodies targeting EGFR or MUC1 alone. When conjugated with payload, BSA01 also exhibited strong anti-tumor efficacy <i>in vitro<\/i> against gastric, NSCLC and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Moreover, BSA01 showed similar activity <i>in vivo<\/i>, effectively inhibiting tumor growth in multiple cell-derived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models. These results suggest that BSA01 has great clinical potential for treating tumors co-expressing EGFR and MUC1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),MUC1,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yifu Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Chenzhang Shang<sup><\/sup>, Anqi Wang<sup><\/sup>, Jia Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Yuji Liu<sup><\/sup>, Hao Li<sup><\/sup>, Xiaopeng Li<sup><\/sup>, Gao An<sup><\/sup>, Li Hui<sup><\/sup>, <b>Frank An<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yi Yang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd, Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"920fa12e-9dcf-4c20-9e30-058f33a482e6","ControlNumber":"5559","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

TGF-&#946; is a crucial enforcer in promoting tumor cells angiogenesis, plasticity, fibrosis, and in regulating immune homeostasis and tolerance. The TGF-&#946; signaling controls innate and adaptive immunity in TME by inhibiting the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and effector T cells, while promoting the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Many studies have revealed that free TGF-&#946; mainly released from glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP)-TGF&#946; complex at the surface of activated Tregs, B, NK, and tumor cells. Existing antibodies or fusion proteins targeting TGF-&#946; cannot simultaneously block the TGF-&#946; releasing and naturalized free TGF-&#946; in TME, thus limiting the anti-tumor effect. Herein, we designed a bi-specific antibody named as BPB-101 with triple functions: specifically target GARP-TGF&#946; complex and\/or small latent complex (SLC), free TGF-&#946;, and PD-L1. BPB-101 can stop tumor expansion and recruitment, and may enhance the immune effector cells to eliminate the tumor.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> An anti-GARP mAb was discovered using a hybridoma platform and selected for binding with GARP-TGF&#946; complex\/SLC and free TGF-&#946;. An anti-PD-L1 nAb was screened out by VHH library and optimized in tumor-bearing mice. After humanizing, these two antibodies were successfully assembled to form a unique bi-specific antibody, BPB-101. The binding affinity of BPB-101 to GARP-TGF&#946; complex\/SLC, free TGF-&#946; and PD-L1 was determined by ELISA, FACS and SPR\/BLI. Report gene assay was utilized to detect the blocking activity of BPB-101. The TGF-&#946; secretion from activated Tregs was also analyzed. Finally, the anti-tumor efficacy of BPB-101 was assessed with a transgenic mouse model (B6-hLRRC32). To address the biosafety risks, the nonclinical safety profile was also evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys.<br \/><b>Results and Conclusion: <\/b>BPB-101 is a high-affinity antibody aims to reverse immunosuppressive TME by triple-targeting functions. The blocking ability of TGF-&#946; in not only latent form but also free form makes our BPB-101 distinct from M7824, any other existing anti-TGF-&#946; mAbs and anti-GARP mAbs. In a MC38-hPD-L1 tumor-bearing<i> <\/i>B6-hLRRC32 model, BPB-101 showed significant tumor growth inhibition of 93 % at the dose of 5 mg\/kg (p&#60;0.001), showing superior efficacy to monoclonal antibody alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1 nAb. In addition, BPB-101 showed durable responsiveness and a splendid safety profile with manageable adverse events. These striking results support the clinical development potential of our trifunctional agent as a monotherapy and in combination with other immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP),Bispecific antibody,GARP-TGF-&#946; complex,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wenxin Xu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jieying Xu<sup><\/sup>, Deyu Xu<sup><\/sup>, Hongjie Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Li Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Huan Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Siyuan Ye<sup><\/sup>, Mengshi Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Jiabing Wang<sup><\/sup>, Lieming Ding<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Betta Pharmaceuticals Co.,Ltd, Hangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"aa5a9462-9a65-4603-9adb-0ca768661d0f","ControlNumber":"5490","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

A monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) also has antitumor activity in patients with mTNBC. Previously, we reported that delivering ultra-high concentrations of nitric oxide (UNO) to mouse colon tumors stimulated innate and adaptive immune responses leading to the rejection of secondarily-induced tumors. Moreover, adding an anti-PD-1 antibody to UNO treatment resulted in primary tumor regression in 53% of the mice, the rejection of a distant tumors in all mice, and prolonged survival compared to control and anti-PD-1 arms. In this <i>in vivo <\/i>study, we investigated the ability of UNO to improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in the aggressive mouse breast cancer model, 4T1.<br \/>Methods: We tested two treatment protocols: 4T1 mice tumors were treated with either a single dose of UNO and anti-PD-1 or a repeated dose of UNO and anti-PD-1. In the single dose design, 4T1 tumors were treated with a single administration of UNO combined with Anti-PD1 administration starting one day after UNO treatment (n=9-10 mice per group). In the repeated dosing design, 4T1 tumors were treated with UNO twice combined with Anti-PD-1 administration starting on the first UNO treatment day (n=8 mice per group). &#8226; UNO treatment regimen: 50,000 ppm, 10 minutes, flow rate ~0.2 liters per minute &#8226; Anti-PD1 treatment regimen: 10 mg\/kg antibody was administered every 3 days for a total of 5 treatments.<br \/>Results (UNO Single Dose): The primary tumors of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were 13.2% smaller in the combined single-dose UNO group compared to anti-PD-1 alone 15 days post-UNO treatment.<br \/>Results (UNO Repeated Dosing): The primary tumors of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were 25.2% smaller in the combined repeated dose UNO group compared to the anti-PD-1 alone group 16 days after the first UNO treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Treating 4T1 tumors with single and repeated doses of UNO improved outcomes compared to anti-PD-1 alone. This suggests that local short-term treatment with UNO can serve as a treatment option for cancer patients with tumors that are not amenable to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nitric oxide,PD-1,Breast cancer,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yana Epshtein<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matan Goldshtein<sup>1<\/sup>, Selena Chaisson<sup>2<\/sup>, Jedidiah Monson<sup>2<\/sup>, Matt Johnson<sup>2<\/sup>, Amir Avniel<sup>3<\/sup>, Steve Lisi<sup>4<\/sup>, Hila Confino<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Beyond Cancer, Rehovot, Israel,<sup>2<\/sup>Beyond Cancer, Atlanta, GA,<sup>3<\/sup>Beyond Air, Ltd., Rehovot, Israel,<sup>4<\/sup>Beyond Air, Inc., Garden City, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a1b4f9dd-565a-4a2a-922a-0d8b68ff57e7","ControlNumber":"4225","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

We generated TAA-targeting Bispecific T-cell Engagers (BiTEs) and engineered adult stem cells to secrete twin BiTEs (T-BiTE-SC). The approach was tested in combination with in na&#239;ve T cells on established and primary patient-derived cell lines expressing various levels of the target antigens. Moreover, to further support the therapeutic action of T cells, and combat immune-suppressive microenvironment and exhaustion, we combined our T-BiTE SC with an immune-stimulating cytokine. We show the efficacy of the individual BiTEs against different primary and established tumor cell lines. Moreover, the T-BiTE-SC, significantly controlled the growth of a tumor expressing heterogeneous levels of the targeted antigens. The immune stimulation reduced T cell exhaustion and consolidated a Th1 phenotype. Altogether our study demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of an off-the-shelf immunotherapy, based on BiTEs simultaneously targeting tumor heterogeneity without the need for direct engineering of the immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BiTE antibody,Cancer immunotherapy,Glioblastoma,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Filippo Rossignoli<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Paulo Borges<sup><\/sup>, Rebecca Lumia<sup><\/sup>, Khalid Shah<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Harvard Medical School\/Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"351a7871-c3d9-4f06-b765-1d0cadbdcd22","ControlNumber":"3805","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Several other CD19 targeting therapies including CAR Ts are now available for R\/R DLBCL treatment warranting evaluation of potential therapeutic sequencing strategies. In this context, CD19 expression status may be assessed on patient samples post TAFA treatment. However, methods for detecting CD19 using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) following TAFA treatment are not standardized which may lead to data misinterpretations including confusion of CD19 epitope masking with CD19 loss or downregulation.<br \/><b>Aim<\/b> This study evaluated various CD19 detection methods following TAFA treatment using comprehensive panels of available flow cytometry (FC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) anti-CD19 mAbs, routinely used in laboratory practice.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> FC and IHC competition assays were used on TAFA pre-treated CD19+ cell lines to differentiate non-competing from competing mAbs, the latter resulting in epitope masking by TAFA.

ADAs that develop after immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) limit their therapeutic efficacy and increase the risk of adverse events. Mitigating ADAs would improve the efficacy of antibody-based therapeutics and identifying reliable biomarkers would allow for rational, evidence-based criteria for tailoring treatments. However, detecting ADAs is challenging and data regarding their biology and means to counter this phenomenon are limited. Here, we examined the development of ADAs to anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies in a mouse model <i>Pten\/Trp53<\/i>-null (DKO) prostate cancer and countered their negative effect with systemic administration of a JAK1\/2 inhibitor. Like human prostate cancer, adding PD-L1 ICB to androgen deprivation therapy has failed to produce a therapeutic effect in DKO cancer model. Our analysis showed that tumor-bearing DKO mice have increased levels of peripheral dendritic cells (pDC) of which &#62;80% exhibited high levels of PD-L1. Given this finding, we developed a system to monitor the development of ADAs against two murine anti-PD-L1 (aPD-L1) monoclonal antibodies clone 80 and 10F9.G2. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that a single-dose administration of the blocking antibodies effectively neutralized PD-L1 in pDC that lasted for four days. Chronic (twice\/week) dosing of the aPD-L1 antibodies strongly neutralized PD-L1 in pDCs, but the efficacy waned after 22 days. Using crossover approach, consisting of clone 10F9.G2 dosing for two weeks followed by clone 80, extended PD-L1 blockade in pDCs to 36 days, but did not improve antitumor activity. Blocking STAT3 signaling with the JAK1\/2 inhibitor AZD1480 restored PD-L1 blockade in pDCs and was associated with improved reduction of tumor burden. Further analysis showed improved neutralization of PD-L1 in cancer cells and tumor infiltrating immune cells in mice treated with AZD1480. These effects were associated with greater T and NK cell reactivity in tumors. Our study shows that the presence of ADAs is associated with lack of antitumor responses to ant-PD-L1 blockade in a preclinical model of prostate cancer and provides additional data that will improve our understanding of ADAs against immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study also offers an approach to monitor ADA development and a platform to investigate novel approaches to target ADAs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,PD-L1,Resistance,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marco A.

AST-021p is designed to demonstrate the immunologic efficacy by activating antigen-specific CD4+ Th1 cell in humans. Due to their ability to link the innate with the adaptive immune response, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are highly promising as adjuvants in vaccines against life-threatening and complex diseases such as cancer, AIDS and malaria. In this study, AST-021p was investigated to evaluate the immunogenicity and tumor growth inhibitory effect under the condition of combining with various immune adjuvants derived from TLR agonists, using in-vivo model.<br \/>Methods: Three different agonists of TLR (TLR-4, TLR-2\/3, TLR-7\/8) were assigned to investigate the immunogenicity in each group (4 FVB\/N mice\/group, total 4 groups). AST-021p was intradermally injected 3 times with different TLR-agonists and the immunogenicity was assessed from mouse splenocyte by HSP90-specific IFN-&#947; ELISpot method. We also examined the efficacy of AST-021p and selected TLR-agonist in MMTV\/neu Tg mice (4 mice\/group, conducted twice and A total 8 mice was assigned to each group). The combination of AST-021p and TLR-2\/3 agonist (AST-021p plus TLR-2\/3 agonist) was injected 3 times every 10 days to mice followed by inoculated mouse mammary cancer cell line. The tumor volume change and immunogenicity were evaluated.<br \/>Results: The most effective TLR-agonist as a potent immune adjuvant was a TLR-2\/3 agonist (L-pampoTM, supplied by CHA Vaccine Institute). AST-021p (100 &#956;g) plus TLR-2\/3 agonist significantly improved immunogenicity by increasing HSP-90 epitope-specific T cells up to 130&#177;10 per 1x10<sup>5<\/sup> spleen cell of FVB\/N mice (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). AST-021p plus TLR-2\/3 agonist also showed higher tumor growth inhibitory effect (170&#177;108 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) on post-implantation 35<sup>th <\/sup>day by suppressing mouse mammary cancer cell line (5x10<sup>5<\/sup>)-derived tumor growth, compared with a TLR-2\/3 agonist alone (1031&#177;450 mm<sup>3<\/sup>).<br \/>Conclusions: Combination regimen of AST-021p and TLR-2\/3 agonist (as immune adjuvant) demonstrated significant immunogenicity and tumor prevention effect in in-vivo study. These data supported the clinical study of AST-021p combined with TLR-2\/3 agonist as active immune adjuvant in certain tumor types, and phase 1\/2 clinical program would be expected to be initiated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heat shock proteins,T lymphocytes,Immuno-oncology,Immunocytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"JinHo Kang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Jee Hyun Choi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Min Ji Seo<sup>2<\/sup>, Eunjung Jung<sup>3<\/sup>, Byung cheol Ahn<sup>3<\/sup>, Jinback Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyo-Hyun Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyunwon Shin<sup>2<\/sup>, Eunkyo Joung<sup>2<\/sup>, Hun Jung<sup>2<\/sup>, Kyong Hwa Park<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Aston Research Institute, Hanam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Aston Sci.

The beneficial effects of these NSAIDs are mainly attributed to their ability to inhibit the production and activity of cyclooxygenases (COX1 and COX2) and prostaglandin (PGE2), which are known to promote tumor progression, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. We recently reported that administration of indomethacin, a prototypical NSAID, can enhance the antitumor efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in animal models. However, currently adoptive T cell therapy as a treatment option is only suitable for selected patients with certain types of cancer. Here, we set out to explore the utility of indomethacin in a chemo-immunotherapy setting that is readily applicable to a wide range of cancers. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is a widely used antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent with immunostimulatory activities when used at low-medium doses. We show that indomethacin had no impact on tumor growth but can significantly enhance the antitumor effect of CTX in multiple mouse tumor models. The beneficial effect of indomethacin was diminished in immunodeficient mice or CD8 T cell-depleted wild-type mice, indicating the requirement for the host immunity. Furthermore, the CTX and indomethacin regimen can sensitize tumors to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. scRNAseq analysis of tumor samples revealed the impact of indomethacin on the tumor microenvironment. Our data also indicate that the immunopotentiating effect of indomethacin can be independent of PGE2 inhibition, and involves the TRAIL-DR5 axis in promoting tumor regression. Other potential mechanisms, including modulation of chronic interferon signaling in tumor cells, have also been investigated. Altogether, our study sheds light on the multiple mechanisms underlying indomethacin&#8217;s beneficial effects, and highlights the potential of NSAID administration as a readily applicable and cost-effective approach to augment the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Chemotherapy,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ogacheko  D.

ICAM-1 is involved in many key processes such as cell-cell interactions, signal transduction and leukocytes trans-endothelial migration. ICAM-1 is constitutively present at low levels on healthy tissues but highly expressed in some hematological cancers and solid tumors, making it an attractive tumor target.<br \/>VBI-002 is a novel human IgG1 based CD47xICAM-1 bispecific antibody with excellent safety profile and potent single agent activities in xenograft models of lymphoma, multiple myeloma and some solid tumors (Cancer Res 2022;82(12_Suppl):Abstract nr 3430). The bispecific design allows VBI-002 to selectively block CD47\/SIRP&#945; binding in tumor cells with high ICAM-1 expression. In contrast to the benchmark CD47 monoclonal antibody, VBI-002 exhibits minimal red blood cell binding and does not cause hemagglutination. In non-human primate (NHP) safety study, four weekly doses of 60 mg\/kg VBI-002 were well-tolerated with only mild and reversible reduction in hemoglobin and platelets.<br \/>Here we further investigate the anti-tumor activities of VBI-002 in solid tumors. Gene expression analysis suggested that ICAM-1 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), melanoma and a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma. Flow cytometry studies confirmed the frequent co-expression of ICAM-1 and CD47 in these tumors. VBI-002 has potent ICAM-1 dependent SIRP&#945; blocking, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activities against cell lines of NSCLC, hepatocellular carcinoma, and melanoma. Furthermore, <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies demonstrated that VBI-002 has potent single agent activities in cell line derived xenograft (CDX) models of NSCLC, hepatocellular carcinoma, and melanoma. Weekly dose of 20 mg\/kg VBI-002 is sufficient to stop tumor growth or drive tumor regression in most models. Notably, VBI-002 is highly effective against NSCLC CDX models carrying Kras mutation and it synergizes with paclitaxel to provide additional anti-tumor activity. In conclusion, VBI-002 is a versatile novel CD47xICAM-1 bispecific antibody with potent single agent activity in various solid tumors and combined well with standard of care chemotherapies for added activity. Thus, VBI-002 warrants clinical evaluations as a single agent and in combination with standard of care chemotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Innate immunity,Bispecific antibody,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Oi Kwan Wong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xinhua Wang<sup><\/sup>, Leonard Post<sup><\/sup>, Xiaocheng Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Virtuoso Therapeutics, Inc., San Mateo, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"60ab2830-d272-4187-b55a-5b030d951872","ControlNumber":"3025","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;O.

Proinflammatory cytokines play a central role in this pathogenic process by driving activation of NF-&#409;B, STAT3 and other signaling cascades. IL-22 is an inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathology of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and ulcerative colitis. IL-22 has also been shown to promote epithelial cell proliferation, stemness and tumorigenesis in cancer. Recent studies demonstrated that neutralization of IL-22 reduced dysplasia and tumor development in preclinical models. To date, there has not been a clear application for anti-IL-22 therapy for autoimmune diseases and cancer, likely due to identifying the right disease indication and to their low potency and low efficacy. Thus, there remains an opportunity to explore the potential of more potent anti-IL-22 therapeutics. Using BioAtla&#8217;s proprietary antibody discovery and engineering platforms, we have generated humanized anti-IL-22 antibodies with high affinities to human, cynomolgus and mouse IL-22. <i>In vitro<\/i> data demonstrated that our anti-IL-22 antibodies inhibited IL-22-induced p-STAT3, CXCL-1 and IL-10 activities. In addition, our antibodies showed a 10-fold increased binding activity to human IL-22 compared to Fezakinumab, which was previously developed by Pfizer for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. BioAtla&#8217;s high affinity anti-IL-22 antibodies were shown to be more potent relative to Fezakinumab using multiple <i>in vitro<\/i> assays. To test the functions of our antibodies <i>in vivo<\/i>, we also established mouse models to determine anti-IL22 efficacy. More specifically, to study whether targeting IL-22 in an inflammation-induced tumor microenvironment reduces tumor occurrence, we developed an inflammation-driven sporadic colitis-associated colorectal cancer mouse model for ongoing cancer studies that will be discussed. In addition, we evaluated our anti-IL22 antibodies in an imiquimod-induced psoriasiform skin inflammation mouse model. The mice treated with potent anti-IL-22 antibodies had significantly reduced skin lesions, including erythema, scales, and skin thickness compared to isotype antibody-treated mice. Q-PCR analysis of the mouse skin demonstrated that treatment with our anti-IL-22 antibody led to significantly decreased RNA levels of the imiquimod-induced inflammatory marker CXCL3. Thus, the enhanced anti-IL-22 therapy is a promising strategy for targeting anti-inflammation in autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and inflammatory cancers, including colorectal cancer. In conclusion, the development of a potent, species cross reactive anti-IL-22 antibody using BioAtla&#8217;s antibody discovery and engineering platforms addresses the challenges of anti-IL-22 therapeutics and allows for translational studies in relevant animal efficacy and safety models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Interleukin-22,Colon cancer,Glycolytic acidic tissue microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christina Wheeler<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jian Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Cathy Chang<sup>1<\/sup>, Gerhard Frey<sup>1<\/sup>, Haizhen Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Kathryn Woodard<sup>1<\/sup>, Solmarie Joyner<sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, William J.

IL12 could induce the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T and NK cell and production of interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;), promote the differentiation of T helper 1 (TH1) cells and regulate innate resistance and adaptive immunity. However, the clinical efficacy of IL12 has been hindered for its high dose-related toxicities and short serum half-life. Here we have developed a heterodimeric Fc-fused IL12, HK054-V, with reduced potency to improve tolerability and prolong half-life.<br \/>Methods: We assessed the binding, bioactivity, anti-tumor efficacy and safety of HK054-V. The binding ability of IL12-Fc lead variants to activated PBMCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. The bioactivity of HK054-V was determined by assessing the activated T-cell proliferation and IFN-&#947; production in human PBMCs, and STAT-4 phosphorylation in a reporter gene assay. A murine surrogate, mHK054-V, was engineered to mimic HK054-V to evaluate the antitumor efficacy in MC38 and CT26 syngeneic tumor mouse models. Cytokine release assay was conducted by incubating HK054-V with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. The safety profiles and pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of HK054-V were characterized in non-tumor-bearing Balb\/c mice.<br \/>Results: HK054-V is a heterodimeric Fc-fused IL12, which was designed with reduced potency. HK054-V was observed to stimulate the proliferation of activated T cells and NK cells and induce production of IFN-&#947; in a dose-dependent manner. HK054-V could activate pSTAT4 signal in luciferase reporter gene assay and showed up to 100-fold reduction of potency compared to wild-type IL12-Fc. Human IL12 is inactive in mice, so in vivo anti-tumor activity was assessed by a murine surrogate, mHK054-V. mHK054-V demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in syngeneic mouse models and was better tolerated than WT mIL12-Fc. Furthermore, mHK054-V has improved PK and therapeutic index in mice.<br \/>Conclusion: These data demonstrate that HK054-V, a heterodimeric Fc-fused IL12 with reduced potency, retain strong anti-tumor efficacy with a favorable tolerability profile, which may provide a practical alternative to the systemic administration of IL12 for antitumor therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Immunocytokines,Tumor,IL-12,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yang Huang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wenting Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Dayan Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Pengfei Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Weiming Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoli Zeng<sup>2<\/sup>, Qun Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Liangwei Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Guodong Shen<sup>4<\/sup>, Liansheng Cheng<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Ctr., Atlanta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Hefei Hankemab Biotechnology Co., LTD, Hefei, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA,<sup>4<\/sup>The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b3cfabdd-fbd3-48d3-ace9-a3caffd9e68b","ControlNumber":"2773","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting HER2 such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab provide good therapeutic benefits in patients with high HER2 expression tumors, however, not all patients respond to the treatment, and many suffer recurrence. There is still a large unmet need for targeted therapies to treat HER2 high expression tumors.<br \/>T cell engaging antibodies that direct T cells to kill cancer cells by simultaneously binding to CD3 on T cells and tumor-associated antigens (TAA) on cancer cells have emerged as a promising new approach. Such therapeutics are potent, but safe use of them depends on selectivity of the TAA engaged. Though HER2 is highly overexpressed in ~ 20% of breast cancer, expression of HER2 is not restricted to cancer cells and present at low level in normal tissues. The capability of selectively targeting cancer cells over HER2 low expressing normal tissues is critical to the safety of CD3 x HER2 antibodies. It is noteworthy to mention that unlike antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapeutics, CD3 x HER2 antibodies might not be a good approach to target HER2 low\/neg expression tumors due to the difference in mechanism of action.<br \/>CMG6A19 is a 150 kD IgG-like tri-specific CD3 x HER2 x HER2 T cell-engaging antibody generated on Chimagen&#8217;s TRIAD platform. It is capable of simultaneously recognizing and binding to two different epitopes on HER2 proteins. Multiple human cell lines with different levels of HER2 expression were used as targets in the antibody-mediated hPBMC killing assays in vitro and in vivo, among which SK-BR-3, KPL-4 and BT474 have high HER2 expression as seen in HER2 positive cancers, HT55 and JIMT1 have medium level of HER2 expression, and PC3 and MCF7 have HER2 expression level that is close to in normal tissues. Conventional 1:1 IgG-like CD3 x HER2 bispecific antibodies were used as control. Results showed that CMG6A19 demonstrated higher tumor inhibition effect compared to control antibodies in SK-BR-3\/KPL-4\/BT474 models, meanwhile remarkably weaker effect in PC3\/MCF7 models suggesting better safety in HER2 low expressing tissues. This selectivity of reactivity towards HER2 high expressing cells is likely due to the unique orientation of the antibody which allows better T cell activation when antigen abundance is high. Preliminary preclinical study in cynomolgus monkeys suggested that the antibody was well tolerated in monkeys at the dosage of 20 mpk and had a half-life that is comparable to conventional antibodies.<br \/>CD3 x HER2 x HER2 tri-specific antibodies selectively showed potent anti-tumor activity on HER2 high expressing cells and good safety on HER2 low expressing cells. Current findings warrant further development in human.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,T cell engager,Bispecific antibody,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jie Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaoqing Wang<sup><\/sup>, Zhenhao Zhou<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chimagen Biosciences, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e934a48a-2bd6-4320-8ae1-a8093e7fa3dd","ControlNumber":"5570","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Mesothelin (MSLN) is a ~71 kDa cell surface glycoprotein that is rarely expressed in normal tissues but overexpressed in many types of tumors. The fastest progress of MSLN-targeted therapy is in clinical phase II currently, including antibodies, ADCs, immunotoxins, vaccines and CAR-T. Here, we developed a bispecific antibody (bsAb) targeting both MSLN and 4-1BB with an intact Fc fragment from human IgG1. It can simultaneously exert the cytotoxic effect of CD8+T cells and and NK cells on tumor cells expressing MSLN to achieve better antitumor efficacy.<br \/>Methods: Firstly, two bsAbs with IgG-scFv format were constructed with IgG1 and IgG4, named as HK013-G1 and HK013-G4 respectively. Secondly, we evaluated the binding activities of two candidates to tumor cells with different MSLN expression levels and their effects on 4-1BB+ cell activation mediated by MSLN-crosslinking. Subsequently, the cell-killing abilities of NK and cytotoxic T cells induced by bsAbs were quantified. Finally, we compared the ability of bsAbs to inhibit tumor growth in vivo and their effects on intratumoral CD8+T cells and Tregs. The capacity of bsAb candidates to induce liver toxicity was investigated simultaneously in these immunocompetent mice. Moreover, to further confirm the safety of HK013-G1, the risk of cytokine release storm (CRS) and activation of 4-1BB signal mediated by Fc receptors (FcRs), which are responsible for the potential side effects of 4-1BB mAbs were also evaluated.<br \/>Results: HK013-G1 is able to bind different MSLN-expressing cancer cells and bridge MSLN+ cells and 4-1BB+ cells. In luciferase reporter assay, the bsAb-induced 4-1BB activation is dependent on expression level of MSLN. While incubated with CD8+T cells, HK013-G1 increased IFN-&#947; production only in the presence of MSLN+ cells. Furthermore, HK013-G1 could exert its affects via both NK cell and activated PBMC. In MC38-hMSLN tumor models, HK013-G1 showed a more significant growth inhibition effect than HK013-G4, and did not show detectable liver damage. In addition, HK013-G1 could enhance the antitumor effect of anti-PD-1 in CT26-hMSLN tumor models. Also, HK013-G1 was shown no stronger ability to inducing CRS and activating 4-1BB signal in the presence of FcRs than HK013-G4 and parent anti-4-1BB mAb in vitro.<br \/>Conclusions: HK013-G1, a MSLN&#215;4-1BB bsAb with human IgG1 Fc fragment prevents tumor development by killing tumor cells directly via effector functions mediated by NK and cytotoxic T cells. These results show that this bsAb has the potential to develop into a new clinical therapy for cancer types with high-level MSLN expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelin,4-1BB,Bispecific antibody,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liangwei Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dayan Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Guodong Shen<sup>3<\/sup>, Wenting Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoli Zeng<sup>2<\/sup>, Lingling Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Qun Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Weiming Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Yang Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Liansheng Cheng<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Hefei Hankemab Biotechnology Co., LTD, Hefei, China,<sup>3<\/sup>The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8e243f96-398c-4dce-a3b9-aa3fb638e0d1","ControlNumber":"2727","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

CD24 is highly expressed on cancers of genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) systems, breast, and lung. High expression of CD24 is also known to be associated with poor prognosis for many types of cancers including breast, lung, GU and GI systems, bone, skin and brain. Mouse models of breast and lung cancer in literature revealed that CD24 attenuation in vivo leads to tumor inhibition and prolonged survival. To address the limited (~25%) overall response rate (ORR) of approved PD-1 \/ PD-L1 antibodies for solid tumors, we developed IMM47, an IgG1 antibody that differentially targets phagocytosis and cytotoxicity onto CD24-expressing cancer cells. At doses between 3 mg\/kg to 10mg\/kg, IMM47 significantly reduced tumor volume in a MC38 mouse model of colon cancer. Mice treated with 10mg\/kg IMM47 produced tumor-specific immune response that prevented growth of re-inoculation of colon cancer cells. Further mechanism of action studies showed that IMM47 selectively and differentially increased M1 spleen macrophages quantity to 7-10 folds higher in that induced by PBS control. In contrast, IMM47 only increased M2 spleen macrophages to less than 1.5 folds higher than induced by PBS control. Expression of MHC II in M1 macrophages was also increased in IMM47-treated mice, suggesting significant activation and antigen presentation by macrophages. Our data has also confirmed that IMM47 specifically binds to and induces ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) ,ADCP (antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis), and CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity) against a variety of cancer cells. Taken together, our data show that targeting CD24 on tumor cells using our IMM47 antibody may serve as potent immunotherapy for multiple cancer indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint,CD24,monoclonal antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Wenzhi Tian<sup><\/sup>, Song Li<sup><\/sup>, Dianze Chen<sup><\/sup>, Dandan Liu<sup><\/sup>, Huiqin Guo<sup><\/sup>, Chunmei Yang<sup><\/sup>, Li Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoping Tu<sup><\/sup>, Liang Peng<sup><\/sup>, Gui Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Ruliang Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Fan Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Frank X.

High expression of CD70 is a prognostic marker for poor survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma, etc. Several CD70 antibodies are under early stages of clinical trials for oncology indications. We have developed IMM40H, a humanized IgG1 antibody that differentially induces phagocytosis and cytotoxicity in CD70-expressing cancer cells. Results of in vitro <\/i>study have demonstrated that, in comparison with cusatuzumab, IMM40H possesses better CD70 binding (kD= 3.22E-11M) and functional inhibition ability, as well as more potent activities of ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, EC50 = 0.5 -2.0ng\/ml) and CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity, EC50 = 170 ng\/mL) against certain cancer cells. IMM40H also induces strong ADCP (antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis) activity (EC50 = 0.02nM). At doses between 0.3 mg\/kg to 10mg\/kg, IMM40H significantly reduced tumor volume in mouse models of multiple myeloma, lymphoma and kidney cancer. Notably, in a U266 multiple myeloma model, IMM40H, at the dose of 0.3 mg\/kg, completely inhibited tumor growth in a way that therapeutic effects appeared significantly earlier than that of cusatuzumab at a higher dose of 1 mg\/kg. Therapeutic effects of IMM40H at the dose of 3 mg\/kg also appeared earlier than that of bortezomib at the dose of 0.5 mg\/kg. Interestingly, combination of IMM40H and IMM01 (a SIRP&#945;-IgG1 Fc fusion protein targeting CD47) generated significant therapeutic synergy in models of A498 kidney cancer and Raji lymphoma. Importantly, maximum tolerated dose of IMM40H exceeds 100 mg\/kg (IV, single dose) in cynomolgus monkeys and no significant adverse reaction was observed at a dose range of 3 to 30 mg\/kg (IV, QW, 5 times) in monkeys. Taken together, our data show that targeting CD70 on tumor cells using IMM40H antibody may serve as a potent immunotherapy for multiple cancer indications. IND of IMM40H has been approved in China and US. This antibody is now in a phase 1 study in patients with advanced malignancies expressing CD70.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint,CD70,monoclonal antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Wenzhi Tian<sup><\/sup>, Song Li<sup><\/sup>, Dianze Chen<sup><\/sup>, Dandan Liu<sup><\/sup>, Huiqin Guo<sup><\/sup>, Chunmei Yang<sup><\/sup>, Li Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoping Tu<sup><\/sup>, Liang Peng<sup><\/sup>, Gui Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Ruliang Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Fan Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Frank  X.

It is comprised of bivalent folate receptor alpha (FR&#945;) and CD16A (Fc&#947;RIIIA) binding domains with a silenced IgG1 Fc region. AFVT-2101 is engineered to exert potent and selective immune-mediated antitumor activity with minimal off-tumor toxicity by promoting NK cell and macrophage engagement of FR&#945;-positive tumors.<br \/>A comprehensive package of IND-enabling studies is currently in progress to support the preclinical safety profile of AFVT-2101. In agreement with target sequence homology, binding affinity of AFVT-2101 against human and cynomolgus monkey FR&#945; and CD16A is highly similar, confirming non-human primate (NHP, specifically cynomolgus monkey) as the only pharmacologically relevant preclinical safety model. The toxicology program includes tissue cross-reactivity assessment against a panel of human and cynomolgus cryosections, single- and repeat-dose range finding (DRF) non-GLP studies and a 4-week IND-enabling GLP study with 4-week recovery period in NHPs.<br \/>In a single-dose study AFVT-2101 demonstrated non-linear pharmacokinetics when administered as a 2-h IV infusion to male NHPs where the mean C<sub>max<\/sub> (85.1 and 1620 &#181;g\/mL) and AUC<sub>168hr<\/sub> (3,430 and 97,000 &#181;g.h\/mL) at 3 and 30 mg\/kg, respectively, increased supra-proportionally with respect to dose, consistent with target-mediated drug disposition. Half-life was 103-155 h across doses.<br \/>A DRF study was conducted to characterize toxicity, identify target organs, determine toxicokinetics (TK), immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies, ADA), and to inform the dose selection of the subsequent 4-week study. AFVT-2101 was administered once-weekly to female NHPs via 2-h IV infusion for a total of 4 doses. Mean C<sub>max<\/sub> (1120, 3320, 7190 &#181;g\/mL) and AUC<sub>168hr<\/sub> (83,600, 209,000, 592,000 &#181;g.h\/mL) at 30, 75, and 150 mg\/kg, respectively, increased in a generally dose-proportional manner with a trend for modest accumulation (&#60;2-fold) upon repeated administration with a half-life of 80-230 h. Exposure did not appear to be impacted by any treatment-emergent ADA. AFVT-2101 was well-tolerated with no test article-related adverse effects on clinical observations, bodyweight, clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, anatomic pathology, or immunotoxicity parameters. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was determined to be 150 mg\/kg under the conditions of the study.<br \/>The safety profile is being further evaluated in an ongoing pivotal 4-week GLP study incorporating standard toxicology endpoints, safety pharmacology (CNS, CV, and respiratory), gross and anatomic pathology, as well as cytokine, immunophenotyping, receptor occupancy, TK, and ADA analyses.<br \/>In conclusion, AFVT-2101 is well-tolerated in NHPs with a pharmacokinetic and safety profile consistent with its intended clinical application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Bispecific antibody,Innate immunity,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Wendy Luo<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Eric  J.

AMH signaling through AMHR2 plays an important role in fetal sexual development by inducing M&#252;llerian duct regression in males. AMHR2 is aberrantly expressed in various human malignancies, including colon, testis, gastric, and ovarian cancers. Functionally, AMH has complex effects on cell cycle regulation; at physiological concentrations it promotes survival and chemoresistance of cell lines, whereas at supraphysiological concentrations it inhibits tumor cell viability. Like other TGF-&#946; family members, binding of its target receptor effects changes in gene expression through activation of intracellular SMAD, NF-&#954;B, and Akt signaling. We developed a fully human anti-AMHR2 monoclonal antibody, 7E1, from RenMab&#8482; mice, which contain the full human immunoglobulin variable domain. 7E1 was found to contain a distinct binding epitope associated with efficient inhibition of AMH binding and signaling. 7E1 also displayed a better ADCC effect than the reference AMHR2 antibody. The <i>in vivo<\/i> half-life of 7E1 in AMHR2- and FcRn-humanized mice exceeded the reference antibody as well and is in a desirable range from a development perspective. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 7E1 <i>in vivo<\/i>, we established syngeneic murine tumor models in AMHR2-humanized mice. We found that 7E1 monotherapy significantly inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, 7E1 was well tolerated in mice, and no adverse effects were observed even at extremely high doses (e.g. 100 mg\/kg). Taken together, these data demonstrate that 7E1 is a novel anti-human AMHR2 blocking antibody with desirable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. 7E1 may potentially find broad application for a range of cancer indications in which AMH signaling is implicated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human monoclonal antibodies,Transgenic mouse models,Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacodynamics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yongfei Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Huilin Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Hao Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Yue Yan<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianhui Li<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Qingcong Lin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Huijun Yin<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiangshan Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Miao Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Kunbao Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Leqiao Sun<sup>2<\/sup>, Shan Zhong<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>China Resources Biopharmaceutical, Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fee8b904-b232-4d82-9d1a-d0b7aa63024b","ControlNumber":"5080","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Antibody-based therapy targeting specific overexpressed surface antigen has proven as a promising strategy. Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (Trop2), also known as epithelial glycoprotein-1 antigen, is a membrane protein found in epithelial tissues involved in cellular signalling, migration, proliferation, and differentiation in normal cells. Its overexpression is validated in several tumor types including basal, squamous and adenocarcinomas of the cervix, breast, colon, and gastrointestinal tracts. Due to its differential overexpression, Trop2 is a viable therapeutic marker whereby a recombinant immunotoxin composed of a single chain variable antibody fragment (scFv) armed with Pseudomonas exotoxin A (Anti-Trop2-ETA) may be delivered for targeted killing of such tumors.<br \/>Methods: Plasmids encoding Anti-Trop2-ETA were designed in silico by fusion of anti-Trop2 single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody to the N-terminus of Pseudomonas exotoxin A and then cloned into an pMT backbone. Expression was performed in BL21 E. Coli cells under osmotic stress and then Anti-Trop2-ETA was purified by IMAC via an N-terminus encoded polyhistidine tag. Purified fractions were structurally characterized by SDS PAGE gel and immunoblotting to confirm the presence of the Anti-Trop2-ETA protein to be used for treatment of tumor cell lines. Trop2 expression cervical cancer and breast tumor cell lines were confirmed, and cells were treated with Anti-Trop2-ETA.<br \/>Results: Dose dependent killing by Anti-Trop2-ETA was observed in the Trop2 expressing tumor cell lines. IC50 values were significantly lower for Trop2 expressing cells as compared to control cells lacking Trop2 expression.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b> Here, we demonstrated antigen specific killing of Trop2 overexpressing tumor cells in vitro. Targeted deployment of recombinant immunotoxin to specifically engage and kill Trop2 positive cells is a potential approach for cancer therapeutics. As such, the ability of the rIT to specifically target and kill Trop2 expressing tumors is an important initial finding towards the possibility of antigen-dependent elimination of Trop2 expressing cancer cells. Ongoing evaluations are aimed at antigen dependent biological activity as well as pharmacokinetics of the rIT in tumor bearing in vivo models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotoxin,Trop-2,Cervical cancer,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dennis Makafui Dogbey<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sizalobuhle Masuku<sup><\/sup>, Stefan Barth<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Integrative Biomedical Sciences, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"66601c9b-cd0d-4cf0-80d0-d491ce5b41d8","ControlNumber":"1974","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

It is possible that some of these limitations could be overcome by specially engineered molecules, <i>e.g<\/i>. bi-functional agents. Here we report a novel rationally designed bi-specific antibody (BsAb) targeting both PD1 and CD47, HX009, in order to improve both efficacy and safety over the two respective single-targeting ICIs. HX009 features IgG4 and 2x2 symmetric format, but with specifically weakened CD47 binding affinity. We performed a comprehensive preclinical pharmacology characterization of HX009 to test our hypothesis by confirming its candidacy as a novel first-in-class biologic for cancer therapy. The affinity constant (KD) of the HX009 binding to PD1 was determined to 3.96x10<sup>-11<\/sup> M, while 5.06x10<sup>-9<\/sup> M for binding to CD47, significantly reduced affinity as compared to the binding to PD1 and the binding between native SIRP&#945; and CD47. HX009 has little binding to red blood cell (RBC) and platelets so to minimize hematological toxicity that usually associated with CD47 targeting. The antibody injectable formulation caused little cytokine release from PBMC (CRS or cytokine storm). HX009 cross-species binds to cynomolgus monkey PD1 and CD47 receptors, with the similar affinity as with the counterparts of human, but not to those of rodents. Cynomolgus monkey was thus chosen to investigate non-clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicology profiles of HX009. The intravenous (IV) infusion PK study revealed that HX009 is largely distributed within vasculature, with terminal half-life (T<sub>1\/2<\/sub>) around 50hr and dose proportional exposure. Repeat dosing caused no accumulation. The production of antidrug antibody (ADA) were observed in the dosed animals, as expected for administration into different species, which impacted PK parameters of repeated dosing. The IV single dose toxicology study revealed the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of 150mg\/kg with 14-day observation, while the maximum non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was determined to be 15 mg\/kg in the repeated dose study after once weekly dose for 4 consecutive weeks (5 times total). The main drug related toxicities observed seemed to be related to CD47 targeting as expected. Strong antitumor activity was also confirmed in in several preclinical cancer models, including humanized syngeneic models. In summary, the desired PK and safety profiles of HX009, along with anti-tumor activity, supporting further clinical development. Currently, HX009 is under clinical investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05189093).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Cancer immunotherapy,CD47,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Faming Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Hang Ke<sup><\/sup>, Feiyu Peng<sup><\/sup>, Cen Chen<sup><\/sup>, Lei Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Henry Qixiang Li<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Hanx Bio, Hangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b66cd024-509f-42a6-b9bd-debec49555b7","ControlNumber":"341","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;F.

OX40 expresses constitutively on T<sub>reg<\/sub> as well as on conventional T<sub>eff<\/sub>, particularly within TME.

OX40 agonistic antibodies have also been shown to activate tumor immunity and increase anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. Here we report that we identified\/constructed a novel OX40-agonistic humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), HX011, with high affinity through hybridoma technology. HX011 was subsequently confirmed of the similar binding properties and functions as the original mouse mAb clone, 9C12: 1) binding to human OX40 (EC<sub>50<\/sub> ~0.012 nM; 2) similar function binding in the reporter assay (EC<sub>50<\/sub> ~6.6 nM); but 3) has little blockade of the OX40L binding to OX40. In another word, HX011 is similar to BMS-986178 for the first two assays, but contrastingly different for the third assay. Non-competing with OX40L may actually maximize T-cell activation, a potential advantage over a competing antibody. <i>In vivo<\/i> pharmacology modeling of HX011 in the humanized syngeneic CRC model, MC38, where syngeneic C57BL\/6 mouse mice were knocked in with huOX40 (&#8220;HuGEMM-OX40&#8221;), demonstrated strong anti-tumor activity (TGI ~100% at 1 mg\/kg, twice weekly).

Currently, there are limited effective systemic treatment options for these patients with advanced disease. We have developed an anchored immunotherapy approach in which canine interleukin-12 is stably linked to aluminum hydroxide (cANK-101). The anchored IL-12 forms a stable, functional depot of IL-12 and is expected to increase therapeutic responses with limited systemic toxicity. We report the preliminary results of an exploratory Phase I study of cANK-101 in dogs with advanced melanoma.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><i>: <\/i>The clinical study was approved by the University of Illinois IACUC, conducted at the College of Veterinary Medicine, and all pet owners provided written informed consent. The primary objective of the trial was to determine the safety and tolerability of cANK-101 in dogs with advanced melanoma. A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design was used with three dose levels (1, 3, and 10 &#181;g\/kg) cANK-101 given by intratumoral injection every three weeks for 4 cycles. In the absence of overt clinical progression, dogs were allowed to receive a second course of four cycles. Dogs were monitored for adverse events via VCOG-CTCAE and clinical responses were measured using RECISTv1.1. Serum was collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity analyses. In addition, serial tumor biopsy and lymph node cytology were performed. Serum cytokines were assayed via ELISA while immunophenotyping of PBMC and lymph node aspirates were assessed by flow cytometry. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) analysis was performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression profiling (Nanostring). Descriptive statistics were used for analyses.<br \/><b>Results<\/b><i>: <\/i>As of November 16, 2022, 8 dogs have been enrolled and all dogs remain on treatment. Thirteen adverse events have been reported in 6 dogs, all being grade 1. However, only two are considered related to the study drug (tumor site inflammation and pain). Treatment was associated with increases in serum IFN&#947; and IL-10, as well as increases in peripheral CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T and CD21<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Additional data on PK analyses, anti-drug antibody levels, gene expression, and clinical responses will be presented.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b><i>: <\/i>Thus far, cANK-101 appears to be safe and tolerable in dogs with advanced melanoma. Data from this trial will help inform human clinical trials and may represent a new therapeutic option for dogs with advanced melanoma and perhaps other solid tumors.

It also engages ILT7, a specific inhibitory receptor on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are associated with poor prognosis when infiltrate patients&#8217; breast tumors. Two groups have identified BST2 isoforms of different lengths, generated by post-transcriptional modification. Based on these findings and our work on protein interaction of ILT7-BST2, we hypothesized that the expression of BST2 isoforms differed in normal and cancer tissues. To demonstrate that, we generated and characterized anti-long BST2 isoform monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Results were compared with our previously developed mAb anti-BST2 full length molecule, 26F8, that recognizes a common epitope to all BST2 isoforms. By comparing the amino acid sequences of different isoforms of BST2, we identified a region of 24 residues on the extracellular domain of BST2, restricted to its long isoform. We then generated mAbs by hybridoma technology, immunizing BALB\/c mice with the 24 mers peptide-KLH conjugated. Screening and positive selection of several clones were performed following our lab SOP. One of the mAbs, LA5, was selected based on positive ELISA against the immunogen and FACS staining of recombinant HEK293 cells expressing full-length BST2 protein. Pharmacokinetic determined using OCTET platform, revealed a KD of 4.61+\/- 0.074 x 10<sup>-9<\/sup> M for LA5. Epitope mapping of LA5 on BST2 overlapping peptides, confirmed specific recognition of full-length BST2 protein and the peptide used as immunogen. LA5 heavy and light chains were sequenced and analysis was performed by IgBlast and IMGTV. Binding of LA5 and 26F8 to the myeloma cell lines MM1 (B-lymphoblast) and U266 (B-lymphocyte) by flow cytometry, indicated 97-100% positive cells with both mAbs, with higher MFI values observed for clone 26F8: 5.8 and 1.8-fold-increase in MM1 and U266 cells respectively. IHC on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues of human ductal breast carcinoma, revealed that LA5 staining was able to identify infiltrating carcinoma cells but not the normal surrounding acinar cells. In contrast, 26F8 staining did not discriminate between BST2+ malignant and surrounding normal acinar cells. Currently, we are analyzing a panel of &#62;105 breast cancer tissue samples of different molecular classifications. Initial data revealed a high-level of expression of BST2 (by 26F8) on the epithelial area of the tumors, lower in the TME (tumor microenvironment-infiltrating immune cells) and almost negative expression in the surrounding fibroblasts rich stroma. Evaluation of IHC staining by LA5 is being processed and yet to be established. These IHC findings indicate a potential diagnostic value of LA5 to distinct between tumor and normal cells in patients&#8217; specimens. Treatment prospects may arise during the process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monoclonal antibodies,BST2 isoform,Diagnosis,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Laura C.

Among them, anti-PD-1 antibodies are the most used and have been approved by FDA for the treatment of many types of cancer (1). In our previous studies, combination of anti-PD-1 antibody with IL-12 demonstrated significant synergistic effect on tumor growth inhibition. The elevation of IFN-&#947; mRNA expression suggested the potential roles of CD8 T cells and NK cells in this process. In this study, we used two syngeneic mice tumor models to investigate the mechanisms of synergistic effect by the combination of IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody.<br \/>Methods: We used syngeneic mice tumor models with mice cancer cell lines CT-26 and MC-38. The mice inoculated with tumor cells and were treated until tumors grew to 100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>. The mice were divided into three groups to receive the treatment, including rmIL-12 alone, anti-PD1-antibody alone, and the combination of rmIL-12 and anti-PD1-antibody (BIW x 3 weeks). At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed and tumor resection and splenectomy were performed. The tumor infiltrating lymphocyte subpopulations within the tumor microenvironment were analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression profile by RNA Seq.<br \/>Results: The combination of rmIL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to the treatment with rmIL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody alone. The combination group demonstrated more CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell in the tumor microenvironment via flow cytometry. In addition, RNA Seq showed the combination group increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, NK cells, and Th1 populations. The levels of cytotoxicity related genes (IFN-&#947;, Granzyme B, Perforin) were also higher in combination group.<br \/>Conclusion: Combination of rmIL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody increased immune cells infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and enhanced anti-tumor response suggesting the potential of this combination for cancer treatment.<br \/>Citation:(1).

Especially, antibodies targeting programmed cell death ligand1(PD-L1) promoted T cells to activate immune response against cancer cells. However, the current ICIs still have insignificant to motivate effective antitumor immunity by blocking PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway and the regulatory network of PD-L1 by cytokines in the tumor microenvironment remains to be uncovered. Previously, we have reported the anti-cancer effects of combination treatment with a natural product, poly-&#947;-glutamic acid(&#947;-PGA), and PD-1 blockade. Now, we showed that combination therapy with anti PD-L1 and &#947;-PGA overcome the limits of ICIs and enhance anticancer effect in murine melanoma(B16F10). In vivo efficacy studies were performed by intraperitoneal injection of antibody targeting PD-L1 and oral administration of &#947;-PGA in C57BL\/6 model transplanted with B16F10 melanoma cell. Systemic changes in immunophenotype were measured by tumor volume size and survival rate. The splenocytes were isolated from mice and the populations of myeloid-driven suppressor cells(MDSCs) and CD4\/CD8 T cells were analyzed by FACS. Combination therapy with &#947;-PGA and anti PD-L1 blockade showed dramatically more suppressive tumor growth and enhanced long-term survival rate than other monotherapic treatment. In addition, &#947;-PGA was shown to play a role in the immune modulation of tumor microenvironment by activation of T cells and inhibition of MDSCs so as to prevent tumors from immune escape. Therefore, we suggest that &#947;-PGA can promote ICI-mediated antitumor responses by the transformation of \"cold tumors\" into &#8220;hot tumors&#8221;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,poly-&#947;-glutamic acid,anti PD-L1 blockade ,murine melanoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jae-Pyung Jang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jae Chul Choi<sup><\/sup>, Kyung-Soo Hahm<sup><\/sup>, Do Young Lee<sup><\/sup>, Young-Chul Park<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>BL Corporation, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e9b0b082-948a-43aa-9496-f03d0032b439","ControlNumber":"3118","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Combination therapies are an emerging approach in ongoing clinical trials to enhance the drug efficacy of monotherapy. Here we described a new preclinical animal model using immunodeficient NSG&#8482;-SGM3-IL15 mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to evaluate the combination treatment of EGFRXCD3 BiTE and two CIs (anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab and anti-PD-L1 avelumab). NSG&#8482;-SGM3-IL15 mice, which were created by crossing NSG&#8482;-SGM3 with NSG&#8482;-IL15, develop a more complete humane immune system after HSC engraftment. Humanized NSG&#8482;-IL15 mice have a higher peripheral NK cell frequency, and NK cells are functional with ADCC activity when compared to NSG&#8482; (Aryee et al., 2022 FASEB). Here we show that humanized NSG&#8482;-SGM3-IL15 mice show improved human CD33+ myeloid progenitor cells and near physiological levels of NK cells and Tregs in peripheral blood when compared to humanized NSG&#8482;-SGM3. Triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cell line is PD-L1 positive, expresses low levels of EGFR and has a low baseline tumor immune cell infiltration in xenograft using humanized NSG&#8482; mice. Previously we have shown BiTE efficacy on this tumor model. Here tumor-bearing humanized NSG&#8482;-SGM3-IL15 mice from two donors were used to evaluate the efficacy and immune responses from the BiTE treatment in combination with CIs. For donor 0348, monotherapy BiTE and avelumab didn&#8217;t result in significant tumor growth reduction when compared to PBS control whereas the combination treatment significantly reduced tumor growth. BiTE treatment alone resulted in a significant increase in CD3+ T cell infiltration into tumor and higher frequency of CD69+ CD4 T and CD8 T cells. PD-1 expression on the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells increased significantly. BiTE and avelumab combination treatment further increased human CD45+ and CD3+ T cell infiltrations with activated T cell phenotypes in tumor. For the second donor 0313, BiTE alone or in combination with the CIs didn&#8217;t show anti-tumor growth activity. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the immune response to BiTE treatment was less pronounced in this donor, especially there were little change in lymphocyte infiltration and CD4+ T cell population in tumor. In this study, we demonstrated donor-dependent response to combination treatment of BiTE and avelumab and found that the responding donor showed an increase in T cell infiltration and activation in tumor after the treatment. The data suggested beneficial effects from inhibition of PD-1\/PD-L1 axis when used in combination with an immunotherapy targeting tumor antigen. The potential involvement of NK cells in this combination therapy remained to be examined.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Immunotherapy,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Li-Chin Yao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Danying Cai<sup>1<\/sup>, Destanie Rose<sup>1<\/sup>, Guoxiang Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Mingshan Cheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael  A.
