[{"Abstract":"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited predisposition for developing cancer caused by germline variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. It is estimated that LS is responsible for 1 out of every 35 colorectal cancers and 1 out of every 56 endometrial cancers. Loss of MMR is also seen in many sporadic cancers. Still, the mechanism of tumorigenesis in these patients is unknown. Loss of MMR increases genomic mutation rate, but it is unclear if increased mutational burden alone leads to tumorigenesis. Recent studies of LS patient colon samples show fields of morphologically normal tissue in which cells have lost expression of an MMR protein, suggesting that loss of MMR in these cells is sufficient to confer an advantage over heterozygous cells still proficient in MMR. However, whether MMR loss provides a direct advantage to cell types associated with cancer in LS has not been directly tested. We hypothesize that loss of MMR is sufficient to confer a selective advantage to colonic stem cells and is the first step towards tumorigenesis in LS patients.<br \/>To test this, we use a human colonic organoid model to examine competition between MMR-deficient (dMMR) and MMR-proficient (pMMR) cells over time. The colonic organoids are differentiated from human embryonic stem cells.<br \/>To track cell populations, dMMR stem cells are labeled with mCherry and pMMR stem cells are labeled with GFP. We have initially observed that dMMR stem cells are much more efficient at generating colonic organoids. Thus, the cells are mixed so that resulting organoids initially contain a small population of dMMR cells in order to mimic the spontaneous loss of heterozygosity that occurs in LS patients&#8217; colonic crypts. Live fluorescent imaging of individual organoids is used to quantify changes in cell population over time. Preliminary data indicate that dMMR cells can outgrow pMMR cells resulting in a shift in the ratio of green to red cells over a two-week time period. These results suggest that loss of MMR function imparts an immediate selective advantage. Furthermore, this assay could be used to find conditions or compounds that decelerate population shifts with the ultimate goal of finding a way to reduce dMMR fields in LS patients. In these ways, this assay can be leveraged for gaining new insights into MMR function, pathogenesis of LS, and potential therapies for LS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lynch syndrome,Mismatch repair deficiency,Organoids,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Caroline Guild<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kirby Madden-Hennessey<sup><\/sup>, Chris Heinen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7f6fdc67-e6c6-44cc-ab58-00a995cb1b87","ControlNumber":"2272","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

However, there is variation in protocols between centers and lack of consistency in important variables, impacting PTO culture success. In this study, we analyzed factors in clinical data and tumor tissue processing to determine optimal conditions for cell isolation and PTO success.<br \/>Methods: Under IRB approval, tumor tissues from primary and metastatic sites were procured in clinically indicated surgeries then dissociated using a standardized protocol. PTOs were fabricated using collagen-hyaluronic acid ECM and underwent drug screening at 10 days post fabrication, where viability was assessed. Clinical and tissue processing inputs such as type of primary, peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI), prior surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, presence of mucin, tissue digestion time, specimen mass, digestion time, and the diameter of isolated cells were analyzed. These factors were assessed by calculating the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) and best fit modeling to determine the effect on outputs including tissue viability as measured by % of viable cells using an automated cellular counter, viable cells per mg tissue, and PTO log<sub>10<\/sub> viability by Promega 3D Cell Titer Glo assay.<br \/>Results: From December 2018-July 2022, 515 tumors<u> <\/u>from 286 patients with 25 primary types were processed for cellular isolation and PTO fabrication. 407 (79%) provided PTOs for therapeutic testing, with 354 (69%) providing sufficiently viable PTOs for therapeutic interrogation. The most common primary tumor type accrued was appendiceal cancer (n=223, 43%). Tissues processed at 24 hours did not differ in viability outputs when compared to tissues processed immediately (p&#62;0.05). Tissue % viability was better maintained in larger specimens (r=.18, p&#60;0.001), resulting in more viable cells per mg of tissue (r=.12, p=0.009) while it was negatively related to larger cell diameter (r=-.32, p&#60;0.001). The number of viable cells per mg of tumor correlated to higher post-processing cell counts (r=.49, p&#60;0.001) while it was decreased by longer digestion times (r=-.11, p=0.017). Finally, PTO log10 viability, correlated with higher burden of disease as measured by PCI scores (r=.35, p&#60;0.001), larger specimens (r=.19, p&#60;0.001), mucinous tumors (PTO log<sub>10 <\/sub>viability 5.46 vs 5.17, p=0.01), and tissues with higher cellular viability (r=.31, p&#60;0.001), while it was negatively impacted by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5.06 vs 5.41, p&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: Higher rates of successful PTO fabrication are obtained in patients with untreated tumors, more aggressive biologic behavior, and increased tumor burden. Creating a unified protocol for tissue processing, agnostic to tumor type, will facilitate incorporation of tissue from the operating room to research protocols with wider translational implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,3D cell culture,Drug-discovery screen,Biospecimen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Steven Donald Forsythe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Richard  A.

PDOs, or HUB Organoids&#174;, are directly established from patient tissue, faithfully recapitulate patient disease, and effectively bridge the gap between the lab and the clinic, bringing a &#8220;patient in the lab&#174;&#8221;. PDOs can also revolutionize clinical research because they can predict patient response to standard-of-care (SoC) compounds. However, there is an urgent need to refine the assay conditions to evaluate the activity of SoC drugs with different mechanisms of action (topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, targeted agents) and various types of molecules (small molecules, antibodies) and achieve optimal results from the PDO-based assay. Specifically, for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), we have optimized the media composition required for drug screening assays to test response to SoC, such as oxaliplatin and panitumumab. Our results indicate that optimal media conditions are essential to observe an <i>in vitro<\/i> drug response in PDOs similar to the patient response in the clinic. In addition, an image-based readout was developed that enables precise quantification of organoid numbers ensuring high assay quality. Optimizing screening conditions to evaluate SoC compounds in PDOs is a required step to accelerate the implementation of the HUB Organoid Technology as a diagnostic platform to accurately predict treatment response and improve clinical outcomes for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Screening,Drug sensitivity,Diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carla S.

Despite its name, HGSOC originates in the fallopian tube (FT), but metastasizes quickly in the adnexal region and is the most lethal gynecological cancer worldwide. Organoid culture is emerging as a powerful model for studying normal FT cell biology and ovarian cancer. To standardize primary human FT and HGSOC organoid culture, we have developed GyneCult Fallopian Tube Organoid Medium (FTOM), an optimized serum-free medium and a workflow that supports robust and representative FT organoid culture from freshly isolated or cryopreserved primary human FT cells. FT cultures were initiated by seeding 4000 dissociated single cells directly into 20 &#181;L Corning&#174; Matrigel&#174; domes and overlaying them with FT Organoid Medium. After seeding, cultures were maintained with full-medium changes every 3 - 4 days and were split either in a passage ratio of 1:3, or at 4,000 cells per 20 &#181;L of Matrigel&#174;, as single cells every 8 - 14 days. Cultures were analyzed by immunocytochemistry (ICC) to detect secretory markers keratin 7 (KRT7), oviductal glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1), and PAX8, as well as ciliated cell markers acetylated alpha tubulin (TUBA1A) and FOXJ1. Across all donor samples, approximately 16 &#177; 8% (mean &#177; SD) of dissociated EpCAM<sup>+<\/sup> FT cells formed 50 - 300 &#181;m diameter cystic organoids within 14 days (n = 8). Cultures can be maintained for at least 5 passages with 14 - 20 cumulative population doublings, at 3 - 4 doublings per passage. ICC analysis confirmed that organoids contain both polarized KRT7<sup>+<\/sup> OVGP1<sup>+<\/sup> PAX8<sup>+<\/sup> secretory cells and acetylated TUBA1A<sup>+<\/sup> FOXJ1<sup>+<\/sup> ciliated cells, indicating multilineage capacity (n = 5). We also tested the compatibility of GyneCult FTOM for growing HGSOC samples, and we observed that 1 of the 3 tumor samples tested generated organoids with a solid and irregular shaped morphology. These cells could undergo a minimum of 5 cumulative population doublings over 5 passages, at 0.5 - 2 doublings per passage; this performance is in line with recently published HGSOC organoid culture methods. These results demonstrate that GyneCult Fallopian Tube Organoid Medium is a robust medium for initiating and culturing FT epithelium as organoids and is a valuable tool for studying FT biology, with the capacity to support HGSOC organoid culture.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Ovarian cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Victor Ho<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Maggie Chan<sup><\/sup>, Manreet Chehal<sup><\/sup>, Alice Liang<sup><\/sup>, Allen Eaves<sup><\/sup>, Sharon Louis<sup><\/sup>, John Stingl<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9799efec-d929-42b4-9401-07ee26d3c7d0","ControlNumber":"5190","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

GI toxicity is one of the most frequent adverse effects amongst chemotherapeutics. Impaired barrier function and epithelial ulceration can lead to symptoms including diarrhoea, dehydration and susceptibility to systemic infection. We have identified a gene signature that can be utilised in an <i>in vitro<\/i> organoid model to predict relevant GI toxicity.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Both mice and small intestinal organoids derived from human and mouse were exposed to chemotherapeutic agents known to cause GI toxicity. For <i>in vivo<\/i> assays mice were treated with 50 or 100mg\/kg CPT11 for 4 or 8 hours or 100, 200 or 400mg\/kg Iressa for 8 or 24 hours before small intestinal (SI) tissue was removed for RNA-Seq analysis. SI tissue was also analysed by histological staining and damage measured to confirm induction of GI-toxicity. Human and mouse organoids were treated with CPT11 and Iressa for 8 hours at a range of concentrations. The organoids were lysed, RNA extracted and an mRNA-Seq library was generated. Samples were sequenced using 2 x 75bp PE reads on a Next-Seq550. Sequences were aligned to the relevant genomes using BWA and normalised using DESeq2. Normalised gene counts were analysed using Partek Genomics Suite and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for gene set enrichment (GSEA) and pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> For all treatments and time points the mechanism of action (MOA) of each agent was evident from the GSEA and pathway analysis. CPT11 induced DNA damage and cell cycle arrest pathways, whereas Iressa demonstrated downregulation of cell cycle and chromosomal replication and mitotic genes. Analysis of toxicity pathways in IPA identified a number of differentially expressed genes that were consistent with increased toxicity. A gene signature was identified and a multivariate scoring system used to demonstrate signature engagement. This signature was activated in all SI tissues treated with CPT11 or Iressa, irrespective of the MOA of both agents.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Deployment of this signature on mouse and human organoids treated with chemotherapeutic agents demonstrated activation of the signature, which could be an alternative method for GI toxicity testing. Further analysis of this signature in gene expression studies from GI toxicity inducing agents submitted to the NCBI Gene expression omnibus (GEO) demonstrated that the signature was activated with a variety of agents with different MOA&#8217;s such as NSAIDs, gamma-secretase inhibitors, CDK8\/19 inhibitors and CAR-T-cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Bioinformatics,Chemotherapy response,Gastrointestinal epithelium,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Gary S.

Often diagnosed in young adults with a median age of 25 years, CCS has a strong propensity for local recurrence and metastasis with an overall high mortality rate. Current treatment recommendations include radical surgical extirpation, followed by radiation or chemotherapy. Nonetheless, there is a need for extensive postoperative follow-up as the efficiency of adjuvant therapy in managing this disease remains poor. Consequently, it is imperative to identify clinically relevant models to advance our understanding of CCS tumor biology and facilitate the development of novel therapies. Compared to conventional preclinical tumor models, patient-derived organoids (PDOrgs) better recapitulate the patient tumor biology, genetic heterogeneity, and therapeutic responses. Here, we describe the development and validation of a human biopsy-derived CCS organoid model 1010561-T. 1010561-T was established from a male patient's metastatic paraspinal mass. This PDOrg demonstrates a moderate growth rate (doubling time of ~20 days) and pleomorphic traits, consisting mainly of solid, grape-like clusters, as well as elongated cells of mixed morphology. Furthermore, this model was successfully maintained over 7 months in culture and remained stable more than one year after cryopreservation. 1010561-T exhibits the cytogenetic hallmark of CCS which is the presence of a recurrent t(12;22)(q13;q12) chromosomal translocation, resulting in a fusion between the Ewing sarcoma gene and activating transcription factor 1 (EWS\/ATF1 fusion). Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed that 1010561-T harbors a dual EWS\/ATF1 fusion, namely EWS exon 8 to ATF1 codon 65 fusion (type 1) and EWS exon 7 to ATF1 codon 110 fusion (type 3). Quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry revealed strong expression of melanocytic differentiation markers typical of CCS including melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF), melan-A (MLANA), premelanosome protein (PMEL), and S100 calcium binding protein A11 (S100A11). Additionally, the gene expression profile of 1010561-T is in concordance with a well-established CCS cell line, SU-CCS-1. To our knowledge, 1010561-T is the first human CCS organoid model. It is, therefore, a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of the biology of this very rare disease, in addition to being a useful tool for validating new preclinical therapies that are undoubtedly needed to achieve better clinical outcomes for patients.

To accelerate access to new therapies, there is a strong need for an <i>in vitro<\/i> human melanoma model mimicking the complexity of the tumor's cellular and physical microenvironment. Such model should recapitulate 3 critical features: (1) a reconstructed human melanoma-in-skin (Mel-RhS) to model melanoma cell invasion, (2) an endothelium to mimic the vascular system, and (3) circulation of, and ultimately, infiltration by, immune cells.<br \/>Here, we present the development of these 3 individual biological features separately in dynamic conditions. These were constructed in standard multi-well plates (MW) by means of our microenviromentally controlled microphysiological system (MPS) (CubiX). This is a critical step towards the creation of a fully differentiated vascularized immunocompetent metastatic melanoma-on-chip model to recapitulate human pathophysiology, suitable for testing immunotherapies and studying the onset of possible resistance mechanisms.<br \/>(1) Mel-RhS were constructed on transwells (8 &#956;m pore size) and consisted of a human fibroblasts-populated collagen-fibrin dermal compartment, on top of which A375 melanoma cells and human keratinocytes were seeded. Mel-RhS were air-exposed for &#62; 14 days to form of a fully differentiated and stratified epidermis. Melanoma nests developed and expanded into the dermal compartment in the 3D model, mimicking the initial stages of invasive melanoma. Moreover, Mel-RhS were viable under flow conditions for up to 3 days and their histology was comparable to that of the static controls.<br \/>(2) The endothelial layer consisted of a monolayer of CD31<sup>+<\/sup> endothelial cells on the bottom side of the transwell membrane. The shear stress provided by medium perfusion was able to induce alignment (75-80%) of cells within 24 hours (3 times faster than published protocols) as well as Von Willebrand Factor production. Real-time pH, lactate, glucose, and oxygen consumption were measured by using in-line sensors during the culture time.<br \/>(3) Circulation of immune cells (MUTZ-3 progenitor cells) was achieved up to 24 hours in the presence of a healthy reconstructed human skin (RhS) model in a proof-of-concept study. The specific design of the developed MPS allowed for both immune cell flow and collection for downstream phenotypic analysis.<br \/>In conclusion, we have individually recapitulated these major biological features of melanoma <i>in vitro,<\/i> in standard MW under dynamic culture conditions. In the future, the integration of these features into a single model would provide a unique <i>in vitro <\/i>vascularized immunocompetent human melanoma-on-chip model as a novel tool to investigate and test new therapies targeting adaptive resistance to ICIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,Precision medicine,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Elisabetta Michielon<sup>1<\/sup>, Tanja de GruIijl<sup>2<\/sup>, Taco Waaijman<sup>1<\/sup>, Matteo Boninsegna<sup>3<\/sup>, Divyasree Prabhakaran<sup>3<\/sup>, Hadhemi Mejri<sup>3<\/sup>, Antoni Homs Corbera<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Pierre Gaudriault<\/b><sup>3<\/sup>, Susan Gibbs<sup>4<\/sup>, Dario Fassini<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands,<sup>3<\/sup>Cherry Biotech, Montreuil, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology & Department of Oral Cell Biology, Amsterdam University Medical Center & Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5c0ae12f-6d31-404b-9b19-3422f1d51a68","ControlNumber":"2968","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

Current medical intervention involves surgical removal of both ovaries and the uterus followed by chemotherapy. Thus, experimental models, established from primary tumor, may not mimic the real-time characteristics, heterogeneity, and disparity of OC after surgical debulking; a stage where OC survive and grow in peritoneal lavage fluid and form malignant ascites. Therefore, we present a protocol that enables efficient derivation and long-term expansion of ascites-derived organoids (AsO) culture to study their heterogeneity and disparity.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Malignant ascites, fresh tumors and whole blood were obtained at the time of surgical debulking and drainage of ascites\/pleural effusion under an approved IRB protocol; patients characteristic included ethnicity: Hispanic and pathology: Mucinous Adenocarcinoma, Serous Grade 3, Carcinosarcoma grade 3, FIGO Stage IIB\/IIIC (N = 3; treatment na&#239;ve).

RNA sequencing was performed on AsO and tumor-derived organoids (TuO), and that of whole tissues as controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed on 1 million live cells collected from malignant ascites (N = 3 patients).

The scRNAseq data have been analyzed to understand the distinctive features of individual cells and subcellular heterogeneity. RNA sequencing data confirmed that AsO and TuO recapitulated the features of their tissue of origin, but also illustrated genomic and phenotypical differences between both organoid types.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our efforts to make Hispanic-centered AsO biobank faithfully recapitulates OC hallmarks and can be subjected to real-time drug screening against chemoresistant tumors, genetic manipulations and cancer disparity research by comparing the AsO of non-Hispanic Whites.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ascites fluid,Organoids,Hispanic,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Md Mynul Hassan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Riajul Wahab<sup>1<\/sup>, Sheralyn Sanchez<sup>2<\/sup>, Eugene  P.

A large fraction of the CRC patients diagnosed with <i>de novo<\/i> metastatic disease do not benefit from standard of care and experience substantial side effects.

In collaboration with Yamaha Motor, the Yamaha CELL HANDLER<sup>TM<\/sup> has been validated to automatically pick-and-place with high accuracy a significantly reduced number of organoids per screening plate, compared to standard procedures. In addition, an image-based readout was developed that enables a precise quantification of organoid number ensuring high assay quality. Organoid responses to chemotherapy and targeted agents were validated using this newly automated system, confirming comparable PDO-patient drug sensitivity profiles, and known drug responses based on genetic dependencies. In summary we describe the development of an automated workflow that combines patient-representative HUB Organoids and state-of-the-art robotics by Yamaha CELL HANDLER. This workflow down-scales the number of organoids needed per screening well and allows to efficiently predict patient response, thereby reducing the diagnostic turnaround time and increasing patient benefits.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Screening,Diagnostic marker,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Esmee Koedoot<sup>1<\/sup>, Inez van Weersch<sup>1<\/sup>, Gakuro Harada<sup>2<\/sup>, Masahiko Watanabe<sup>2<\/sup>, Hamdy Warda<sup>1<\/sup>, Hideaki Kyan<sup>2<\/sup>, Yasmine Abouleila<sup>1<\/sup>, Takahiko Kumagai<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuichi Hikichi<sup>2<\/sup>, René Overmeer<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeanine Roodhart<sup>3<\/sup>, Kiyotaka Matsuno<sup>2<\/sup>, Carla Verissimo<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sylvia  F.

Despite the physiological relevance of tumoroid models, they have yet to supplant cancer lines, particularly for high-throughput screening (HTS) applications, in large part due to the relative difficulty of the culture workflow. The current gold standard tumoroid culture method involves embedding the cells into a scaffold (most commonly basement membrane extract or BME), which is highly manual, costly in time and resources, and difficult to implement in HTS workflows. We have developed a novel tumoroid culture medium, named Gibco<sup>TM<\/sup> OncoPro<sup>TM<\/sup> Tumoroid Culture Medium, and method in which the addition of diluted BME to tumoroid suspension cultures preserves apical-in polarity (equivalent to that of embedded cultures) while leveraging the benefits of a suspension culture workflow. Additionally, histology for a subset of suspension cultures have been compared with xenograft tumors formed in mice and demonstrate that the suspension culture maintains similar cellular organization. Our system enables a single user to generate hundreds of millions of cells, a feat that would require hundreds of BME domes using standard tumoroid culture methods, and has been shown compatible with colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and head and neck tumoroid lines that were derived in embedded culture with various complete media formulations. Critically, our data confirm that, when paired with our novel tumoroid culture medium, suspension culture maintains patient-specific characteristics comparably to embedded culture when passaged side-by-side for multiple months. Tumoroid lines representing the four unique cancer indications evaluated maintained patient-specific mutational and gene expression profiles (both &#8805; 90% correlated with the original material) over the course of culture. An evaluation of differentially expressed genes from a panel of over 20,000 human RefSeq genes showed that there was no change (greater than a two-fold increase\/decrease; p-value &#60; 0.05) in gene expression for &#8805; 98% of genes, on average, between embedded and suspension culture. Following scale up in suspension culture, we also show that tumoroids can be plated using automated liquid handling techniques for downstream HTS assays. Taken together, our data indicate that this suspension culture workflow paired with OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium maintains all critical characteristics of tumoroid lines grown in the traditional embedded culture workflow, while providing the scalability and compatibility with liquid handling that will enable greater adoption of these more physiologically relevant cancer models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Colorectal cancer,Lung cancer,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brittany  N.

However, cancer organoids have limitation in reflecting physicochemical microenvironments of tumor. In particular, vascular networks not only provide oxygen and nutrients to the tumor, but also play an important role as a channel through which drugs move in cancer. Vascularization occurs in an uncontrollable form and speed in conventional methods. Here, we regulate the directionality of the vascular bed using the surface acoustic waves(SAW) technology by which, vascular cells are locally aligned. Aligned cells exhibited an improved, cell-cell contact enhancing the vascular system maturation in a couple days. Organoids are constructed from gastric cancer patients with four molecular subtypes according to TCGA. Organoids were dissociated into a single cell to make a co-culture spheroid with HUVEC cells. Co-cultured spheroids were formed by adding fibronectin according to the characteristics of the patient sample. The SAW device is built with interdigitated transducer, NiNbO3 substrate, polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) and coverglass. After putting co-culture spheroids and HUVEC cells mixed with fibrin gel into the device, patterning is performed using surface acoustic waves with shaking in EGM-2 media. After fixing the models, CD31 and F-actin are stained and imaged through immunofluorescent. Immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the blood vessel cross section. The blood vessels patterned with SAW were well aligned in a straight line, and a lumen structure was formed in a couple days. When co-cultured spheroids were used compared to mono-cultured spheroids, the interaction with external HUVECs was improved, allowing for efficient vascular organism models. As evidence for this, it was confirmed that HUVEC inside the co-cultured spheroid and HUVEC outside were connected through interaction when PKH dyeing was done in a different color. We showed that blood vessels are formed faster and thicker in patterning models than in random models, and interactions with co-cultured spheroids are also high. Through immunofluorescent staining, we found that the number of vascular branches linked to spheroids was higher in the SAW model. In addition, in the H&#38;E results, it was confirmed that the blood vessels were arranged in a line, and that differentiation occurred appropriately to form a tubular structure. In addition, the number of blood formed inside the spheroid was higher.

An emerging solution to this problem is to replace traditional cell lines with patient tissue-derived cells expanded in 3D, also known as tumoroids or cancer organoids. We developed a defined, serum- and conditioned medium-free system, Gibco<sup>TM<\/sup> OncoPro<sup>TM<\/sup> Tumoroid Culture Medium, that can be used to derive stable tumoroid lines from a variety of tissue sources and maintains the phenotype and genotype of patient-derived tumor cells. By supplementing the base medium with indication-specific growth factors, tumoroid lines were derived from colorectal, lung, and endometrial cancers from both fresh surgical resections and cryopreserved primary cancer cells. To demonstrate the utility of these patient-derived cells as long-term in vitro models, colorectal and lung tumoroid lines were derived from multiple donors and cultured for up to 50 passages. Brightfield microscopy, cell counts, and next-generation sequencing were used to assess maintenance of tumoroid morphology, growth rate, gene expression patterns, and genomic mutations. Patient-derived tumoroid cultures adopted donor-specific morphologies that were maintained during long-term culture. Cell doubling time tended to stabilize within the first few passages as cultures established, was donor-dependent, and averaged around 65 hours for colorectal tumoroids - on par with that of traditional 2D cancer cell lines - and 90-100 hours for lung and endometrial tumoroids, respectively. Importantly, tumoroid lines maintained their gene expression pattern for over 20,000 human RefSeq genes during long-term culture, with correlation between initial tumor material and late-passage samples of R&#62;0.8. Distinct molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer were preserved in cultured tumoroids. The allelic frequency of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in 161 highly relevant cancer genes was also highly correlated (R&#62;0.9) between uncultured tissue and late-passage tumoroids. Within SNVs, transition\/transversion mutation ratios were conserved. Tumoroids were cryopreserved and recovered during this study, demonstrating that biobanking of colorectal and lung tumoroids should not impact their long-term stability. Finally, a subset of the derived colorectal and lung tumoroids were tested and shown to be tumorigenic in mice, where subsequent histology of the tumor was similar to that of in vitro cultures. Altogether, tumoroid derivation and culture in this novel medium enables the long-term preservation of patient-specific cellular genotype and phenotype, which should allow for expansion, biobanking, and performance of experimental repeats within the same patient tissue-derived cultures across labs and over time.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,In vitro,Lung cancer,Endometrial cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chris Yankaskas<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Brittany Balhouse<sup><\/sup>, Colin Paul<sup><\/sup>, Shyanne Salen<sup><\/sup>, Sybelle Djikeng<sup><\/sup>, Pradip Shahi Thakuri<sup><\/sup>, Mark Kennedy<sup><\/sup>, Matt Dallas<sup><\/sup>, David Kuninger<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Thermo Fisher Scientific, Frederick, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0c97f7fd-b98e-4aa4-bc89-8d149063f570","ControlNumber":"5100","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

Patient-derived tumor cells can serve as a powerful resource for studying pathophysiologic mechanisms and developing robust strategies for precision medicine. To address this problem, we launched the patient-derived organoids (PDOs) Hub to establish a comprehensive model of various tumor organoids from pancreatic, biliary tract, liver, colorectal, breast, gastric, ovarian, and oral cancers, with matching clinical data and molecular characteristics.<br \/>Methods All specimens were collected from histologically confirmed cancer patients at the National Cancer Center. Samples obtained from surgery, biopsy, or body fluid (malignant ascites or pleural effusion) were collected for ex vivo culture of tumor cells. PDOs were managed according to our standard operating procedure (SOP), which included specimen delivery process, separation of cells from tissues, criteria for subculture, quality control (QC), production of genomic and histologic data, and the 384-well-based drug response evaluation system. Organoids were considered to be successfully cultured when they were maintained for five or more passages.<br \/>Results A total of 263 PDOs were established from various cancer types, including oral cancer (N = 89), pancreatic cancer (N = 48), ovarian cancer (N = 32), breast cancer (N = 30), biliary tract cancer (N = 29), hepatocellular carcinoma (N = 17), gallbladder cancer (N = 8), gastric cancer (N = 7) and colorectal cancer (N = 3). PDOs broadly recapitulated the histologic and genetic characteristics of the patient&#8217;s tumor. These organoids available for long-term culture were cryopreserved, and a total of 2986 stocks have been accumulated. Drug screening tests were performed with 60 PDOs (pancreatic cancer, N = 36; breast cancer, N = 15; ovarian cancer, N = 6; gastric cancer, N = 3) using selected agents among the 47 drugs for each type of cancer. Profiles of cytotoxic agents were well correlated with the patient&#8217;s clinical responses to the matched drugs and tested investigational agents also showed promising antitumor activity.<br \/>Conclusions We have established a model of several human cancer organoids. This will serve as the platform that can recapitulate the physiology and drug response profiles of human cancer and pave the way for screening innovative drugs, identifying novel targets, and stratifying patients for pertinent therapeutic options.<br \/>(This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea grant, funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2020M3A9A5036362))","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Patient-derived organoid(PDO),Pre-clinical model,Drug screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yebeen Yu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mi Rim Lee<sup><\/sup>, Wonyoung Choi<sup><\/sup>, Sumin Kang<sup><\/sup>, Jeong Eun Gong<sup><\/sup>, Soobeen Heo<sup><\/sup>, Hye Ju Park<sup><\/sup>, Sang Myung Woo<sup><\/sup>, So-Youn Jung<sup><\/sup>, Sung Weon Choi<sup><\/sup>, Jong-Ho Lee<sup><\/sup>, Myong Cheol Lim<sup><\/sup>, Ji Yeon Baek<sup><\/sup>, Bo Hyun Kim<sup><\/sup>, Ji Hoon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Yuri Cho<sup><\/sup>, Sang-Jae Park<sup><\/sup>, Yun-Hee Kim<sup><\/sup>, Sun-Young Kong<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Cancer Center - Korea, Goyang-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cf9e1dcf-ad5e-4276-8bc8-94dda38d87ba","ControlNumber":"3294","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSC) is a distinct subtype of ovarian cancer, comprising ~10% of serous carcinomas and typically characterized by a younger age of onset. Molecularly, these tumors are often characterized by alterations within the Ras signaling pathway, including <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations. Clinically, LGSC is often resistant to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, but may have sensitivity to hormonal therapy or MEK inhibitors.<b> <\/b>Here we report on a platform and proof of concept in one LGSC patient to evaluate personalized tumor-directed therapy regimens using patient-derived organoids (PDOs), BH3 profiling and viability evaluation in 3D microfluidic devices.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> A patient with LGSC presented to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and was treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel before a total abdominal hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Tissue was obtained under an IRB approved protocol and PDOs were established. Standard of care and non-standard of care treatments including doxorubicin, abemaciclib, letrozole, alpelisib, tamoxifen, trametinib, venetoclax, and navitoclax were evaluated by two orthogonal assays. First, they were tested for delta priming by BH3 profiling (Bhola<u> et.al., Sci Signal. 2020<\/u> ) and second for cell viability using 3D microfluidic devices by TMRM \/ DRAQ7 dual-color fluorescent staining. Standard of care treatments carboplatin and paclitaxel were evaluated as individual treatments and in combination in 3D microfluidic devices.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> We successfully established a PDO model from the patient&#8217;s tumor sample in 14 days. BH3 profiling at 24 hours and viability in 3D microfluidic devices after 6 days in treatment showed that from the eight tested drugs, the model was sensitive to navitoclax and venetoclax. Average percent change in viability was -91.5% and -89.9%, respectively, and the drugs had a dynamic BH3 profiling index of 551.4 AUC (+\/- 76.63) and 488.9 AUC (+\/- 21.46) with the threshold of response being &#62;175 for BH3 profiling. Trametinib showed a clear response in 3D, with an average percent change of -72.6% compared to the control but no significant response in BH3 profiling. Neither carboplatin and paclitaxel alone, nor in combination, elicited a significant change in viability. This observation was consistent with the patient&#8217;s history prior to surgery, where the tumor did not demonstrate significant clinical response to neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> We describe a proof of concept of a N of 1 response assessment platform for LGSC using PDOs, BH3 profiling and live\/dead fluorescent staining in microfluidic devices and demonstrate that BH3 profiling and 3D viability assessment assays show good congruity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Tumor targeting,Ex vivo,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Brittany Meisenheimer<sup>1<\/sup>, Ha  V.

Clinical factors were also analyzed associated with the success rate in establishing PDAC organoids; specimens with high cellularity (&#62;10 clusters) were an independent factor in multivariate analysis. Whole exome sequencing showed the high concordance between primary PDAC and its organoid and more enriched genetic alterations in organoids. In addition, the high-throughput screening (HTS) drug test revealed that the clinical correlation with real-world data was 12 out of 15 between PDAC organoids and the chemotherapeutic response of the study patients. Whole-transcriptome sequencing identified genes and pathways associated with the drug responses.<br \/>Conclusions: We have achieved the PDAC organoid platform in a high success rate via EUS-guided FNB, and the concordance between primary PDAC and its organoid seems very high.

More than 20 different subtypes of breast cancer are identified. Advancement in patient-derived organoid technology makes it possible to preserve cellular, structural, and tissue microenvironment, which mimics the tissue in vivo. The present study aims to develop a cryopreserved (living) tumor biobank from patient-derived tumor breast tissues. Eventually, biobank organoids will be used to test treatment options outside of patients, in a dish, and provide information on what treatments the patient responds to.<br \/>Method: Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) were bio-fabricated using an unsorted tumor and normal cell suspension in a collagen-based hydrogel. Immune-enhanced tumor organoids (iTOs) were also bio-fabricated using patient-matched PMBCs and tumor cells. Breast cancer living biobanks were developed by freezing organoids in cryopreservation solutions and reestablishing them in growth media compatible with breast organoids. Histological staining for hormone receptors and Her2 receptor markers was performed. Organoids were cultured for seven days, followed by treatment with chemotherapy (Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin, and Sulphonamide) and immunotherapy (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Atezolizumab), and assessed for cell viability.<br \/>Results: H&#38;E staining showed the characteristics of the breast tissue with well-defined acini. In tumor organoids, acini were somewhat perturbed compared to normal breast organoids. Immunofluorescence staining showed the expression of breast biomarkers, including EGF receptor 2 (HER2), Progesterone receptor (PR), and Estrogen receptor (ER). Zona occludin 2 and keratin 19 expression in luminal cells and expression of Keratin 14 and P63 in basal cells, suggesting correct polarization in the organoids. Immunofluorescence staining of iTOs, with T cell markers including CD3, CD4, and CD8, indicated that immune cells remained viable in the iTOs. Drug responses to Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel, Sulphonamide and a combination of Doxorubicin-Paclitaxel showed significant inhibition of cell growth in normal and tumor organoids (p&#60; 0.04). Treatment of breast iTOs showed moderate responses to nivolumab (n=11) and pembrolizumab (n=5), with a 63%-100% efficacy (P &#60; 0.05) respectively. No responses were observed for Atezolizumab (n=5). Drug responses of biobank organoids showed comparable drug sensitivities to their fresh, non-frozen counterparts, suggesting that biobank organoids retain physiological relevant information and can be used for testing new drug therapies.<br \/>Conclusion: Breast cancer organoids recapitulate the histological features of breast tissue in culture and respond to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In the future, patient-derived breast tumor organoids can be cryopreserved and serve as living biobanks to provide a platform for personalized medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Breast cancer,Biobank,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nadeem Wajih<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Richard Erali<sup>2<\/sup>, Edward  A.

The development of colorectal cancer involves a stepwise accumulation of genetic alterations in APC, KRAS, DCC, and p53 that is often described as a &#8220;Vogelgram,&#8221; named after the Vogelstein laboratory which laid the groundwork for our understanding of the molecular events leading to colorectal cancer. Organoids are a highly physiologically relevant laboratory tool that can provide valuable information regarding the tumor microenvironment. Here, we describe <i>ex vivo<\/i> establishment of APC fl\/fl, CRE+, KRAS G12D +\/-, P53 fl\/fl colorectal organoids, which behave normally before tamoxifen treatment but acquire malignant behaviors after tamoxifen-induced loss of APC and p53.<b> <\/b>Colonic crypts from mice with colon-specific expression of APC fl\/fl, CRE+, KRAS G12D +\/-, P53 fl\/fl were isolated and grown in Matrigel and WENRAS medium following the Organoid Core Facility protocol of the Legorreta Cancer Center. Western blot was used to measure levels of KRAS, KRAS G12D, APC, and p53 after 12 days of tamoxifen treatment and images were taken after 6 days of tamoxifen treatment. The organoid growth medium was collected after 3-4 days of incubation and run on the Luminex 200 platform to measure the levels of 50+ cytokines. Organoids were embedded in OCT and cryosectioned for IF staining with p53, p21, Ki67 and Lgr5 antibodies. IF stained organoid slides were imaged by confocal microscope at 40X magnification. Tamoxifen treatment (12 days) induces overexpression of KRAD G12D protein, reduces expression of APC, and abolishes p53 expression. At day 6, distinct morphological changes indicate malignant transformation. This transformation was accompanied by a trend toward decreased BAFF and CCL20. H&#38;E staining revealed clearly visible intra-organoid structures and florescent labeling of Ki67, Lgr5, and p21 visualized by confocal microscope revealed distinct localization of these proteins within the organoid structures. Here, we describe Vogelgram-mimicking organoids that may be used as a valuable laboratory tool to study the processes involved in the stepwise transformation into colorectal cancer. We plan to use this validated system to evaluate drug sensitivity, cytokine secretion, and immune cell interactions along colorectal cancer progression. We also plan to characterize cell populations with single-cell RNA-seq, establish triangulated cultures, and conduct <i>in vivo<\/i> studies using this transgenic mouse model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Colorectal cancer,Progression,Transgenic mice,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Leiqing Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Lindsey Carlsen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lanlan Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Liz Hernandez Borrero<sup><\/sup>, Wafik  S.

Deficiency in the DNA double-strand break repair mechanism can cause tumor vulnerability to platinum and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) through synergistic lethal mechanisms. However, PARPi resistance is observed among some BRCA-mutant cancer patients. Conversely, some wild-type <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> cancers are susceptible to these therapies. Hence, there is a need to better characterize HRD cancers and uncover additional treatment options. Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) are emerging <i>ex vivo<\/i> cancer models as they harbor the mutational landscape of the original tumor and are shown to accurately replicate drug responses observed in patients. In this project, we used a diverse set of pan-cancer PDTOs to model HRD responses to PARPi and other therapies. A total of n=230 pan-cancer PDTOs were generated and characterized by cytopathology, immunohistochemistry, and NGS platforms, confirming concordance with corresponding tumors. Fifty PDTOs from patients with and without <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> mutations and from patients who received platinum or PARPi were selected for this project, including ovary, breast, pancreas, endometrium and gastrointestinal cancers. HRD of the original cancers was determined by their genomic composition and manual curation of single base substitution molecular signatures and structural variants - a novel classifier trained and validated in our pan-cancer whole-genome sequencing (WGS) cohort. Mutational status of genes in HR pathway was recorded only for PDTOs that have whole exome sequencing (WES). We developed an immunofluorescent staining to detect RAD51 foci and support the functional HR status and evaluated the treatment timeline with daily brightfield imaging to record the effect of PARPi. We performed high throughput drug screening (HTDS) on 11 PDTOs with FDA-approved drugs, including DNA synthesis inhibitors, CHEK1 inhibitors, PARPi, and ATM\/ATR inhibitors. Four PDTOs (rectum, ovary, and prostate) with <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> alterations and 3 wild-type <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>(pancreas and ovary) responded to PARPis; while 4 wild-type <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> (pancreas and ovary) did not respond. Only 5 PDTOs were sensitive to platinum therapies, but all 11 PDTOs responded to the CHEK1 and ATM\/ATR inhibitors. Further HTDS experiments on the rest of the selected PDTOs, including combination therapies, are ongoing. In this project, our combinational approach includes well-characterized pan-cancer PDTOs, a functional assay to determine the effects of genetic variants, and an innovative HTDS pipeline to assess HRD status. These robust and clinically relevant assays will help uncover alternative therapeutic options for patients with HRD cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Drug discovery,DNA double-strand break repair genes,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hui-Hsuan Kuo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Madj Al Assaad<sup>2<\/sup>, John Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jenna Moyer<sup>1<\/sup>, Hamza Gokozan<sup>3<\/sup>, Sarah Ackermann<sup>1<\/sup>, Jared Capuano<sup>1<\/sup>, Jyothi Manohar<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Sigouros<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Sboner<sup>2<\/sup>, Juan Miguel Mosquera<sup>2<\/sup>, Olivier Elemento<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Laura Martin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a31ad5d6-d43c-4280-b180-bfd9df1d2d74","ControlNumber":"4536","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

Incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) subtype has been rising (&#62;60%) in North America. Systemic docetaxel-based triplet chemotherapy represents the best standard of care, approx. 60% of patients showcasing innate chemo-resistance or developing acquired chemo-resistance. 3D organoids provide a robust and heterogeneous cell source but lack the stromal microenvironment. We established a high-fidelity, stromal-inclusive tumor-on-chip platform expanding on tumor heterogeneity with micro-physiological relevance and flexible complexity.<br \/>Methods: A total of 8 (4 chemo-sensitive and 4 chemo-resistant) treatment na&#239;ve patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and matched fibroblasts were selected to develop syngeneic human esophageal microtissues (tumor and adjacent) on commercially available (Emulate), compartmentalized, porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane-based microfluidic device. Chips accommodate organoids-derived epithelial cells at the upper mucosal channel and matched fibroblasts at the bottom stromal channel. 3D-microtissue development on the chip and treatment-induced cytotoxicity were examined for up to 11 days. We followed the FLOT (docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil; 1:1.7:52) based chemotherapy regime on the chip and evaluated the recapitulation of patient-specific response. Epithelial barrier integrity, adenocarcinoma-associated cellular proteins, and level of cyfra 21-1 (circulating tumor biomarker) were determined on-chip grown microtissues.<br \/>Results: Real-time brightfield microscopic observations revealed that the EA chips manifest mucin production, adequate tissue tight epithelial barriers, and distinct morphological characteristics that emerged with adenocarcinoma progression. Presence of pleomorphic cells (multiple shapes and sizes), establishment of tight epithelial barriers and formation of mature microvilli was observed <i>via<\/i> electron microscopy. Patient specific tumor tissue growth were observed for maximum 12 days under a physiologically relevant media flow. Perfusion of pharmacokinetically pertinent doses of triplet chemotherapeutic compounds performed through the stromal channel and each chip recapitulated level of chemosensitivity observed in the patient. Fluorescent probes and LDH assay also demonstrated patient-specific chemo response.

The effects of microgravity in low earth orbit (LEO) can be leveraged to study pre-cancer and cancer transformation in an accelerated timeframe. Thus, we launched two cancer cell types into space as a proof of concept and to establish an innovative model for studying cancer. The two cell types are TF1a, an erythroleukemia cell line, and Caco-2, a colon cancer cell line that was cultured as organoids. These studies were performed in collaboration with Axiom Space and were launched as part of the Ax-1 mission on April 8, 2022. To study these tumor organoids in space, cells were transduced with two lentiviral reporters, ADAR1 NanoLuciferase reporter, an A-to-I editing reporter, and Fucci2BL, a cell-cycle transit reporter. Fluorescent imaging at days 5 and 6 of the mission, courtesy of KEyence Research MIcroscope Testbed (KERMIT), allowed us to receive and assess the development of these tumor models in real-time. Caco-2 organoids in flight grew 3-5 times bigger than their ground counterparts. Preliminary whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis showed that telomere length is shortened in flight samples compared to asynchronous ground control samples. In summary, research done in LEO has the capacity to strengthen terrestrial research. As we follow-up with these studies as part of the Ax-2 mission in May of 2023, we hope to gain more insight into the pathogenesis of cancer and develop strategies to mitigate cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jessica Pham<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Luisa Ladel<sup><\/sup>, Christina Wu<sup><\/sup>, Catriona Jamieson<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1a9da9f6-6ffa-46ec-b6f7-ccc5e0e4d826","ControlNumber":"8190","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Using organoid models, we aim to explore the mechanisms of resistance to cancer therapies and identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities, including stress protecting melanoma-associated antigens (MAGEs). MAGEs are normally restricted to expression in testis but are abnormally activated in cancer and are associated with therapy resistance.<br \/>Methods: Organoids have been established from fresh tumor biopsies and are stored in Gliobank, a Slovenian collection of patient tumor samples with corresponding clinical data. Organoids were first characterized and compared with the corresponding parental tumor tissue by immunofluorescence and qPCR of selected markers. Organoids were then treated with a combination of irradiation, the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide and\/or a chemokine receptor antagonist, and response to therapy was assessed by immunofluorescence, qPCR, cell viability and invasion assays, multiplex ELISA and proximity ligation assay.<br \/>Results: Organoids recapitulated the gene expression profile of parental glioblastoma tissues, including expression of genes related to cancer stem cells, DNA damage response, cell cycle progression, epithelial- to- mesenchymal transition, and cytokine signaling. In addition, the organoids preserved the cellular composition of the parental glioblastoma tissues, consisting of glioblastoma (stem) cells, macrophages, microglia, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. Standard treatment decreased viability and invasion of organoids in only 2 of 6 patients, suggesting that organoids recapitulate tumor therapy resistance. The increased expression of <i>MDM2<\/i> and <i>CDKN1A<\/i> in organoids after treatment with irradiation and temozolomide suggests that the p53 pathway and DNA damage response mechanisms may contribute to the therapy resistance. Next, we detected high abundance of secreted cytokines in the culture medium of the organoids, including CXCL12. However, treatment of the organoids with the CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor, which blocked the interactions between CXCL12 and CXCR4 in the organoids, had no effect on organoid viability and invasion, suggesting resistance of glioblastoma to this immunotherapy. Since high expression of several type I MAGEs correlates with poor prognosis of glioma patients based on TCGA database analysis, we investigate the role of MAGEs in therapy resistance of glioblastoma organoids.<br \/>Conclusions: Patient-derived tumor organoids provide a valuable tool to 1) identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in the context of the tumor microenvironment, 2) evaluate the effect of novel candidate treatments including immunotherapy, and 3) discover novel markers of therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Therapy resistance,Organoids,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Barbara Breznik<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bernarda Majc<sup>2<\/sup>, Anamarija Habi&#269;<sup>2<\/sup>, Gloria Krapež<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrej Por&#269;nik<sup>3<\/sup>, Jernej Mlakar<sup>4<\/sup>, Tamara Lah Turnšek<sup>2<\/sup>, Metka Novak<sup>2<\/sup>, Klementina Fon Tacer<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Veterinary Medicine, Texas Tech University, Texas Center for Comparative Cancer Research (TC3R), Amarillo, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, Ljubljana, Slovenia,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia,<sup>4<\/sup>Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pathology, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2ee92846-6b88-48c2-933f-d24363bea4af","ControlNumber":"3834","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

However, the establishment rate of prostate cancer (PCa) organoids directly from clinical specimens are still low, and we need to improve. Patient-derived xenograft model (PDX) is widely used as a human-derived in vivo model, but genetic engineering is impossible, limiting its use. We aimed to develop a method to stably grow prostate cancer organoids from PDX and evaluate the feasibility of gene engineering using PDX-derived organoids. Materials and Methods KUCaP PDX series, which were established from castration-resistant prostate cancer patient tissues, were used to establish organoids. Eight organoids from eight models of KUCaP PDX were established and maintained for at least three passages. Organoids were reinjected into immunodeficient mice to establish organoid-derived xenograft (ODX) with 100% efficacy. We compared histopathological and molecular characteristics of primary patient tumors, PDX tumors, organoids, and ODX tumors. We conducted whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing to assess the genomic profiles across the models. Firefly luciferase was introduced into organoids to show the feasibility of genetic engineering. Results Pathological findings were similar across the models derived from the same patient. WES analysis revealed most of the mutations detected in the matched patient tumors and organoids. Hierarchical clustering of RNA sequencing showed that the primary tumors, PDX tumors, organoids, and ODX tumors derived from the same patient cluster, which indicates that even after clonal selection during the establishment of organoids, the basic molecular feature of the model is maintained (Figure). Firefly luciferase was successfully introduced in seven out of seven tested organoids and imaged the ODX tumors from these organoids in vivo. Conclusions Organoids were established with a high success rate using PDX. Firefly luciferase was successfully introduced, showed the feasibility of genetic engineering using prostate cancer organoids. Matched PDX and organoids of PCa recapitulate the basic molecular features of primary human PCa. PDX-derived organoids of PCa, which enables genetic engineering of human-derived cellular models, which could be a valuable tool to enhance PCa research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Organoids,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Takuro Sunada<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Takayuki Goto<sup><\/sup>, Takayuki Sumiyoshi<sup><\/sup>, Akamatsu Shusuke<sup><\/sup>, Takashi Kobayashi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Urology, Kyoto Univ.

Therefore, it is important to incorporate elements of the TME, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and stromal cells, into preclinical models to better recapitulate tumor dynamics in vivo. Particularly, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a dominant stromal cell type within the TME that secrete and remodel the ECM and whose abundance can correlate with poor overall survival. Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) are an innovative preclinical model that has recently emerged as a biomarker for predicting patient-specific drug responses in CRC. However, traditional PDTO cultures fail to account for the aforementioned elements of the TME. Here, we present a basement membrane extract (BME) and collagen type I-based co-culture system utilizing patient-matched CRC PDTOs and CAFs to investigate the effects of the TME on PDTO growth rate, morphology, and drug response.First, we compared the growth rate, morphology, and drug response of PDTO-only cultures in 2 ECMs: 100% BME and 90% BME + 10% collagen type I. PDTOs were seeded 4 days prior to treatment with clinically relevant therapeutics 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan). Cell viability was assessed 5 days after treatment using the CellTiter-Glo 3D assay. In addition, brightfield and fluorescent images of the PDTOs were taken on days -1, 0, 3, and 5 of the drug treatment. GFP-labeled PDTOs were utilized for the image-based analysis to improve segmentation and quantification of PDTO growth rate and morphology as well as to help distinguish between PDTOs and CAFs in the co-culture experiments. The co-culture experiments of PDTOs and CAFs in 90% BME + 10% collagen type I were performed and analyzed using the same assays. To enhance tumor-stromal interactions, the PDTOs and CAFs were suspended together in the ECM. By culturing CRC PDTOs in the BME + collagen I matrix, as well as co-culturing with patient-matched CAFs, we observed differential responses in PDTO growth rate, morphology, and drug response compared to the 100% BME, PDTO-only condition. In conclusion, our initial findings warrant further investigation into the importance of incorporating elements of the TME into PDTO models for drug discovery applications to more closely mimic in vivo tumor conditions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Imaging,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Scott Valena<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pratiksha Kshetri<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuyuan Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Elton<sup>1<\/sup>, Shohei Imamura<sup>2<\/sup>, Nolan Ung<sup>1<\/sup>, Seungil Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael E.

Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are a 3-D culture model that allow primary tumour cells to propagate, and have gained considerable traction in many cancer types such as PDAC. However, concerns remain regarding whether these models can predict what occurs in patients. We hypothesize that genomic and transcriptomic drift occurring in PDO models impacts the fidelity of drug response. To investigate, matched WGS and bulk RNAseq was performed on paired PDAC organoids and tumour tissue (n=41). Core biopsies were obtained from in patients with Stage III-IV PDAC enrolled in the COMPASS trial (NCT02750657) and divided for sequencing and organoid generation. Tumour cellularity was enriched by laser capture microdissection. Although alterations in the four major driver genes (KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A) remained consistent, other genomic differences were identified. SNV count was higher in organoids (median 6584 vs 5931, p&#60;0.0001), and enriched in SBS5 mutational signature (p&#60;0.0001). This was not significantly correlated with passage number, and private mutations were identified in both tumours and organoids (median 67% overlap). Two organoids showed significant shifts in ploidy, with both diploid to polyploid shifts and vice versa observed. In the transcriptome, expression of Basal-like genes (KRT5, TP63) was decreased. Bias towards the Classical transcriptomic subtype have previously been observed in PDAC organoid cultures. PDO responses to 5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin correlated with patient response to FFX (n=22, 72% concordance). However, PDO responses to gemcitabine and paclitaxel were poorly predictive of patient responses to GnP (n=10, 38% concordance), and notably, expression of the biomarker hENT1 was not correlated in matched tumors and PDOs (R=0.17, p=0.40). Despite this, tumour expression of the biomarker hENT1 successfully stratified patient responses to gemcitabine, and organoid hENT1 expression was correlated to gemcitabine response in vitro (R=0.47, p=0.005), indicating that transcriptomic drift may be a major contributor to discrepancies in patient-PDO drug response. In summary, organoids recapitulate major histologic features and driver mutations of patient tumours, but genetic drift and subclonal selection are observed even at lower passages. Further study is required to improve the utility of organoids in translational precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Pancreatic cancer,Genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Irene  Y.

Despite this heterogeneity, systemic treatment options for patients with advanced STS are rather uniform and have very limited efficacy. There is an unmet medical need to develop more active, subtype-specific treatment options. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models (organoids) have been successfully used for drug testing in carcinoma research. However, the development of STS organoids is lagging behind. We attempted to identify the best growth conditions for organoids derived from synovial sarcoma (SySa), which is one of the more common translocation-related subtypes of STS.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Human synovial sarcoma tissue was implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice and grown to create a patient-derived xenograft (PDX). Fresh tumor tissue from the PDX model was collected and enzymatically and mechanically dissociated into small cell clusters. The cells were seeded into a 3D scaffold with advanced Dulbecco's modified Eagle&#8217;s medium (DMEM)\/F12 and different growth factors were added. In order to obtain optimal results, different scaffolds and growth factors were compared. The growth of the 3D cultures was evaluated by bright-field microscopy and a cell viability assay using PrestoBlue. The organoids were characterized by histopathological stainings and the presence of the SSX-SS18 translocation was molecularly confirmed. Finally, we attempted to create organoids from PDX-derived material stored in liquid nitrogen.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A scaffold consisting of 50% collagen type 1, 30% Matrigel, 20% DMEM 10x and sodium hydroxide was superior to Matrigel alone. The addition of human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng\/ml), human insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, 20 ng\/ml), human recombinant fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2, 10 ng\/ml), and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 500 mmol) to advanced DMEM\/F12 stimulated the growth of SySa organoids the best. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was added to prevent apoptosis during early passages. So far, attempts to create organoids from frozen material have been unsuccessful.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: At present, the success rate of establishing organoids from synovial sarcoma cells is limited if the culture conditions are not adapted to their needs. We identified that growth factors such as EGF, FGF-2, IGF-1, and NAC are beneficial for growth. The availability of fresh samples plays an important role in the development of these 3D models. Despite these limitations, organoids can be an interesting tool for studying this rare disease and aid in the development of new drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lore De Cock<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Agnieszka Wozniak<sup>1<\/sup>, Kimberly Verbeeck<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Schöffski<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>General Medical Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c85843ee-7d79-491c-b6c5-faa1d2b844d1","ControlNumber":"6161","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

However, current tumoroid culture relies on labor-intensive media formulations and culture workflows. To address these issues, we have developed the serum- and conditioned medium-free Gibco&#8482; OncoPro&#8482; Tumoroid Culture Medium to enable derivation and expansion of patient-derived lines from multiple cancer indications. The system has been optimized to retain key patient genotypic and phenotypic characteristics during in vitro culture in a Wnt agonist-free system that can be easily adopted and transferred between labs. To test the applicability of our system with previously established tumoroid\/cancer organoid models, we procured publicly available cancer models from the National Cancer Institute Patient-Derived Models Repository (NCI PDMR). Multiple colorectal, lung, pancreas, and head and neck tumoroid models were tested, including tumoroids originally derived in conditioned medium containing Wnt-3A, R-spondin 3, and Noggin. Cells were assessed for survival, growth, and fidelity to starting material in both OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium and in PDMR-recommended homebrew media. Growth and morphology of tumoroid cells was monitored and was comparable between culture conditions. To test for genetic stability of cultures over time, the mutational status of organoids expanded in each condition was characterized using targeted NGS. Both SNV allelic frequency and ploidy values were conserved from initial starting material following expansion to cryopreservation-competent banks (&#62;10e6 cells). Gene expression levels across over &#62;20,000 human RefSeq genes were compared between culture methods and showed high (&#62;0.9) correlation, and Wnt-related signaling pathways were not differentially regulated between media types. In select cases, tumoroid cells expanded in each condition were also analyzed by flow cytometry using optimized antibody panels and protocols. Total cell viability and expression of EpCAM, CD45, CD31, smooth muscle actin, vimentin, CDX2, CEACAM, and cytokeratin 7 was nearly identical across culture conditions. Taken together, our approach represents a simple and effective method to expand and maintain patient-derived human cancer organoids <i>in vitro<\/i>, with no clear adverse effects from moving to a Wnt-free system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,In vitro,Cancer cell,3D models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Colin Paul<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Brittany Balhouse<sup><\/sup>, Chris Yankaskas<sup><\/sup>, Shyanne Salen<sup><\/sup>, Sybelle Djikeng<sup><\/sup>, Pradip Shahi Thakuri<sup><\/sup>, Matt Dallas<sup><\/sup>, David Kuninger<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Thermo Fisher Scientific, Frederick, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3fe14a1a-1e4a-4443-be07-b03af1e5fac1","ControlNumber":"4541","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

PDOs are useful for preclinical studies including drug sensitivity tests of tumors from individual patients as well as development of novel targeted agents. Collectively, PDOs are recently introduced as an emerging platform for personalized medicine. We obtained a total of 100 surgical specimens from 100 patients with breast cancer at the Yonsei Cancer Center, Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea. One of the tissue specimens was acquired from a breast cancer patient-derived xenograft model. We dissociated the tissues and isolated breast cancer primary tumor cells from the samples, and then the cells were cultured in basement membrane-like matrix in 3D manner with growth medium with supplements. We defined successful establishment of PDOs as continuous growth after 3 passaging. Among all 100 cases, 32 cases failed to culture or passage, however, 41 cases were successfully cultured over 3 passages. In addition, the remaining 27 cases are still in progress of establishment. Success rate of PDO was 68% (68\/100). Subtypes of primary tumors of the PDO were 33.8% (23\/68) of luminal A, 26.5% (18\/68) of luminal B, 26.5% (18\/68) of triple-negative, 5.9% (4\/68) of triple-positive and 7.4% (5\/68) of HER2-enriched. Success rates of each subtype were 69.7% (23\/33) of luminal A, 72.0% (18\/25) of luminal B, 66.7% (18\/27) of triple-negative, 66.7% (4\/6) of triple-positive and 55.6% (5\/9) of HER2-enriched. Pathologic evaluation using immunohistochemistry revealed that PDOs showed similar morphologic and immunohistochemical features with primary tumors. The selective sensitivity of PARP inhibitor, olaparib, was confirmed in PDOs harboring mutant <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>compared with BRCA1\/2 wild-type PDOs. Overall, PDOs can be used as a real-time platform for drug sensitivity and screening analyses, and a robust tool for preclinical studies in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Organoids,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Won-Ji Ryu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shinyoung Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeong Dong Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Yumi Hwang<sup>1<\/sup>, Seongyeon Jo<sup>2<\/sup>, Kweon Tae Yong<sup>1<\/sup>, Ja Seung Koo<sup>3<\/sup>, Min Hwan Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Joo Hyuk Sohn<sup>5<\/sup>, Hyung Seok Park<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Division of medical science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Medical oncology, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Division of Breast Surgery, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7901d00b-bc07-4a2d-82e9-effde0255b10","ControlNumber":"5718","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.
