[{"Abstract":"Background: Prostate cancer (PCa), the second leading cause of death in American men, includes distinct genetic subtypes with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. The <i>DACH1<\/i> gene encodes a winged helix\/Forkhead DNA-binding protein that competes for binding to FOXM1 sites.<br \/>Methods: Analysis of DACH1 gene deletion and gene expression was conducted from public data bases and human prostate cancer samples. Transgenic mice were generated in which the Dach1 gene was deleted in the prostate of prostate Oncomice. Cells derived from Dach1 gene deletion mice and human prostate cancer cell lines with Dach1 knockdown were analyzed for DNA damage repair responses.<br \/>Results: <i>DACH1 <\/i>gene deletion within the<i> <\/i>13q21.31-q21.33 region, occurred in up to 18% of human PCa, and was associated with increased AR activity, and poor prognosis. <i>DACH1<\/i> homozygous deletions more frequent in the metastatic site than in the primary tumors (Mich: 10% <i>vs.<\/i> 18%, N=59; FHCRC: 4% <i>vs.<\/i>11%, N= 54, SU2C: not profiled <i>vs.<\/i> 3.3, N=150). The prevalence of <i>DACH1<\/i> heterozygous deletions was higher in the metastatic lesions than in primary tumors within a given cohort for three of six cohorts (Mich: 27.3% <i>vs.<\/i> 36%, N=59; FHCRC: 15% <i>vs.<\/i> 59%, N=54; SU2C: 0% <i>vs.<\/i> 26%, N=150, respectively). The patients with homozygous <i>DACH1 <\/i>deletions had reduced overall survival (medians of 84 <i>vs<\/i>. 120 months, N=667, log rank test <i>P<\/i>=9.3x10<sup>-3<\/sup>). Low DACH1 gene expression (expressed as a z-score with a z-score threshold of -1.25) was significantly correlated with earlier biochemical recurrence (BCR, log rank p value = 4.7x10<sup>-4<\/sup>, n=79). In prostate OncoMice, prostate-specific deletion of the <i>Dach1<\/i> gene enhanced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and was associated with increased DNA damage. Reduced <i>Dach1<\/i> increased DNA damage in responses to genotoxic stresses. <i>DACH1<\/i> was recruited to sites of DNA damage, augmenting recruitment of Ku70\/Ku80. Reduced <i>Dach1<\/i> expression was associated with resistance to TGF&#946; kinase and PARP inhibitors.<br \/>Conclusions: Reduced <i>Dach1<\/i> expression may define a subclass of PCa that warrants specific therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,DACH1,DNA repair,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Zhiping Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Xuanmao Jiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Gordon Robertson<sup>2<\/sup>, Gabriele Di Sante<sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony  W.

While this canonic function plays a role in the regulation of cellular processes such as transcription, alternative splicing, and DNA damage reparation, SETD2 is also important for the methylation of other proteins like EZH2, STAT1, and the cytoskeletal proteins actin and &#945;-tubulin. Mutations in SETD2 are found in a broad range of cancers, including Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). Loss of chromosome 3p followed by the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is a focal characteristic of ccRCC, however, additional mutations are common on other genes also found on chromosome 3p, including SETD2. Our previous studies demonstrated the possibility of targeting VHL-deficient cells by blocking the late stages of autophagy with the small molecule STF-62247. We recently identified PIKfyve, a phosphoinositide kinase important for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), as STF-62247&#8217;s target. In the mindset of personalized medicine, we hypothesize that other mutations on genes like SETD2 could influence cell response to STF-62247 and other PIKfyve inhibitors such as apilimod. The objectives of this project are to 1) evaluate whether SETD2 expression influences the response to STF-62247 and PIKfyve inhibitors in ccRCC and 2) investigate the mechanism by which STF-62247 is selectively targeting SETD2-inactivated cells. Molecular biology approaches such as CRISPR\/Cas9 and the Gateway cloning system were used to repress or reintroduce the gene coding for SETD2 in ccRCC cells like 786-0 and RCC-ER. Western blots were used for the validation of our models. Cell response to STF-62247 and other agents was measured by clonogenic assays, cell counts, and XTT viability assay. Flow cytometry, in addition to western blots, was used to study the cell cycle. Our results indicate that repression of SETD2 in 786-0, especially in 786-0 where VHL was reintroduced (786-0\/VHL), sensitized cells to STF-62247 and apilimod. When treated with STF-62247, sensitive cells stopped proliferating and the reintroduction of a truncated version of SETD2 partially rescued them. In RCC-ER, a SETD2-deficient cell line, the reintroduction of SETD2 or VHL increased the viability and proliferation of the cells when treated with STF-62447. That resistance was increased when both genes were reintroduced together. Flow cytometry results showed an increase in S-phase in SETD2-inactivated 786-0\/VHL cells treated with STF-62247. Likewise, decreased expression of some proteins related to DNA replication and mitosis, such as CDT1 and Cyclin B1, also indicate alterations in the cell cycle. Altogether, our results put forward the potential of using PIKfyve inhibitors as a new therapeutic approach to treat cancer patients with inactivated SETD2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle arrest,Kidney cancer,SETD2,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mathieu Johnson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sandra Turcotte<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of chemistry and biochemistry, Université de Moncton, Moncton, NB, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"43b2d1a4-922f-4067-8f7e-1ab13a613af2","ControlNumber":"4887","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

We previously identified the &#947;-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1 (BBOX1), a member of the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family whereas functionally uncharacterized previously in human cancers, plays a vital oncogenic role in triple-negative breast cancer. However, the role of BBOX1 in other cancers such as kidney cancer remains unclear. We found that BBOX1 is a highly context-dependent enzyme, reflected by its expression only detected in a few organs such as kidney. Intriguingly, according to our immunohistochemistry staining results and the data from The Human Protein Atlas database, BBOX1 is only expressed in the proximal tubule cells where clear cell RCC (ccRCC, the most common form of kidney cancer) derives from, indicating a connection of BBOX1 with kidney malignant transformation. In this study, we investigated the BBOX1 mRNA and protein expression in paired normal and tumor ccRCC patient samples from the UTSW Kidney Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) program, as well as patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), which consistently showed that BBOX1 is remarkably downregulated in the ccRCC patient tumors compared to normal kidneys, and its low expression associates with worse prognosis in ccRCC patients. Furthermore, expression of BBOX1 was highly presented in the human primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) while robustly suppressed after malignant transformation of the RPTEC cells. These data suggest a pathological loss of BBOX1 during RCC progression. Restoration of BBOX1 in multiple human ccRCC cell lines suppressed xenograft tumor growth in mice but not in the 2D in vitro growth with normal tissue culture conditions, suggesting BBOX1 plays an important role in ccRCC tumor development. By comparing the gene expression profiles from transcriptomics analyses in the control or BBOX1 overexpression samples either from xenograft tumors or cells grown in normal 2D culture, we found that BBOX1 suppresses the mTORC1 signaling only in the in vivo condition. Interestingly, we could recapitulate this phenomenon by culturing the control or BBOX1 overexpression ccRCC cells in a physiologic medium but not the standard cell culture medium. These data suggested BBOX1 may regulate the mTORC1 signaling depending on the nutrient status of the tumor cells. Overall, we identified BBOX1 as a novel tumor suppressor in ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Tumor suppressor,mTOR,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chengheng Liao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Liwei Jia<sup>1<\/sup>, Hua Zhong<sup>2<\/sup>, Lianxin Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Payal Kapur<sup>2<\/sup>, James Brugarolas<sup>2<\/sup>, Qing Zhang<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"13d7f04a-e448-4260-8eea-20b82dde05cb","ControlNumber":"1433","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

LRIG1 is preferentially expressed in adult stem\/progenitor cells and regulates their biological properties and quiescence by repressing the ERBB signaling. We recently reported LRIG1 to be overexpressed in human prostate cancer and to function as a feedback tumor suppressor. Human LRIG1 transgenically expressed in the mouse prostate inhibited the development and growth of both Hi-Myc and TRAMP tumors. The relationship between Lrig1-expressing adult stem\/progenitor cells and cells-of-origin for cancer remains poorly understood. To address this, we deleted the <i>Pten<\/i> tumor suppressor gene in Lrig1-expressing cells by crossing <i>Lrig1<\/i>-CreER<sup>T2 <\/sup>mouse with <i>Pten<\/i><sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>animals followed by Cre activation via tamoxifen administration. This knockout of <i>Pten<\/i> in Lrig1-expressing cells allowed us to assess the tumor suppressive function of Lrig1 as <i>Lrig1<\/i>-CreER<sup>T2 <\/sup>is a knock-in model in which one allele of Lrig1 is inactivated. We also generated a Lrig1-lineage tracing mouse model to label endogenous Lrig1-expressing cells by crossing <i>Lrig1<\/i>-CreER<sup>T2 <\/sup>mouse with CAG-tdTomato<sup> <\/sup>animals. Cre recombinase in these animals was activated by tamoxifen and epithelial tissues were harvested and analyzed for tomato signal by fluorescent microscopy. Lrig1-lineage tracing model showed that Lrig1-expressing cells in mouse prostate and oral epithelia are of CK5<sup>+ <\/sup>and CK8<sup>- <\/sup>phenotype suggesting their basal lineage. Targeted deletion of <i>Pten<\/i> in the Lrig1-expressing cellular compartments resulted in hyperplasic lesions in oral mucosa as early as 4 weeks and prevalent papilloma by 8 weeks. <i>Pten<\/i> deletion in the mouse prostate led to hyperplasia and high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) in a time-dependent manner. Consistent with these hyperplastic and tumor phenotypes, we observed elevated Ki-67 and pAkt staining indicating increased cell proliferation. Since <i>Lrig1<\/i>-CreER<sup>T2 <\/sup>is a knock-in model in which one allele of <i>Lrig1<\/i> is inactivated, our data suggest that even one allelic loss of Lrig1 promotes more aggressive tumor phenotypes compared to those reported earlier with <i>Pten<\/i> deletion in CK5<sup>+ <\/sup>basal cells (CK5-CreER<sup>T2<\/sup>:Pten<i><sup>fl\/fl<\/sup><\/i>) in which similar lesions in oral mucosa and prostate tissues developed only after 20-24 weeks of <i>Pten<\/i> deletion. These results suggested that LRIG1 is a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor as mono-allelic deletion of <i>Lrig1<\/i> is sufficient to promote the tumorigenic process in mouse epithelial tissues induced by <i>Pten<\/i> loss. Our study also suggests that the Lrig-1 expressing cells can function as the cells-of-origin of cancer. We propose that Lrig1 may be used as a prognostic marker in cancers of epithelial origin and higher levels may portend a better prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor,Cancer genetics,Mouse models,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Moyi Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Qiuhui Li<sup><\/sup>, Amanda Tracz<sup><\/sup>, Jason Kirk<sup><\/sup>, Anmbreen Jamroze<sup><\/sup>, Rahul Kumar<sup><\/sup>, Dean  G.

In addition, GSTO2 polymorphisms are strongly associated with lung function and the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We recently reported that GSTO2 is exclusively expressed in airway basal cells, Clara cells, and type II alveolar cells, which have self-renewal capacity in the lungs. In this study, we examined the expression of GSTO2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and analyzed the relationship between GSTO2 expression and clinicopathological features. We enrolled 233 patients who were diagnosed with NSCLC and underwent surgery, and immunohistochemically evaluated the expression of GSTO2 using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of surgical specimens. While all 94 squamous cell carcinoma samples showed no GSTO2 expression, 58 of 139 lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) samples exhibited GSTO2 expression. The expression of GSTO2 in LAC samples was significantly associated with never or light (Brinkman Index &#60; 400) smoking history (<i>P<\/i>=0.0027) and histological subtypes (lepidic 85\/110, 77%; acinar 30\/68, 44%; papillary 18\/64, 22%; micropapillary 1\/6, 16.7%; solid 3\/31, 9.6%;<i> P<\/i>&#60;0.0001). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to pN, pM, EGFR mutation, ALK fusion, and ROS-1 fusion. However, GSTO2 expression in LAC significantly associated with pT1 (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.0001), early stage (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.0001), and absence of PD-L1 expression (<i>P<\/i>=0.0027). Moreover, patients with GSTO2-negative LAC had a significantly lower disease-free survival rate than those with GSTO2-positve LAC (<i>P<\/i>=0.028). To examine whether GSTO2 expression affects PD-L1 expression, we prepared GSTO2-transfected and mock-transfected NSCLC cell lines (A549, PC-9, and H520). However, there was no difference in PD-L1 transcription between the GSTO2 and mock transfectants. Previous studies have reported that PD-L1 protein expression is induced via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in lung cancer, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Our prior finding that GSTO2 accelerates the phosphorylation of p38, a key protein of MAPK signaling (<i>Cancer Science<\/i>, 2022), suggests that GSTO2 may be involved in PD-L1 expression as a post-transcriptional regulator. In summary, our study indicates that GSTO2 loss contributes to LAC progression partially through the induction of PD-L1 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,PD-L1,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryusuke Sumiya<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroto Hatano<sup>1<\/sup>, Teruki Hagiwara<sup>1<\/sup>, Satoshi Nagasaka<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiromu Suzuki<sup>2<\/sup>, Kazuhiko Yamada<sup>1<\/sup>, Norihiro Kokudo<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuki  I.

Our recent study (Cancer Letters, 2022) reported, for the first time, that TUSC2 functions as a novel tumor suppressor for GBM. In this report, we found TUSC2 protein expression, not mRNA expression, to be significantly decreased in GBM as compared to normal brain. TUSC2 protein is destabilized in GBM due to polyubiquitination by E3 ligase, neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated gene 4 (NEDD4), and degradation by the proteasome. We further identified that NEDD4 targets TUSC2 on lysine residue K71. We reported that TUSC2 overexpression reduces colony formation, neurosphere formation and promotes apoptosis <i>in vitro<\/i>, and suppresses tumor growth <i>in vivo. <\/i>Conversely,<i> <\/i>GBM cells with CRISPR-mediated knockout (KO) of TUSC2 were highly aggressive <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, demonstrating the role of TUSC2 as a novel tumor suppressor for GBM. We further performed RNA-seq analysis using our stable Control gRNA and TUSC2-KO GBM cell lines and discovered over 1,200 significantly differentially expressed genes. Since TUSC2 is not a transcription factor, we hypothesized that TUSC2 alters the GBM transcriptome through protein-protein interaction with transcriptional regulators. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis by performing immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis to identify TUSC2-interacting proteins in both normal human astrocytes and GBM cell lines. Results showed 95 and 88 TUSC2-interacing proteins in astrocytes and GBM cell lines respectively. 27 proteins were found to interact with TUSC2 in both astrocytes and GBM. Ongoing efforts are focused to validate the interaction of TUSC2 with transcriptional regulators identified within the immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis. Since the expression of TUSC2 is lost in GBM, we hypothesized that TUSC2 loss is an important event during gliomagenesis. To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel conditional transgenic mouse model to investigate the role of TUSC2 loss in gliomagenesis. GFAP-Cre C57\/BL6 mice were crossed with TUSC2<sup>flx\/flx<\/sup> mice, mice containing loxp-flanked TUSC2, to specifically delete TUSC2 from mouse astrocytes. The recombination would introduce firefly luciferase to allow for bioluminescence imaging to detect TUSC2 knockout. Ongoing efforts are to monitor TUSC2<sup>flx\/flx<\/sup> \/GFAP-Cre (TUSC2-KO) mice for glioma development using IVIS imaging and MRI. Taken together, our study is the first step in elucidating the functions of a novel GBM tumor suppressor TUSC2 and investigating the role that TUSC2 plays in gliomagenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor,Cancer,Glioblastoma,Transgenic mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Austin Arrigo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mariana Najjar<sup>1<\/sup>, Angelina Regua<sup>2<\/sup>, Hui-Wen Lo<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Neurosurgery, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3b90fc1e-40df-4c9f-a65b-827a32a9571e","ControlNumber":"7919","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Cysteine(C) substitution at p53 codon 72 polymorphism (p53C72) is rarely studied in cancer patients. A patient who developed AML and who carries p53C72 was described (El-Deiry, 2022 WIN Symposium). The patient&#8217;s family has high rates of cancer susceptibility in the women some of whom carry FANCC alterations and other alleles. To examine the functional characteristics of different p53 alterations at codon 72, we generated plasmids expressing p53C72, p53 R72 or p53P72. The variants of p53 were overexpressed in p53-null cancer cells by transient transfection of the plasmids. We tested functions of the p53 codon 72 polymorphisms (p53C72, p53R72 and p53P72) in two cancer cell lines (Soas-2 and HCT116 p53 null) with different expression levels of the p53 variants at different time points. To examine the effect of codon 73 variants on p53 transactivation, we performed a PG13-Luciferase reporter assay and examined the endogenous p53 targets at the protein level. The luciferase-reporter assay showed that all the three variants of the p53 codon p72 variants increased PG-13 luciferase expression at early time points. The Western blot assay showed that the p53C72, the p53R73 and the p53P72 increased endogenous p21, DR5, puma and MDM2 at the protein levels at different time points. The p53C72 increased the p53 targets and PG13-driven luciferase expression much higher than the p53R72 and the p53P72. These results suggest that the p53 codon 72 variants (C72, R72 and P72) retain wild-type activity for p53-mediated transcription, and p53C72 has the highest potency among them. We examined the effect of the p53 variants on cell growth and death. PARP cleavage (a marker of cell apoptosis) was induced in cells overexpressing all the three p53 codon 72 variants. We observed a lesser potency of p53C72 to induce PARP cleavage compared to p53R72 and p53P72. Colony formation assay showed a suppressive effect of p53C72, p53R72 and p53P72 on cancer cell growth. Our studies demonstrate some differences of in wild-type functions of p53 p53C72, p53R72 and p53P72 alleles.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Polymorphisms,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shengliang Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Wafik  S.

In tumors, the presence of LOXL3 has been associated with genomic stability, cell proliferation, and metastasis. <i>In silico<\/i> analysis has shown that glioblastoma was among the tumors with the highest <i>LOXL3<\/i> expression levels. Moreover, LOXL3 expression increased with malignancy grade amongst diffusely infiltrative astrocytomas (from grade 2 to 4). In the present work, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing was used to knock out <i>LOXL3<\/i> in the human glioma U87MG cell line to evaluate the role of LOXL3 in glioblastoma. Analyses of protein expression level and genomic mutation mediated by CRISPR-Cas9 by two different sgRNA (denominated sgRNA1 and 2) were performed and the knock out efficiency and genome editing were confirmed. Transcriptome analysis of these cells revealed a downregulation of genes that coded for proteins involved in microtubule organization, cell division, and vesicle trafficking. On the other hand, upregulated genes when LOXL3 was knocked out in U87MG cells were involved in actin cytoskeleton, negative regulation of gene transcription, including chromatin remodeling, and cell-cell adhesion. Functional <i>in vitro<\/i> assays showed that LOXL3 knocked out cells presented decreased cell proliferation due to longer cell cycles with increased G1 and G2\/M checkpoints compared to control cells. Additionally, LOXL3 knocked out U87MG cells presented a higher percentage of cells in the early phase of apoptosis with an increment after temozolomide treatment. Our results suggest an important role of LOXL3 in glioblastoma possibly mediated by cytoskeleton regulation, affecting cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell death. These results reinforced the importance of LOXL3 in tumors, especially in glioblastoma, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),CRISPR\/Cas9,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Talita S.

Two distinct mechanisms of MDM2\/MDM4 regulation of p53 include, one, suppression of p53 transactivation activity by direct interaction of MDM2\/MDM4 with p53 protein, thus blocking its transactivation interface and two, targeting p53 to proteasomal degradation by MDM2 E3 ligase activity. However, the importance of these mechanisms in normal p53 regulation <i>in vivo<\/i> has remained controversial. To genetically separate these two mechanisms of p53 regulation we generated a novel Mdm2 mutant mouse (Mdm2L466A) that lacks E3 ligase activity but retains the ability of Mdm2 to heterodimerize with Mdm4 and inhibit p53 transactivation. Homozygous Mdm2L466A mice are embryonic lethal due to dysregulated p53 activity, thus demonstrating Mdm2 E3 ligase mediated regulation of p53 is essential during embryonic development. Additionally, we uncovered novel p53-independent functions of MDM2 E3 ligase in cell cycle regulation and genome integrity in cells. Cells lacking MDM2 E3 ligase activity have defective G2-M transition during cell cycle and developed elevated levels of aneuploidy regardless of p53 status. This study unequivocally demonstrates the requirement of Mdm2 E3 ligase activity for normal regulation of p53 and uncovers previously unknown p53-independent role of Mdm2 in cell cycle regulation and maintaining genome integrity. A current therapeutic approach involves blocking MDM2-p53 interaction to promote p53 tumor suppression function in cancer cells. Our findings suggest that this approach alone is insufficient because MDM2 has other potential oncogenic mechanisms independent of its role as negative regulator of p53. Hence, targeting MDM2 E3 ligase activity is likely to be more effective cancer therapy as it addresses both p53-dependent and p53-independent oncogenic mechanisms of MDM2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDM2,p53,Cell cycle regulation,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meenalakshmi Chinnam<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rati Lama<sup><\/sup>, Chao Xu<sup><\/sup>, Xiaojing Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Carlos Cedeno<sup><\/sup>, Yanqing Wang<sup><\/sup>, Aimee B.

While no TP53-targeting therapeutics have been approved in the USA or Europe yet, drugs tailored to specific TP53 mutations, restoring the functionality of mutated TP53 (TP53mut), and protecting TP53 from negative regulation are being explored in preclinical studies and clinical trials. We performed a comprehensive mRNA expression analysis in 24 cancer types of the TCGA to extract (i) a consensus expression signature shared across TP53 mutation types and cancer types, (ii) differential gene expression patterns between different TP53 mutation types such as LOF, GOF, as well as dominant-negative mutations, and (iii) cancer types specific gene expression patterns. Mutational hotspots showed a similar pattern across cancer types, but at the same time prevalence was significantly different between cancer types for about half of the most prevalent hotspots. Both can be explained in part by the mutational processes operational for example the clock-like process behind SBS1 that is operational across cancer types and aflatoxin exposure assocated with SBS24 that ist operational in liver hepatocellular carcinoma. Virtually no genes were differential between tumors harboring different types of TP53 mutations in none of the cancer types, while hundreds of genes were over- and underexpressed in TP53mut compared to TP53wt tumors. A consensus gene list of 178 common over- and 32 common underexpressed genes was shared between at least two-thirds of the 24 cancer types. Analysis of the immune tumor microenvironment revealed exclusively decreased immune cell populations in the TP53mut tumors in six, a mixed pattern in four, exclusively increased immune cell populations in two, and no significant alterations in 20 cancer subtypes. The analysis of a large cohort of human tumors complements results from experimental studies and support the development of novel strategies for therapeutic targeting of TP53mut.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Gene expression patterns,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jan Budczies<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eva Romanovsky<sup>1<\/sup>, Klaus Kluck<sup>1<\/sup>, Iordanis Ourailidis<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Menzel<sup>1<\/sup>, Susanne Beck<sup>1<\/sup>, Markus Ball<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Kazdal<sup>1<\/sup>, Petros Christopoulos<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Schirmacher<sup>1<\/sup>, Thorsten Stiewe<sup>2<\/sup>, Albrecht Stenzinger<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD), Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Philipps-Universität Marburg, Marburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2e013ff1-efc5-432d-af5d-f4ba7aebf30a","ControlNumber":"5894","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by germline Tp53 mutations that significantly increase the risk of cancer. The p53 amino acid residue arginine 181 is one such mutation site that promotes tumorigenesis by impacting a phenomenon known as p53 cooperativity. This is the ability of one p53 molecule to interact with another in order to efficiently bind specific sites on DNA to enact specific p53 functional pathways. Two p53 molecules interact with each other through the formation of a salt bridge between H1 helices found in respective DNA binding domains. The two key amino acid residues in this salt bridge are positively charged arginine (R) 181 and negatively charged glutamic acid (E) 180 which form electrostatic interactions with the residues on the opposite p53 H1 helix. Cooperativity mutants such as R181H and R181C show a hypomorphic behavior wherein much of p53&#8217;s canonical functions remain intact. Colony suppression data show that H1299 cells with p53 R181H and R181C yield a similar number of colonies as p53 wild type, which is significantly fewer than the yield of p53 hotspot mutation R175H and the absence of p53. Despite retaining some wild-type behavior, R181 mutants are found in LFS patients with cancer. Discovering the importance of the R181 residue for p53&#8217;s role in defending against tumorigenesis can lead to unique treatment opportunities for LFS patients with cooperativity mutants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Breast cancer,Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Renyta Moses<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gregory Kelly<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandra Indeglia<sup>2<\/sup>, Sven Miller<sup>3<\/sup>, John Karanicolas<sup>3<\/sup>, Maureen Murphy<sup>2<\/sup>, Kara Maxwell<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c10a68bc-f43a-4b8e-8fe0-fb2b2174c17a","ControlNumber":"1841","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

In order to identify the difference of <i>TP53<\/i> mutation spectrum in GCs in Eastern Europe and in East Asia, we sequenced <i>TP53<\/i> in GCs from Eastern Europe, Lujiang (China), and Yokohama, Kanagawa (Japan) and identified the feature of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations of GC in these regions.<br \/>Subjects and Method: In total, 689 tissue samples of GC were analyzed: 288 samples from East European populations (25 from Hungary, 71 from Poland and 192 from Romania), 268 from Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan and 133 from Lujiang, Anhui province, China. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue of Chinese, East European cases; and from frozen tissue of Japanese GCs. PCR products were direct-sequenced by Sanger method, and in ambiguous cases, PCR product was cloned and up to 8 clones were sequenced. We used No. NC_000017.11(hg38) as the reference sequence of <i>TP53<\/i>. Mutation patterns were categorized into nine groups: six base substitutions, insertion, deletion and deletion-insertion. Within G:C&#62;A:T mutations the mutations in CpG and non-CpG sites were divided. Furthermore, 40 cases of Rwanda GC were compared in the world for mutation spectrum. The Cancer Genome Atlas data (TCGA, ver.R20, July, 2019) having somatic mutation list of GCs from Whites, Asians, and other ethnicities were used as a reference for our data.<br \/>Results: The most frequent base substitutions were G:C&#62;A:T transition in all the areas investigated. The G:C&#62;A:T transition in non-CpG sites were prominent in East European GCs, compared with Asian ones. Mutation pattern from TCGA data revealed the same trend between GCs from White (TCGA category) vs Asian countries. Chinese and Japanese GCs showed higher ratio of G:C&#62;A:T transition in CpG sites and A:T&#62;G:C mutation was more prevalent in Asian countries.<br \/>Conclusion: The divergence in mutation spectrum of GC in different areas in the world may reflect various pathogeneses and etiologies of GC, region to region. Diversified mutation spectrum in GC in Eastern Europe may suggest GC in Europe has different carcinogenic pathway of those from Asia. Whether the Rwanda pattern belong to Asian or East European would be interesting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,TP53,Molecular epidemiology,mutation spectrum,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hiroko Natsume<sup>1<\/sup>, Kinga Szczepaniak<sup>2<\/sup>, Hidetaka Yamada<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuji Iwashita<sup>1<\/sup>, Marta G&#281;dek<sup>3<\/sup>, Jelena Šuto<sup>4<\/sup>, Rika Kasajima<sup>5<\/sup>, Felix Manirakiza<sup>1<\/sup>, Augustin Nzitakera<sup>1<\/sup>, Rei Ishikawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Rutaganda<sup>6<\/sup>, François Ngabonziza<sup>6<\/sup>, Benoit Seminega<sup>6<\/sup>, Placide Kamali<sup>6<\/sup>, Vincent Dusabejambo<sup>6<\/sup>, Belson Rugwizangoga<sup>6<\/sup>, Nobuhito Nobuhito<sup>1<\/sup>, Yaping Wang<sup>7<\/sup>, Yohei Miyagi<sup>5<\/sup>, Simona Gurzu<sup>8<\/sup>, <b>Haruhiko Sugimura<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland,<sup>3<\/sup>Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland,<sup>4<\/sup>Clinical Hospital Centre Split, Split, Croatia,<sup>5<\/sup>Kanagawa Cancer Center Research Institute, Yokohama, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>University Teaching Hospital of Kigali, Kigali, Rwanda,<sup>7<\/sup>Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, China,<sup>8<\/sup>George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology, Targu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4b53edda-4fba-4e16-9f72-3c7b9bc0a334","ControlNumber":"4021","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

According to <i>The Cancer Genome Atlas<\/i>, 92% of cases are characterized by early mutations in two genes coding for alpha subunits of G protein coupled receptors (GPCR): <i>G protein subunit alpha q<\/i> (<i>GNAQ<\/i>) or <i>11<\/i> (<i>GNA11<\/i>). These mutations are mostly found in the codon Q209 causing a constitutive activation of different signaling pathways linked to cellular proliferation such as MAPK and PKC. Furthermore, a bi-allelic inactivation of the <i>BRCA1 associated protein-1 <\/i>(<i>BAP1<\/i>) is found in 83% of metastatic UM and causes a loss of function of this protein.<br \/>Our hypothesis is that the genes essential for the survival of mutant UM cells will be ideal therapeutic targets. Using CRISPR\/Cas9 technology, we engineered <i>GNAQ\/11<\/i> and <i>BAP1<\/i> mutant isogenic cell lines derived from wildtype UM cells or choroidal melanocytes (CM) to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in UM development. We have designed three ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) composed of single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and <i>Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 <\/i>(spCas9) specific to the <i>GNAQ\/11<\/i> and <i>BAP1<\/i> genes. This allowed to target the DNA sequence on the exon 5 of these proteins to induce a double-strand break. To introduce the desired mutations Q209L in <i>GNAQ\/11<\/i> or C91G in <i>BAP1<\/i>, we have also designed DNA templates called <i>single-strand oligo DNA nucleotides<\/i> (ssODNs) that were co-transfected with respective RNPs by electroporation into UM cells (Mel285) or CM and favorized the homologous recombination (HR) during DNA repair to knock-in these mutations. After a few days, we genotyped the clones by Sanger sequencing and expanded those of interest into cell lines. We obtained an electroporation efficiency of 50% for CM and 70% for Mel285 using an eGFP plasmid. The first CRISPR transfections showed a mean edition of 20-60% of targeted regions with 4% HR. To increase our percentage of HR, we have also used the Prime Editing method; nine plasmids per mutation have been designed and constructed. The first transfection tests in HEK293T cells are currently underway. We obtained three KO cell lines: Mel285<sup>GNAQ-KO<\/sup>, Mel285<sup>GNA11-KO<\/sup> and Mel285<sup>BAP1-KO<\/sup>. We saw no morphologic changes. A decrease in the proliferation and metabolic activity was observed in Mel285<sup>GNAQ-KO<\/sup> and Mel285<sup>BAP1-KO <\/sup>cell lines in comparison to the wildtype cells. Furthermore, an increase of phosphorylated ATF2\/7 was noted in Mel285<sup>GNAQ-KO<\/sup> and Mel285<sup>GNA11-KO <\/sup>cell lines by western blotting.<br \/>A better understanding of the altered pathways in our <i>GNAQ\/11<\/i> or <i>BAP1<\/i> mutant isogenic cell lines will help to identify new drugs targeting specifically metastatic UM cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Genotype\/phenotype correlations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncogene,CRISPR\/Cas9,Uveal melanoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aurélie Fuentes-Rodriguez<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Andrew Mitchell<sup><\/sup>, Joël Rousseau<sup><\/sup>, Jacques  P.

ESCC molecular pathogenesis has not been well characterized, while chemoradiotherapy remains the routine treatment option besides surgery, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of ESCC and new treatment options. <i>Tumor protein p63 (<\/i><i>TP63),<\/i> encoding p63, plays fundamental roles in stratified epithelial homeostasis. In the esophagus, &#916;Np63 is the predominant isoform and is required for normal epithelial development. ESCC retains high &#916;Np63 expression level, but its contribution to ESCC development is not fully understood.<br \/>Results: We found &#916;Np63 maintains ESCC development, depletion of which results in great attenuation and regression of cell line-derived xenograft growth in mice. Transcriptomic profiling showed type-I interferon (IFN-I) signaling-related pathways are the top pathways enriched in &#916;Np63-depleted cells. This was further verified by quantitative PCR confirming up-regulations of interferon-stimulated genes upon &#916;Np63 depletion in cell lines, and by transcriptomic profiling on our latest panel of na&#239;ve ESCC patient-derived organoids (PDOs) showing <i>TP63 <\/i>expression level negatively associated with IFN-I signaling-related pathways. Elevated endogenous retrotransposon-encoded RNA expression induces cancer cell IFN-I signaling through mediating tumor-suppressive viral mimicry response, an anti-viral state triggered by endogenous stimuli (1).

However, the mutational profiles of the relevant key genes on this pathway have not been clearly defined, and no comparisons have been conducted on whether mutations in these genes provide the same predictive value in lung cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: In this study, statistical analysis of clinical factors, tumor mutation burden, chromosomal instability, and co-appearing alterations of 5 key genes on the SWI\/SNF pathway was conducted for 4344 lung adenocarcinoma samples. Two independent online cohorts (N = 1661 and N = 576) were used to supplement the analysis with survival and RNA-Seq data, respectively.<br \/>Results: ARID mutations were found to be more prominent in males under the age of 60 than any other clinical group, while no significant differences exists for SMARC-mutant groups. Mutational burden and chromosomal instability analysis showed that patients with either ARID family mutations (including <i>ARID1A<\/i>, <i>ARID1B<\/i>, or <i>ARID2<\/i> mutations) or SMARC family mutations (including <i>SMARCA4<\/i> or <i>SMARCB1<\/i> mutations) display different sample-level metrics than patients with wild-type samples (<i>TMB<\/i>: ARID v WT: p&#60;2.2X10<sup>-16<\/sup>, SMARC v WT: p&#60;2.2X10<sup>-16<\/sup>; <i>CIN<\/i>: ARID v WT: p=1.8X10<sup>-5<\/sup>, SMARC v WT: p=0.027). Additionally, both mutant groups have a higher proportion of transversions than transitions, while the ratio is more equal for wild-type samples. Survival analysis shows that patients with ARID mutations were more sensitive to immunotherapy treatment than wild-type and SMARC-mutated patients (p &#60; 0.001 and<br \/>p=0.013, respectively), and multivariate cox analysis reveals that presence of ARID mutations is likely the main cause. Furthermore, we observed higher expression of genes on the MTOR1C signaling pathway and the unfolded protein response pathway in the SMARC-mutated group in comparison to the ARID-mutated group, both of which have been reported to increase resistance to immunotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, the mutational landscape of 5 major SWI\/SNF pathway genes were classified. The research presented also shows that mutations in the ARID gene family, including <i>ARID1A<\/i>, <i>ARID1B<\/i>, and <i>ARID2<\/i>, are primarily responsible for the sensitive response to immunotherapy treatment in patients with SWI\/SNF mutant lung adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Tumor suppressor gene,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Haimeng Tang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hua Bao<sup><\/sup>, Xue Wu<sup><\/sup>, Yang Shao<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc., Nanjing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a9600399-d6a6-4db5-99a3-f8264a41be68","ControlNumber":"2887","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

We recently discovered that NNAL, a major metabolite of a tobacco specific carcinogen NNK, rapidly induces LKB1 phosphorylation and its loss-of-function via the &#946;-AR\/PKA signaling pathway in an isomer-dependent manner in human lung cancer cells. Such an acute exposure, however, only resulted in moderate enhancement in lung cancer cell migration and chemoresistance. Here we characterized the effects of chronic NNAL exposure, better mimicking human tobacco use, on LKB1 and tumor progression in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo.<br \/>Methods and Results: Human NSCLC cells with wild type LKB1 (H1299 and H1975) were cultured in the presence of 1 nM NNAL for 3, 6 and 12 months. LKB1 and its signaling pathways were characterized with phenotypes evaluated, including cell proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance. NNAL chronic exposure in lung cancer cells, mimicking its chronic exposure among smokers, resulted in more prominent LKB1 phosphorylation and the deactivation of its signaling, cell migration, and chemoresistance even in the absence of NNAL, indicating the long-lasting LKB1 loss-of-function. These observations were confirmed in a lung cancer xenograft model. More importantly, human lung cancer tissues revealed elevated LKB1 phosphorylation in comparison to the paired normal lung tissues.<br \/>Conclusion: These results suggest that LKB1 loss-of-function in human lung cancer could be extended to its phosphorylation, which may be mediated by NNAL from tobacco smoke in an isomer-dependent manner via the &#946;-AR\/PKA signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tobacco smoke,Cell invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tengfei Bian<sup>1<\/sup>, Lingtao Jin<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Chengguo Xing<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Florida, Gainesville, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7756a322-103e-461a-b3be-f9e4a5a61601","ControlNumber":"2980","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.
