[{"Abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Aspirin is the most promising CRC prevention agent with significant data supporting long-term use with a reduction in the incidence of adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer. The adoption of aspirin as a preventive agent has been limited by an incomplete understanding of aspirin&#8217;s mode of action in humans. To elucidate the mechanism of aspirin prevention, we sought to identify aspirin-associated transcriptional changes within the colon. To accomplish this objective, we performed RNA sequencing of biopsy-derived colonic epithelial cells from participants enrolled (N=180) in our ongoing aspirin randomized placebo-control trial (RCT) program, &#8220;ASPirin Intervention for the REDuction of colorectal cancer risk&#8221; (ASPIRED). Individuals with a recent resection of an adenoma were eligible. Participants for whom epithelial cells from rectosigmoid mucosal biopsies were successfully obtained at both pre- and post-treatment timepoints (n=130) were included in this analysis. Participants were randomized to once-daily placebo (n=45), low-dose aspirin (81 mg) (n=46), or standard-dose aspirin (325 mg) (n=39) for 8-12 weeks. For each timepoint, we performed Illumina RNA 100-bp paired-end sequencing of 4,000 fluorescence-activated cell-sorted (FACS) colonic epithelial cells (CD45-; EpCAM+). Transcriptomic read alignment and read counts per gene were obtained using <i>STAR<\/i> and <i>Salmon<\/i>. Quality control measures removed 52 participants (20 placebo, 18 low-dose aspirin, and 14 standard-dose aspirin) from the analysis. No significant differences in age, gender, ethnicity, or BMI were observed between placebo and aspirin-treated participants. We then identified genes whose expression is modulated by aspirin exposure (low and standard dose aspirin) while controlling for baseline gene expression differences between placebo and aspirin-exposed patients and for intra-sample gene expression variability using <i>Dream<\/i>. We found 57 genes were significantly differentially expressed in aspirin-treated participants at an FDR &#60; 0.10. <i>AGR2<\/i>, which is a CRC oncogene that is upregulated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), was significantly downregulated by aspirin treatment suggesting aspirin modules the expression of PGE2 responsive genes in the colonic epithelium. Gene enrichment analysis found aspirin significantly downregulated scaffold proteins (e.g. <i>KRT8<\/i>, <i>KRT18<\/i>, and<i> ACTB<\/i>) and structural ribosomal RNA binding proteins. These pathways are critical processes in epithelial cell differentiation. This finding supports previous <i>in vitro<\/i> evidence that aspirin results in cell composition changes within the colonic epithelium favoring stem-like cell states, which may underlie its preventive effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aspirin,Chemoprevention,Colorectal cancer,Transcription,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jonathan  M.

Despite more than 40 years of research, oncogenic K-RAS activation remains an undruggable target in clinical oncology. Seven-In-Absentia (SINA) homologues (SIAH) are conserved E3 ubiquitin ligases that play a critical gatekeeper role downstream of the EGFR\/K-RAS pathway. Our prior studies have shown that tumor growth was abolished in human tumor cell lines following SIAH inhibition; however, the underpinning molecular mechanisms that give rise to this anti-EGFR\/K-RAS and anticancer phenotype remain unclear.<br \/>Specific Objectives: to delineate the molecular mechanism(s) of why anti-SIAH2PD targeted therapy is so effective in impeding growth, we conducted reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)-based kinomic analysis to discover how major cancer signaling pathways and K-RAS-dependent signaling networks are remodeled in response to SIAH2 inhibition. Ongoing studies aim to identify and validate dysregulated phospho-proteins identified by RPPA-based kinomic analysis.<br \/>Methods: 300 proteins\/phosphoproteins were quantitatively measured by the RPPA platform to identify new tumor vulnerabilities, actionable targets, and compensatory signaling network alterations in response to anti-SIAH targeted therapies in five cancer cell lines in triplicate. Doxycycline (DOX)-inducible Tet-ON MiaPaCa, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, HeLa, and A459 cell lines were generated from a single cell, and DOX-induced SIAH2PD expression was confirmed. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) was conducted to quantify fold-changes of proteins whose expression was significantly (p&#60;0.05) altered in response to SIAH inhibition. Ongoing Western Blot and Immunofluorescence (IF) studies are being used to validate our key RPPA findings.<br \/>Results: Supported by statistical analyses, we identified 6 unique proteins that were significantly up-or down-regulated in response to SIAH inhibition. These proteins play a role in controlling and regulating cell growth, cell death, NF&#954;B signaling, stress response, DNA damage, immune function, and cell attachment pathways. Thus, our data provide additional evidence supporting our tumor eradication phenotype observed in these human cancer cell lines lacking functional SIAH. Western Blot and IF validation studies have yielded further supporting evidence to confirm our RPPA results.<br \/>Conclusion: Validation studies are being conducted to gain insight into pathway alterations and dynamic rewiring in order to uncover SIAH as a major tumor vulnerability in multiple malignant cancers. Our data supports the explanation as to why anti-SIAH targeted therapy works so effectively to shut down malignant tumor growth, as reported in the literature.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-12 New agent development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras oncogene,SIAH E3 Ligase,Chemoresistance,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew Howell<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Wulfkhule<sup>2<\/sup>, Rosa Gallagher<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonathan Baker<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashleigh Hannah<sup>1<\/sup>, Emanuel  F.

Oral Poly E administration confers chemoprotective activity against prostate cancer (PCa) progression in the TRAMP model of human PCa. Poly E has limited activity against human PCa, but only in those previously diagnosed with atypical small acinar proliferation or high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. The molecular mechanisms underpinning Poly E chemopreventive activities against PCa are not fully understood. We hypothesized Poly E treatment of PCa cells induces gene expression changes, which could involve molecular mechanisms underpinning the limited Poly E chemoprevention activity against PCa. PC-3 cells were cultured in complete growth media supplemented with varied Poly E concentrations (0, 100, 200, or 300 mg\/L) for 24 hr. RNA was isolated for comparative DNA microarray (0 vs. 200 mg\/L Poly E) and subsequent qRT-PCR analyses for validation. Microarray data for 54,613 genes were filtered for &#62; 2-fold expression level changes, with 8,319 increased and 6,176 genes decreased. Seven genes (<i>CASP8, CBLB, CCNB1, HDAC4, MXD1, RGCC, RGS4<\/i>) involved in key cellular signaling pathways and with &#62; 2-fold expression level changes, as well as a control gene (<i>RB1<\/i>), were selected for qRT-PCR analyses. These eight genes are listed with corresponding fold-change gene expression values for each microarray probe set (Table 1). The qRT-PCR analyses identified two genes with significantly increased expression, <i>MXD1<\/i> (13.98-fold; p=0.0003) and <i>RGS4<\/i> (21.98-fold; p=0.0011), between poly E treatment levels. The significantly increased <i>MXD1<\/i> and <i>RGS4 <\/i>gene expression in Poly E-treated PC-3 cells, and the Poly E-dose dependence of <i>MXD1<\/i> gene expression increases, could implicate <i>MXD1<\/i> and <i>RGS4<\/i> in the PCa chemopreventive activity of Poly E. Future experimental directions include cell cycle profile and Annexin V analyses, immunoblotting analyses, and including other established PCa cell lines in these studies.<br \/>$$table_{7D042F30-86CD-467B-B90C-5A23D44A19D7}$$<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{BAB7033A-428A-4919-88FC-483BFABA12F3}\"><caption>Microarray Data from Poly E-treated PC-3 Cells<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Affymetrix Probe ID<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gene symbol<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Log<sub>2<\/sub>-Fold Change<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">213373_s_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>CASP8<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-2.23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1553306_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>CASP8<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-3.20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">208348_s_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>CBLB<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">209682_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>CBLB<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.83<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">214710_s_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>CCNB1<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-2.77<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">228729_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>CCNB1<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-3.47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1554322_a_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>HDAC4<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-2.47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">204225_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>HDAC4<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-3.23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">228813_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>HDAC4<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-4.45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">206877_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>MXD1<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.56<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">228846_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>MXD1<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7.35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">226275_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>MXD1<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.91<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">211540_s_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RB1<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">203132_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RB1<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-1.43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">218723_s_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RGCC<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">239827_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RGCC<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">204338_s_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RGS4<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20.54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">204337_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RGS4<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">204339_s_at<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RGS4<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.69<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-03 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Polyphenols,Microarray,Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

A promising method of retarding cancer-related mortality is cancer chemoprevention. However, there is no drug available that can be used routinely as a breast cancer-preventative agent. As carvedilol (CAR), an FDA-approved beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, reduces breast cancer mortality, we hypothesized that CAR might act as a breast cancer preventative agent. Three protocols were utilized to evaluate the ability of CAR to prevent 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in rats. In protocol 1, two doses of CAR (2 and 10 mg\/kg) were administered in drinking water as a 7-day pretreatment and throughout the study. In protocol 2, 10 mg\/kg tamoxifen and 10 mg\/kg carvedilol were provided as a 7-day pretreatment, and treatment was halted after six weeks. In protocol 3, CAR and the non-&#946;-blocking enantiomer R-carvedilol (10 mg\/kg) were given as a 7-day pretreatment and throughout the study. In all studies, animals were palpated weekly beginning at week 5 to detect the presence and location of mammary tumors. Tumors were measured using a caliper, and the experiments terminated at week 13. In protocol 1, only 10 mg\/kg CAR was effective in delaying DMBA-mediated tumor occurrence (<i>p<\/i> = 0.0002); the first appearance of tumors and median tumor appearance in CAR-treated rats were separated from rats receiving DMBA alone by 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. However, tumors that did form grew at the same rate in all groups. In protocol 2, tamoxifen served as a control to prevent DMBA-mediated tumors; only one tamoxifen-treated rat developed a tumor at the end of the study. The tamoxifen-treated rats tumor formation was not statistically different than negative controls; however, the CAR group was not statistically different from the DMBA group. In protocol 3, CAR and R-CAR treatment showed delayed tumor formation and growth compared to the DMBA-only group, although not statistically significant. Combining all DMBA and 1-week pretreatment CAR data (n = 58 and 40, respectively), CAR effectively prevents DMBA-induced tumor incidence (<i>p<\/i> = 0.001), with a 3-week differential in the median tumor formation between the two groups. Therefore, continuous CAR treatment is essential to achieve the observed chemopreventive effects. As carvedilol is a clinically used beta-blocker, the results provide significant implications in breast cancer chemoprevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-01 Animal models in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoprevention,Breast cancer,Animal models,Cancer prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pabitra Kumar Sardar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Yeung<sup>2<\/sup>, Ayaz Shahid<sup>2<\/sup>, Bradley T.

However, it is still very difficult to treat and prevent liver cancer. Salsolinol (SAL) is an endogenous catechol isoquinoline generated by the condensation of dopamine with acetaldehyde, a major metabolite of ethanol. In the present study, we found that SAL inhibited the phosphorylation, dimerization, and subsequent nuclear translocation of STAT3 in a concentration-dependent manner in SK-Hep1 cells, a hepatic carcinoma cell line. SAL suppressed the expression of Cdk 4 and Cyclin D1, the major target protein of STAT3, and induced the cell cycle arrest at Go\/G1 phase. However, SAL induced the expression of STAT1 in SK-Hep1 cells. In addition, SAL enhanced the expression of the cell cycle regulators such as p53 and p21 in SK-Hep1 cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotes tumor invasion and metastasis in malignancies through STAT3 activation. SAL induced the expression of E-cadherin while suppressing the expression of Snail, N-cadherin, and Slug, which are related to EMT. SAL inhibited the migration of SK-Hep1 cells by suppressing the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of SAL reduced the number of tumors in the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver carcinogenesis model without affecting the body weight change. Proliferative markers PCNA and KI-67 and p-STAT3 were down-regulated in the SAL-injected mice liver cancer tissue. The plasma level of alpha-fetoprotein, a tumor marker in the blood, was also reduced in the SAL-injected mice. Interestingly, SAL injection significantly reduced the anxiety-like behavior without affecting the locomotive activities in the DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model. Moreover, SAL injection recovered tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme for producing dopamine from tyrosine in the substantia nigra compacta of DEN-treated mice. Together, SAL inhibits STAT3 signaling, thereby suppressing the cell cycle progression and EMT in SK-Hep1 cells, which may account for its anti-depressant and anti-carcinogenic activity in DEN-induced liver carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-11 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,STAT3,Salsolinol,Cancer prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyeon Jeong Oh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Seah Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Hong-Kyung Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hoon Ryu<sup>2<\/sup>, Young-Joon Surh<sup>3<\/sup>, Dae-Yong Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Hye-Kyung Na<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sungshin Women's Univ., Gangbuk-gu, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Brain Science Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1292fd41-8e15-4953-9d91-1b542246259b","ControlNumber":"5980","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Notably, while baseline levels of PD-L1 in normal human epidermis are low, acute solar-simulated light (SSL) exposure increases the expression of this protein in epidermal keratinocytes, an effect which can be replicated in cultured keratinocytes and in mouse models. While current immunotherapies targeting the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis using monoclonal antibodies are providing therapeutic benefits in many cancers including cSCC, small molecule inhibitors are also being developed to target PD-L1 which may be amenable for topical formulation and therefore early intervention with reduced systemic exposure. We have recently tested one such molecule, BMS-202, <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. BMS-202 application to keratinocytes in culture inhibits UV-induced PD-L1 RNA and protein expression.

Topical application of BMS-202 to immunocompetent SKH-1 mouse skin resulted in significant inhibition of SSL-induced epidermal PD-L1 as determined by immunoblot analysis. NanoString nCounter Pathway&#8482; transcriptomic analysis of full-thickness SKH-1 mouse skin shows strong inhibition of SSL-induced inflammatory responses, chemokine activity, innate immune response and NF-&#954;B activation in BMS-202 treated samples compared to SSL-only controls.

Identification of key cancer cell signaling networks and developing promising agents is critical for effectively inhibiting tumor growth and progression. In many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has emerged as an important molecular pathway due to its role in promoting proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance. Thus, developing STAT3 targeting, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors may be helpful for the prevention of BC progression and improving the survival rate of patients with muscle invasive BC. Monolayer culture has limitations for drug testing. Therefore, spheroid and organoid culture are used extensively as they may mimic in-vivo drug response more accurately. The aim of our study is to examine the preclinical anticancer efficacy of STAT3 inhibitors [TTI-101 (C188-9) and SH5-07] in 3D (spheroid and tumoroid) invitro models of BC. We optimized the spheroid growth using various BC cell lines [human (J82), rat (NBT-II), and mouse (MB49) BC cells]. Similarly, tumoroids from rat (BBN-induced bladder tumors) and transgenic mice (UPII-SV40T) bladder tumors were developed. These spheroids and tumoroids were treated with various concentrations (0 - 50 &#956;M range) of STAT3 inhibitors and evaluated for their viability [Calcein AM (CA) and EtBr staining], ATP production (CellTiter-Glo&#8482; 3D), and ROS production (MitoSOX<sup>TM<\/sup>). Effect of drug treatment on biomarkers of cell proliferation, apoptosis, stemness, STAT3 signaling, and immune modulation was determined using western blotting and immunofluorescence. Treatment with TTI-101 (0 - 50 &#956;M or SH5-07 (0 - 50 &#956;M) for 144 hrs resulted in significant reduction in the spheroids size (39-45% smaller Vs untreated; p&#60;0.0001), along with decreased ATP levels (20%-40%, p&#60;0.05). MitoSOX<sup>TM<\/sup> staining suggested that STAT3 inhibitors treatment increased ROS production in BC cells. CA and EtBr staining revealed that TTI-101 and SH5-07 treatment resulted in increased cell death in BC spheroids compared to control. Decreased spheroids and organoids size also correlated with increased apoptotic marker (cleaved caspase-3) along with decreased cyclin D1, PCNA, and pSTAT3 protein expression. Drug treated BC spheroids\/tumoroids also showed reduction in CD44 (BC stemness and invasion marker) and induction of cGAS-STING pathway (cGAS, STING, TBK1, and IRF3) in comparison to the control. These findings indicate that STAT3 inhibitors, TTI-101 and SH5-07, could inhibit bladder cancer by suppressing STAT3 pathway activation and therefore warrant further study in vivo.

The goal of this research project is to test immunopreventive strategies by targeting the 5&#8217; ectonucleotidase enzyme, CD73, one of the gatekeeper enzymes responsible for conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), to an immunosuppressive metabolite, adenosine, in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We hypothesize that inhibition of CD73 will prevent pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) formation and progression to PDAC by reversing adenosine directed immunosuppression. This research explores immunopreventive strategies aimed to restore tumor immune surveillance to prevent cancer initiation or progression.<br \/><b>Materials and methods:<\/b> We used two models: a syngeneic model of PDAC using cells derived from <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H\/+;<\/sup>PdxCre<\/i> (KPC) mice and a <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;PdxCre<\/i> (<i>KC<\/i>) genetically engineered mouse model (GEM) of PDAC. Oral gavage of AB680 (small molecule CD73 inhibitor) was given three days\/week at 10mg\/kg starting the day after KPC injections and tumor sizes were measured weekly. In the GEM model, the same treatment regimen began when the mice were between 6 and 9 weeks old and were euthanized either between 15 and 20 weeks of age or around 27 weeks of age, and pancreas tissue was harvested. Histology was analyzed and 6 fields per mouse were quantified using ImageJ.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As we have described (<i>Singh, et al, bioRxiv<\/i>),<b> <\/b>in the syngeneic model, there was a significant reduction in tumor growth and significant increase in activated CD8-positive T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages from AB680 treated mice. The intratumoral adenosine levels were significantly decreased in AB680 treated mice compared to vehicle treated mice. In the <i>KC<\/i> GEM model, we quantified significantly fewer early PanIN lesions (p=0.0328), a trend in decreased advanced PanIN (p=0.0641), and significant decrease in PDAC (p=0.0058) in the AB680 treated mice when compared to the vehicle treated mice. We quantified abundance of collagen deposition as a marker of fibrosis and observed significantly decreased collagen (p&#60;0.0001) in AB680 treated <i>KC<\/i> mice. In addition, we quantified abundance of CK19+ lesions and observed a significant decrease in CK19+ lesions in AB680 treated mice (p=0.0061) compared to vehicle treated mice.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Inhibiting CD73 restructures TME and reduces PanIN incidence and progression to PDAC. CD73 inhibition may be a candidate immunoprevention strategy in pancreatic cancer.

Tamoxifen may also have detrimental metabolic effects in overweight\/obese women. Duavee&#8482;, a complex of bazedoxifene (BZA) and conjugated estrogen (CE), is FDA approved for relief of hot-flashes and prevention of osteoporosis. Preclinical studies suggest favorable metabolic effects in ovariectomized animals and potential for breast cancer risk reduction. A single arm clinical trial found reduction in Ki-67 and mammographic density such that BZA+CE is being further evaluated in a Phase IIB trial of peri and early postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms who are at high risk for breast cancer. Here, in a companion study, we assessed the effect of BZA+ CE on metabolic health and cancer risk in a rat model of carcinogen induced ER+ tumors and high fat diet induced obesity.<br \/><b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Rats received 50 mg\/kg N-methylnitrosourea at 7 weeks to increase mammary tumor risk and were fed a high fat diet (46% kcal fat) to promote obesity. At 16 weeks lean and obese rat were selected based on % body fat and were then randomized to 8 weeks of daily oral vehicle control or 3mg BZA + 0.07mg CE\/kg body weight. Systemic metabolic variables were measured at 16 and 24 weeks, and RNA from mammary glands analyzed by gene expression microarray (Affymetrix).<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b> BZA+CE resulted in systemic as well as mammary changes indicative of improved metabolic health, including: reduction in total and visceral fat (p&#60;0.01), glucose (p&#60;0.05), cholesterol (p&#60;0.001), and triglycerides(p=0.08), as well as an increase in the adiponectin:leptin ratio (p&#60;0.01). BZA+CE vs control increased the ratio of small (insulin sensitive) to large adipocytes in the mammary gland. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed BZA+CE downregulated proliferation-associated pathways which had been upregulated in obese rats, consistent with anti-cancer effects. Obese rats treated with BZA+CE also had upregulation of metabolic pathways, including adipocyte differentiation, fatty acid metabolism, and inflammatory response pathways.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Unlike tamoxifen, BZA+CE improved whole body and mammary gland metabolic health, particularly in obese rats. Transcriptional profiling and GSEA demonstrated a blunting of cell cycle and proliferation and enrichment of metabolic and immune-related pathways. Together this supports BZA+CE (Duavee) as an agent to be explored for breast cancer risk reduction in obese individuals.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Funding:<\/b> This work was supported in part by P30 CA168524, R00 CA169430, and R25 CA203650.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Chemoprevention,Gene expression analysis,Hormones,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ramsey  M.

Since majority of BCs are non-invasive at diagnosis, developing agents that effectively block BC progression may be beneficial for clinical translation. In this study, clinically approved agents, everolimus, mTOR inhibitor, [0.19mg\/kg;7x\/week (low dose, LD) or 1.33mg\/kg;1x or 2X\/week (high dose, HD)] at various dosing schedules alone or in combination with naproxen, an NSAID (30mg\/kg body weight) intermittent dosing (3 Wks ON\/OFF) were tested for efficacy in an N-butyl-N-(4- hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN)-induced BC rat model. Female F344 rats (8 weeks age; N=30) were gavaged 16 doses of BBN (150mg\/dose). Either one-week (early intervention) or 12-weeks (late intervention) after BBN treatment, rats in each group received respective drug treatments by gavage. At 50 weeks age, rats were euthanized, and tissues were analyzed. Results suggest that BBN-exposed rats developed high number of Non-MIBC (NMIBC) and MIBC and had significantly large bladders (430&#177;57mg, Mean&#177;SEM; p&#60;0.0001) compared to normal bladders in vehicle group (68.8&#177;1.3mg). Importantly, there was significant reduction in tumor growth and progression of hyperplasia\/papilloma with naproxen alone (3 weeks intermittent dosing) by 70% (129.7&#177;7.7mg; p&#60;0.0001) and 58% (180.8&#177;27.6mg; p&#60;0.001) at early and later interventions respectively compared to untreated BBN-exposed rats. Continuous LD or HD everolimus regimens during early intervention showed significant inhibitory effect on papilloma progression, whereas its delayed administration had modest to insignificant inhibitory effect of papilloma progression to NMIBC\/MIBC. Intermittent dosing of naproxen alone inhibited large tumors (&#62;200mg) incidence by 90% (p&#60;0.0001) and by 75% (p&#60;0.0001) with early and late interventions respectively. Early treatment with combinations led to &#62;72% reduction in tumor weight (120.8&#177;7.8mg, 121.8&#177;11.5mg, and 118.6&#177;5.2mg; p&#60;0.0001) while late intervention had 58%-65% tumor reductions (179.6&#177;14.4mg, 150.6&#177;12.6mg, and 172.5&#177;15.6mg; p&#60;0.0005) with the combination dosing regimens. Notably, all 3 regimens of naproxen plus everolimus combinations significantly inhibited large tumor incidence at both early intervention (90%-100%; p&#60;0.0001) and late intervention (60%-70%; p&#60;0.0005), with significant suppression of papilloma progression to NMIBC and MIBC, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Protein biomarker analysis suggested decrease in markers of proliferation, inflammation and mTOR signaling with an increased apoptosis. In summary, our study indicated that naproxen and everolimus combination can prevent bladder cancer progression and warrants further evaluation.

Commensurate with risk, current approaches to localized prostate cancer include prostatectomy, prostate radiation with or without radiation therapy or active surveillance. Recent data suggest that systemic anti-androgen therapy with enzalutamide reduced the risk of prostate cancer progression in men on active surveillance but was associated with considerable side effects. We developed a novel polymer-based drug delivery method to provide sustained localized drug administration of anti-androgens selectively to the prostate. In vitro and in vivo mouse and canine studies show that this drug eluting implant delivers sustained high prostate to plasma therapeutic anti-androgen levels for an anticipated range of 2 years while preventing accumulation of anti-androgens in the liver, lungs, heart and brain. We performed a proof of concept study in a canine prostate model implanting an 15mm x 1mm bicalutamide eluting implant into each lobe of the prostate. Bicalutamide levels in the prostate measured near the implant at 6 months were 3250 &#177; 1622 ng\/g, n = 3 compared to 3809 &#177; 638 ng\/g, n = 3 to those achieved at steady-state oral administration. Plasma and other off target levels were over 1000-fold lower in the implant cohort compared to oral administration: Plasma: 5.9 &#177; 0.2 ng\/ml, liver: 11.3 &#177;4.3 ng\/g, and brain: 5.4 &#177;0.8 ng\/g versus plasma: 18170 &#177; 3820 ng\/ml, liver: 35407 &#177;8510 ng\/g, and brain: 8870 &#177;1797 ng\/g. The implants were well tolerated without local toxicity and imaged easily with ultrasound. The design characteristics of the implant facilitates minimally invasive surgical implantation under standard image guidance and withstands the concomitant use of prostate radiation. This novel technology warrants future clinical exploration of prostate specific anti-androgen therapy for (neo)adjuvant therapy or in active surveillance.<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{265F055A-55E5-4C91-B0FE-4FF56BF9EEC7}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Tissue<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><div><b>Bicalutamide oral (2m)<\/b><\/div><div><b>(ng\/g)<\/b><\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><div><b>Bicalutamide implant (6m)<\/b><\/div><div><b>(ng\/g)<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Plasma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18,170 (3820)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.9 (0.2)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prostate<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3,809 (638)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3,250 (1622)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Liver<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35,407 (8510)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.3 (4.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cerebrum<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8,870 (1797)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.4 (0.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cerebellum<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8,737 (1550)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.2 (1.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Spleen<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7,727 (1288)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.2 (0.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Lung<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">27,013 (2896)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.3 (4.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Heart<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11,737 (3491)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.0 (1.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Kidneys<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17,413 (6581)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.5 (2.0)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-12 New agent development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Drug delivery,Prevention,Androgen deprivation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Pujan Desai<sup>1<\/sup>, Maithili Rairkar<sup>2<\/sup>, Nela Pawlowska<sup>1<\/sup>, Scott Thomas<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Pamela N.

Relevant to breast cancer prevention, the breast epithelium in women with atypical hyperplasia has been shown to have increased in cholesterol levels and oxidative products of cholesterol.

We have previously shown in SV40C3TAg mice that the cholesterol lowering drug-fluvastatin reduces breast tumor incidence and burden by 50% and have noted that the efficacy of statin is reduced due to the tight regulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway through multiple restorative feedback loops, thus bypassing the effect of statin blockade.<br \/><b>Hypothesis:<\/b> We hypothesize that fluvastatin efficacy can be improved by co-targeting the restorative feedback pathways that are involved in resistance to statins.<br \/><b>Methodology:<\/b> RNA seq data from statin resistant MCF10.AT1-R cell clones was compared to the statin sensitive parental MCF10.AT1 cells in order to identify pathways and targets involved in statin resistance.

Efficacy of avasimibe, an ACAT inhibitor, to sensitize MCF10.DCIS cells to statin therapy was studied by the colony formation assay.

Cholesterol esterification in conjunction with cholesterol synthesis and export constitute key mechanisms involved in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Thus, we tested if avasimibe treatment potentiates the fluvastatin efficacy to inhibit colonizing ability. Avasimibe and fluvastatin combination completely abolished the ability of MCF10.DCIS cells to form colonies. Next, we tested the efficacy of combination treatment to prevent breast tumors in SV40C3TAg mice. The treatments started at the age of 6 weeks, prior to the onset of cancer and continued until 22 weeks of age. We found fluvastatin and avasimibe combination to be completely ineffective and 90% mice developed tumors. In addition, tumor burden was not reduced with dual treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We postulate that avasimibe enhanced metabolism of fluvastatin in mouse system and thus completely abolishing the chemopreventive effects of statin. Genomically derived rationale drug combinations may result in unanticipated interactions and\/or ancillary effects that limit efficacy in vivo\/ in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Statins,Avasimibe,SV40C3TAg mice,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anjana Bhardwaj<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zhenlin Ju<sup><\/sup>, Alexander Koh<sup><\/sup>, Rhea Bhala<sup><\/sup>, Jing Wang<sup><\/sup>, Isabelle Bedrosian<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7aa3c593-71cf-4e31-a053-5e043bbf97bc","ControlNumber":"7342","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

It is accompanied by protumorigenic effects: chronic low-grade inflammation and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Breast cancer risk reducing drugs with proven efficacy have adverse side effects, significantly minimizing their uptake and impact. Effective alternative strategies with lower toxicity are needed. We have shown that licochalcone A (LicA) suppresses aromatase expression and activity, enhances the activity of detoxifying enzymes, and reduces estrogen genotoxic metabolism in cell lines and animal models. However, no previous data exist on the breast tissue of women at substantial risk of breast cancer. We hypothesize that LicA creates a tumor preventive environment in the breast by modulating antioxidant\/anti-inflammatory responses in the breast and adipogenesis leading to decreased proliferation.<br \/>Methods: We prepared microstructures from the fresh tissue of contralateral unaffected mastectomy specimens of 6 postmenopausal women with incident unilateral breast cancer. After exposing them to DMSO (control) and LicA (5 &#181;M), we performed total RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes were identified, and analyzed by gene ontology and pathway membership. The RNA-seq data was utilized also to conduct metabolism flux analysis. Combined enrichment scores &#62; 4 and FDR &#60; 0.05 was considered significant. The NanoString metabolism panel was employed in 6 additional subjects. We performed live cell imaging to monitor proliferation of pre-malignant DCIS.COM, DCIS.COM\/ER+ PR+; and malignant MDA-MB-231 (ER- PR-), MCF-7 (ER+ PR+), MCF-7aro, and BRCA1 defective HCC-1937, and HCC3153 cells.<br \/>Results: We observed upregulation of antioxidant genes (up to 8-fold), consistent with upregulation of <i>NRF2<\/i> and the thioredoxin system, the major regulators of antioxidant pathways. This was accompanied with the significant downregulation of RELA- and NF-kB1-dependent inflammatory pathways. In addition, we observed decreased expression of the pro-adipogenic transcription factors <i>SREBF1<\/i> and <i>SREBF2<\/i>, which may explain the downregulation (4 to 32-fold) of cholesterol biosynthesis and transport, and lipid metabolism genes. Metabolism studies confirmed these data and demonstrated a robust increase in the pentose phosphate shunt and NAD(P)H generation without enhancing ribose 5 phosphate formation, suggesting an antioxidant and anti-proliferative environment. LicA also suppressed proliferation of pre-malignant and malignant cells, with sustained effects on aggressive cells at doses &#60; 10 &#181;M.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data suggest that LicA is a good candidate for breast cancer prevention through modulation of metabolic and antioxidant pathways leading to decreased proliferation. Our ongoing in vivo study will further demonstrate the efficacy of LicA for breast cancer prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Prevention,Natural products,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Atieh Hajirahimkhan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Bartom<sup>1<\/sup>, sriram Chandrasekaran<sup>2<\/sup>, xiaoling xuei<sup>3<\/sup>, Susan Clare<sup>1<\/sup>, Seema Khan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Northwestern University, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>3<\/sup>Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d0b94cd8-0915-4fb5-b033-d5aa33f42493","ControlNumber":"6735","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Desmocollin-3 (DSC3) one of the desmosomal adhesion (Desmoglein 1, 2, 3 and Desmocollin 1, 2, 3) proteins is a trans-membrane glycoprotein present in basal\/suprabasal layer of normal stratified epithelium. It is a p53-responsive desmosomal cadherin protein. Cancer development and progression are associated with either additional cytoplasmic expression of DSC3 as seen with squamous non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer or loss of DSC3 expression as seen in prostate and breast cancer To investigate the role of DSC3 in bladder cancer, we evaluated the expression levels of DSC3 in biopsy samples of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (MIBC) and correlated it with the clinical staging and immune cell infiltration. Also, its relationship with immune signature genes and immune cell subsets is evaluated using TCGA dataset available on c-bioportal.<br \/><b>Materials and Method:<\/b> DSC3 protein expression was evaluated by Immunohistochemistry. H&#38;E stained slides were evaluated by light microscopy to identify immune cells as macrophages or lymphocytes and their location as intrastromal or intratumoral as previously described. It was correlated with the type, stage, and grade of the tumor. Spearman correlation between DSC3 and 207 immune signature genes available in TCGA data was calculated using RSEM and methylation values of each gene.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The data suggests that<b> <\/b>NMIBC is more likely to be DSC3 positive than MIBC. DSC3-positive samples are more likely to have tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIL) compared to DSC3-negative samples. <i>In silico<\/i> analysis of bladder cancer shows that DSC3 mRNA expression is inversely proportional to its methylation. We found that DSC3 expression is biased towards the Th1 subset of immune cells. DSC3 is not correlated with PD-1\/PDL1 expression, and the macrophage subsets are negatively correlated with DSC3.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> DSC3 expression is associated with the Basal\/Squamous type of bladder cancer. Therefore, this study suggests the potential of DSC3 as a predictive biomarker for response to systemic immunotherapy and resistance\/poor response to conventional therapy (chemotherapy; radiotherapy, and cystectomy) and underscores the need for studies evaluating the potential of DSC3 expression as a biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-04 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Bladder cancer,Signaling,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chandreshwar  P.

Environmental exposure to chemical carcinogens is one of the major causes of NMSC initiation, promotion, and progression. Ursolic acid (UA) is a naturally abundant pentacyclic triterpenoid showing anticancer potentials against diverse cancers. In the current study, we developed a two-stage skin carcinogenesis model in SKH1 hairless mice by administering cancer-initiating agent benzo[a]pyrene<b> <\/b>(B[a]P) and promoting agent 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate to study the epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolic changes at different stages (5, 20, and 26 weeks) during the development of NMSC, and investigated how UA regulates B[a]P-mediated alterations for NMSC interception. We found that UA protects against B[a]P-induced tumorigenesis at different phases of NMSC. Epigenetic CpG methyl-seq showed UA abrogated B[a]P-mediated alterations in differentially methylated regions (DMRs) profiles. Transcriptomic RNA-seq data exhibited UA reversed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of several inflammatory genes, such as chemokine ligand 8 (<i>Ccl8<\/i>) and interleukin 17F<i> <\/i>(<i>Il17f<\/i>), and epigenetic genes, such as DNA-methyltransferase 3-like<i> <\/i>(<i>Dnmt3l<\/i>) and protein-l-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase domain-containing protein 1 (<i>Pcmtd1<\/i>)<i> <\/i>during different stages of NMSC. Association study between DEGs and DMRs showed that B[a]P promoted transcription of kallikrein-related peptidase 13 (<i>Klk13<\/i>) by promoter demethylation, while UA suppressed <i>Klk13 <\/i>expression through hypermethylation in the promoter during the initiation stage, indicating the early intervention of UA. Ingenuity pathway analysis further showed significant upregulation of macrophage-stimulating protein-recepteur d'origine nantais (MSP-RON) signaling pathway by B[a]P during the initiation stage while suppressed by UA treatment. The metabolomic study revealed UA modulated cancer-associated changes in metabolisms, including the TCA cycle and pyruvate metabolism\/metabolites during the promotion phase, indicating UA plays a critical role in regulating B[a]P-regulated metabolic changes and intercepting NMSC progression. In summary, UA protects against the environmental carcinogen B[a]P-driven epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolic changes during the initiation, promotion, and progression of NMSC, potentially contributing to the anticancer effects of UA.

A previous study utilizing the TRAMP model of human PCa, displayed chemopreventive activity as a result of Poly E oral administration in a dose-dependent pattern. Human clinical trials of Poly E treatment exhibited activity in PCa of those previously diagnosed with atypical small acinar proliferation or high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. The molecular mechanisms of these Poly E chemopreventive activities against PCa are not well established. Our hypothesis is that Poly E treatment influences expression of genes involved in key cellular signaling pathways. DU145 prostate cancer cells were cultured in complete growth media supplemented with varied Poly E concentrations (100, 200, 300 mg\/L) for 24 hrs. RNA was isolated for comparative microarray (0 vs. 200 mg\/L Poly E) and qRT-PCR analyses. Microarray data for 54,613 genes were filtered for &#62; 2-fold expression level changes, with 5,272 increased and 6,467 genes decreased. Nine genes, (<i>CASP8, CBLB, CCNB1, HDAC4, MXD1, RGCC, RGS4, TBC1D7, ZNF462<\/i>) involved in key signaling pathways with &#62;2-fold gene expression changes were selected for subsequent qRT-PCR analyses. Microarray probe set IDs and fold change gene expression values for these nine genes analyzed are listed (Table 1). From qRT-PCR analyses, six of these genes had significant gene expression changes between Poly E treatment levels, <i>MXD1<\/i> (14.20-fold; <i>p <\/i>= 0.0122), <i>RGCC<\/i> (0.6748-fold; <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.0001), <i>TBC1D7<\/i>(0.2416-fold; <i>p = <\/i>0.0037), <i>ZNF462<\/i> (0.7030-fold; <i>p<\/i> = 0.0173), <i>CASP8<\/i> (0.4856-fold; <i>p <\/i>= 0.0136), and <i>CBLB<\/i> (2.149-fold; <i>p <\/i>= 0.0036).

However, research involving non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) PDOs is hampered by the compromised sample size and the lack of appropriate platforms tailored for scarce samples. Although BME2 domes show promising results in PDO maintenance and drug testing, the need for relatively large sample and the long incubation time hinder their application in drug response studies. Here, we report an agarose microwell (AMW) platform requiring miniscule sample volume for PDO rapid drug screening.<br \/>The AMWs were formed by 3D-printed molds and attached to the bottom of 24-well plates. Each well has ~400 agarose microwells with 200&#956;m diameter, 75&#956;m depth and U-shaped bottom. Seeded cells migrate and form spheroids in each microwell. NSCLC spheroids of H358 (KRASG12C), A549 (KRASG12S) and PDOs CK7152 (KRASG12C, obtained from NCI PDMR) were cultured in arrays and treated by KRASG12C inhibitor adagrasib.<br \/>PDOs normally grow in a BME2 dome, however large PDO size variability and consumption complicate drug evaluation. The AMWs are biocompatible and have a smooth surface that allows single cells or PDOs to migrate into microwells within 1d. The amount of PDOs in one dome is enough for 4 wells of 24-well plate. After 7d culture, PDOs formed in AMW exhibited high viability (89%&#177;7% in AMW vs. 89%&#177;11%, in dome) and better size uniformity (CV 29% in AMW vs. 44% in dome).<br \/>AMWs can easily be implemented to standardize cytotoxicity evaluation. Following the exposure to adagrasib for 72h, we found that H358 spheroids were sensitive to KRASG12C specific inhibitor adagrasib in dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 88nM; whereas A549 spheroids -without the target mutation- was not responsive. CK7152 PDOs were also exquisitely sensitive to adagrasib (34% and 21% viability reductions viability in AMWs and dome).<br \/>Drug sensitivity can be affected by several factors that maintain proliferative signals active in tumor microenvironment. We have been able to simulate the effect of the tumor microenvironment, by culturing spheroids and PDOs with fibroblast supernatant in AMWs. The IC50 of adagrasib for H358 spheroids treated with WI-38 supernatant was about 3.5&#215; higher than that in normal medium (310nM vs. 88nM). We replicated these results with CK7152 PDOs treated with CAF supernatant that significantly decreased viability from 24% to 51% (p&#60;0.001) following 72h treatment of 500nM adagrasib.<br \/>Our AMW is a convenient 3D culture platform that generates uniform spheroids from a small sample volume for highly consistent drug screening results. The adagrasib drug response observed in AMW was comparable to that in conventional dome culture. Resistance due to tumor microenvironment can be readily assessed using fibroblast supernatant in AMW platform, promising for pre-clinical drug screening and personalized medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Preclinical testing,Precision medicine,Drug sensitivity,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qiyue Luan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ines Pulido<sup>2<\/sup>, Jian Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Takeshi Shimamura<sup>2<\/sup>, Ian Papautsky<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biomedical engineering, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ffcdcc4e-40fb-40a6-b4ef-4f3d3585b031","ControlNumber":"8094","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Q.

PIM kinase family are responsible for enhancement of cell cycle, inhibition of apoptosis, activation of transcription, and cell homing\/migration. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is part of a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and a molecular therapeutic target of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There are three FTL3 inhibitors, midostaurin, gilteritinib, and quizartinib have been approved for clinical treatment of AML. We have developed a novel dual inhibitor of PIM1 and FLT3, RF-1302 and evaluated its inhibition of cell proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i> and antitumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i>. RF1302 was found to have a strong inhibitory activity against target enzymes (PIM1 IC<sub>50<\/sub><sub> <\/sub>at 1.0-2.3 nM and FLT3 IC<sub>50<\/sub> at 0.8-2.2 nM), which were more potent than the tested positive control drugs gilteritinib, quizartinib, and midostaurin. RF-1302 showed to be highly cytotoxic to cultured human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (MV4-11 and Molm-13) with IC<sub>50<\/sub> at 5.7nM and 9.5 nM, respectively. The <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity of RF-1302 was evaluated and compared with midostaurin and gilteritinib in the treatment of the two AML xenograft models. RF-1302 at 20 mg\/kg\/daily x 14, oral) significantly delayed tumor growth and resulted in a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 95% (p&#60;0.001 compared with the control group) in the Molm-13 AML model, and cured all of the tumor-bearing mice in the MV4-11 AML model. The antitumor activity of RF-1302 was superior to gilteritinib (TGI=46-55%) and midostaurin (TGI=63-75%). The treatment with RF-1302 showed very little toxicity (only 2% body weight loss) which were well below the maximum tolerated dose. These preclinical results suggest that RF-1302 represents a novel dual inhibitor of PIM1 and FLT3, which may constitute a highly efficacious modality for the treatment of FLT3 mutant AML, and is worthy of further clinical evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-12 New agent development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Weiwei Qi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yanjun Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Lei Zhao<sup>3<\/sup>, Ailian Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Chunze Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Xiaoming Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Lijuan Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Huaquan Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zonghong Shao<sup>1<\/sup>, Rong Fu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Hematology Institute, Tianjin, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Ruifu Therapeutics, Inc., Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"477cc581-9daa-4f0d-a51f-4e150649faf2","ControlNumber":"973","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

Recently, we showed that silibinin (SB) exerts strong efficacy against ultraviolet B radiation (UVB)-induced BCC growth\/progression, and mast cells (MCs) are one of the targets of its efficacy. Notably, 30 days of UVB exposure in patched (Ptch)+\/- mouse model of UVB-induced BCC formation increased MC numbers by ~50% that was completely inhibited by SB. Hence, understanding pathways associated with MC regulation by SB seems valuable for its efficacy against BCC and other cancers. We generated bone marrow MCs (BMMCs) in presence of interleukin (IL)-3 and stem cell factor from C57BL\/6 mice (confirmed using flow cytometry dual staining: cKit\/Fc&#8364;RI). They were treated with two concentrations of SB (25 &#181;M; SB 25 and 100 &#181;M; SB 100) or untreated (control), and proteomics was performed (liquid chromatography mass spectrometry on Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer). Total 3575 proteins were identified and 166 were found to be statistically significant (ANOVA, Fisher&#8217;s posthoc analysis, p&#60;0.05, FDR&#60;0.01) amongst the three groups (n=4\/group). Proteins with highest differential expression among the groups (greatest fold change expression; n=50), greatest contribution to the selection (variable importance; n=15), and common expression profiles in both SB 25 and SB 100 compared to control (n=21) were selected for further pathway analysis. Important nodes found for SB regulation of MCs were tumor necrosis factor, interferon-gamma, and IL-13; IL-13 also emerged as a key regulatory node in normal BMMCs. Furthermore, to determine the effect of SB in BCC associated MCs, a subset of proteins implicated with skin-associated MC activity (determined using IPA) was generated. Most important molecules implicated included IL-13 and Rac Family Small GTPase2 (RAC2; regulates all myeloid lineages). RAC2 was found to modulate the expression of mast cell protease4 (MCPT4), mast cell transcriptase1 (TPSAB1), and macrophage migration inhibition factor. RAC2 also activates MC proteases via JNK signaling cascade. Together, via the regulation of MCPT4, TPSAB1, and JNK signaling, RAC2 regulates inflammatory responses, and controls MC migration via actin cytoskeleton reorganization and lamellipodia formation. Phagosome maturation was also an important pathway implicated in our analysis; MCs lyse engulfed pathogens\/debris via phagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that SB increases RAC2 expression in BMMCs, which can regulate MC migration into the tumors and effectively increase the MC protease gene expression. Thus, SB treatment shifts BMMCs towards anti-tumorigenic pathways and RAC2 can be a novel therapeutic target in BCC and other cancers as well.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomic analysis,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neha Mishra<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sandeep Paudel<sup><\/sup>, Chapla Agarwal<sup><\/sup>, Rajesh Agarwal<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"74cea782-71fd-4c4c-b3ff-4fd529c9b8e5","ControlNumber":"920","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

During the histopathological analyses of the skin tissues in these studies, we observed a significant decrease in mast cell (MC) numbers in SB-treated UVB-exposed groups. Although, the MCs are primarily responsible for conferring protection against diseases and pathogens, the dynamics of BCC and MCs are complex, where MCs may also contribute to tumor transformation\/progression; furthermore, their role in BCC is poorly understood. To address this gap, we first assessed the course of MC recruitment in wild-type (C57BL\/6) mice vs. Ptch<sup>+\/-<\/sup> mice as a function of time following either a single or thrice weekly UVB (240 mJ\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>) exposure. Results indicated that Ptch<sup>+\/-<\/sup> mice had significantly higher infiltration of MCs compared to C57BL\/6 mice. MC infiltration into the epidermis\/dermis was initiated as early as 30 min post single UVB exposure in Ptch<sup>+\/-<\/sup> mice, and the MCs remained in the epidermis\/dermis for a longer duration in the Ptch<sup>+\/-<\/sup> mice compared to C57BL\/6 mice. Next, the effect of SB treatment (topical-9 mg\/200 &#181;l acetone) on MC recruitment upon UVB exposure in these mice was assessed. Notably, SB treatment significantly decreased MC numbers in both pre- and post-UVB single exposure by ~48% and ~43%, respectively, and in multiple exposure by ~55% and ~41%, respectively. Furthermore, UVB exposure for 26 and\/or 46 weeks caused an increase in MC numbers by ~2.3 fold in BCC tumors, which was also decreased by both pre- (~38-39%) and post- (~20-26%) SB treatments at 26 and 46 weeks, respectively. Notably, in preformed BCC tumors (UVB 26 weeks exposure), SB treatment for 20 weeks post UVB stoppage also decreased the number of MCs by ~25%. Thus, it was evident that anti-BCC efficacy of SB was associated with its potential to decrease MC numbers. To further understand the role of SB in MC regulation, assessment of cell viability and migration (towards BCC cell lines) in <i>in vitro<\/i> assays were performed with\/without SB exposure in bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs from C57BL\/6 mice), which indicated that non-toxic doses of SB (25 -100 &#181;M) at the 48-72 h timepoint were able to inhibit BMMC migration towards BCC cell lines. Furthermore, a correlation of other immune cells (T cells, macrophages, etc.) with MC recruitment and anti-BCC effect was also determined. Taken together, our results suggest that SB effectively regulates MC numbers\/function in its efficacy against BCC in Ptch<sup>+\/-<\/sup> mouse model; thus, further in depth-studies, deciphering the associated molecular pathways, could yield novel preventive\/ therapeutic avenues targeting MCs in BCC and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-07 Chemoprevention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin carcinogenesis,Mouse models,Immunomodulation,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sandeep Paudel<sup>1<\/sup>, Neha Mishra<sup>1<\/sup>, Komal Raina<sup>2<\/sup>, Chapla Agarwal<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Rajesh Agarwal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO,<sup>2<\/sup>College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6167b7ae-d3f4-46b0-a55a-8aeee993159d","ControlNumber":"932","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

As cancer experimental therapeutics advance towards study paradigms that more carefully mimic physiology, e.g. organoids and spheroids. Presently, we are using a 3D cell culture method emphasizing layers of extracellular matrix (ECM) as FA premalignant lesions retain epithelial architecture. We conducted 3D screening studies using 2 layered geometries: 1) nanofibers coated with 1 ng\/mL 2:1 Collagen III\/IV (C3C4) then 100 pg\/mL 2.75:1 Tenascin C\/Fibronectin (TNFN) and 2) polystyrene layered with 50 ug\/mL C3C4 then 3.5 ug\/mL TNFN. We developed these coatings to maximize lipid raft recovery, a drug transport feature lost in 2D culture. The ECM impact on FA cell drug transport was characterized by comparing effective nuclear delivery of a 20nm nanoencapsulated FITC-labeled RNAi compound (s50-TBG-RNAi3UTR), known to require lipid rafts, to the same oligo formulated with Dotap in a FA HNSCC cell line (FA1). Using confocal microscopy and IMARS software to segment delivery at maximal nuclear intensity into nuclear or endolysosomal compartments, we found, for FA1 cells on ECM, nuclear oligo signal colocalization with nuclear compartment &#177; coefficient of variation was 62 &#177; 2.2% for the capsule vs 9.8 &#177; 8.5% for Dotap oligo. On glass, nuclear delivery was 10 &#177; 52% for s50 capsule vs 25 &#177; 32% for Dotap. Endolysosomal compartment sequestration was respectively 28 &#177; 12, 62 &#177; 10, 44 &#177; 19 and 51 &#177; 15%. This illustrates a relevant decrease in variation in FA cell biology from ECM addition. Next, we studied metformin (Met) and pioglitazone (Pio)(agents in current oral cancer prevention studies) combined with G2\/M blockade inhibitors, MK1775 (Wee1 kinase inhibitor) and GSK461364 (PLK inhibitor) in FA1s. Inhibiting G2\/M blockade, already induced by FA-derived DNA damage, could promote inappropriate cell division, mitotic catastrophe (MOC) and death. In initial 2D FA1 growth studies, increased death was observed with Met plus MK1775. 3D studies, in contrast, showed increased cell death for FA1s treated with Pio plus either MK1775 or s50-TBG-RNAiCK2 (RNAiCK2). Confocal mechanistic studies in cells plated on ECM and treated for 18 hours, indicated Pio + MK1775 inhibited Survivin and &#223;-catenin upregulation and FA1 cells did proceed into MOC and death. For Pio (PPARg agonist) + RNAiCK2, RXRa was dephosphorylated at S260, enabling its escape from cytosolic sequestration to bind nuclear PPARg, initiating differentiation. Differentiation was indicated by upregulation panKeratin and Transglutaminase-3. We conclude combination therapies with high interest agents in FA-associated oral cancer can be performed in 3D culture systems and might confirm drug mechanisms of action, thus augmenting other standard methods of cancer drug evaluation and screening (e.g. cell proliferation and clonogenicity).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-11 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Fanconi Anemia,3D Cell Culture,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Gretchen  M.

Mutations in <i>SETD2<\/i> have been evidenced in several types of cancer, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Previous studies reported the potential involvement of SETD2 in driving ccRCC tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism by which SETD2 causes cell metastasis remains poorly understood.<br \/>Methods: Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screens and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry were used to identify candidates for regulating SETD2 stability. Immunohistochemistry staining of the ccRCC tissue array and bioinformatics analysis of TCGA database were used to investigate the clinical relevance of SETD2 in ccRCC. The gene expression was detected by qRT-PCR, and the protein level was detected by western blotting. Wound healing and transwell migration assay were used to explore the cell migration ability. SIAH2 was deleted from ccRCC cell lines using CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Furthermore, we used BALB\/c-nude mice to construct xenograft mouse models and pulmonary metastasis models. Moreover, RNA-seq, H3K36me3 CUT&#38;Tag and RNA N<sup>6<\/sup>-methyladenosine-IP were performed to uncover the mechanism.<br \/>Results: SETD2 mutant or low expression was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with ccRCC based on TCGA data and tissue array. Through the CRISPR\/Cas9 screening system and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH2 that regulates the stability of SETD2. Then, we verified that the protein stability of SETD2 was downregulated by SIAH2 in a dose-dependent manner and further confirmed that the SIAH2 promotes SETD2 degradation in a proteasome-dependent pathway. In addition, we constructed a dominant negative mutant of SIAH2 and proved the degradation dependent on its enzymatic activity. Moreover, we showed that SIAH2 knockout increased the protein level of SETD2. In SETD2 stable knockdown ccRCC cell lines, loss of <i>SETD2<\/i> enhanced the capability of cell migration, while knockdown of <i>SIAH2<\/i> resulted in the rescue of <i>SETD2<\/i> deficient effect. Moreover, <i>SETD2<\/i> ablation significantly decreases H3K36me3 peaks of E-cadherin, further reducing the m<sup>6<\/sup>A signal and stability of <i>E-cadherin<\/i> mRNA.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we firstly revealed the mechanism that E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH2 interacted with SETD2 and promoted the ubiquitination degradation of SETD2. Moreover, <i>SETD2<\/i> ablation in ccRCC cells enhanced EMT through impaired epigenetic regulation of <i>E-cadherin<\/i>, suggesting SIAH2\/SETD2\/E-cadherin axis as a potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-03 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Kidney cancer,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mengxue Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Lingao Ju<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Gang Wang<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Urology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"07d41421-529a-4e0c-b0b4-69aa71091911","ControlNumber":"2412","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.
