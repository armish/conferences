[{"Abstract":"EGFR-mutated lung tumors respond poorly to checkpoint (PD-1\/PD-L1) inhibitors. Resistance to such therapies has been attributed to the prototypic immunosuppressed &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME) of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs, which is characterized by low levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Growing evidence from breast cancer studies demonstrates the ability of 17&#946;-estradiol to regulate several species of immune cells within an immunosuppressive TME. Furthermore, treatment of breast cancers with AIs or estrogen receptor antagonists promotes lymphocyte infiltration and enhances immune reactivity. While the role of estrogen species in lung tumorigenesis is well documented, little attention has been given to their contribution to the immunosuppressed lung TME or the use of estrogen-modulating agents to attenuate these effects. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of estrogen depletion, using the AI exemestane (Exe), on levels of tumor infiltrating immune cells and other tumor endpoints in the murine model of mutated EGFR<sup>L858R <\/sup>NSCLC. Male (n = 42) and female (n = 39) mutEGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup> mice were gonadectomized at 6 weeks of age and doxycycline-supplemented chow was given to induce lung tumor development. Daily treatment with Exe (250 &#956;g\/kg) or vehicle was initiated at 8 weeks of age, and continued for the duration of the experiment (7 weeks). Body weights were recorded twice per week. At the time of euthanasia, lung tissues were processed for histopathological analysis and assessment of tumor CD8+ lymphocyte concentrations by immunohistochemistry was performed. Lung tumors from Exe-treated mice exhibited higher concentrations (median, Q1 - Q3) of CD8+ T cells per 20x field (77.5, 60.3 - 114.0) vs. those of vehicle-treated controls (61.0, 48.8 - 80.8) (P = 0.035). A trend of a decreased incidence of solid adenocarcinoma lesions within the lungs of Exe-treated vs. vehicle-treated control mice was observed in both males (26.3% vs. 38.1%) and females (26.3% vs. 35.0%). Among females, the incidence of continuous weight loss (over 3 consecutive weeks) was lower among Exe-treated (16.7%) vs. vehicle-treated (40.0%) mice. Early findings suggest that administration of AI therapy to mutEGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup> mice stimulates CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration within lung tumors, and inhibits both the formation of lung adenocarcinomas and disease-associated weight loss. Murine studies to further optimize the dose and schedule of AI treatment, as well as evaluate the ability of AI therapy to enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors in mutated EGFR<sup>L858R <\/sup>NSCLC are underway.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A enzymes play a key role in retinoic acid (RA) synthesis. RA regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival by activating nuclear receptor transcription factors (RAR, RXR). In cancer cells, increased ALDH expression correlates with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. Our goal is to effectively utilize ALDH inhibitors (ALDHi) as novel therapeutics and identify their mechanism in cancer and immune cells. Based on RNAseq data, NR4A1 has emerged as a possible ALDHi target. After binding RXR&#947;, NR4A1 serves as a &#8216;molecular switch&#8217; for cancer cell survival. Here, we explore the potential use of ALDHi as immune modulators in OC.<br \/>Methods: <i><u>T cells:<\/u> <\/i>The effect of several ALDHi on T cells following anti-CD3\/CD28 polyclonal stimulation was tested via flow cytometry. <i><u>Macrophages:<\/u><\/i> Human OC ascites samples were cultured and treated for 72h with ALDHi or DMSO control. Flow cytometry was performed to identify ascites resident cell populations. Western blot to detect NR4A1 was conducted. <i><u>Dendritic cells (DCs):<\/u><\/i> Murine bone-marrow derived DCs were exposed to ALDHi or DMSO and expanded in culture; cells were counted via hematocytometer to assess myeloid cell expansion and DC differentiation. <i><u>DC vaccine<\/u>: <\/i>ALDHi and DMSO were used with a DC vaccine and sonic hedgehog inhibitor in a study of ID8 tumor-bearing mice to assess effects on tumor progression and survival.<br \/>Results: We identified several novel ALDHi that promote T cell proliferation and CD8 expansion in vitro. Exposure of 5 patient ascites samples to ALDHi showed a significant decrease in CD14+ and CD163+ cells, indicating a loss of M2 immune-suppressive macrophages vs DMSO. NR4A1 expression was decreased in ALDHi treated cells vs DMSO. In contrast, no deleterious effect was observed on ascites T cells. <i><u>DC expansion<\/u><\/i>: There was a 10-fold increase in DC proliferation when cells were exposed to ALDHi vs DMSO in culture. <i><u>DC vaccine<\/u><\/i>: In vivo, addition of ALDHi to a DC vaccine did not provide a survival significance.<br \/>Discussion: In vitro, ALDHi have differential, complementary effects on tumor and immune cells in OC. In tumor cells, ALDHi lower chemoresistance and trigger necroptosis. ALDHi support the expansion of polyclonal CD8 T cells and type-1 DCs and inhibit T-regulatory cells. In contrast, ALDHi reduce M2 macrophages. Despite beneficial effects in vitro, suggesting anti-tumor competence, there was a modest effect on survival in tumor bearing mice. This may be explained by poor bioavailability of current ALDHi. Further analyses of cryopreserved murine tissues (tumor, lymph nodes, spleen) using flow and CHIP cytometry to assess surface markers, Western blot to test levels of NR4A1, and IHC to assess intratumoral immune cell invasion will continue to test target engagement. Alternative in vivo treatment regimens with other compounds are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Ovarian cancer,Dendritic cell vaccine,ALDH,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julia Knight<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bingsi Gao<sup>2<\/sup>, Mainpal Rana<sup>3<\/sup>, Ibrahim Uygun<sup>3<\/sup>, Ronald Buckanovich<sup>3<\/sup>, Anda Vlad<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of the Central South University, Changsha, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Magee-Womens Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ffc43058-49c2-4e5d-a3a5-887a6a61ff19","ControlNumber":"3558","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Additionally, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) plays a pivotal role as a mediator in repairing DNA damage in cancer cells. Here, we developed a triple inhibitor of PI3K&#948;\/&#947; and DNA-PK, BR101801, to promote antitumor immune responses and thereby enhance therapeutic efficacy of the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.<br \/>Methods: CT26 and MC38 colon tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice were treated with BR101801 (50 mg\/kg, PO) daily and\/or anti-PD-1 (8 mg\/kg, IP) twice a week. The tumors were comprehensively analyzed using flow cytometry, multiplex tissue imaging, and NanoString profiling methods.<br \/>Results: Oral administration of BR101801 suppressed tumor growth without significant toxicities. The optimal schedule for BR101801 was determined by activation of T cell immunity in the TME. BR101801 monotherapy significantly increased CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and decreased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, while no changes were observed in tumor-associated macrophages. Moreover, BR101801 increased AH-1+ tumor-specific CD8+ T cells within BR101801-treated CT26 tumors. BR101801 induced extensive immune remodeling of the TME by altering immune-related genes. Notably, gene signatures related to DNA damage and inflammatory responses were more enriched in BR101801-treated tumors. Furthermore, the combination immunotherapy of BR101801 and anti-PD-1 antibody strongly suppressed tumor growth and improved antitumor immunity within the TME, leading to complete tumor regression.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that BR101801, an oral triple inhibitor of PI3K&#948;\/&#947; and DNA-PK, effectively elicited anticancer immune responses within the TME and potently inhibited tumor progression in combination with immune checkpoint blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,PI3K,DNA-PK,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Seung Joon Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Won Suk Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eun-Jin Go<sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hong Ro Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Bong-Seog Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Chan Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Hong Jae Chon<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>CHA Bundang Medical Center, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Recuon, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9d40b7c6-7831-4da7-93d7-0b68861f47e3","ControlNumber":"3189","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

IL-2 activates lymphocytes and NK-cells through the intermediate-affinity dimeric IL-2 receptor, IL-2R&#946;\/&#947; (CD122\/CD132), while antigen activated T-cells and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) have increased sensitivity to IL-2 by expressing the high-affinity trimeric IL-2 receptor, IL-2R&#945;\/&#946;\/&#947; (CD25\/CD122\/CD132)<sup>3<\/sup>. CD25-independent IL-2s (&#8220;non-&#945;-IL-2s&#8221;) aim to increase the therapeutic efficacy of IL2 in cancer patients by avoiding Treg activation through selective binding to IL-2R&#946;\/&#947; <sup>4<\/sup>. However, those molecules still are reported to induce fever and hypotension and have limited efficacy as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1 <sup>5,6<\/sup>. Here we show that a novel &#945;\/&#946;-IL-2 agonist that was designed to preferentially bind to the IL-2R&#945;\/&#946;\/&#947; receptor highly upregulated on antigen activated T-cells can greatly improve on the efficacy of IL-2 while avoiding the vascular toxicity commonly associated with IL-2 treatment. In syngeneic tumor models, this &#945;\/&#946;-IL-2 agonist significantly reduced exhaustion of tumor infiltrating T cells compared to WT-IL-2 or a non-&#945;-IL-2 leading to improved expansion of tumor antigen specific CD25+PD-1+CD8+ T cells systemically and in the tumor microenvironment. This resulted in complete responses and tumor immune memory with &#945;\/&#946;-IL-2 monotherapy as well as improved outcomes in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in PD-1 refractory syngeneic tumors. In contrast, WT-IL-2 reduced T cell exhaustion and drove antigen specific T cell responses to a lesser degree, resulting in reduced combinatorial efficacy with anti-PD-1, while the non-&#945;-IL-2 failed to do either. Furthermore, the &#945;\/&#946;-IL-2 agonist reduced intratumoral Tregs compared to treatment with WT-IL-2 or PBS improving the intratumoral CD8 to Treg ratio. In non-human primates and mice, WT-IL-2 and a non-&#945;-IL-2 led to broad extravasation of lymphocytes and NK cells and activation of intra-pulmonal T cells resulting in systemic tissue inflammation and NK cell-mediated lethal capillary leak syndrome whereas the &#945;\/&#946;-IL-2 agonist, which avoids binding the dimeric IL-2R&#946;\/&#947; expressed on NK cells, avoided systemic lymphocyte activation which facilitated continuous treatment without acute vascular toxicities. Overall, through selective engagement of CD25+ T cells, this &#945;\/&#946;-IL-2 agonist demonstrated improved efficacy and tolerability of IL-2 in preclinical tumor models.

PCa and BCa often induce immunosuppressive and immune evasion mechanisms that restrict anti-tumor responses. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) offer promising and safe therapeutic options in the treatment of cancer as OVs target and or preferentially replicate in tumor cells, potentially evoking systemic anti-tumor immune responses. Combination of immunotherapy with OVs may, therefore, unleash the full potential of immunotherapy for these cancers. To achieve beneficial anti-tumor responses a more personalized OV therapy approach seems crucial. Strikingly, only few studies describe head-to-head comparison of the effects of different OVs.<br \/>Together with our partners in the oncolytic viro-immunotherapy (OVIT) consortium we are developing and evaluating multiple OVs for their abilities to induce oncolysis and subsequent immunomodulation. Furthermore, we are developing tools to predict oncolytic virus effectiveness and design strategies to personalize oncolytic virus therapy. The OVs that were generated by our consortium encompass the spontaneous Orthoreovirus mutant (<i>jin<\/i>-3), a non-human primate Adenovirus (AdV-lumc007dRbD), and a Newcastle Disease Virus variant (NDV-F0).In this study we determined the anti-tumor and immunomodulatory effects of selected OVs in multiple &#8216;near-patient and patient-derived human PCa and BCa models; 1) tumor cell line cultures, 2) cocultures of tumor cell lines and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs), and 3) <i>ex-vivo<\/i> cultured tumor tissue slices and explants from patient material or patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The selected OVs infected a panel of PCa and BCa cell lines and displayed heterogenous effects on tumor cell viability and expression of immunogenic cell death markers (HSP90, Calreticulin, and HMGB1). For instance, the <i>jin<\/i>-3 virus showed enhanced tumor tropism in most PCa cells, while AdV-lumc007dRbD was more efficient in BCa cells. Virus infection of tumor cells resulted in maturation and activation of moDCs. Furthermore, OVs were able to infect and replicate in <i>ex-vivo<\/i> cultured tumor tissue slices and viability of <i>ex-vivo<\/i> tumor tissue explants was reduced following viral inoculation. Transcriptomic analysis of infected patient tissues revealed heterogenous responses to the tested OVs.Taken together, we established and compared the oncolytic properties of various OVs in multiple preclinical models of PCa and BCa. The data indicate heterogeneity of response for the tested OVs in urological cancers. In order for OV therapy to reach robust clinical efficacy, better appreciation of underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms is crucial for the personalization of oncolytic viro-immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Immune response,Prostate cancer,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thijs  J.

Since the effect of T-DXd is based on toxin payload, topoisomerase I inhibitor, the emergence of toxin-resistant cancer cells is unavoidable. Clinical cases of Primary, or secondary resistance to T-DXd have been reported. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel drugs that can effectively exhibit antitumor effects against T-DXd-resistant carcinoma. Interferon beta (IFN-&#946;), a promising potent cytokine, has been attracting attention for treatment of cancer. It is one of the few cytokines that induce tumor cell killing directly. Importantly, it could be an alternative to conventional drug-resistant cancer, because it regulates tumor growth in a way different from cytotoxic agents. Here, GNP101, an IFN-&#946; mutein-based immunocytokine, exhibits antitumor properties against HER2-positive cancers, including T-DXd-resistant cancer.<br \/>Method: A panel of human HER2-positive cancer cell lines derived from breast, stomach and lung were treated with GNP101 or HER2 therapeutics (trastuzumab, T-DM1, T-DXd) to compare direct antitumor effects. To generate a T-DXd-resistant cells, HCC1954, NCI-N87 and Calu-3 were exposed to the IC<sub>50<\/sub>, IC<sub>80<\/sub> or IC<sub>90<\/sub> of T-DXd by cyclic treatment. After 4 months, HCC1954-R cells were established and IFN-&#946; signaling was assessed by STAT1-phosphorylation. The direct antitumor effect of GNP101 <i>in vivo<\/i> was tested in HER2-positive cancer xenograft models.<br \/>Result: GNP101 showed superior potency compared to existing HER2 therapies (trastuzumab, T-DM1, and T-DXd) in all HER2-positive cancers regardless of tissue origin. To investigate the antitumor effect of GNP101 against T-DXd resistant cancer, we first generated T-DXd-resistant cell line (HCC1954-R). These HCC1954-R cells were strongly resistant to T-DXd, and showed no antitumor effect even at 100 nM of T-DXd. However, they were sensitive to GNP101, suggesting that GNP101 maintained its antitumor effect in T-DXd resistant cells. In addition, there was no difference in IFN-&#946;-induced STAT1 phosphorylation between the parent cell and HCC1954-R. Taken together, these results indicate that HCC1954-R cells maintain IFN-&#946; signaling and are selectively resistant to T-DXd. The activities of GNP101, T-DM1 and T-DXd on HER2-positive cancer cells were compared <i>in vivo<\/i>. GNP101 inhibited the growth of tumor by 90%, with no difference from that of T-DXd or T-DM1.<br \/>Conclusion: We have evaluated the antitumor properties of GNP101, a trastuzumab-IFN-&#946; mutein in HER2-expressing cancer. Given that GNP101 retains its antitumor properties in T-DXd-resistant cancer cells, the study suggests that anti-HER2-IFN-&#946; mutein is a promising candidate for the treatment of HER2-positive and T-DXd resistant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Immunocytokines,HER2,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chan Gyu Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Minkyung Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyun Kyung Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Na Young Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Jun Young Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Sungyoul Hong<sup>3<\/sup>, Young Kee Shin<sup>3<\/sup>, Hae Min Jeong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Genopharm, Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Abion, Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Laboratory of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Genomics, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"10ffa094-81a9-42d9-8240-40d2850fcaac","ControlNumber":"7791","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

The acidity causes pHLIPs to insert as transmembrane helices, and attached cargoes can be delivered into targeted cells. STING agonists can trigger an immune response when they are inside cells. pHLIP targeted delivery of a STING agonist (STINGa) effectively triggers cytokine secretion to mobilize the immune system to eradicate tumors while avoiding side effects.<br \/><u>Experimental Procedures:<\/u> Constructs consisting of a pHLIP peptide (Var3) linked to a STINGa (diABZI) via a self-immolating linker were synthesized and characterized. Activation of the STING pathway by the agent was confirmed in cells. Small (100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) and large (400-700 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) tumors were grown in female Balb\/c mice following flank injections of CT26 colorectal cancer cells. Randomized groups of mice were injected i.p. or i.v. with pHLIP-STINGa made with L- or D- amino acid pHLIP peptides, STINGa alone, pHLIP alone or vehicle. Tumor size and body weight were then measured 3 times per week. The durability of the response to the agent was tested by a second injection of CT26 cells after 60 days. In separate experiments, the identities of targeted immune and stromal cells, the production of cytokines, the PK, tumor targeting and biodistribution were assessed.<br \/><u>Results and Conclusions: <\/u>pHLIP extends the lifetime of a STINGa in the blood 6-fold and delivers STINGa to acidic cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid derived suppressor cells (mMDSCs), and dendritic cells (DCs). The resulting activation of cytokines within the tumor microenvironment (TME) triggers the eradication of small and large CT26 tumors in mice after a single dose of pHLIP-STINGa. The tumor stroma was destroyed, intratumoral hemorrhage developed, and the TME pH increased, which is important for the efficient cytotoxic activity of immune cells. Further, no tumors developed in 20 out of 25 tumor-free mice re-challenged by an additional injection of cancer cells. The therapeutic effect on CT26 tumors was insignificant in nude mice lacking T-cells. Inhibition of MHC-I negative B16F10 melanoma tumor growth was also observed in Balb\/c mice. Thus, targeted delivery of the STINGa to the tumor stroma and TAMs activates signaling, potentially resulting in the recruitment and infiltration of both T-cells and NK-cells, which gain access to the tumor core. The cytotoxic activity of immune cells is enhanced, and immune memory is developed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted drug delivery,Immunomodulation,Microenvironment,Tumor targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Donald  M.

Recent evidence suggests that genetic deletion of ADAR1 render tumors cells substantially more vulnerable to immunotherapy. In cells, ADAR1 is expressed as two different isoforms, the constitutively expressed ADAR1p110 and the inducible ADAR1p150. Evidence suggests that ADAR1p150 is the isoform that confers oncogenic and immune modulating effects in most tumors. Of note, many of the effects of ADAR1p150 appear to be independent of the protein&#8217;s RNA editing function suggesting that a small molecule which induces ADAR1p150 targeted protein degradation might be preferable to agents that simply block deaminase activity. We have recently developed a high throughput platform that allows for the identification of ligands that can bind to wide variety of protein targets. Using this approach, we screened a diverse chemical library of 100,000 small molecules to identify compounds that bind to the unique N-terminal region of ADAR1p150. One such molecule, CL-AD-100, directly bound to ADAR1p150 but not ADAR1p110. Moreover, sub-micromolar concentrations of CL-AD-100, induced proteasomal mediated degradation of ADAR1p150, without effecting ADAR1p110 expression. Cells treated with CL-AD-100 exhibited a signature consistent with what has been observed with ADAR1p150 genetic deletion, namely accumulation of dsRNA, an inflammatory gene expression profile and interferon-dependent cell death. These results therefore demonstrate the feasibility of generating a small molecule that induces the specific targeted protein degradation of ADAR1p150. Such a molecule should have wide applicability in ADAR1-addicted tumors, as well as more broadly, in immuno-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Apoptosis,Tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yuan Liu<sup><\/sup>, Mads  B.

NK cells are highly responsive immune cells that can detect and eliminate tumor cells and bridge innate to adaptive immune responses. Bicycles are small (ca.1.5kDa), chemically synthetic, structurally constrained peptides discovered via phage display and optimized using structure-driven design and medicinal chemistry approaches. We have applied the Bicycle platform technology to discover and evaluate a new class of fully synthetic molecules termed NK tumor immune cell agonists (NK-TICA&#174;). The NK-TICA&#174; consists of chemically coupled Bicycles&#174; that bind specifically to the key activating receptor, NKp46, and to tumor antigens, that results in highly potent, antigen-dependent receptor activation and NK cell activation. We demonstrate potent, selective binding of our Bicycles to receptor-expressing cells and the capability of the bifunctional molecule to induce NK cell function in vitro. With Bicycle&#8217;s novel NK-TICA&#174; compound, we demonstrate the engagement of NK cells, the specific activation and function of NK cells, and enhanced tumor cytotoxicity in a tumor target- and dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, NK-TICAs drive NK cell-mediated tumor cell killing and cytokine production in vitro and as such have the potential to catalyze the development of durable anti-tumor immunity in tumor types not well served by current therapies. We hypothesize that utilization of Bicycle NK-TICA&#174; as a multifunctional immune cell engager will promote the modulation of NK cells, as well as the infiltration and anti-tumor activity of NK cells in solid tumors.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{B7B2F55A-221C-4B52-A59C-D5D80621E31E}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#174;<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fay Dufort<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Christopher  J.

Upon engagement, CD137 enhances immune cell survival, proliferation, cytokine production and memory formation. CD137 agonists in the clinic have shown tantalizing anti-tumor effects, however, hepatic toxicity has hampered clinical utility. To circumvent this limitation, we developed CB307, a half-life extended heavy-chain only Humabody&#174; that selectively agonizes CD137 only in the presence of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA, HGNC:FOLH1). PSMA is highly upregulated on tumor cells in prostate cancer and tumor neovasculature in other solid tumors including lung (NSCLC), kidney (clear cell RCC), bladder and colorectal cancers. CB307 enhances immune cell activation in a PSMA-dependent manner. We present here preclinical mechanistic differentiators of CB307 with respect to non-targeted CD137 agonists.<br \/>Methods: CD137 agonism, immune cell activation and cytokine secretion were evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> using coculture assays in the presence\/absence of PSMA-expressing tumor cells and <i>in vivo<\/i> with a transgenic mouse syngeneic tumor model. The ability of CB307 or non-targeted CD137 agonists to enhance tumor cell killing was additionally characterized in 3D spheroid cocultures. <i>In vitro<\/i> cocultures were used to determine the impact of PSMA expression level on CB307 activity. CB307 was evaluated as a single agent and in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors; tumoral checkpoint contribution was investigated using isogenic PD-L1 positive vs. PD-L1 CRISPR-deleted tumor cells.<br \/>Results: CB307 or PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibition alone induced IL-2 secretion in PBMC\/PSMA-expressing tumor cell cocultures; this effect was synergistically enhanced when CB307 was combined with either PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibition. CB307 augmented tumor cell killing in 3D spheroids containing PSMA-expressing cells. Enhanced tumor cell killing was observed in spheroid cultures containing CB307 in combination with PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibition. In <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacology studies in a syngeneic mouse model, CB307 demonstrated statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth versus control without peripheral T cell activation - consistent with pharmacology restricted to the PSMA+ tumor microenvironment, whereas an anti-CD137 monoclonal antibody induced tumor growth inhibition accompanied by peripheral immune cell proliferation and cytokine production.<br \/>Summary: CB307 is a novel CD137 agonist that selectively enhances immune cell activity only in the presence of PSMA-positive cells. Our data demonstrate PSMA-targeted CB307 immunological pharmacology both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> which has supported the ongoing Phase 1 &#8216;POTENTIA&#8217; clinical trial (NCT04839991).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Tumor antigen,Immunostimulation,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew  J.

This resistance to treatment is attributed to low neoantigen expression, and the inability of T cells to kill HLA-I negative tumor cells, especially cancer stem cells (CSCs). Advantageously, NK cells can preferentially kill CSCs via stress ligand recognition. We have previously shown that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of a specific chain length, and synthetic mimetics thereof, selectively inhibit colon CSCs. In the current study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of natural GAGs and synthetic GAG mimetics (SGMs) in eliciting Natural Killer effector functions that regulate the anti-tumor immune response.<br \/>Methods: 8-12 wk old C57bl\/6 mice were treated with SGM or natural GAG (Fucoidan, heparin hexasaccharide (HS06)) and vehicle for 2 wks. Splenocytes were expanded in IL-2-containing media with or without respective GAG\/SGMs, and subjected to co-culture with syngeneic MC38 colon cancer cells. The effects of each treatment on immune cell profile and anti-cancer properties were evaluated using a) multiplex flow cytometry Cytek&#174; immune profiling assay and b) MTT assay. <i>In vitro,<\/i> MACS-enriched human peripheral blood NK cells were stimulated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with GAG\/NSGMs and analyzed for activation using flow cytometry and cytotoxicity towards primary human colon cancer-derived spheroids. PDL-1 expression and CSC marker expression in GAG\/SGM-treated MC38 spheroids was analyzed using western blotting and qPCR.<br \/>Results: Unbiased multiplex flow cytometry revealed a robust activation of NK cells, evidenced by increased CD335 (NKp46) expression in SGM or Fucoidan-treated mice. SGM pulsed splenocytes also showed increased cytotoxicity toward MC38 cells compared to vehicle controls ex vivo. Furthermore, our preliminary findings showed that human peripheral blood NK cells (CD45+CD3-CD56+) showed activation (increased CD69 expression) with both GAGs and SGMs but showed increased proliferation (Ki67+) upon <i>ex vivo<\/i> stimulation with GAG oligosaccharide HS06 and not polymeric GAG. Furthermore, GAG treatment significantly enhanced activated autologous NK cell-induced apoptosis in primary human tumor-derived spheroids. Mechanistically, a significant reduction in Pdl-1 protein expression was observed in MC38 spheroids concurrent with the downregulation of various CSCs maker genes, e.g., Oct4, Sox2, and c-my when treated with various SGMs <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: The work highlights the role of novel SGMs in the activation of NK cells to target CSCs and it has major implications for development of novel immunotherapy strategies in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Natural killer cells,Glycosylation,Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pavani Pingali<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jackson Faulx<sup><\/sup>, Aditi Nandi<sup><\/sup>, Umesh  R.

Currently, several EP4 selective antagonists and an EP2\/4 dual antagonist are being developed for anti-cancer immunotherapy. Using a combination of EP2 and EP4 selective antagonists in different tumor mouse models, we could demonstrate that dual EP2\/EP4 blockade is more effectively activating anti-tumor immunity compared to targeting either receptor alone. The concurrent inhibition of EP2 and EP4 resulted in tumor regression and induction of immunological memory. Together with published data showing similar findings, our results suggest that simultaneous targeting of EP2 and EP4 could be a promising new therapeutic approach to overcome cancer immune evasion. Idorsia Pharmaceuticals has identified ACT-1002-4391 as a novel, potent antagonist of EP2 and EP4 receptors with an excellent duality profile. In vitro, ACT-1002-4391 is capable of modulating immune cell proliferation and\/or function and is superior to EP2 or EP4 selective inhibition in that respect. In vivo, ACT-1002-4391 displays strong and dose-dependent single agent anti-tumor efficacy in a syngeneic mouse tumor model. Based on the excellent selectivity and duality profile, ACT-1002-4391 will be advanced into clinical development by Idorsia Pharmaceuticals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Immunostimulation,Anticancer Immunotherapy,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sébastien Jeay<sup><\/sup>, Stefan Diethelm<sup><\/sup>, Agnes Knopf<sup><\/sup>, Marie Goxe<sup><\/sup>, Marie Daugan<sup><\/sup>, Julie Erupathil<sup><\/sup>, Julien Pothier<sup><\/sup>, Davide Pozzi<sup><\/sup>, Thierry Sifferlen<sup><\/sup>, Lorenza Wyder<sup><\/sup>, Isabelle Lyothier<sup><\/sup>, Olivier Corminboeuf<sup><\/sup>, Francois Lehembre<sup><\/sup>, <b>Imke Renz<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Dominique Meyer<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Allschwil, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dc396a8f-f80a-48c3-a178-78dc3226b5b4","ControlNumber":"3433","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Extensive evidence from translational studies indicates immunosuppressive cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor immune escape and inhibits the efficient antitumor immune response. Previously, we have shown that a large proportion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in claudin-low subtype of TNBC are CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup> Tregs. Infiltration of Treg in TME is associated with suppressing effector T cell responses, accelerated tumor growth, and poor clinical outcomes. Herein, to convert immunosuppressive TME of TNBC to immune-inflamed immunophenotype we used polymeric micelles nanoparticles for co-delivering immunomodulatory small molecule drugs. We used a novel Full Spectral Flow Cytometry approach for immunophenotyping tumors. We identified significant infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the orthotopic T11 TNBC tumor. The small molecule resiquimod, an imidazoquinoline Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7\/8 agonist, and idelalisib, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p110&#948; were incorporated in poly(2-oxazoline) block copolymer polymeric micelle NPs. Drug exposure to tumor cells was increased by the small-size nanoparticles associated with the preferential accumulation of NPs in tumors. The resiquimod and idelalisib were used to differentiate MDSC and selectively decrease the number and function of Tregs<sub> <\/sub>in TME, respectively. Following targeted radiation therapy in combination with iv administration of nanoformulation to animals bearing orthotopic T11 TNBC tumors, we observed significant suppression of tumor growth and enhanced overall survival compared to targeted radiotherapy alone. Radiation therapy in combination with both nanoformulated resiquimod and idelalisib induced optimal tumor control, increasing median survival with over 50% complete response rate, while all mice in the nanoformulation groups or radiation alone group succumbed to tumor growth. Enhanced adaptive T cell immunity against TNBCs and effective therapeutic improvement in immunocompetent mice following radiotherapy were only observed with simultaneous depletion of Tregs and MDSC. These data suggest radiotherapy in combination with nanoparticle co-delivery of immunomodulators inhibiting MDSCs and Treg, has promising potential for future clinical trials and translation for the treatment of TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Nanoparticle,Immunomodulation,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mostafa Yazdimamaghani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Oleg Kolupaev<sup>2<\/sup>, Chaemin Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Duhyeong Hwang<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander Kabanov<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonathan Serody<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8365fbef-6b5f-47b6-8679-80e9a45ab0fc","ControlNumber":"1867","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Activating innate immune cells is considered a safer, yet efficacious, alternative to T cells. We report here the preclinical development of AFVT-2101, a novel bispecific innate cell engager designed to induce tumor killing by high avidity binding to CD16A on innate cells and folate receptor alpha (FR&#945;), a tumor-associated antigen with upregulated expression on certain solid tumor cells. Binding of AFVT-2101 to CD16A and FR&#945; was assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry in the presence of physiological levels of IgG. The antitumor activity of the innate engager was evaluated by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) <i>in vitro<\/i> assays, using purified NK cells or differentiated macrophages as effector cells against tumor cell lines with varying levels of FR&#945; expression. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies were conducted in transgenic mice expressing human CD16A on myeloid cells and transplanted with FR&#945;-expressing cancer cell lines. AFVT-2101 binds to CD16A and FR&#945; with an apparent avidity of 0.1 nM and 0.05 nM, respectively. Physiological levels of human IgG do not alter binding kinetics. AFVT-2101 induces potent and selective ADCC and ADCP, even on FR&#945;<sup>low<\/sup> cancer cells. Further, AFVT-2101 is more efficacious and potent in both ADCC and ADCP assays than farletuzumab, an Fc-competent monoclonal antibody targeting FR&#945;, which shares the same VH\/VL sequence as AFVT-2101. In <i>in vivo <\/i>experiments, AFVT-2101 is active and significantly inhibits the growth of FR&#945;<sup>+ <\/sup>tumors. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> flow cytometry analyses show a repolarization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) with reduction of the frequency of tumor-associated macrophages upon treatment with AFVT-2101. A reduction of FR&#945;<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells in groups receiving therapy was also observed. In conclusion, AFVT-2101 binds selectively to CD16A and FR&#945;, even in the presence of physiological levels of IgG, resulting in a potent and selective elimination of FR&#945;<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells through the engagement of NK cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and macrophage phagocytosis (ADCP). The high avidity for CD16A likely imparts increased potency and efficacy compared to the FR&#945;-specific antibody farletuzumab. Moreover, the innate immune engager significantly restrains <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth and induces pharmacodynamic changes in line with TME repolarization. AFVT-2101 engages innate immune cells in a target-restricted manner and potentially imparts an efficacious clinical profile with favorable tolerability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,CD16A,Folate receptor,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nicolo' Rigamonti<sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Schmollinger<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Peter Sandy<\/b><sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Tomaszowski<sup>4<\/sup>, Josef Caslavsky<sup>4<\/sup>, Ahmad Trad<sup>4<\/sup>, Daniel O’Shannessy<sup>5<\/sup>, Jana Siegler<sup>2<\/sup>, Eric  J.

The lead product, IGV-001, was evaluated in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients in a phase 1b clinical trial. Median overall survival of highest exposure IGV-001-treated &#8216;Stupp-eligible patients (n=10) was 38.2 months compared with 16.2 months in current standard-of-care-treated patients (<i>p<\/i>=0.044) (Andrews 2021). Imvax also reported anti-tumor activity of the murine variant of this product, <i>m<\/i>IGV-001, in the GL261 GBM mouse model and detected <i>m<\/i>IGV-001-induced immune responses in BDC-draining lymph nodes. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction can result in immunogenic cell death, we investigated the role of ROS formation as a mediator of cell death in <i>m<\/i>IGV-001 as well as the generation of subcellular particles that, when released from the BDCs, may provide a tumor antigen payload with potential anti-tumor activity.<br \/>Methods: Mouse (<i>m<\/i>)<i> <\/i>or<i> <\/i>human<i> <\/i>(<i>h<\/i>) variants of IGV-001 were prepared using mouse GL261 or human T98G GBM cells, respectively, and BDCs were incubated for 24-48 h. ROS levels were detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy via oxidation of H2DCF (a fluorescein analog used to quantify ROS in cells) in the presence or absence of the antioxidant <i>N<\/i>-acetyl-cysteine (NAC).<i> m\/h<\/i>IGV-001 viability was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V\/7-AAD staining. Particle size distribution in <i>h<\/i>IGV-001 BDC contents was analyzed using a Nanosight NS300. The transport of subcellular particles (25-90 nm) across the BDC membrane was modeled under dynamic and static conditions using MATLAB<sup>&#174;<\/sup> 2022a and confirmed by <i>in vitro <\/i>studies<i>.<\/i><br \/>Results: After 24 h <i>in vitro<\/i>, ROS levels in <i>m<\/i>IGV-001 were significantly increased along with overt cell death. ROS scavenging with NAC resulted in a cell viability rescue of approximately 50% (from ~40% to ~60% viable cells). Similar trends, although of reduced magnitude, were observed in <i>h<\/i>IGV-001. Particle analysis within <i>h<\/i>IGV-001 BDCs showed that after 48 h in culture, dead cells produced particles small enough to diffuse through the BDC membrane. Computational models corroborated that under static conditions, particle equilibrium inside and outside BDCs was achieved after 40 h, 80 h, and 260 h for 25 nm, 50 nm, and 90 nm particles, respectively. Under dynamic conditions, equilibrium was reached in less than 5 h irrespective of particle size.<br \/>Conclusions: The use of a surgically implantable drug-device combination product induces ROS-associated immunogenic cell death and generation of a tumor-derived immunogenic payload that can be taken up by local DCs, which travel to the proximal draining lymph nodes to activate anti-tumor T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Cell death,Reactive oxygen species,Glioblastoma multiforme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher Cultrara<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kenneth Kirby<sup>1<\/sup>, Essam Elrazaq<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Uhl<sup>1<\/sup>, Amelia Zellander<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorenzo Galluzzi<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Exley<sup>1<\/sup>, Jenny Zilberberg<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Imvax, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"47536e6a-1f5c-465b-b8cf-91082c809b97","ControlNumber":"4589","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

ITK-\/- mice exhibit defects in Th2 differentiation while retaining the ability to differentiate into Th1 cells that secrete IFN&#947;. We generated CPI-818, a covalent inhibitor of ITK (K<sub>D<\/sub> 2.5nM) with &#62; 100 fold selectivity over resting lymphocyte kinase (RLK) and other TEC family kinases. This drug is now being evaluated as a single agent in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in refractory T cell lymphoma where objective tumor responses have been observed. In the studies reported here, we have investigated the immunomodulatory effects of specific ITK blockade of human T cells with CPI-818 in vitro and in vivo in murine tumor models.<br \/>Analysis of the cytokine profiles in human CD4 T cells differentiated under non-polarizing, Th1 or Th2 polarizing conditions showed that CPI-818 inhibited generation of Th2-associated cytokines whereas, production of Th1 cytokines such as IFN&#947; were largely unaffected. Suppression of IL-2-mediated proliferative response occurred only at high concentrations of CPI-818 (&#62;1uM). The effect of CPI-818 on anti-tumor immunity was evaluated in both murine syngeneic CT26 colon cancer and EL4 T cell lymphoma models. In vivo treatment of animals with established tumors showed single-agent anti-tumor activity in both models. Combining CPI-818 with suboptimal doses of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 synergistically inhibited the growth of established CT26 tumors, leading to complete tumor elimination in 100% treated animals. Furthermore, triple combination therapy elicited durable anti-tumor immune memory after animals were rechallenged with a new engraftment of CT26 cells. Enhancement of anti-tumor activity required CD8+ T cells as in vivo antibody-mediated depletion of CD8, but not CD4, abolished the efficacy of CPI-818 monotherapy. Consistent with that, we found increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and increased ratio of CD8: Treg in the responding tumors of CPI-818 treated animals. Levels of several exhaustion makers were down-regulated by treatment with CPI-818, suggesting that inhibition of ITK by CPI-818 produces favorable changes in the tumor microenvironment. Our findings provide insights into the effects of selective ITK blockade on tumor immunity and its potential role in immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,T cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,ITK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lih-Yun Hsu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rahul D.

To overcome the limitation of the current IL-2 therapy, a number of pharmaceutical companies have developed CD25 binding attenuated IL-2 muteins via various platform technology. These physical changes, however, accompanied a decrease in CD122-mediated signaling which was associated with cytotoxic lymphocytes expansion, leading to unsatisfied clinical consequences. In this context, we developed HM16390, a long-acting IL-2 analog with enhanced CD122 binding affinity to elicit potent anti-tumor efficacy. Furthermore, optimal binding affinity to CD25 was incorporated to prevent from unwanted toxicity. The pharmacokinetics in mice after single subcutaneous administration of HM16390 supported an extended duration of action (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub>= 24.5 hr, bioavailability= 43.0%). To further investigate anti-tumor effect on various immunological conditions, syngeneic tumor mouse models, which are representing highly immunogenic colon cancer (CT26) and poorly immunogenic melanoma (B1F10), were chosen. After two weeks treatment in CT26 mice, complete response (CR) was observed in 89% and 100% of the mice by once weekly treatment of HM16390 at 2.1 and 8.5 mg\/kg respectively, while only 22% of the mice showed CR by 5 consecutive day treatment per week of aldesleukin at 3.0 mg\/kg. The cured mice had no evidence of relapse after tumor re-challenges at days 50 and 152. This immunological memory response against the CT26 tumor was demonstrated by significant increase in tumor-specific memory T cells in lymphoid organ and blood. Next, after four weeks treatment in B16F10 mice, once weekly treatment of HM16390 was well tolerated up to 42 mg\/kg, and led to significant and dose-dependent retardation in tumor growth (<i>vs<\/i> syngeneic tumor vehicle) from 62.9% to 96.4% as well as dose-dependently prolonged median overall survival from 15 to 38 days (14 days in syngeneic tumor vehicle) at the dose range of 0.34 to 42 mg\/kg. Of note, at doses &#8805;17 mg\/kg, CR was observed in up to 22% of the mice. To sum up with the results, HM16390 has a dose-dependent and potent anti-tumor efficacy in murine models with the broad range of the immunogenic condition via CD122-enhanced IL-2 agonism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,Immunotherapy,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jinyoung Kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jaehyuk Choi<sup><\/sup>, Yu Yon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Seongju Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Sang Hyun Park<sup><\/sup>, Sungmin Bae<sup><\/sup>, Daejin Kim<sup><\/sup>, In Young Choi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c54c204a-6e98-4d9b-b13b-a21402987d9b","ControlNumber":"5623","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

The V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cell receptor is activated by a butyrophilin 2A1 and 3A1 (2A1\/3A1) heterodimer as &#8220;signal 1&#8221;, together with costimulatory signaling through CD28 or NKG2D as &#8220;signal 2&#8221;. Here we evaluated the ability of a GDT engager (GADLEN) comprising the extracellular domains of 2A1\/3A1 adjoined via an Fc to an antibody fragment targeting the CD20 antigen, to mediate target-cell depletion in vivo at physiologically relevant frequencies of GDT. A humanized mouse model was developed wherein human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were engrafted to NSG-IL15 mice and a high degree of human chimerism persisted for over 3 weeks, including a circulating pool of human GDT comprising 0.5 to 3% of total T cells. Across different human donors, the GDT effector to target B cell ratio varied from 1:1 to 1:46. Following treatment with a B cell-targeted GADLEN, rapid and dose-dependent depletion of over 95% of human B cells was achieved in the peripheral blood and spleen, even at E:T ratios of 1:46. Based on these data, a repeat-dose toxicology study was conducted in cynomolgus macaques across a dose range of 0.1 to 25 mg\/kg with the CD20-targeted GADLEN. This study also demonstrated dose-dependent B cell depletion within 2 hours of infusion. Durable receptor occupancy was observed on CD20+ cells for over 7 days, whereas transient occupancy was observed on circulating cynomolgus V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells. GDT represented approximately 1-3% of total T cells in cynomolgus macaques, and E:T ratios ranged from 1:7 to 1:49. All treatments were well tolerated, and no evidence of cytokine release syndrome nor any other toxicities were observed. Interestingly, in both humanized mice and non-human primates, the proliferation of GDT was not required to achieve B cell depletion. In fact, over several weeks, the circulating frequencies of cynomolgus V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells remained stable, and no evidence of either proliferation or migration out of the blood was observed. These observations, together with the speed at which B cell depletion occurred, suggest that the V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells eliminated the B cell pool by serial killing following treatment with the GADLEN. Despite a GDT frequency of less than 5% of total T cells in all these studies, V&#947;9V&#948;2 T cells achieved rapid depletion of target cells following treatment with the GADLEN, without evidence of toxicity, even at high doses. Collectively, these results indicate that low frequencies of GDT can be harnessed to achieve similar target-cell killing potential as the broader CD3+ T cell pool but with potentially less toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Bifunctional fusion proteins,T cell engager,Butyrophilins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anne Y.

Mechanistically, IFN&#945; directly inhibits tumor cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, while simultaneously activating various innate and adaptive immune cell populations. Unfortunately, clinical use of IFN&#945; has been hindered by the adverse events associated with its systemic administration, demonstrating the need for novel approaches to utilize this cytokine in the clinic. WTX-613 is a conditionally activated IFN&#945; prodrug, or INDUKINE&#8482; molecule, which has two identical half-life extension (HLE) domains tethered to IFN&#945;2b via a proprietary tumor protease-sensitive linker. Following systemic administration, WTX-613 circulates as an inactive prodrug that is unable to bind to IFN&#945; receptors in normal tissues due to the steric hinderance of the HLE domains complexed with albumin. However, when WTX-613 enters the tumor, proteases found in the tumor microenvironment (TME) cleave the protease-sensitive linkers, releasing fully active IFN&#945;2b selectively in the tumor. Since human IFN&#945; is not active in mice, a surrogate INDUKINE&#8482; molecule containing mouse IFN&#945;1 (mWTX-613\/WW0610) was created.<b> <\/b>mWTX-613 treatment generated robust anti-tumor immunity in several murine syngeneic tumor models. In the MC38 model, mWTX-613 treatment was more efficacious than equimolar amounts of the recombinant cytokine (mIFN&#945;1) and was accompanied by an increase in the therapeutic window. Mechanistically, systemic treatment with mWTX-613 resulted in prolonged peripheral exposure extending over a week beyond the time of the final dose. mWTX-613 treatment also resulted in a significant increase in the CD8\/Treg ratio, and a robust increase in MHC I and MHC II expression by various professional antigen presenting cell populations. In addition, mWTX-613 treatment resulted in a clear and prolonged activation of both tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Transcriptionally, systemic treatment with mWTX-613 resulted in prolonged IFN&#945; signaling within the TME, as demonstrated by significant enrichment in multiple Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with an anti-viral immune response. Finally, the combination of mWTX-613 treatment with various checkpoint inhibitor molecules resulted in improved anti-tumor efficacy in syngeneic models. Together, these data support the advancement of this innovative IFN&#945; therapy into clinical testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Cytokines,Preclinical,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher  J.

Despite the recent advancement of immune checkpoint inhibitors, more than 50% of patients still fail to show a sustained response to therapy. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop therapies specific to novel immune targets as well as combination drug regimens. Current immunocompetent preclinical models do not adequately model the responses to immunotherapy, reflecting the urgent need to develop models with greater translational utility. To address this need, we developed a humanized xenograft melanoma model engrafted with autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to evaluate the utility of nemvaleukin alfa, an engineered IL-2 cytokine which preferentially activates and expands cytotoxic NK cells and antigen-experienced CD8 T cells.<br \/>Methods: Melanoma-bearing mice were injected intravenously with matched melanoma patient PBLs and treated for four cycles (1 cycle\/week) with anti-PD-1, nemvaleukin, or rhIL-2. Tumor growth was monitored, and correlative analyses were done on blood, spleen, and tumors by flow cytometry after 4 cycles of treatment.<br \/>Results: This humanized melanoma mouse model exhibited good T cell engraftment and was characterized by expression of the proliferative marker Ki-67 in 50-60% of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations. Treatment with nemvaleukin resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition rates (TGIs) of an average of 48% compared to vehicle-treated mice. In addition, nemvaleukin promoted expansion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, without expansion of CD4+ regulatory T cells, which are known to suppress immunological responses. Compared to rhIL-2 and vehicle, nemvaleukin treatment delayed tumor growth and enhanced survival with a median survival time of 56 days compared to 21 and 50 days, respectively. Nemvaleukin-treated mice had higher CD45+ cell engraftment in spleens and tumors compared to anti-PD-1 treatment, indicating that nemvaleukin boosts T cell proliferation and expansion. Of note, we observed better antitumor efficacy in response to nemvaleukin or anti-PD-1 when mice were engrafted with tumors from patients who responded to checkpoint immunotherapy with TGIs of 36% and 51%, respectively, compared to those who did not with TGIs of 16% and 12%, respectively. These data indicate that treatment responses in our humanized model correlates with clinical outcomes.<br \/>Conclusion: In this all autologous humanized melanoma mouse model, nemvaleukin treatment not only enhances T cell engraftment, it significantly augments anti-tumor efficacy. These data support the use of this personalized melanoma xenograft model to analyze the underlying immune responses in responders and non-responders to novel immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Preclinical,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yee Peng Phoon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jared  E.

As the five-year survival with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is 14%, new treatment strategies are needed. Immune checkpoint blockade which takes advantage of an individual's immune system in order to fight cancer, is a promising future direction of research, although it is only effective and approved for the treatment of mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient CRCs. Long-term outcomes even in MMR-deficient mCRC suggest that most patients are not cured but eventually develop therapy resistance. We hypothesized that targeting TGF- &#946; signaling may enhance immune-mediated T-cell killing by MMR-deficient CRC cells. Using GLPG-0187, an inhibitor of multiple integrin receptors and TGF- &#946;, we demonstrate minimal cytotoxicity against MMR-deficient HCT116 or p53-null HCT116 human CRC cells. However, GLPG-0187 promoted significant immune cell killing of the CRC cells by TALL-104 T lymphoblast cells. GLPG-0187 reduced pSMAD2 in HCT116 p53-null cells either in the absence or presence of exogenous TGF- &#946;. We observed a reduction in CCL20, CXCL5, prolactin, and TRAIL-R3 while GDF-15 was increased in TALL-104 cells treated with a T-cell activating dose of GLPG-0187 (4 &#956;M). Our results suggest that TGF- signaling inhibition by a general integrin receptor inhibitor may boost T-cell killing of MMR-deficient colorectal cancer cells, and suggest that a combination of anti-GDF-15 in combination with TGF- &#946; blockade should be further investigated in the treatment of MMR-deficient mCRC. Our results support the development of a novel immune-based therapeutic strategy to treat colorectal cancer by targeting the TGF-&#946; signaling pathway through integrin receptor blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Colon cancer,Integrins,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brooke Verschleiser<\/b><sup><\/sup>, William MacDonald<sup><\/sup>, Lindsey Carlsen<sup><\/sup>, Kelsey E.

We have developed a micellar formulation of the TLR7 agonist MBS8(1V270) which demonstrated low toxicity and high efficacy in multiple murine cancer models when administered intravenously as monotherapy. In combination treatment, MBS8(1V270) showed a synergistic effect with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Moreover, in several models resistant to anti-PD-1 treatment, MBS8(1V270) co-administration restored sensitivity to anti-PD-1 thus indicating potential for combination treatment in clinical setting. GLP toxicology studies in SD rats and cynomolgus monkeys did not reveal significant toxicities up to the human equivalent dose level of ~1.3 mg\/kg which is above anticipated therapeutic dose. Additionally, <i>ex vivo <\/i>stimulation of human whole blood demonstrated significantly lower IL-6 induction by MBS8(1V270) as compared to the benchmark drug resiquimod. Tissue distribution and excretion of MBS8(1V270) was investigated in SD rats. No signs of drug accumulation were observed in any of the analyzed organs with nearly complete clearance of the drug 24 hours post-end of infusion. The major route of the MBS8(1V270) elimination was via faeces. Cellular uptake of MBS8(1V270) by human blood cells was investigated <i>ex vivo<\/i> using whole blood from healthy donors. The main cell populations taking up the drug were monocytes and B cells followed by NK cells. No MBS8(1V270) was detected in neutrophils or T cells.In conclusion, MBS8(1V270) was well tolerated in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels above therapeutic effective doses identified in mice, thus providing a good therapeutic window. It showed significant anti-cancer activity in multiple murine tumor models when administered either alone or in combination with PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors. Together, these data provide a rationale for clinical studies of MBS8(1V270) as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. MBS8(1V270) is currently under clinical investigation in the clinical trial MBS8-101 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04855435).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TLR7,Nanoparticle,Immunostimulation,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Simon Skjøde Jensen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Esben Christensen<sup>2<\/sup>, Martin Bak Winther<sup>2<\/sup>, Anders Elias Hansen<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonas Rosager Henriksen<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Lars Andersen<sup>2<\/sup>, Morten Just Petersen<sup>1<\/sup>, Svetlana Panina<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>MonTa Biosciences ApS, Lyngby, Denmark,<sup>2<\/sup>Danish Technical University, Lyngby, Denmark","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cc928a18-33da-44e0-bacf-c8b09ad9d5bb","ControlNumber":"4374","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

In T cells, HPK1 negatively regulated TCR signaling by phosphorylating the adaptor protein SLP76 on Ser376, which leads to the dissociation of the SLP-76\/LAT signalosomes and downregulation of T cell priming and activation. HPK1 knockout (KO) or kinase-inactive (KI) mice spontaneously reject tumors with an enhanced immune response compared to wild-type ones. Thus, HPK1 is a novel immuno-oncology (I\/O) target. In this work, we described the discovery of a potent HPK1 inhibitor starting from comprehensive SAR-based design with guidance from X-ray crystallography and computational modeling. These efforts led to identification of the potent azaindole inhibitor XNW21015, with excellent kinase selectivity and promising PK profile of low clearance and sufficient exposure for <i>in vivo <\/i>animal studies. XNW21015 dose-dependently inhibited phosphorylation of SLP76(Ser376)<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> in response to anti-CD3 agonist antibody, with concomitant enhancement in T cell activation. Oral administration of XNW21015 in mouse syngeneic tumor models showed favorable PK profile and robust anti-tumor activity as both single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In a humanized PDX (patient-derived xenograft) model, XNW21015 enhanced tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes (TIL). In summary, we have discovered a novel, highly potent and selective HPK1 inhibitor XNW21015 as promising small molecule I\/O agent, as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunostimulation,T cell,Preclinical,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuchuan Wu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rui Hao<sup><\/sup>, Xi Chen<sup><\/sup>, Xiao Liu<sup><\/sup>, Yonghua Xie<sup><\/sup>, Shihua Wang<sup><\/sup>, Bingquan Gao<sup><\/sup>, Jichun Wen<sup><\/sup>, Zhenwei Wu<sup><\/sup>, Wengui Wang<sup><\/sup>, Haiyang Wei<sup><\/sup>, Yonghan Hu<sup><\/sup>, Xiaojun Liu<sup><\/sup>, Meijie Le<sup><\/sup>, Jing Qiang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Evopoint Biosciences Co., Ltd., Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2471602f-eee1-4e31-91cd-de7092d30807","ControlNumber":"1008","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Immunotherapy with PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibition has limited activity in mCRPC. AR signaling modulates CD8+ T cells and antitumor immune responses in mCRPC. In a companion presentation (Schwermann et al., submitted AACR 2023), we demonstrate that AR blockade activates NK cell killing of prostate cancer (PC) cells. We hypothesize this activation requires IFN-&#947; and TRAIL pathways. We investigated the mechanisms of AR inhibitors (ARi)enzalutamide (Enza) and darolutamide (Daro) on the antitumor function of NK cells and potential enhancement with checkpoint inhibitors. Material and Methods: We performed ATP-based CellTiterGlo viability assays to investigate the effects of Enza and Daro on PC cells (LNCap, 22Rv1 [ARv7mutation], DU145, PC3 [AR-]) and NK-92 cells. We performed co-culture experiments with PC, NK, and T cells, at a 1:1 ratio, using IFN-&#947; blocking mAb (10 &#956;g\/ml), RIK-2 (TRAIL blocking mAb- 10 &#956;g\/ml) and analyzed immune cell-mediated tumor cell killing (ImageXpress Confocal HT). The NK cell immune checkpoint inhibitor monalizumab that targets NKG2A was combined with ARi.<br \/>Results: Co-cultures of PC plus NK-92 cells with ARi significantly increased immune-mediated PCkilling within 24hrs (control[C]: 20%&#177;1.9; Enza: 40%&#177;4.3; Daro: 36%&#177;3.72, p=0.0001). This immune enhancement effect was abolished by IFN-&#947; mAb. The combination of TRAIL inhibitory mAb with Enza decreased NK immune-mediated killing by 16&#177;2.4% ([C]: 40%&#177;4.3; Enza+RIK-2:25.6%&#177;2.1, p=0.002). Treatment of PC cells plus NK cells with Enza, IFN-&#947; mAb, and TRAIL-blocking RIK-2 significantly reduced NK cell-mediated killing of PCs (control[C]: 20%&#177;1.9, [T]:3.2%&#177;2.6, p=0.003). ARi immune enhancement effect was increased by NKG2A blockade with monalizumab ([C]: 31.2%&#177;3.1, [T]: 43.92%&#177;4.52, p=0.0045). Conclusions: ARi promotes NK cell killing of PC cells via IFN-&#947; gamma and TRAIL. NK cell activation is enhanced by the combination of ARi and the checkpoint inhibitor monalizumab. Validation of these results in patient-derived organoids paired with tumor samples from patients with PC is ongoing to further understand the innate immune response and direct novel therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Natural killer cell receptor (NKG2A),Cytokines (TRAIL\/Interferon),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maximilian Schwermann<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lindsey Carlsen<sup>2<\/sup>, Kelsey  E.

Upon binding to Siglec-9, MUC16 triggers inhibitory signaling in the immune cells that allows ovarian cancer cells to evade cytolytic immune responses. Ovarian and other tumors express a plethora of cell surface as well as secreted glycoproteins with glycans that are terminated with the Siglec-9 ligand, &#945;-2,3-linked sialic acid. Therefore, targeting the sialic acid-Siglec-9 axis has been of major interest to augment antitumor immunity. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic glycomimetic Siglec-9 ligands have the potential to enhance the immune recognition of ovarian cancer cells. We first demonstrate, using siglec-9 chimeras, that the glycomimetics developed by our group inhibit the binding of Siglec-9 to its natural ligands. Our data showed that 50-fold excess of the glycomimetics over Siglec-9 chimera prevented the Siglec-9 chimera from binding to the OVCAR-3 cell line (P.value, 0.039). Additionally, we demonstrate that glycomimetics (#153 and 157) developed by our group, enhance the recognition of ovarian cancer cell targets by human NK cells. In healthy donor 1, CD107a expression was increased (21, 17, 19 %) when 0.01, 0.025, 0.05 mM concentration of glycomimetic 153 was used, respectively. A statistically significant increase (5%) in CD107a expression was observed when the NK cells were treated with 0.05 mM concentration of glycomimetic 157. At higher concentrations of glycomimetic 153 and 157, inhibition of CD107a was repeatedly observed. These experiments, therefore, suggest that there is likely a certain concentration range of the glycomimetic that can be used to overcome NK cell suppression occurring via Siglec-9. To our knowledge, these data are among the first to demonstrate that specially designed glycomimetics can be used to overcome the suppression of NK cells against ovarian cancer cells. Future studies will employ murine and humanized models to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the Siglec-9-targeting glycopeptides in enhancing immune responses against epithelial ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,NK cells ,Glycomimetics ,MUC16,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lojain  I.

Although recombinant mIL18 has demonstrated efficacy in mouse tumor models, recombinant human IL18 has not been efficacious in clinical studies, likely due to upregulation of IL18 binding protein (IL18BP), a negative regulator of the IL18 signaling axis. IL18BP is induced 10 - 100 fold after IL18 administration, binds to IL18 with high affinity, and prevents IL18 binding to the IL18 receptor. Analysis of expression data from the TCGA database as well as archived patient samples from select indications revealed that both IL18 and IL18BP are co-expressed in a number of tumor types, suggesting there may be a preexisting pool of IL18\/IL18BP complex at the site of the tumor in some patients. Inhibition of IL18\/IL18BP binding using a monoclonal antibody may therefore allow release of IL18 in situ, leading to IL18-mediated proinflammatory effects and enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Although the interaction of IL18 with IL18BP is a high affinity interaction, we have been able to identify very high affinity antibodies which can both inhibit complex formation and disrupt existing mouse IL18\/IL18BP complexes. These antibodies are active in a number of cell-based functional assays, resulting in potent stimulation of interferon gamma production from cell lines or splenocytes. In vivo, we observed efficacy in a mouse syngeneic tumor model using an anti-mIL18BP antibody. RNA and protein analysis demonstrated expression of both IL18BP and IL18 within the tumors. Combined, these data suggest that inhibition of IL18\/IL18BP binding may prove efficacious in the treatment of cancers where existing pools of IL18\/ IL18BP complexes prevent an IL18-mediated proinflammatory response. Experiments exploring anti-IL18BP therapy in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 are under current investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Importantly, we showed that pooled R microbiota transplantation into gnotobiotic xenograft mice decreased tumor growth compared to NR colonized mice following anti-PD1 therapy, a phenomenon associated with enrichment of the <i>Bacteroides<\/i> genus. However, the bacterial strains driving this synergistic effect with anti-PD1 therapy and mechanism of action are unknown.<br \/>Method: Feces collected from R mice were used as source material for high-throughput microbial isolation performed with the GALT Prospector technology. Bacterial identification was performed with MALDI-TOF Biotyper and Sanger sequencing. The cell free supernatants and under 3 kDa small molecules of 183 <i>Bacteroides<\/i> isolates were screened for their ability to stimulate IFN&#947; production by primary CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. A consortium composed of 6 IFN&#947;-stimulating isolates or NR feces was transplanted into a gnotobiotic mouse model of lung cancer treated with anti-PD1, with or without anti-IFN&#947; monoclonal antibody depletion. Tumors were harvested at endpoint for flow cytometric analysis, and blood serum for IFN&#947; ELISA. Bioactivity-guided fractionation coupled with LC-MS analysis was used to identify small molecules from the cell free supernatant of a single stimulating <i>Bacteroides<\/i> isolate. Potential bioactive small molecule characterization was performed using LC-MS\/MS supported by computational pipelines for structural prediction followed by NMR for structural confirmation.<br \/>Results: We cultured and identified 679 isolates from 30 unique species. The cell free supernatant from 6 out of 183 <i>Bacteroides<\/i> isolates stimulated IFN&#947; production from primary CD8+ T cells. Small molecules from the six stimulatory isolates&#8217; supernatants significantly induced IFN&#947; production compared to 6 taxonomy-matched non-stimulatory isolates (P=0.039). A defined consortium composed of the six stimulatory isolates (R-consortium) was able to colonize germ free mice, and decreased tumor growth compared to NR feces-colonized mice (P=0.041). IFN&#947; depletion of R-consortium mice significantly increased tumor growth (P=0.012) compared to non-depleted mice. Intratumor IFN&#947;+ CD8+ T cell frequency and circulating serum IFN&#947; was elevated only in R-consortium mice. Bioassay guided fractionation revealed 5 small molecule metabolites produced by <i>Bacteroides <\/i>and their structure and bioactivity are currently being investigated.<br \/>Conclusion: A microbial consortium engineered from R patients&#8217; feces synergizes with anti-PD1 therapy to reduce lung cancer growth through an IFN&#947;-dependent mechanism which may be mediated by small molecule metabolites.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Microbiome,Cancer immunotherapy,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rachel  C.

Their ability to directly kill malignant cells and elicit an adaptive immune response makes them a promising candidate for a precision-guided immunotherapy for cancer patients.<br \/>Bicycle&#174; peptides are small (~1.5-2 kDa), chemically synthetic, structurally constrained bicyclic peptides discovered using phage display. We have developed a Bicycle&#174; that specifically binds to NKp46, a target expressed on NK cells which acts as a key activating receptor contributing to cytolytic function of NK cells. The NKp46-binding Bicycle&#174; conjugated to the tumor antigen, EphA2-binding Bicycle&#174; creates a NK tumor-targeted immune cell agonist (NK-TICA&#174;). EphA2 is a well-characterized tumor-associated antigen overexpressed in many cancer types including prostate, lung, esophageal, urothelial, cervical, head and neck and colorectal cancers. Thus, NK-TICA&#174; is designed to engage and activate NK cells locally in the tumor to induce tumor cell killing and stimulate the adaptive immune system.<br \/>To evaluate the effects of NK-TICA&#174; administration in vivo, we used a human NKp46 knock-in mouse model subcutaneously engrafted with a syngeneic MC38 tumor. Characterization of NK populations in blood and tumor samples was conducted by multiplex flow cytometry combined with immunohistochemistry. Plasma samples were collected at various timepoints to measure a number of relevant cytokines.<br \/>All tested doses of NK-TICA&#174; were tolerated well with no record of body weight loss or clinical signs. A single dose of NK-TICA&#174; led to a significant upregulation of activation markers in the NK cells isolated from blood and tumor tissue with no increase over baseline in plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. We show that NK cell activation in the tumor is dependent on binding of the TICA&#174; to a tumor antigen highlighting the importance of the precision-guided approach.<br \/>In vivo proof-of-concept data shown here, in combination with extensive in vitro preclinical characterization of NK-TICA&#174; reported elsewhere, validate this novel class of NK cell engagers as a prospective therapeutic modality.<br \/>These studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
