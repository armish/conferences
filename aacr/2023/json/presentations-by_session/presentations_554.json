Up to 20 percent of the patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), will progress to NEPC after treatment with standard-of-care therapies, such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, that target the androgen receptor (AR) pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive the emergence of NEPC are largely unknown, contributing to a lack of treatment options for patients with NEPC. We implemented a forward genetic approach to identify novel drivers of NEPC, by using the <i>Sleeping Beauty<\/i> (SB) transposon-based forward genetic mutagenesis screening system in our <i>Pten-, Trp53-<\/i>deficient mouse model that is primed to develop NEPC at a low frequency. We generated a mouse strain (<i>NPp53-SB<\/i>) in which the <i>Nkx3.1<\/i> promoter regulates the expression of tamoxifen-inducible <i>Cre<\/i> specifically in the mouse prostate epithelium, resulting in transposition of the <i>T2Onc2<\/i> transposable element and conditional deletion of <i>Pten<\/i> and <i>Trp53<\/i> in mouse prostate epithelium. We observed an increased NEPC incidence in our <i>NPp53-SB <\/i>mouse model compared to control mice without the transposon <i>T2Onc2<\/i>, suggesting that the SB-mediated insertional mutagenesis events are driving the development of NEPC. To elucidate the genetic events that are driving the observed NEPC phenotype, we identified the common insertion sites (CISs) of the transposon insertions, which revealed a total of 330 CIS-associated genes. We further performed an integrative analysis using RNA-seq data from our SB cohort, a second mouse dataset and a metastatic CRPC patient cohort, which allowed us to identify the Master Regulator (MR) proteins that are associated with NEPC, as well as the upstream genomic events that modulate these MRs and the emergence of NEPC. Our integrative analysis identified the deacetylase Sirt1 as a candidate driver of NEPC. Using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) technology <i>in vivo <\/i>we observed that SIRT1 activation induced an NEPC-like phenotype in the adenocarcinoma LNCaP cell line, while Sirt1 drug-mediated inhibition in an NEPC cell line resulted in less aggressive tumors.In summary, we have developed a <i>Sleeping Beauty<\/i> forward genetic screen in our mouse model of CRPC, which not only accelerates disease progression, but also increases the incidence of NEPC. Our integrative analysis identified a panel of CIS-associated genes that are likely to be functionally involved in progression to NEPC. In particular, Sirt1 was shown to be a promising candidate, which may shed light on mechanisms that this aggressive disease uses to evade treatments and may inform the development of novel therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Sirt1,Neuroendocrine differentiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francisca Nunes de Almeida<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alessandro Vasciaveo<sup>2<\/sup>, Min Zou<sup>1<\/sup>, Matteo Di Bernardo<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Califano<sup>2<\/sup>, Cory Abate-Shen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fad22b57-8097-43c2-9d85-80a6e41e0fb9","ControlNumber":"7121","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

While nearly all SCLCs are genetically driven by near universal loss of function (LOF) mutations in <i>RB1<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i>; several recent studies show that there are different phenotypic SCLC molecular subtypes characterized by expression of lineage transcription factors. These include the neuroendocrine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 subtypes which together comprise ~70-80% of SCLCs. Initially subtypes were thought to be mutually exclusive, but recent evidence shows intra-tumoral subtype heterogeneity and plasticity between subtypes. A recent study found that 35-40% of human SCLCs express both ASCL1 and NEUROD1, but the mechanisms driving ASCL1 and NEUROD1 intra-tumoral heterogeneity are not well understood. My laboratory previously developed an autochthonous CRISPR-based SCLC genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) generated by intratracheally injecting adenoviruses encoding Cre recombinase and sgRNAs targeting <i>Rb1<\/i>, <i>Trp53<\/i>, and <i>Rbl2<\/i>. Cre turns on Cas9 expression and allows for CRISPR\/Cas9 editing of <i>Rb1<\/i>, <i>Trp53<\/i>, and <i>Rbl2<\/i> in somatic cells in the lungs. The unique advantage of this model is that it allows the inclusion of sgRNAs targeting additional genes of interest in the same adenovirus. Using this CRISPR-based autochthonous SCLC GEMM approach, we studied the consequences of inactivating the epigenetic modifier KDM6A during SCLC tumorigenesis. KDM6A functions as an H3K27 histone demethylase and also exists in the COMPASS complex with KMT2C\/D to promote H3K4 mono-\/di-methylation at enhancers. KDM6A along with its protein binding partner KMT2D are mutated in SCLC and KDM6A has been implicated in controlling differentiation in other lineages. Strikingly, we found that KDM6A inactivation in SCLC GEMMs induced plasticity from ASCL1 to NEUROD1 resulting in SCLC tumors that expressed both ASCL1 and NEUROD1. ATAC-sequencing showed open chromatin at the promoters of NEUROD1 and NEUROD1 target genes in KDM6A inactivated tumors. Interestingly, KDM6A inactivated tumors showed a spectrum of ASCL1 to NEUROD1 heterogeneity where some KDM6A inactivated tumors completely lost ASCL1 and solely expressed NEUROD1, some tumors expressed ASCL1 and NEUROD1 in a mutually exclusive manner, while others primarily expressed ASCL1 with very few NEUROD1 positive cells. Mechanistically, KDM6A binds and maintains ASCL1 target genes in an active chromatin state with its loss increasing H3K27me3 near both promoters and enhancers, and decreasing H3K4me1\/2 at enhancers together leading to a cell state primed for ASCL1 to NEUROD1 subtype switching. This work identifies KDM6A as an epigenetic regulator that controls ASCL1 to NEUROD1 subtype plasticity and provides an autochthonous SCLC GEMM to model ASCL1 and NEUROD1 subtype heterogeneity, which is found in 35-40% of human SCLCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Mouse models,Neuroendocrine differentiation,Lung cancer: small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Leslie Duplaquet<sup>1<\/sup>, Yixiang Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew A.

Prior work has demonstrated that transcriptional subtypes in pancreatic cancer can stratify patients by response to chemotherapy and overall survival. These include classical and basal-like as the predominant subtypes in untreated disease, as well as a transdifferentiated neural-like malignant subtype enriched after standard-of-care chemotherapy. Nonetheless, our understanding of transcriptional subtypes remains critically limited by genetic and culture-based confounders in preclinical models. Furthermore, most murine pancreatic cancer models do not fully reflect the classical <i>vs.<\/i> basal-like divide observed in humans, preventing faithful <i>in vivo<\/i> investigation. Collectively, these challenges have hindered the study of and development of therapeutic strategies against these transcriptional subtypes. To enable systematic study of the classical, basal-like and neural-like subtypes, we developed isogenic KP (<i>Kras<\/i><sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>;<i>Trp53<\/i><sup>FL\/FL<\/sup>) organoids and leveraged CRISPR activation to endogenously overexpress state-specific transcription factors. Our data revealed that <i>Gata6<\/i> and dN<i>Trp63<\/i> drove classical and basal-like identity, respectively, supporting prior studies. Furthermore, through <i>in silico<\/i> approaches, we identified candidate drivers of the neural-like state, including <i>Glis3<\/i>, a zinc finger protein that mediates neuroendocrine fate during pancreatic development. We confirmed that <i>Glis3<\/i> overexpression results in neural-like transdifferentiation in cancerous organoids through RNA-seq and proteomics, and that <i>GLIS3<\/i> knockout abrogates neural-like identity in human cell lines. To study their malignant potential <i>in vivo<\/i>, we performed orthotopic transplants into murine pancreata, and observed that <i>Glis3<\/i> and dN<i>Trp63<\/i> accelerated tumor formation and progression, corresponding to clinical outcomes observed in patients. These models may therefore provide a means for <i>in vivo<\/i> interrogation of subtype biology and vulnerabilities. Finally, to model and predict therapeutic sensitivities, we performed <i>ex vivo<\/i> treatment assays with chemotherapy and emerging KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>inhibitors. A selection assay showed that basal-like and neural-like<i> <\/i>organoids were starkly enriched by multi-agent chemotherapy, while classical organoids were depleted. Finally, we learned that the neural-like subtype exhibits differential sensitivity to KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibition through an RTK-associated mechanism. Taken together, we provide a foundational system for interrogating subtype-specific vulnerabilities in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Resistance,KRAS,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jimmy  A.

The National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR, https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov) continues to develop a collection of highly characterized patient-derived organoid models representing a variety of cancer types including rare and recalcitrant malignancies and tumors from patients of diverse ancestry. More than 230 publicly available organoid models are undergoing characterization of their suitability for incorporation into HTS panels based on their recovery from cryopreservation, reproducible growth and expansion capacity, and assay performance metrics in a 384-well format with a CellTiter-Glo 3D viability endpoint. Organoid models with suitable characteristics are being screened with a library of 166 FDA-approved oncology drugs (https:\/\/dtp.cancer.gov\/organization\/dscb\/obtaining\/default.htm). Over a 7-day period, the organoids are exposed to five concentrations of each drug with a 1-log dilution series ranging from 0.01 &#181;M to 100 &#181;M. The concentration-response profiles of patient-derived organoids will provide reference data for the organoid screen and will eventually include data from all approved and most investigational oncology agents (approximately 1,000 small molecules). NCI-60 cell lines were screened as monolayers in a 384-well format with a CellTiter-Glo viability endpoint after a 3-day exposure to the same oncology drug concentrations. Both monolayer and 3D tumor models were tested using a custom designed fully automated screening system and data analysis software platform. A comparison of the FDA-approved drug responses of a panel of 3D colon cancer organoids and a corresponding panel of 9 colon carcinoma NCI-60 cell lines elucidated similarities and differences attributable to the assay methodologies as well as the tumor model characteristics, such as the presence of a BRAF V600E variant or other clinically relevant genetic alterations (APC, ARID1A, BRCA2, etc.).

Acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM), the process by which pancreatic acinar cells transdifferentiate into ductal epithelial cells, is believed to be an initiating event of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our lab has developed a 3D organoid assay to display ADM using primary, human pancreatic acinar cells to study the rate of transdifferentiation amongst these three different races. Preliminary data shows that the rate of ADM is occurring significantly faster (p &#60; 0.05) in Blacks\/AAs (White=16, Hispanic=11, Black\/AA=5), which may explain the disproportionately behind the incidence and mortality rates for this race in pancreatic cancer. A sigmoid Emax function best captured the longitudinal changes in the percentage of ADM in nonlinear mixed effects modeling analysis performed in Monolix. Covariate analysis on top of the selected model demonstrated that race was the only covariate affecting the individual trajectories in the percentage of ADM. We additionally use nanoparticles to study the biomechanical properties (I.e., viscoelasticity, storage modulus) of the ADM microenvironment which shows a stiffer microenvironment in Blacks\/AAs than for the other races (White=4,Hispanic=4, Black\/AA=1). Furthermore, we have used a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor in reversing the process of ADM, which has consequently shown race-related outcomes, with Blacks\/AAs displaying a significant chemoresistance (p &#60; 0.05) to HDAC treatment (White=6,Hispanic=6, Black\/AA=3) by utilizing an ADM reversal index (ADMRI). Through further analysis, the plan is to continue procuring human samples from these three races to isolate an ADM-specific biomarker in relation race and drug reversal by studying the expression\/activity of pancreatic associated genes by bulk-RNA and single-cell sequencing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenocarcinoma,Pancreatic cancer,Race,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Corey Melissa Perkins<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jinmai Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hesam Hakimjavadi<sup>2<\/sup>, Jason Brant<sup>3<\/sup>, Zhongyue Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Ji-Hyun Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, David Quashie<sup>4<\/sup>, Yating Mao<sup>4<\/sup>, Jamel Ali<sup>4<\/sup>, Sarah Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Martha Campbell-Thompson<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Schmittgen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pharmaceutics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL,<sup>4<\/sup>Chemical & Biomedical Engineering, Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University, Tallahassee, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"64b4540b-70db-436a-b588-eecbe659c85d","ControlNumber":"2051","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Of these co-occurring mutations, <i>HER2<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutations are the most prevalent gene pair, with approximately 40% of <i>HER2<\/i> mutated breast cancers also having activating mutations in <i>PIK3CA<\/i>. To study the effects of co-occurring <i>HER2<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutations, we bred genetically engineered mice with the (loxP-STOP-loxP) <i>HER2<sup>V777L<\/sup><\/i>; <i>PIK3CA<sup>H1047R<\/sup><\/i> transgenes (HP mice) and studied the resulting breast cancers both <i>in vivo<\/i> as well as <i>ex vivo<\/i> using breast cancer organoids. HP mice rapidly developed invasive mammary adenocarcinoma at a median time of 2.1 weeks after adenoviral Cre injection into the mammary gland. Organoids from these breast cancers showed increased number of buddings in branching morphogenesis assay and increased migration and invasion <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i>, HP breast cancers are resistance to the pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, neratinib, but are effectively treated by the combination of neratinib plus trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). <i>Ex vivo<\/i>, we found strong synergy between neratinib and T-DXd in HP organoids. Proteomic and RNA-seq analysis of HP breast cancers showed increased gene expression of <i>CCND1<\/i> (cyclin D1) and <i>CDKN1A<\/i> (which encodes p21WAF1\/Cip1) and changes in cell cycle markers. An increase in p-p53, p-p27, and p-PDK1 in HP organoids was seen. The GSEA analysis showed that the mTOR pathway and the MYC target signature were significantly upregulated in the HP organoid group. As p21 stabilizes the cyclin D1-CDK4\/6 complex to further activate CDK4\/6, we found CDK4\/6 inhibitors inhibit cell proliferation in HP mice-derived organoids. Combining neratinib with CDK4\/6 inhibitors was another effective strategy for HP breast cancers with neratinib plus palbociclib showing a statistically significant reduction in mouse HP tumors as compared to either drug alone. We validated both the neratinib plus T-DXd and neratinib plus palbociclib combinations using a human breast cancer patient-derived xenograft that has HER2 and PIK3CA mutations very similar<br \/>to our transgenic mouse. This study provides valuable preclinical evidence for these drug combinations, which are being tested in phase 1 clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Neratinib,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),CDK4\/6 inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaoqing Cheng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yirui Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Maureen Highkin<sup>1<\/sup>, Nagalaxmi Vemalapally<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaohua Jin<sup>1<\/sup>, Brandon Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie L.

While HGSC usually responds well to primary treatment, most cases eventually relapse. Functional precision medicine - tailoring individualized treatments based on functional in vitro assays on patient-derived cells - has been recently employed in cancer clinical trials. Cancer organoids - three-dimensional, self-organizing, self-renewing cell cultures that recapitulate original tissue structure and function - have been applied as cellular models in these trials. However, in case of HGSC, organoid derivation has proven time consuming and inefficient, hindering their application in functional precision medicine due to a short time window, in which therapy for each patient needs to be selected.<br \/>To address this problem, we aimed to establish whether drug vulnerabilities at HGSC relapse could be predicted using organoids derived from the primary disease cells. We derived sequential organoid models from material sampled during primary treatment and at relapse. Then, for organoid pairs (primary-relapse), we performed large-scale drug response profiling of a library of 370 compounds (approved drugs or drugs in clinical development), in 384-well microplate format, alone or in combination with a standard HGSC chemotherapeutic agent carboplatin. First, we found that HGSC organoid responses to standard chemotherapeutics retrospectively correlated to observed clinical treatment outcomes. But further, for each patient we identified compounds with pronounced cytotoxicity both in the primary and in the relapsed model, amounting to 66% of all hits (7% were primary-specific and 27% relapse-specific). We then focused on identifying patient-specific hits rather than compounds displaying general toxicity in all patient models. Based on a potential clinical applicability, for three patients we selected compounds for validation in organoid outgrowth assay, with prolonged (&#62;1 month) drug-free period post-treatment. In two patients, AZD4573, a selective CDK9 inhibitor in clinical development for hematological malignancies, at nanomolar concentrations caused eradication of organoids when combined with carboplatin. Organoids from the third patient were vulnerable to nitazoxanide, an approved anti-helminthic agent and an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Importantly, the selected final hits were identified solely based on screening in organoid models from primary disease.<br \/>In summary, we here demonstrate that HGSC organoids derived from primary disease material predict a majority of patient-specific drug vulnerabilities of organoids derived from the relapsed HGSC lesions. This indicates that patient stratification in functional precision medicine for treatment of HGSC relapse could be prospectively performed at the primary disease stage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Ovarian cancer,Precision medicine,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wojciech Senkowski<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Gall-Mas<sup>1<\/sup>, Matias  M.
