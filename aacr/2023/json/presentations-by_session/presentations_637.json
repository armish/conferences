[{"Abstract":"Ovarian cancer resistance to chemotherapy accounts for the most therapeutic challenge, leading to the high mortality rate of gynecological cancer worldwide. Meanwhile, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are identified as key features in regulating ovarian chemoresistant cancer. In this study, we first found that PRMT5 was upregulated in paclitaxel (PTX)-resistant ovarian cancer cells compared with non-resistant cancer cells. Then, we determined the oncogenic role of PRMT5 in chemoresistant ovarian cancer by using its potent and selective inhibitor, GSK3326595. Disruption of PRMT5 activity by GSK3326595 or depletion of PRMT5 in PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells restored the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug via triggering cell apoptosis. Then, we also validated that inhibition of PRMT5 decreased cell migration ability through the transition of motile mesenchymal phenotypes into epithelial characteristics. Moreover, PRMT5 inhibitor significantly decreased the number of sphere formation and attenuated the stem cell-like properties in PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, our study suggests that PRMT5 is a powerful target to overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapy for the treatment strategy in ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,ovarian cancer,PRMT5,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yen Thi Do<sup><\/sup>, Jin Young Kim<sup><\/sup>, Seungmee Lee<sup><\/sup>, Tam Thuy Lu Vo<sup><\/sup>, Thi Tuyet Mai Pham<sup><\/sup>, Eunyoung Ha<sup><\/sup>, Chi-Heum Cho<sup><\/sup>, So-Jin Shin<sup><\/sup>, <b>Ji Hae Seo<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5308e295-ec2d-4c76-896a-6afb36a3acb6","ControlNumber":"4168","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

The approval of AMG510 in 2021 broke the curse of KRAS&#8217;s non-druggability. AMG510 targets the KRAS-G12C mutation and achieves up to 90% disease control rate, but drug resistance quickly develops. KRAS-G12D, the most prevalent and oncogenic KRAS mutation, still lacks inhibitors. MRTX-1133, the first reported highly selective KRAS-G12D inhibitor, is currently in the preclinical phase. Similarly, drug resistance will inevitably develop to KRAS-G12D inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: To explore the resistance mechanisms of KRAS-G12D mutation, our group used ASPC-1 cell line, which naturally expresses KRAS-G12D, to generate the ASPC-1-MRTX-1133R cell line using a dose-escalation method after treating cells with a mutagenic agent. Specifically, ASPC-1 cells were treated by MRTX-1133 with increasing dosage for 4 weeks, the remaining live cells were harvested and designated as ASPC-1-MRTX-1133R. Cell survival assay showed that IC50 of ASPC-1-MRTX-1133R is &#62;2000nM, 100-fold more resistant than the parental ASPC-1 cell line (22nM). We identified the potential resistance mechanisms using whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. The resistance to MRTX-1133 of ASPC-1-MRTX-1133R cell line was highly stable after 20 cell passages.<br \/>Conclusion: The ASPC-1-MRTX-1133R cell line can be a useful in vitro model in the development of KRAS-G12D inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,G12D,MRTX-1133,resistance ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Guoqian Wang<sup><\/sup>, Yao Tang<sup><\/sup>, Tingduo Lv<sup><\/sup>, Jinying Ning<sup><\/sup>, <b>Feng Hao<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Kyinno Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ecbc4a85-b271-42fe-8b76-612c75ba3b4f","ControlNumber":"4418","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

Tumors detected beyond the transitional zone of the bladder (advanced BC) account for most deaths. In advanced BC, tumor heterogeneity and resistance to successive chemotherapy regimens are major contributors to morbidity and mortality. Toxicity associated with the combination of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin (G+C) treatment limits the efficacy of chemotherapy. We tested the potential antitumor activity of a novel combination therapy involving a semisynthetic derivative of the pentacyclic triterpene (PTA) Ursolic Acid (N-methyl piperazine conjugated Ursolate, UA4) and Gemcitabine (Gem) in two Gem resistant BC cell lines developed in the laboratory. UA4 was synthesized from the PTA Ursolic Acid and Gem was purchased from LC-Labs. We tested the response to Gem and UA4 on na&#239;ve (WT) and Gem Resistant (GemR) cells. We generated Gem resistant BC cell lines HTB-4 (T24) and HTB-9 (5637) by repeated selection in increased Gem doses <i>in vitro<\/i>. The surviving cells were tested for a stable resistant phenotype. We measured the sensitivity to Gem and UA4 alone, and in adjuvant and neo-adjuvant combinations by colorimetric, cell counting, or clonogenic assays. The antitumor efficacy of UA4 and Gem were tested <i>in vivo<\/i> by xenograft studies on Fox N1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> athymic mice (both sexes). The expression of markers associated with drug resistance was determined by qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence studies. The 50% growth inhibition (IC50) dose in Gem treated cells increased significantly in 5637 and T24 GemR cells - 10-fold higher in GemR (100nM) than in WT cells (10 nM). Both WT and GemR cells showed equal sensitivity to UA4 (~5 &#181;M). GemR cells showed elevated mRNA expression of a pyrimidine salvaging enzyme, cytidine deaminase (CDA), which degrades intracellular Gem, MRP2, and ENT1, all related to limiting intracellular drug availability. Tetrahydrouridine (THU), a competitive inhibitor of CDA, reduced the resistance significantly, indicating CDA as the principal mediator of resistance in GemR cells. Oral administration of UA4 was highly effective in reducing tumor growth of 5637 WT and GemR xenografts, whereas Gem (25mg\/kg, 2x per week, i.p.) did not significantly reduce growth of GemR xenografts. Gem antitumor activity on 5637 WT tumors was predominantly due to apoptosis. Increased expression of autophagy markers, but not markers of apoptosis, was evident<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> treatments with UA4. Overall, treatment with UA4 was equally effective in decreasing viability in both WT and GemR advanced BC cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and reducing their tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Unlike Gem, UA4 did not induce significant levels of apoptosis but mainly autophagy-induced cell death. Ongoing studies indicate potential to use UA4 as an adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy in the treatment of advanced BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Bladder cancer,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Natural products,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Juliette  R.

To study this, our lab generated two patient derived platinum-resistant tumor spheres from platinum-sensitive primary patient cells to better understand the biology behind recurrent disease and identify novel therapeutic targets. Utilizing an artificial intelligence (AI) powered model, we screened a library that consisted of compounds predicted to target known or postulated resistance mechanisms and involved a novel therapeutic target. From this screen, we identified a TNIK kinase inhibitor as the only compound to effectively kill HGSOC spheres while sparing non-malignant fallopian tube cells. TNIK plays a key role in Wnt pathway activation, which our lab has previously shown to be critical in driving cancer stemness and epithelial ovarian cancer platinum resistance. Additionally, patient data shows that TNIK is amplified in ovarian cancer more than any other cancer type and is highly activated in ovarian cancer patients. We found that this compound was able to decrease overall Wnt activity in our platinum-resistant cells and could resensitize our platinum-resistant cells to cisplatin. This work demonstrates the abilities of using AI to expedite the drug discovery process as well as uncover novel therapeutic targets which may lead to future therapeutic strategies for HGSOC patients who no longer respond to standard of care platinum chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,TNIK,Chemoresistance,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Noah Puleo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michele Cusato<sup>1<\/sup>, Dylan Carvette<sup>1<\/sup>, Chantelle Husdon<sup>2<\/sup>, Analisa DiFeo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>BenevolentAI, London, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1cb29387-7dff-492d-96da-f85012973ee9","ControlNumber":"5286","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

In a recent high-risk clinical trial (ARST0431) 25% of patients progressed during 52 weeks of chemo-radiation treatment, and 80% had tumor recurrence or progression within 24 months. Two drug modules comprise the core for treatment: VAC (vincristine, actinomycin-D, cyclophosphamide) and VI (vincristine, irinotecan). However, the molecular basis for intrinsic or acquired resistance to these combinations is poorly understood.To simulate clinical heterogeneity of RMS, we have developed 40 PDX\/CDX xenograft models and using Single Mouse Testing (SMT) have characterized the sensitivity of each model to individual agents and to VAC\/VI combinations. Tumor volume regression and Event-Free Survival (EFS) were used to assess chemosensitivity. To select for acquired resistance, tumor bearing mice were treated with one cycle of VAC or VI, tumor was transplanted upon regrowth when volume reached 400% of that on day 1 of treatment. The process was repeated for up to 5 cycles of therapy. Development of resistance was measured by decreased EFS and tumor progression during treatment. Parental and isogenic lines with acquired resistance were snap frozen for DNA and RNA sequencing. Sensitivity for each tumor models was assessed by EFS for treated <i>vs<\/i> untreated tumor and probability plotted against time (days) after initiating treatment. Each single agent significantly extended EFS compared to control EFS (P&#60;0.001), consistent with known clinical activity. Of note VAC and VI combinations had greater than additive EFS (e.g. EFS<sub>VAC<\/sub>&#62;&#62;EFS<sub>vincristine <\/sub>+ EFS<sub>actD <\/sub>+ EFS<sub>cyclophosphamide<\/sub>). The sensitivity of the 40 xenograft models to VAC ranged from Progressive Disease with EFS &#60;42 days to Maintained Complete Response at 140 days. A similar range in sensitivity to VI was observed also, but the correlation between sensitivity to VAC and VI was poor (r=0.375) indicating greater sensitivity of a model to one combination than the other. Ten lines have been selected in vivo for acquired resistance to VAC and VI. Resistance was developed between cycle 2 and cycle 5 of treatment with a mean decrease in EFS of 65 +\/- 15% compared to the EFS on drug cycle 1. In summary, we have characterized the sensitivity of 40 RMS xenograft models to single agents and VAC\/VI combinations and have developed 20 models with acquired resistance to these combinations. Tumor tissue has been obtained from all 40 models and from 20 models with acquired drug resistance. Sequencing of these models is ongoing and preliminary results will be presented.

Therefore, we want to figure out what is the real function of Src in colon cancer cell in this study. HT-29, colon cancer cell with epithelial cell morphology was used in the study. After treated with Dasatinib, cells were followed by reattachment experiment. Then the cell growth, migration ability, signaling pathway transition, molecular localization and expressions were analyzed. The results showed Src inhibition can reduce EGFR activation on cell-cell contacts and increased Akt phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation. We further found Dasatinib has limited effect on cell toxicity, however, can be the selector to separate two cell populations, Dasatinib sensitive (DSTS) and Dasatinib resistance (DSTR) cells, interestingly, the DSTS cells were grown as colony phenotype efficiently and majorly through EGFR\/AKT pathway.

The essential contributions of mitochondrial metabolism to fuel tumor growth and resistance to therapy are now evident in multiple contexts. However, targeting of mitochondrial metabolism in the clinical setting has repeatedly failed, owing to a narrow therapeutic window and the remarkable ability of tumor cells to activate compensatory metabolic programs. Thus, it is essential to uncover additional mechanisms that may render cancer cells selectively susceptible to treatment and those that enable them to survive when exposed to mitochondrial metabolism-targeted drugs. Here, using pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as a disease model, we report that cellular and, in particular, mitochondrial lipid composition affects the sensitivity of cancer cells to pharmacological inhibition of electron transport chain complex I. Metabolomic, including lipidomic, analyses of patient-derived PDAC models uncovered a critical role for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and demonstrated that MUFA-linked ether phospholipids have a critical role to sustain homeostasis of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Blocking de novo ether phospholipid biosynthesis in the peroxisomes, sensitized PDAC cells to mitochondrial complex I inhibition by inducing mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxidation. Biochemical analysis revealed a role of ether phospholipids in the assembly of mitochondrial supercomplexes and ROS production. Together, our data identify an ether phospholipid-dependent mechanism that regulates mitochondrial redox control and contributes to the sensitivity of PDAC cells to complex I inhibition. These findings might lead to novel approaches to target mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Lipid metabolism,monounsaturated fatty acids,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ziheng Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, I-Lin Ho<sup><\/sup>, Melinda Soeung<sup><\/sup>, Er-Yen Yen<sup><\/sup>, Johnathon Rose<sup><\/sup>, Sanjana Srinivasan<sup><\/sup>, Angela Deem<sup><\/sup>, Sisi Gao<sup><\/sup>, Haoqiang Ying<sup><\/sup>, Giulio Draetta<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f6d22e6c-d5ce-4763-b953-ef97a0e53ac8","ControlNumber":"178","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

However, the molecular mechanism of platinum resistance is not fully understood. Here, we compared gene expression between cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cells using gene expression microarray analysis and found the significantly up-regulated expression of <i>SERPINE1<\/i> encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease regulating the fibrinolysis and extracelluar matrix, in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. The correlation of high PAI-1 expression with low cisplatin sensitivity was confirmed in ovarian cancer cells. PAI-1 overexpression in ovarian cancer cells significantly decreased the sensitivity to cisplatin, whereas PAI-1 down-regulation by <i>SERPINE1<\/i> siRNA or PAI-1 inhibitor increased cisplatin sensitivity. PAI-1 inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage. PAI-1 also decreased cisplatin-induced ferroptosis through the upregulation of GPX4 levels. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using TGGA data demonstrated that high PAI-1 expression was significantly associated with shorter platinum-free survival of patients with ovarian cancer. Collectively, these results illustrate that PAI-1 promotes cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells by inhibiting ROS-mediated apoptosis and ferroptosis, suggesting that targeting PAI-1 increases the sensitivity to cisplatin in ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Cisplatin resistance,Ovarian cancer,Reactive oxygen species,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mi Jeong Kwon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ha Yeong Chae<sup>1<\/sup>, So Young Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Shin Ung Kang<sup>1<\/sup>, Tae Woong Jung<sup>2<\/sup>, Soo Youn Cho<sup>3<\/sup>, Jinil Han<sup>4<\/sup>, Hyojin Jeong<sup>5<\/sup>, Chang Ohk Sung<sup>6<\/sup>, Young Kee Shin<sup>7<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>College of Pharmacy, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Gencurix, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>7<\/sup>College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"70b25afb-1c82-4a70-a2a1-de35ae133c00","ControlNumber":"3270","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

PROTAC degraders are able to target crucial proteins traditionally thought to be &#8220;undruggable&#8221;, such as transcriptional factors. Hence, there is increasing interest in these drugs due to their highly efficacy and low off-target toxicity. However, upon further investigation, it has been found that after a period of treatment with PROTAC degraders, cancer cells can acquire resistance to these compounds. Thus, it is of increasing importance to figure out the mechanisms of the resistance and to overcome the acquired resistance to these PROTAC degraders. In our study, we classified resistance mechanisms of prostate cancer cells to PROTAC degraders into two classes and identified factors that can induce them to preferentially develop specific resistance mechanisms.<br \/>Methods and Results: AU-15330 is a PROTAC that specifically degrades the subunits (BRG1, PBRM1, BRM) of SWI\/SNF complex. We treated 22rv1, a prostate cancer cell line, with different AU-15330 concentrations over a month to establish AU-15330-resistant cell lines. Whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis of these resistant cell lines found that the resistant cell lines that were developed through high-dose (1uM) AU-15330 treatment acquired multiple point mutations within or adjacent to the AU-15330 targeting bromodomain of BRG1. However, BRG1 point mutations were absent in the resistant cell lines that developed through lower concentration of AU-15330 treatment (100nM). Instead, RNA-seq analysis revealed that ABCB1 (also known as Multidrug Resistance Protein 1) expression was upregulated in cells that developed resistance to AU-15330 at 100nM. This was further confirmed by Western blot and qPCR. Next, we overexpressed ABCB1 in LNCaP and 22RV1, and found that overexpression of ABCB1 indeed made prostate cancer cells resistant to AU15330. In addition, we tested with several different potent PROTAC degraders (ARD616, ZBC260, etc) in ABCB1-expressing AU-15530 resistant cells, and found the ABCB1 expression drove the cells to become resistant to all tested PROATC degraders compared to the parental cells. Lastly, we demonstrated that Zosuquidar, an ABCB1 inhibitor, can overcome the ABCB1-mediated resistance to AU-15330 and other PROTAC degraders, suggesting that inhibiting ABCB1 might be a direct and effective strategy to restore PROTAC degrader&#8217;s potency when ABCB1-mediated drug resistance is developed.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study found that the mechanisms of resistance of PROTAC degraders can vary and may be dependent on drug concentrations. Such concepts may inform future clinical decision-making regarding drug dosing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,ABC transporters,Mutation detection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tongchen He<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Caleb Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Abhijit Parolia<sup><\/sup>, Alex Hopkins<sup><\/sup>, Yuanyuan Qiao<sup><\/sup>, Lanbo Xiao<sup><\/sup>, Arul Chinnaiyan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e9b719b2-2dc1-4e19-8d9a-aad7a3af2c6c","ControlNumber":"4648","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

The PACC phenotype is a transient state that cancer cells can adopt to protect themselves from stress. PACCs can give rise to non-PACC progeny that maintain resistance to chemotherapy. While PACCs are documented in many cancer types, they have not yet been documented in sarcoma<i>.<\/i> However, we identified PACCs in cell culture from leiomyosarcoma (LMS) patient tumors. The goal of this study was to characterize PACCs in LMS <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>in vivo<\/i>, and in patient samples. When LMS cells grown <i>in vitro<\/i> or in mice were treated with chemotherapy (doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or docetaxel), large cells with atypical nuclei emerged as the predominant cellular phenotype.<i> In vitro<\/i>, these LMS PACCs were more resistant to chemotherapy and repopulated the culture with non-PACC LMS cells, potentially through a process called neosis. PACCs were also identified in clinical samples from patients with LMS. Current efforts are underway to test for a correlation between the amount of PACCs in patient samples and initial response to therapy, as well as long-term patient outcomes. LMS tumors often do not respond to chemotherapy so defining the role of PACCs in LMS may have important clinical implications. LMS PACCs, which are non-dividing cells, may contribute to the lack of response. Identifying therapeutic approaches that target and kill LMS PACCs may improve response to chemotherapy and improve outcomes for patients. LMS tumors have a very high rate of <i>TP53<\/i> loss of function reported to be &#62;90%; <i>TP53<\/i> loss may contribute to the ability of these giant cells to form with such abnormal nuclei. LMS PACCs transfected to express functional <i>TP53<\/i> undergo apoptosis. Additionally, combining functional <i>TP53<\/i> expression with low doses of doxorubicin increases the apoptotic response of LMS cells, potentially by targeting PACCs.

The molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance remain largely unknown and could be amenable to interventions that mitigate resistance. We have recently discovered that several docetaxel resistant mPCa cell lines exhibit less uptake of cellular copper and express markedly higher levels of ATP7B protein without significant changes in the protein expression levels of other copper transporters, such as ATPase copper transporting alpha (ATP7A) and high affinity copper uptake protein 1 (CTR1). Knock-down of ATP7B by silencing RNAs sensitized docetaxel resistant-mPCa cells to the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of docetaxel. Importantly, deletions of ATP7B in mPCa tissues predict significantly better survival of patients after their first chemotherapy than those with wild-type ATP7B (P = 0.0006). In addition, Disulfiram (DSF), an FDA approved drug for treatment of alcohol dependence, in combination with copper, significantly enhanced the in vivo antitumor effects of docetaxel in a docetaxel resistant xenograft tumor model. Our analyses also revealed that DSF and copper engaged with ATP7B to decrease protein levels of COMM domain-containing protein 1 (COMMD1), S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2) and clusterin and markedly increase protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21\/WAF1). Taken together, our results suggest that ATP7B is a clinically relevant and key target for improving the efficacy of docetaxel for treatment of mPCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Docetaxel,Resistance,ATP7B,Copper,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liankun Song<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Vyvyan Nguyen<sup><\/sup>, Jun Xie<sup><\/sup>, Matthew Tippin<sup><\/sup>, Le TP Truong<sup><\/sup>, Christopher  A.

The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as V-ATPase inhibitors has been shown to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in some cancers.<br \/>Material and Method: We investigated the effect of proton pump inhibitors on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, one of the major causes of cancer mortality in Japan. First, three PPIs at various concentrations (lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and bonoprazan) and pyrimidine fluoride (5-FU), a key drug in chemotherapy for esophageal cancer, were used as basic medical agents. Human esophageal squamous cell lines, KYSE50 and KYSE70, were prepared and treated with the above drugs, and cell viability assays were performed using Cell Counting Kit 8 for 72 hours. We then performed a retrospective clinical study of 40 patients with clinical stage IV esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with the drugs at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Hospital in Japan.<br \/>Result: In cell survival assays, PPIs showed significantly enhanced cytotoxic effects of pyrimidine fluoride on all cell lines compared with those not treated with PPIs. Clinical data showed no difference in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events between the PPI and non-PPI groups. The response rate after two courses of chemotherapy was 66.7% in the PPI group and 40.9% in the non-PPI group (p=0.102). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed improved OS in patients treated with PPIs (log rank test p=0.032), and multivariate analysis showed that PPI use was associated with a more favorable OS (p=0.009,HR 0.33,95% CI 0.12-0.76 ).<br \/>Conclusion: In the chemotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the use of PPIs may enhance the cytotoxic effect of the key drug, pyrimidine fluoride, while ensuring safety, and may lead to better therapeutic efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,5-Fluorouracil,Proton ponp inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryuichi Morita<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takeshi Ishikawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Shinya Matsumura<sup>2<\/sup>, Tomoki Sakakida<sup>3<\/sup>, Juichiro Yoshida<sup>4<\/sup>, Toshifumi Doi<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryohei Hirose<sup>1<\/sup>, Ken Inoue<sup>1<\/sup>, Osamu Dohi<sup>1<\/sup>, Naohisa Yoshida<sup>1<\/sup>, Kazuhiko Uchiyama<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomohisa Takagi<sup>1<\/sup>, Hideyuki Konishi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuji Naito<sup>5<\/sup>, Yoshito Itoh<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gastroenterology and Molecular Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Gastroenterology, Kyoto Chubu Medical Center, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Gastroenterology, National Hospital Organization Maizuru Medical Center, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Gastroenterology, Saiseikai Kyoto Hospital, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Biological Nutritional Immunology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"394d7211-88d2-4785-9fd8-c82dac9e7edf","ControlNumber":"2766","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 15-20% of all breast cancers and is an aggressive subtype. Chemotherapy-based treatments remain the standard of care for TNBC. Unfortunately, chemotherapy resistance is common, and for these patients, outcomes are poor and alternative treatment strategies remain an unmet need. circRNAs are a newly identified class of noncoding RNA molecules with covalently closed circular structures. An increasing number of recent studies including ours have indicated that circRNAs play crucial roles in regulating tumor development and chemoresistance. However, the role of circRNAs in the process of chemotherapy resistance and TNBC progression is not clear.<br \/>Materials and Methods: As a first step towards identifying circRNAs that participate in the development of chemoresistance in TNBC cells, and to determine if targeting such circRNAs is a novel and efficacious therapeutic strategy, doxorubicin-resistant (Doxo-R), paclitaxel-resistant (PTX-R), and double-resistant (DP-R) cell lines were generated from MDA-MB-231. Human circRNA microarrays were utilized to profile the expression of approximately 14,000 known circRNAs in normal breast tissue, matched patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generated prior to and following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and TNBC chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines. Top hits were validated using RT-PCR.<br \/>Results: circRNA microarray profiling identified 429 and 310 transcripts differentially expressed in doxorubicin and paclitaxel resistant cells, respectively, compared to parental chemosensitive cell lines (|FC| &#8805; 1.5; p value &#60; 0.05). In comparison to pre-NAC derived xenografts, 1,396 circRNAs were dysregulated among post-NAC PDX models. Further, three circRNAs (hsa_circ_001388, hsa_circ_104652, and hsa_circ_061260) were upregulated in Doxo-R, PTX-R, and post-NAC PDX samples compared to their respective controls. Among these three circRNAs, hsa_circ_001388 (also known as circNSD2) was the only transcript also predicted to be translated into a novel and uncharacterized protein given the presence of a high confidence translation initiation site and IRES sequence. Ongoing studies are aimed at determining the role of circNSD2 protein in breast cancer carcinogenesis, progression, and response to standard of care chemotherapeutics and the mechanistic process by which this protein functions. Additionally, the efficacy of specifically targeting this circRNA as a novel therapeutic approach is being explored.<br \/>Conclusions: Increasing knowledge of the important functions of circRNAs underlying drug resistance will provide new opportunities for developing efficacious therapeutic strategies and prognostic\/predictive biomarkers for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Noncoding RNA,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiyin Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael  J.

One method of chemoresistance employed by cancer cells is accession of the protective polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state, in which cells enter a functionally dormant state upon environmental stress. Entry into the PACC state begins with a whole-genome duplication event followed by endocycling, where the cells are metabolically active and cycling through repeated G1, S and G2 phases of the cell cycle without dividing. While in this state, cells avoid the mitotic stress exerted by common chemotherapeutics and survive therapy, eventually undergoing a depolyploidization process to repopulate the tumor, driving cancer lethality. The mechanisms by which a cancer cell can switch between a mitotic cell cycle and an endocycle are unknown. Cancer is characterized by deregulated cell proliferation, often driven by mutation or amplification of genes that govern the cell cycle. C-myc, an oncogenic transcription factor, is dysregulated in roughly 70% of cancers and is clinically used as a negative prognostic factor for disease-free survival and metastasis. C-myc is responsible for the transcriptional activation of many cell cycle-related genes, and repression of cell cycle inhibitors. Our data indicate that endocycling cells in the PACC state downregulate c-myc expression. Transcriptomic analyses show repression of myc targets, along with supporting protein data that total c-myc protein levels are decreased. While myc downregulation is expected in non-proliferative cells, the compensatory mechanisms mediating the G1\/S transition in the cancer endocycle remain unknown. These observations suggest the presence of underlying mechanisms to reprogram the mitotic cell cycle to access the PACC state. We hypothesize that myc downregulation is essential for cells to activate the cancer endocyle and enter the protective PACC state. Understanding the mechanisms that govern this transition is crucial to generate next-generation cancer therapeutics to block accession or disrupt this state.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,c-Myc,Chemoresistance,Cell cycle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael Loycano<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kenneth  J.

Mechanisms of resistance in these residual tumors may involve rare preexisting clones with mutations, as well as <i>de novo<\/i> development of resistance through various genetic and\/or non-genetic processes. In the context of acute stress resulting from cancer therapeutics, the initial adaptation is essential for tumor cell survival and allows for subsequent development of resistance through additional genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. As an integrator of environmental signals and cellular response, the mTOR pathway is a critical driver of cellular adaptation to environmental changes. In particular, mTOR regulates embryonic diapause, a reversible dormancy state in mammalian development in response to unfavorable environments. Analogous to its role in regulating embryonic diapause, mTOR inhibition may induce a diapause-like state in cancer cells, leading to drug tolerance and persistence of residual tumors following therapy. In line with this notion, recent studies have reported markedly reduced mTOR activity in residual tumors. However, the causal relationship between mTOR inhibition and chemosensitivity has not been investigated. Through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout library screen in pancreatic cancer cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents, we have identified the mTOR pathway as a prominent determinant of chemosensitivity. Pharmacological suppression of mTOR activity in cancer cells from diverse tissue origins leads to the persistence of a reversibly resistant population, which is otherwise eliminated by chemotherapeutic agents. Conversely, activation of the mTOR pathway increases chemosensitivity and predicts better survival among various human cancers. Survival of the persisters is dependent on the regulation of autophagy, G2\/M checkpoint, and cell death pathways, as revealed by a small-molecule chemical library screen. Thus, mTOR plays a causal yet paradoxical role in regulating chemotherapeutic response; inhibition of the mTOR pathway, while suppressing tumor expansion, facilitates the development of a reversible drug-tolerant persister state.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,Drug sensitivity,Senescence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yuanhui Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Nancy Azizian<sup>1<\/sup>, Delaney Sullivan<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Yulin Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2875e99b-964d-425c-9ae5-90cff17542dc","ControlNumber":"2010","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Recent studies identified a reversible stage of cancer cells entering a quiescent state to ensure survival, called drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells. The DTP stage is viewed as a major source of non-genetic drug resistance, while its epigenetic dynamic and regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. To determine the epigenetic activity reminiscent of a quiescent state during DTP development, we evaluated repressive epigenetic modifications during DTP progression and found that DTP cells had a markedly increased H3K27me3 level at the beginning of DTP stage. Treatment of EZH2 inhibitor together with target therapy synergistically inhibited cell growth, indicating the essential role of compressed chromatin structure for DTP survival. To further investigate the epigenomic heterogeneity of DTP cells, we performed single cell ATAC-seq on DTP cells. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the drug-induced DTP cells had two distinct populations compared with the untreated group with only one major population, suggesting an increased epigenomic heterogeneity. By analyzing the differentially accessible regions, motifs for TEADs and GATAs were specifically enriched in DTP cells, whose family members are well-established regulators of the lung development. This raised a possibility that the evolution of drug resistance shares similarities with organ regeneration, both require terminally differentiated cells regaining cell plasticity and serving as a progenitor cell to direct re-differentiation. Thus, we focused on alveolar lineage genes as a model to test our hypothesis that DTP cells hijack conserved developmental pathways for lung regeneration to ensure their survival and subsequent expansion. Our results showed that specific alveolar marker genes were transiently upregulated and exhibited translocation from cytoplasm to nuclei at early phase of DTP. Moreover, deletion of the alveolar lineage gene decreased cell re-growth under drug treatment. Our finding provides a new perspective of anti-relapse therapeutic strategies, that targeting lung lineage pathways to manipulate the activity of critical lineage factors during lung regeneration, for patients with minimal residual disease and relapse after target therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Drug tolerant persisters,Heterogeneity,Epigenomic regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yang Tian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Feng Jiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Athina Jaffer<sup>2<\/sup>, Benjamin Hopkins<sup>3<\/sup>, Jian Jin<sup>4<\/sup>, Hideo Watanabe<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medicine, Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Pulmonary, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f98dcc9a-f1fb-4078-81ca-b29b6f8293b6","ControlNumber":"3796","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

The data suggest that GBP1 knockdown (KD) inhibits the clonogenic potential of cancer cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies including subcutaneous xenograft and intraperitoneal models revealed that GBP1 overexpressing (OV) tumor cells growing faster and reduce the median survival of animals compared to vehicle control (VC). Whereas GBP1 KD tumors were progressing slowly with longer median survival compared to scrambled control (SC). To study the molecular interactions of GBP1, we performed a proteomics-based Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) on GBP1 OV and KD ovarian cancer cells. We found that GBP1 interacts with members of proteasome including PSMB1, PSMB6, PSMA3, and Cytochrome C (CYCS). Protein analysis showed that GBP1 over-expressing cells had less ubiquitinylated proteins compared to VC, whereas GBP1 KD cells accumulate the ubiquitinylated proteins compared to SC. We also found that the GBP1 KD cells are sensitive to paclitaxel treatment and accumulated ubiquitinylated proteins compared to SC. Moreover, GBP1 KD inhibits the overall proteasomal activity. Paclitaxel-treated GBP1 OV cells accumulated the ubiquitination of CYCS, followed by clearance of cytosolic CYCS. Furthermore, global proteome profiling also suggests that GBP1 KD induces apoptotic pathways whereas GBP1 OV induces pathways associated with the stress response. Overall, the results from our studies elucidate the role of GBP1 in chemotherapeutic stress response<i> via<\/i> the activation of proteasomal machinery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Proteasome,GBP1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dhanir Tailor<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fernando Jose Garcia-Marques<sup>2<\/sup>, Abel Bermudez<sup>2<\/sup>, Sharon  J.

Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG), which combines a Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor payload (SN38) with hRS7, an antibody targeting the tumor-selective antigen TROP2, is proving to be a successful cancer therapeutic for some highly refractory cancers including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, mechanisms and biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to SG remain poorly understood. Prior clinical trials have identified positive correlations between TROP2 expression and better outcome for metastatic TNBC patients receiving SG. Additionally, patient-derived specimen analyses by our group identified mutations in both TROP2 and TOP1 in post-progression metastatic lesions, suggesting multifaceted resistance mechanisms.<br \/>To systematically interrogate ADC sensitivity mechanisms, we utilized genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening to identify novel regulators mediating SG sensitivity in human TNBC cells. Interactome analysis of top SG sensitizing hits showed clustered pathways of interest, including DNA repair\/replication, mTORC1\/metabolism, and endosome trafficking\/sorting. The top druggable hit sensitizing to SG was PARP1, encoding the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 that is a key enzyme required for single-strand break repair pathways and for DNA replication fork stability. Conversely, the very top SG resistance-inducing hit in the genome was PARG, encoding the glycohydrolase that opposes PARP enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the synergistic lethality between TOP1 and PARP1 was confirmed in experiments combining SG with PARP inhibitor treatment of TNBC cell lines. In addition, to identify SG\/ADC specific genes and pathways, we performed a secondary round of CRISPR screens using a custom library comprising top hits discovered in the primary screen, treating cells in parallel with either SG or cytotoxic payload SN38 alone. Pathway analysis of genes selectively modulating sensitivity to SG but not SN38 revealed novel mediators involved in TROP2 turnover and recycling. We then performed validation and mechanistic studies to elucidate how specific genetic permutations regulate antibody delivery and sensitivity to SG.<br \/>In conclusion, through a systematic approach using CRISPR screening, we identified several novel resistance and sensitizing pathways that are implicated in ADC delivery and target protein turnover. We are currently prioritizing the druggable genes and pathways in preparation for proof-of-concept studies combining ADCs with select targeted therapeutics to achieve greater tumor killing efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Breast cancer,Drug resistance,CRISPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bogang Wu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sheng Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Nayana Thimmiah<sup>1<\/sup>, Aiko Nagayama<sup>1<\/sup>, James Coates<sup>1<\/sup>, Win Thant<sup>1<\/sup>, David Li<sup>1<\/sup>, John Doench<sup>2<\/sup>, Aditya Bardia<sup>1<\/sup>, Leif Ellisen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a5041f43-e7e9-43c7-939d-c307ad22c3a9","ControlNumber":"2427","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Intra-tumoral bacteria are emerging as a cause of therapy resistance in cancer. In order to determine if intra-tumoral bacteria play a role in the resistance of EGFR-mutant lung cancers to EGFR-TKIs, including osimertinib, we used a bacterial pre-conditioned medium (PCM) screening system which utilized various bacteria identified in lung cancer specimens. We used a cell viability evaluation method in GFP-labeled PC9 cells (EGFR Ex19del) to identify the bacterial PCM that may lead to resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We found that PCM from <i>Chryseobacterium indologenes<\/i> (C-PCM) markedly rescued PC9 from osimertinib. Furthermore, we found that C-PCM also could increase cell viability in other EGFR-mutated cell lines HCC4006, HCC827, and H1650. We found that proteinase K treatment eliminated the rescue of C-PCM on EGFR-TKI treatment, indicating that proteins within C-PCM are responsible for its effect of EGFR-TKI treatment. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis showed that C-PCM does not degrade osimertinib, suggesting that C-PCM mediated resistance does not occur through drug degradation. To understand the mechanism by which C-PCM meditates resistance to osimertinib in NSCLC, we performed phosphor-Receptor Kinase Array to detect changes in phosphorylation between C-PCM and non-C-PCM treatment in PC9 cells. This showed no change in phosphorylation levels of EGFR, indicating that rescue from osimertinib is not through re-activation of EGFR pathway. However, phosphorylation levels of MET and IGF1R were significantly increased when C-PCM was applied to PC9 cells regardless of the presence or absence of osimertinib. Knockdown of IGF1R significantly increased the sensitivity of PC9 cell to osimertinib. Similar results were observed in siMET-PC9 cells. Interestingly, we found that C-PCM lost its ability to rescue PC9 cells from osimertinib when IGF1R was knocked down. Also, inhibition of IGF1R activation by the IGF1R inhibitor linsitinib increased PC9 cell sensitivity to osimertinib, and C-PCM rescue ability decreased with increased linsitinib concentration. Even though MET knockdown increased PC9 cell sensitivity to osimertinib, C-PCM still could increase cell viability with MET knockdown. These results together indicate that activation of IGF1R may be the main pathway that mediates <i>Chryseobacterium indologenes<\/i> resistance to osimertinib. Further mechanistic studies of C-PCM mediated resistance are underway to understand the precise mechanism of bacterial-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance. Additional research on the clinical relevance of these findings may lead to new strategies to overcome EGFR-TKI-resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wendong Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Keqiang Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Aviva Rotter-Maskowitz<sup>2<\/sup>, Deborah Nejman<sup>2<\/sup>, Ravid Straussman<sup>2<\/sup>, Dan Raz<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovol, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3d4fb126-c8ca-4f4a-9884-cfa30ef96071","ControlNumber":"3053","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

However, therapy-resistant, incurable disease invariably develops which remains as the major cause for mortality among prostate cancer patients. Molecular mechanism underlying emergence of resistant prostate cancer is yet to be fully characterized.<br \/>Methods: We developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> cell culture model to mimic the clinical conditions in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. These cells were transcriptionally profiled for gene expression analysis by Illumina Hi-Seq whole genome gene-expression array. Hits were validated by RT-qPCR and Western blot. For clinical correlation, enzalutamide treated prostate PDX models and surgical tumors (warm autopsy) from prostate cancer patients were comprehensively analyzed. Regulation and role of new hits were determined by treating cells and xenograft tumors with lentiviral-based shRNAs followed by analysis of cell viability, apoptosis, and effects on downstream targets. Pro-cancer effects were analyzed by cell proliferation, invasion, and soft-agar colony formation assays.<br \/>Results: We identified that the Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (ERPC) cells. Elevated level of TRIB2 was also observed in enzalutamide treated PDX tumors, and in prostate tumors from patients who developed enzalutamide resistant metastatic disease. Interestingly, TRIB2 protein level is especially higher in prostate cancer cells and tumors, where the AR activity is low or absent due to genetic changes. Transfection and overexpression of TRIB2 results in aggressive prostate cancer cell growth and resistance to enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, and abiraterone. Furthermore, TRIB2 overexpression results in trans-differentiation in prostate cancer cells including neurite outgrowth and adeno-to-neuroendocrine lineage transition. Curiously, we found that TRIB2 downregulates luminal markers (AR, CK8), but upregulates the neuroendocrine markers (CHGA, NSE, SYP). Knockdown of TRIB2 triggers loss of neuroendocrine features, reduces viability of ERPC cells, and sensitize them back to enzalutamide, suggesting that TRIB2 plays a direct role in neuroendocrine differentiation and therapeutic resistance. We also found that TRIB2 upregulates the master neuronal transcription factor, BRN2, and the stemness factor, SOX2, and inhibition of either BRN2 or SOX2 re-sensitizes ERPC cells to enzalutamide.<br \/>Conclusion: These findings reveal that TRIB2 is a novel driver for lineage plasticity and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer cells and greatly contributes to enzalutamide resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine differentiation,Enzalutamide,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jitender Monga<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Craig Rogers<sup>1<\/sup>, Shirish Gadgeel<sup>2<\/sup>, Dhananjay Chitale<sup>3<\/sup>, Jagadananda Ghosh<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Urology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>Oncology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI,<sup>4<\/sup>Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7302aaa5-d90a-4b4a-8ef0-6c2b1249cc45","ControlNumber":"3231","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Morbidity and mortality associated with ovarian cancer will continue to impact the female population. Although cisplatin centered chemotherapy is the first line anticancer agent for human ovarian cancer, chemoresistance and adverse side effects remain major hurdles to successful treatment. The effective targets for cancer therapy must be desirably expressed differentially in particular cancers as compared with normal cells. Also, there should be an essential dependence of cancer cells on the target compared to non malignant cells. Ideally, the target should be understood in the context of existing biochemical and signaling frameworks known to play a direct role in a particular carcinogenesis or in regulating the response to therapy. In the context of striking chemo radiotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer and the fundamental role of RLIP as an important mercapturic acid pathway transporter that is essential for survival and therapy resistance in cancers, we investigated the role of RLIP in regulating the critical signaling proteins involved in relaying the inputs from multiple upstream survival pathways and mechanisms contributing to chemo radiotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer. Compounds that inhibit, deplete, or downregulate RLIP will function as wide spectrum agents to treat ovarian cancer, independent of common signaling pathway mutations. Here, we demonstrate that RLIP expression is significantly greater in ovarian cancer cells than in non malignant cells, and RLIP is an essential requirement for cancer formation, and its depletion or inhibition will prevent ovarian carcinogenesis as well as metastases. Taken together, the results of our studies provided insights into a novel anticancer effect of RLIP depletion\/inhibition on ovarian cancer and might open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

We have studied the clonal emergence of resistance to targeted and cytotoxic chemotherapy in osteosarcoma barcoded cell lines derived from patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, in order to verify if short macroevolutionary jumps occur, as a consequence of chromosomal instability, leading to subclonal diversification after chemotherapy treatment.<br \/>Methods: We have previously shown in our barcoded PDX models that, by applying selective pressure with methotrexate (MTX) IC<sub>95<\/sub> treatment,<sub> <\/sub>a clonal subpopulations more resistant to MTX emerges. Preliminary data from Next-Gen sequencing of the genomic DNA extracted from the vehicles and selected clones have shown a wide variability of barcode abundance in the clones and the vehicles. Interestingly a reduced barcode abundance was observed in the clonal subpopulations as compared to the vehicles. Also, a wide range of clonal diversity was observed among the different clones and the vehicles, being high in the M17 PDX and its clones, and low in the OS252 PDX and its derived clones. Functional assays of MTX transport were performed by measuring the cellular uptake of [3H] MTX as previously described (Matherly L. Cancer Res. 1991) in both PDXs and derived clones. Our observations show that [3H] MTX uptake was affected differently in PDXs and derived clones, highlighting a wide variability in MTX transport, possibly due to different mutations in the reduced folate carrier (RFC) gene in different clones. In some of these clones, resistance to MTX might also be due to alterations in other genes involved in MTX cytotoxic activity (DHFR, FPGS, GGH).<br \/>Results: By applying selective pressure with MTX to PDX derived cell lines we obtained clones whose genomic DNA has been studied with NGS technique. The results obtained by performing the functional assay of MTX transport on both PDXs and derived clones showed a wide variability in the MTX uptake, further supporting the initial hypothesis. Sequencing will allow us to study if there are mutations in the RFC gene and\/or in other genes involved in MTX resistance in all the PDXs and derived clones. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) will suggest the pathway alterations that may be associated with the emergence of resistance. Conclusion - Barcoded PDX derived osteosarcoma cell lines have been created with resistant clones obtained after MTX treatment. Sequencing of the RFC gene and other genes involved in resistance to MTX, and RNA-Seq profiling will yield critical information on the clonality and mechanisms of resistance which will be presented.<br \/>Acknowledgments: This work was funded by Swim Across America, the Foster Foundation, and the Barbara Epstein Foundation.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-02 Drug transport and metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Transporters,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Giuseppe Longo<sup>1<\/sup>, Sylvester Jusu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Zhongting Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zhaohui Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Wendong Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Roth<sup>1<\/sup>, Rui Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Douglas Harrison<sup>1<\/sup>, Massimo Libra<sup>3<\/sup>, Amer Najjar<sup>4<\/sup>, Jonathan Gill<sup>4<\/sup>, Richard Gorlick<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>The Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>International Program in Basic and Applied Biomedical Sciences, University of Catania, Catania, Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Pediatrics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"be9dd775-7708-4343-b39b-25cd5674b295","ControlNumber":"4674","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.
