[{"Abstract":"Small Molecule-Drug Conjugates (SMDCs) are anti-cancer pro-drugs composed by a tumor-targeting small organic ligand, a linker structure and a potent cytotoxic payload. OncoFAP is an ultra-high affinity ligand of Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP), a stromal protein overexpressed in multiple types of solid human malignancies. Nuclear medicine studies validated the applicability of the OncoFAP technology for tumor-targeting applications in a wide variety of tumor types. We have recently reported the development of SMDC products in which OncoFAP is used to deliver Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE) to tumors, exploiting linkers that are selectively cleaved by FAP. Here we describe the generation and <i>in vivo <\/i>characterization of novel OncoFAP-based SMDC products bearing potent camptothecin derivatives acting as topoisomerase I inhibitors. Those drug payloads have been already included in approved ADC products (Enhertu<sup>TM<\/sup> and Trodelvy<sup>TM<\/sup>). The FAP-cleavable linker technology was directly compared against linker strategies used for approved ADCs. Therapy results in preclinical xenograft models of solid tumors revealed that SMDC products activated by FAP show superior anti-cancer activity and deserve industrial development for the treatment of various human solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor targeting,Tumor microenvironment,Small molecule drugs,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matilde Bocci<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Samuele Cazzamalli<sup><\/sup>, Dario Neri<sup><\/sup>, Andrea Galbiati<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Philochem AG, Otelfingen, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"63d6f266-9fe5-4e1c-9f15-0b1703f4b121","ControlNumber":"6070","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Our results reveal that both targeted ADC and SMDC products mediate potent anti-cancer activity and complete tumour remission in a FAP-positive preclinical murine model of cancer, when administered at the same molar dose. Non-targeted albumin and antibody conjugates included in our comparative studies delayed tumour growth but presented suboptimal anti-cancer efficacy in the same cancer model.

DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DELs) can be used to discover novel binders and to improve binding affinity of existing small organic ligands by affinity maturation procedures. OncoFAP is a 680 pM inhibitor of the stromal pan-tumoral antigen Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP). OncoFAP displays best-in-class tumor targeting performance in patients, although its relatively short half-life limits the applicability as radioligand therapeutic against solid malignancies. We designed three focused affinity maturation DELs, containing 50,730 compounds bearing two sets of building blocks coupled to a propargylglycine central scaffold.

The high affinity FAP ligands described here enable the efficient delivery of therapeutic radionuclides to tumors with long residence time and with low uptake in normal tissues.

Mainly, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, about 80% of cases) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC, about 20% of cases) are the major types of lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma (30-50%) and squamous cell carcinoma (30%) are the major subtypes of NSCLC. Even though there are considerable advancements in the drugs against lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate is meager. Unfortunately, the drug resistance for currently available anticancer drugs results in a 5-year survival of only 5%. The remarkable lung cancer recurrence despite definitive local and\/or systemic therapy indicate that residual cancer stem cells (CSCs) possess tumorigenic potential. Therefore, drugs targeting the CSCs and killing them quickly can cure lung cancer without any relapse and improve the 5-year survival rate. Herein, we present the application of the recently reported ID-Checker technology (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2022 65 (19), 12883-12894) for killing lung cancer stem cells (LCSC). The ID-Checker that is decorated with the glucose tag allows highly specific absorption and macroscale delivery of anticancer drugs to the LCSC through the GLUT channels. ID-Checker inhibits the microtubule formation resulting in the cell cycle arrest in the G2\/M phase followed by apoptosis. The inhibition of microtubule formation by ID-Checker also leads to the inhibition of GLUT channel deployment in the LCSC. Thus, the glucose-deprived LCSC undergoes apoptosis within 72 hours of ID-Checker treatment. Hence, we believe the ID-Check technology presented here can kill the LCSC and completely cure lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,Lung cancer,Drug design,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Keum-soo Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Satish Balasaheb Nimse<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Taisun Kim<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biometrix Technology, Inc., Chuncheon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Hallym University, Chuncheon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ccea04df-3f7f-4bff-a5d7-835cf036507d","ControlNumber":"4310","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

The survival rate decreases significantly for patients who develop OS lung metastasis (OSLM).<br \/><b>P<\/b><b>urpose: <\/b>To assess the safety and efficacy of colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor (CSF-1Ri) (Pexidartinib; PLX) in shifting the OSLM tumor microenvironment (TME) to an anti-tumorigenic state upon local delivery to lungs of a syngeneic mouse model of OSLM.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The safety of PLX upon repeated pulmonary administration (9 doses, every other day at 2 mg\/kg) in healthy BALB\/c mice was assessed using health scoring, pulmonary mechanics, molecular and cellular composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), blood count and plasma biochemistry, and H&#38;E of lungs and liver. To establish the OSLM model, murine OS cells, expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent genes (K7M2-Luc-tdT), were used. Mice bearing OSLM were randomized into two groups (vehicle and PLX) and treated over 3 weeks. Tumor burden was evaluated using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and lung weight. The treatment impact on the abundance and phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their CSF-1R expression as well as on the abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and their expression to PD-1 were investigated using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and western blot.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>PLX is well tolerated upon local lung administration with all safety markers indicating no alteration compared to na&#239;ve and vehicle controls. Treatment did not affect health scores. We did not detect any functional or mechanical alteration on the lungs or systemically (including liver); no marked differences in pulmonary function parameters, proinflammatory cytokines, nor infiltrating differential cell count obtained from BALF were observed. Both total blood count and liver enzymes were within normal range. As a measure of efficacy, treatment with PLX via local lung administration reduced tumor burden, indicated by the <i>in vivo <\/i>BLI and lung weight. Notably, PLX significantly decreased the abundance of total TAMs, with a more pronounced effect on pro-tumorigenic alternatively-activated (M2-like) TAMs phenotype, thus leading to a 22-fold increase in M1\/M2 ratio. PLX further led to a marked decrease in tumor-promoting T regulatory cells (Treg), increase in the CD8\/Treg ratio, and decrease in PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> percentage in CD8 T cells in the TME, indicating a shift to a more immunogenic tumor phenotype.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We demonstrated that repeated doses of<b> <\/b>PLX is safe upon local delivery to the lungs of murine model of OSLM, with no alternations in lungs or liver tissue. We further showed that PLX reduces tumor burden, which correlates with a change in the immune phenotype of the OSLM toward a more anti-tumorigenic profile. These results are clinically relevant as PLX has been approved by the FDA, thus opening opportunities for its repurposing to support standard of care therapy in OSLM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Lung metastasis,Immunotherapy,Local drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fatemah  S.

DEB-TACE elicits ischemic cell death in the embolized tumor while simultaneously delivering a local, sustained release of chemotherapy. We hypothesize that the application of DEBs loaded with an immunostimulatory adjuvant in the DEB-TACE procedure will promote local antigen presenting cells to utilize the antigens released by dying tumor cells to generate a systemic, adaptive anti-tumor immune response. This approach represents a novel form of transarterial immunoembolization (TIE). 558 is a highly potent, small molecule Toll-like receptor 7\/8 agonist that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses to eliminate tumor cells in various preclinical tumor models. Hydrogel microspheres composed of cross-linked sulfobutylether-&#946;-cyclodextrin (SBE-&#946;CD) were investigated as DEBs for 558 in the current study. SBE-&#946;CD hydrogel microspheres (SBE-&#946;CDMS) of 10 - 300 &#956;m diameter were synthesized via suspension polymerization of SBE-&#946;CD and ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether followed by wet sieving. 558 loading was achieved by incubating blank SBE-&#946;CDMS in aqueous solutions of 558. Under non-saturating conditions, SBE-&#946;CDMS absorbed almost the entirety of 558 from loading solutions in 4 h. The dose of 558 loaded in SBE-&#946;CDMS was tuned by altering the initial amount of 558 in solution, up to a maximum loading of 0.28 mg 558\/mg dry SBE-&#946;CDMS determined under saturating conditions. The time to 50% release of 558 from loaded SBE-&#946;CDMS was less than 30 min when phosphate buffered saline was used as release media. However, the release of 558 was negligible when deionized water was used as release media. The released drug was as effective as free 558 in stimulating cytokine response from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. As a surrogate for TIE, we evaluated plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics upon intratumoral injection of 558-loaded SBE-&#946;CDMS (50 - 100 &#956;m diameter) or free 558 at a dose of 100 &#956;g in C57BL\/6 mice bearing B16F10-OVA flank tumors. The gradual release of 558 from loaded SBE-&#946;CDMS prevented an initial spike in plasma concentration that was observed for mice administered with free 558, and maintained constant tumor concentrations for at least 4 h post-injection. High-resolution MALDI mass spectrometry imaging of 15 &#956;m-thick tumor cryosections indicated that 558 was initially concentrated within SBE-&#946;CDMS after intratumoral injection, and extensively released into the surrounding tumor tissue 24 h post-injection. Taken together, these results suggest that 558-loaded SBE-&#946;CDMS are a promising platform for local drug delivery and immune cell stimulation via TIE.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Drug delivery,Immunostimulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joel Updyke<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shubhmita Bhatnagar<sup>2<\/sup>, Nitu Bhaskar<sup>2<\/sup>, Rachel Parise<sup>2<\/sup>, Swati Nagar<sup>2<\/sup>, John Schultz<sup>3<\/sup>, David Ferguson<sup>3<\/sup>, Tamara Kucaba<sup>4<\/sup>, Thomas Griffith<sup>4<\/sup>, Ronald Siegel<sup>1<\/sup>, Jayanth Panyam<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pharmaceutics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,<sup>2<\/sup>Pharmaceutics, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN,<sup>4<\/sup>Urology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5da3f145-674e-4d45-9f61-3ef36cff2894","ControlNumber":"2278","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

More than 15% of ovarian cancer patients have a defective BRCA-mediated homologous recombination repair pathway that can be therapeutically targeted with PARP inhibitors, such as Talazoparib (TLZ). The expansion of TLZ clinical approval beyond breast cancer has been hindered due to the highly potent systemic side effects resembling chemotherapeutics. Here we report the development of a novel TLZ-loaded PLGA implant (InCeT-TLZ) that sustainedly releases TLZ over 25 days directly into the peritoneal cavity (i.p.) to treat BRCA-mutated metastatic ovarian cancer (mOC).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>InCeT-TLZ was fabricated by dissolving TLZ and PLGA in chloroform followed by extrusion and evaporation. Drug loading and release were confirmed by HPLC. The detailed structure of InCeT-TLZ was checked by scanning electron microscopy. The in vivo therapeutic efficacy of InCeT-TLZ was carried out in a murine <i>Brca2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>p53<sup>R172H\/-<\/sup>Pten<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> genetically engineered peritoneally metastatic ovarian cancer model. Treatment started 7 days post tumor inoculation. All mice were monitored by IVIS imaging once a week to confirm and track tumor growth. On day 8, mice with tumors (4-5 mm in diameter) were divided into 4 groups: PBS i.p. injection (50 &#956;l, three times a week), empty implant i.p. implantation (2.5 mm, every 25 days), TLZ i.p. injection (0.33 mg\/kg of TLZ by i.p. injection three times a week), and InCeT-TLZ i.p. implantation (2.5 mm, equal to a total amount of 10 i.p. injection doses, every 25 days). Body weight was recorded three times a week as an indicator of treatment tolerance and efficacy. Mice were sacrificed when the body weight increased by 50% of the initial weight.<br \/><b>Results and Conclusion: <\/b>The drug-loaded PLGA implant was developed for the sustained and local delivery of TLZ to treat high-grade serous ovarian cancer with a loading efficiency of 26.75 &#956;g\/mm. Implants can be easily placed into the peritoneal cavity of patients or animals with an 18-gauge clinical needle. The extended survival in InCeT-TLZ treated mice compared to the TLZ injection group indicated that the slow release of TLZ maximizes PARP inhibitor therapy in the peritoneal cavity for disseminated cancer treatment. Decrease in ascites formation within the intraperitoneal cavity of the InCeT-TLZ group suggests a promising treatment for ovarian cancer-associated ascites and disease progression. Histopathology following peritoneal InCeT-TLZ implantation showed no toxicity in any surrounding organs at risk. This approach would offer new sustained therapy options for substantially enhancing the therapeutic window, increasing cure rates, reducing mortality and suffering, and offering major enhancements in quality of life for the thousands of women diagnosed with OC yearly.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Ovarian cancer,BRCA,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shicheng Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Needa Brown<sup>2<\/sup>, Abigail  L.

NETs consist of smooth filaments composed of stacked nucleosomes. Fully hydrated NETs have a cloud-like appearance and occupy a space 10-15-fold larger than the volume of the cells they originate from. DNases are the enzymes that cleave extracellular DNA including NETs. Together with their protective role in microbial infections, NETs are involved in multiple pathological processes and represent key events in a variety of pathologies including cancer, autoimmunity, and cardiovascular disease. Sites of NETs concentration are dangerous for the host if the process of NETs formation becomes chronic or the mechanism of NETs removal does not work. NETosis has been linked to the development of periodontitis, cystic fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 or rheumatoid arthritis as well as cancer progression.<br \/><b>Purpose:<\/b> Thus, the destruction of NETs is of primary significance in many pathologies. In our approach, we are focusing on mimicking one of the natural mechanisms of destroying excessive NETs by delivering deoxyribonuclease I to the specific site of pathological NETs accumulation by modifying the nanoparticles using an anti-nucleosome monoclonal antibody (2C5). The antibody is specific to nucleosomes and can recognize histones in NETs. DNase I is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved active component and is commonly used in therapeutic methods of modern medicine for cystic fibrosis to clear extracellular DNA fibers in the lungs and systemic lupus erythematosus. Recent findings have also shown the effectiveness of DNase I in the digestion of NETs. However, the low serum stability and fast deactivation by environmental stimuli have been considered as the limiting factors for clinical applications of DNase I, which can be overcome by its targeted specific delivery in pharmaceutical nanocarriers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this study, we generate NETs <i>in vitro<\/i> using human neutrophils and HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocyte-like cells. We used interleukin-8, lipopolysaccharide from <i>E.Coli <\/i>(LPS), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and calcium ionophore A23187 (CI) to generate the NETs. We confirmed the specificity of 2C5 toward NETs by ELISA, which showed that it binds to NETs with the specificity like that for purified nucleohistone substrate. We further utilized that feature to create two delivery systems (liposomes and micelles) for DNAse I enzyme to destroy NETs, which was confirmed by staining NETs with SYTOX Green dye and followed by flow cytometric measurements and microscopic images.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our results suggest that 2C5 could be used to identify and visualize NETs and serve as a ligand for NET-targeted diagnostics and therapies. Also, we proved that our carrier can successfully deliver DNase to NETs to provide their degradation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,DNA,Monoclonal antibodies,Liposomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nina Filipczak<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiang Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Gaurav Rajan Saawant<sup>1<\/sup>, Diptanshu Pardeshi<sup>1<\/sup>, Bharat Ashok Rajmalani<sup>1<\/sup>, Satya Siva Kishan Yalamarty<sup>1<\/sup>, Vladimir  P.

However, it is not curative, and ADT has significant systemic effects including hot flashes, osteoporosis, anemia, etc. We sought to identify agents that would inhibit AR signaling without causing these systemic effects. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are attractive agents because they impede AR signaling and DNA damage repair in PCa and show epigenetic modifications in prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression. This study demonstrated romidepsin as an alternative to ADT and the development of a romidepsin encapsulated CSPC PCa targeted nanoparticle for PCa cell killing and growth inhibition without the toxicity associated with free romidepsin or ADT.<br \/><b>Materials\/Methods:<\/b><b> <\/b>Three PCa cell lines, LNCaP, 22Rv1 and PC3 that express different androgen receptor (AR) levels were used for this study.

We developed a poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and 1, 2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-polyethylene glycol (DSPE-PEG) polymer-lipid nanoparticle coated with vipivotide tetraxetan(PSMA-617) for prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting.

HPLC showed nanoparticle encapsulated romidepsin of 0.7%wt and TEM\/DLS\/NTA showed a size of 130 &#177;20nm. Furthermore, PSMA-617 coated nanoparticles exhibited enhanced uptake in LNCaP cells compared to non-coated nanoparticles.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our study showed that the romidepsin has a dual effect on inhibiting AR signaling as well as downregulating DNA damage repair genes.

Among the various subtypes, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer shows a very aggressive and invasive phenotype. This subtype is characterized by the overexpression of HER2 receptor on the cell surface that upon ligand binding and dimerization, leads to overactive cell signaling that promotes cell proliferation and metastasis. Even though therapies have been developed to treat this type of breast cancer by targeting HER2 and preventing dimerization (eg. Trastuzumab), patients can present with acquired or intrinsic therapy resistance. One of the mechanisms of resistance is the compensation of intracellular signaling from other receptors. This signaling converges on guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that activate Rac and Cdc42 by exchanging GDP for GTP, thus activating downstream effectors that modulate the actin cytoskeleton to promote cell migration and invasion. Therefore, targeting Rac and Cdc42 activation selectively in HER2 positive breast cancer is a promising strategy for overcoming HER2-targeted therapy resistance. Previously, we characterized the dual Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitor MBQ-167 that inhibits Rac and Cdc42 activity with IC50s of 103nM and 78nM, respectively. However, there is a need to develop selective delivery systems that transport MBQ-167 directly into HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Our objective is to deliver MBQ-167 selectively into HER2-positive cells using liposomes coated with Trastuzumab, a clinically used monoclonal antibody that targets HER2. We conjugated Trastuzumab to a lipid linker (DSPE-PEG-Maleimide) by reacting Trastuzumab with 2-iminothiolane (Traut&#8217;s reagent) under nitrogenated (low oxygen) conditions and then mixing with the lipid linker overnight. This reaction was characterized by measuring the thiol groups formed after the reaction with Traut&#8217;s reagent and after mixing with the lipid, followed by mixing the Trastuzumab-lipid conjugate with liposomes containing MBQ-167. To quantify the amount of MBQ-167 in the liposomes, we determined the excitation\/emission parameters of the molecule and measured the concentration of MBQ-167 by fluorescence. We found an increase in thiol groups after the reaction with Traut&#8217;s reagent, which decreased after mixing with the lipids, suggesting the formation of the DSPE-PEG-Trastuzumab conjugate.

Despite advances in the different methods of therapy, the prognosis for GBM has not improved through the years and, thus, alternative treatment methods for GBM are needed. Minocycline (MINO) is known as a semi-synthetic tetracycline that serves as an antibiotic and has also been shown to be able to suppress angiogenesis for GBM treatment. Collected from brown seaweed, alginate is a biodegradable polysaccharide that can be used to form a hydrogel for drug delivery due to its biocompatibility properties. Injectable alginate scaffolds may be a promising component for an adjuvant treatment method against GBM as the injectability property of the scaffold will allow for the site of interest to be filled precisely after tumor resection. The objective of this study is to develop injectable alginate scaffolds for the delivery of MINO for the treatment of GBM. The effects of the concentration of sodium alginate (SA) and calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3<\/sub>) (i.e., 0.75, 1.00, 1.50, and 2.00 wt.\/vol.%) with a 0.25 wt.\/vol.% of glucono-delta lactone (GDL) on the pH, gelation time, dimensions, degradation, and drug release kinetics of alginate scaffolds were investigated. Injectable alginate scaffolds were fabricated by dissolving SA and CaCO<sub>3<\/sub> (1:1) in water, homogenized with GDL for 20 sec., and then injected into a 24-well plate to develop uniform scaffolds. Their properties were evaluated by testing pH values via a pH meter, timing gelation with a digital timer, utilizing a digital microcaliper to investigate dimensions, an analytical scale to evaluate the mass of dried scaffolds to determine scaffold degradation, and evaluating the release rate of MINO using a microplate reader at a wavelength of 350 nm. As the concentration of SA and CaCO<sub>3<\/sub> increased, an increase in pH, gelation time, and overall stability of the scaffold were observed. All four concentrations of SA and CaCO<sub>3<\/sub> tested resulted in scaffolds with desired pH and workable gelation time; however, the 1 wt.\/vol.% group may be the most ideal as an optimal pH was reached after 10 minutes and the gelation time for these scaffolds was ~8 minutes. Lower concentration scaffolds (0.75 and 1.00 wt.\/vol.%) degraded faster in comparison to those made with higher concentrations. Drug release kinetics data revealed that the scaffolds can sustain short term release but could be improved by incorporating the drug into micro or nanoparticles before incorporation into the scaffolds. In conclusion, the injectable alginate scaffolds developed in this study may be promising biomaterials for the delivery of drugs for GBM treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Temozolomide,Antiangiogenic agents,Glioblastoma multiforme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kaitlyn D.

EV membrane-associated integrins show organotrophic properties by interacting with microenvironmental stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Specifically, integrin &#945;V&#946;5 is associated with the metastasis of cancers with remarkable liver tropism, including pancreatic cancer, uveal melanoma, and colorectal cancer. Despite the importance of understanding the pathogenic roles of EVs, EV heterogeneity, lengthy isolation, and low yields make it difficult to study the function of EVs at the molecular level. Therefore, we explored engineering EV-like lipid nanoparticles with selected cargo, such as integrin &#945;V&#946;5, as a tool to study EV biology.<br \/>Methods: EV-like liposomes (in terms of size and charge) have been produced by our group by nanoprecipitation. Aqueous solvent (proteins in Milli-Q water) and organic solvent (cholesterol and DMPC in ethanol) were mixed in a 3D-printed microfluidic chip. Recombinant integrin &#945;V&#946;5 was purchased from R&#38;D System and encapsulated into the liposomes in one step. Liposomes with recombinant GFP protein (Thermo Fisher) and liposomes with cellular proteins isolated from 92.1 and A431 cells were produced as proof of concept. Liposomes were produced with dye SP-DilC18 or labelled by PKH after production. Unencapsulated proteins and unbound dye was removed by ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography (qEV, Izon). Stain-free gel (Biorad), flow cytometry, and Tecan Reader were used to detect encapsulated proteins. Hepatocyte uptake of liposomes was analyzed by Incucyte. The liposomes were characterized by transmission emission microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis, and dynamic light scattering.<br \/>Results: Liposomes with and without protein cargo presented a bi-layer lipid membrane by cryoTEM. 92.1 cellular protein, A431 cellular protein, GFP, and integrin &#945;V&#946;5 encapsulated by liposomes were detected by stain-free gel. Positive signals from GFP encapsulated by liposomes were detected by flow cytometry and Tecan Reader, indicating encapsulated proteins can remain functional. By Incucyte fluorescence microscopy, we analyzed the uptake of liposomes by hepatocytes and found that different sizes and charges affect the uptake efficiency.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we produced EV-like liposomes with lipid bilayers in a controllable way in terms of size, charges, and functional cargo. We showed that EV-like liposomes could be a novel and easy-to-use model to study the role of specific EV cargo in cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Integrins,Liver,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yunxi Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rubén  R.

STING agonists have shown great potential in preclinical studies, but they are not applicable for most patients due to limited systemic delivery. Therefore, we designed a positively charged liposome loaded with STING agonist (PoSTING) for systemic delivery of STING agonists and to selectively target tumor immunity and tumor vasculature.<br \/>Method: We designed PoSTING using 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), 18:0 PEG2000 PE (PEG-PE), and 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The properties and stability of PoSTING were evaluated by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography. PoSTING (1 mg\/kg) was administered intravenously to Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-bearing mouse models every three days. Tumor tissues were comprehensively analyzed by histologic, flow cytometric, and Nanostring immune profiling assays.<br \/>Results: PoSTING efficiently loaded 88.5% of STING agonists. The average particle size was 198.4 nm, which avoided clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system. PoSTING could fuse with cell membrane of target cells due to a positive surface charge (+44.53 mV). Stability tests found that PoSTING could be stored at 4&#176;C for 12 weeks and remained stable in serum for a week. Intravenously administered PoSTING selectively accumulated in LLC tumor tissues and suppressed tumor growth. In particular, PoSTING was preferentially accumulated in tumor endothelial cells and perivascular cells, and suppressed tumor angiogenesis and normalized abnormal tumor vasculatures. PoSTING also increased expression levels of P-selectin, which is involved in endothelial-lymphocyte interactions and prepares tumor vessels for lymphocyte trafficking. PoSTING induces type I IFN responses in antigen-presenting cells, tumor ECs, and cancer cells, and promotes intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells by remodeling tumor microenvironment. In addition, PoSTING significantly upregulated genes related to type I\/II IFNs, Th1\/Th2 responses, innate\/adaptive immunity, and chemokines.<br \/>Conclusion: PoSTING is a novel and stable systemic delivery platform that effectively and selectively delivers STING agonists to tumor tissue, triggering vascular normalization and immune reprogramming.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liposomes,Drug delivery,Vascular targeting,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eun-Jin Go<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Wooram Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Won suk Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, So Jung Kong<sup>1<\/sup>, Seung Joon Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Keun Han<sup>3<\/sup>, Hong Jae Chon<sup>1<\/sup>, Chan Kim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>CHA Bundang Medical Center, Seongnam-si, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>CHA University, Seongnam-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"36cb32f2-5ee0-41b9-8038-307fc0b92080","ControlNumber":"3259","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

The RCC&#8217;s standard treatments are including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib) was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 to treat advanced RCC. According to the results from the clinical trial, sunitinib is associated with a higher objective response rate and survival rate than IFN-&#945;, which indicates that it is an effective multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKi) against advanced RCC. Meanwhile, recent studies demonstrated sunitinib could cause tumor immune surveillance by upregulated autophagy to inhibit tumor PD-L1 expression. However, sunitinib targets not only tumor tissue but also multiple organs in the human body, which causes many serious side effects and even leads to death. In order to reduce the toxicity of sunitinib, our group design a novel nanocarrier by PEGylated liposome to encapsulate sunitinib (lipo-sunitinib). The PEGylated liposome could passively target tumor tissue by extravasation of nanoparticles through increased permeability of the tumor vasculature (enhanced permeability and retention, EPR effect). Moreover, the PEGylation on the liposome surface could prolong liposome half-life in the body through increased particle size. Through the EPR effect and PEGylation of lipo-sunitinib to target tumor cells precisely, we successfully increased RCC orthotopic tumor inhibition in mouse models compared with vehicle and sunitinib groups. Furthermore, the RCC tumor immunofluorescence staining revealed lipo-sunitinib had higher activated effector T cells (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>IL-2<sup>+<\/sup>IFN-&#947;<sup>+<\/sup>) and type 1 dendritic cells (CD11c<sup>+<\/sup>CD24<sup>+<\/sup>MHCII<sup>+<\/sup>) infiltration and lower vessel formation than sunitinib group. The flow cytometry also demonstrated that lipo-sunitinib had increased anti-tumor immune cells and inhibited immune suppressors in the systemic system. More importantly, lipo-sunitinib showed lower toxicity in mouse livers, hearts, and kidneys compared to the sunitinib group. Our results suggested lipo-sunitinib could inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival rate by modulating a positive anti-tumor microenvironment and anti-angiogenesis effects. In sum, with the polish of the delivery system, our novel nanodrug lipo-sunitinib could be a potential new treatment strategy for RCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Liposomes,Sunitinib,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Po-Fu Yueh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuan Chang<sup>2<\/sup>, Keng-Li Lan<sup>1<\/sup>, Fei-Ting Hsu<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institute of Traditional Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Taipei City, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medical Imaging, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, New Taipei City, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical Univ., Taichung City, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8a3aecfd-22a3-4f39-b575-38de275b74fc","ControlNumber":"886","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Both cell lines were exposed to two different liposome preparations loaded with 3 mol% doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), a MM targeted CLENs preparation of 95% DOPC and 5 mol% RPMI-8226 cell lipid extract (LE) and a non-specific, 100 % DOPC liposome. Liposome preparations were separated from free drug by centrifugation and overnight dialysis. Following overnight liposome exposure, the CyQUANT<sup>TM<\/sup> LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Invitrogen) was utilized to assess extracellular LDH activity and evaluate cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded RPMI-8226 LE <i>in vitro. <\/i><br \/>Results: The mean diameter for the DOX-loaded DOPC (100%) and DOPC\/LE (95\/5) nanoliposomes was 203 &#177; 24.3 nm (n=4) and 235 &#177; 24.6 nm (n=4), respectively. The average zeta potential was -15.79 &#177; 0.33 mV (n=2) and 0.26 &#177; 0.19 mV (n=2) for DOPC (100%) and DOPC\/LE (95\/5), respectively. The mean percent of doxorubicin incorporated into DOPC (100%) and DOPC\/LE (95\/5) was 72% (n=4) and 84% (n=4), respectively. Following overnight exposure of RPMI 8226 cells to DOX-loaded DOPC (100%) and DOX-loaded DOPC\/LE (95\/5) at 50 nM and 150 nM, preliminary results showed that the inclusion of LE significantly improved cytotoxicity when compared to the DOX-loaded DOPC control. Additionally, DOX-loaded DOPC\/LE (95\/5) displayed enhanced extracellular LDH activity compared to the DOX-loaded DOPC control, indicated by higher red formazan fluorescence intensity. There was no difference in LDH activity or cytotoxicity between the two DOX-loaded preparations against Y79 (negative control) cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that RPMI 8226-CLENs represent an improvement over the use of more conventional nanoliposome preparations. Future studies will evaluate additional drug-loaded CLENs <i>in vitro.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Nanoparticle,Targeted therapy,Liposomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matthew Amorin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Peter Daley<sup><\/sup>, William Smullen<sup><\/sup>, Robert Campbell<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, MCPHS University, Worcester, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3f5690ce-9262-4725-83b0-64c82731387b","ControlNumber":"2064","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Anti-FSHR antibody Fab&#8217; fragment conjugated PTX encapsulated immunoliposomes (ILs) were prepared, characterized, and evaluated to determine their <i>in vitro <\/i>efficacy in FSHR receptor positive (Caov3) and negative (SKOV3) OC cells. FSHR expression was determined by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The results confirmed that FSHR expression levels of Caov3 were higher and no expression was detected in SKOV3. ILs were prepared by covalent conjugation of Fab&#8217; fragments to functionalized PLs via thioether linkage which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoreactivity of the prepared ILs was determined against Fab&#697; in Caov3 cells using flow cytometry and it was observed that after conjugation, Fab&#697; remained intact and also maintained the binding characteristic to the receptor. In MTT assay at the end of 48 h, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> value for ILs was found to be 10.8 and 3.5 folds lower than Taxol&#174; and PLs respectively in Caov3. However, being receptor negative, there was no significant difference noticed for IC<sub>50 <\/sub>when PLs and ILs were compared for SKOV3. To prove, whether immune tagging improves cell-specific uptake of ILs in FSHR-expressing cells, cell uptake studies were carried out using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry which showed higher uptake of ILs in Caov3 but not in SKOV3. For assessment of anti-angiogenic activity, a wound scratch assay was performed on Caov3 cells. At an equimolar concentration of treatment given to the cells by PLs and ILs, the % recovery of the wound was 1.3 and 2.3 times lower than Taxol&#174; respectively indicating the superior performance of ILs in inhibiting cell proliferation. The quantitation of cell death after treatment was carried out by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide and the highest amount of cell death was seen in ILs group for Caov3 cells. Evaluation of cell cycle in the Caov3 indicated superior results of arrest of cells in G2\/M phase. Further, an increase in cell death was observed as indicated by the increase in % of cells in subG1 stage. Performance of PLs was similar in Caov3 and SKOV3 leading to almost around 22% of arrest in G2\/M stage, however, for ILs, the number of cells in G2\/M was 28% for Caov3 cells at the end of 24 h indicating that the targeted formulation was able to better get internalized in the cells due to receptor-mediated uptake. The results highlight the importance of FSHR as a prominent target for OC therapy and the potential of anti-FSHR Antibody Fab' conjugated nanocarriers as a site-specific delivery system to reduce the limitations associated with OC chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Nanotechnology drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted drug delivery,Liposomes,Paclitaxel,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priyanka Bhatt<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Pharmaceutical Sciences, St John Fisher University, Rochester, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"91fbed55-3144-40e8-bc52-30100b502736","ControlNumber":"7693","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

However, lack of tumor specificity leads to severe side effects. In addition, cancer cells frequently develop resistance to treatment through overexpressing cell surface multi-drug resistant proteins (MDRs). Therefore, it is desirable to develop novel Pt-based drugs with excellent anti-cancer efficacy and a minimal toxicity profile, as well as the capability to overcome drug resistance. We have previously demonstrated that poly(amino acid)-conjugated drugs can reduce toxicity and improve pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutics and also overcome drug resistance by bypassing MDRs. Here we would like to apply this strategy on Pt drug development.<br \/>Method: To address this question, we synthesized a L-aspartic acid-chelated Pt moieties (Asp-Pt), and then conjugated it to poly(L-glutamic acid\/ L-aspartic acid) to generate a polymeric-Pt macromolecule, namely carrier-platin. We next applied this drug on cancer cell lines including the therapeutic-resistant cancer cells in vitro, and tumor bearing murine models in vivo to evaluate its efficacy and toxicity.<br \/>Result: We first tested the cytotoxicity of carrier-platin and compared with a current first-line chemotherapeutic oxaliplatin on colorectal cancer cell CT26 in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that carrier-platin effectively killed the CT26 cancer cells with hours while oxaliplatin slowly induced cell death after days. Importantly, carrier-platin was well-tolerated by non-cancerous cells. Furthermore, carrier-platin killed cancer cells that resistant to current chemotherapeutics in clinic, including cisplatin, oxaliplatin, doxorubicin and docetaxel, as effective as their parental cells. Next, we found that carrier-platin showed prolonged circulation time and high tumor accumulation compared with Pt-equivalent dosage of oxaliplatin. Treatment with 8 mg Pt\/kg oxaliplatin caused severe body weight loss and intolerable hematotoxicity in mice, but even higher dose of carrier-platin (12 mg Pt\/kg) can be tolerated by mice with stable body weight and did not induce any clinical symptoms. Finally, we revealed that carrier-platin potently inhibited mouse colorectal (CT26) and human ovarian (A2780) tumor growth over Pt-equivalent dosage of oxaliplatin. More importantly, carrier-platin was almost as effective on the cisplatin-resistant A2780 tumors (A2780-Cis) as on the parental A2780 tumors in vivo.<br \/>Conclusion: We developed a novel macromolecular drug carrier-platin that overcome shortages of current small molecular Pt drugs. It displayed a satisfactory toxicity profile accompanied with excellent anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Moreover, carrier-platin overcomes the cross-resistance problem of cancer cells to current chemotherapeutic drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Drug discovery,Drug resistance,Platinum drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yongbin Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dongfang Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Junhua Mai<sup>1<\/sup>, Ping-Ying Pan<sup>2<\/sup>, Shu-Hsia Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Haifa Shen<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Nanomedicine, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4d369f82-a28c-46cd-b364-843006e7a8a0","ControlNumber":"4933","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Despite emerging treatments, there is still an unmet medical need for novel therapeutics to target the inherent and acquired drug resistance associated with MM. CA102L is a conjugate of hyaluronic acid and an anticancer drug designed to deliver its payload, Lenalidomide (Len), to MM cells via the CD44 receptor. Lenalidomide is used as a front-line therapy in MM; The CD44 receptor is highly expressed in MM and is associated with advanced clinical stages and poor survival. In addition to the enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of Len, a reduction in off-target toxicity is suggested. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CA102L in MM and identify its potential mechanism of action. The antitumor efficacy of CA102L was tested (<i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>) in two MM cancer models, IM-9 and NCI-H929. Protein expression was used to identify the potential targets of CA102L in MM. Both in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> investigations, CA102L as a single agent displayed an improvement in potency in MM models. In CB-17 SCID mice bearing either IM-9 or NCI-H929 cells, tumor growth inhibition was significantly higher (P&#38;lt 0.05) in the CA102L (25 mg\/kg) treated group compared to that of Len (25 mg\/kg). Further, CD31 and hematoxylineosin (H&#38;E) staining of tumor sections from the IM-9 xenograft mice treated with CA102L resulted in greater antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects compared to the other groups. Prolonged survival was also observed in CA102L monotherapy in H929 models relative to Len (56% vs 11%). Interestingly, in H929 cell viability studies, CA102L and Len at 400&#956;M showed comparable cytotoxicity with a 60% cell growth inhibition, while superior activity was noted against IM-9-treatments (CA102L 60%, Len 20%). Western blot studies confirmed CRBN as the primary target of CA102L. In summary CA102L as a single agent, exhibited greater efficacy than Len in preclinical MM models, thus representing a promising potential therapeutic strategy for MM. Studies presently are ongoing to further evaluate CA102L&#8217;s preclinical profile to advance the candidate into the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Antitumor agents,Drug delivery,Lenalidomide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eskouhie Tchaparian<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Star Lin<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Holy Stone Healthcare, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c536f3cb-bf84-4f65-b66d-57a034a7ce9a","ControlNumber":"7758","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

Recent studies have reported that macropinocytosis can be increased in cancers with the KRAS mutation. Accordingly, several attempts have been made to deliver therapeutic agents to tumor using the phenomena related to albumin metabolism.To target KRAS mutant cancer cells, we adopted a previously developed albumin-binding caspase-3 cleavable peptide doxorubicin conjugate (MPD1). MPD1 is composed of albumin-binding moiety, caspase-3 substrate (DEVD peptide), and doxorubicin. The albumin-bound MPD1 is delivered into KRAS mutant cancer cells via macropinocytosis and induces apoptosis. Then, the induced caspase-3 cleaves DEVD sequence of MPD1 in the tumor microenvironment and produces free doxorubicin successively exerting <i>in situ<\/i> amplification and overcoming tumor heterogeneity. In this study, we proposed a strategy for effectively delivering and accumulating MPD1 to tumors by promoting altered albumin uptake of KRAS-mutated tumors. We discovered that DNA-PK inhibitor, one of the anticancer drugs that inhibit DNA damage repairing, selectively increases albumin uptake in tumor cells with KRAS mutation. We found that this is due to activated PI3K signaling in KRAS mutant tumor cells. In particular, this investigation has revealed that DNA-PK inhibitor increased albumin uptake by activating the AMPK in PI3K signaling enhanced cancer. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)&nbsp;is a vital cellular energy sensor, so once AMPK is activated by insufficient nutrition level of cells, it activates albumin uptake for nutrient scavenging to restore low energy status. Therefore, because DNA-PK inhibitor activate AMPK-dependent macropinocytosis, it selectively increases albumin uptake in KRAS mutant cancer, enabling tumor targeting of MPD1. In addition, doxorubicin is accumulated in tumors through the caspase-3 amplification system described above overcoming tumor heterogeneity. We demonstrated that MPD1 and DNA-PK inhibitor combination therapy exerted 100% complete remission in the KRAS mutant TNBC xenograft model, suggesting its potent clinical applicability.In conclusion, our results indicate that DNA-PK inhibitor enhances macropinocytosis in an AMPK-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that DNA-PK inhibitor has a dual role of preventing DNA repair as an anticancer agent and elevating nutrient-scavenging pathway in KRAS mutant cancer as a mean of drug delivery. Thus, the albumin-binding self-amplifying MPD1 synergizes its cytotoxic effects at the tumor site with the DNA-PK inhibitors. We believe that this proposed strategy is a valuable approach to broadening the therapeutic benefit for PI3K-activated cancers including KRAS mutant cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Caspases,Combination therapy,DNA-PK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ha Rin Kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Seong Jin Park<sup><\/sup>, Moyo Knowledge Mudhibadhi<sup><\/sup>, Jae Hee Park<sup><\/sup>, Youngro Byun<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Seoul National University College of Pharmacy, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"be3d01b4-eca3-4be5-8686-1d7884b2c4f9","ControlNumber":"5981","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive therapeutic target due to its high expression in NSCLC. Gemcitabine (Gem) has shown antitumor activity against many kinds of solid tumors, including NSCLC. Aptamers emerged as promising drug delivery vehicles because of their high binding affinity for the target molecules. The objective of this study was to develop the aptamer-drug conjugates using the EGFR-specific aptamer. EGFR aptamers selected by the SELEX process and gemcitabine was internally incorporated into the EGFR aptamer. <i>In vitro<\/i> binding affinity of EGFR and Gem-loaded EGFR aptamer was evaluated on EGFR-positive A549, H460, H1299 cell lines, as well as EGFR-negative H522 cells using confocal microscopy.

This high mortality rate is linked to the development of resistance to first line chemotherapy with platinum compounds which has been attributed in part to increased activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The anti-diabetic drug metformin was previously shown to induce cytotoxicity in PROC cells and thus, the combination of a FAK inhibitor, Y15 and metformin may be a promising treatment for PROC. Biomaterial scaffolds can be utilized to deliver drugs locally to maximize the drug concentration and bioactivity at the target site while minimizing non-target systemic toxicity. The Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a polyester copolymer and its degradation rate can be easily tailored from days to years providing versatility in the delivery of different drugs. The objectives of this study were to investigate the ability of the PLGA scaffold to control the release of the drugs and if the combined delivery of both Y15 and Metformin would result in additive effects on cell viability compared to the release of each drug alone. Scaffolds were fabricated from an easy and economical mold-less technique by combining PLGA and the drugs (i.e. metformin and\/or Y15) in tetraglycol and injected into PBS, to form a globular morphology. An MTT assay was used to analyze cell viability in PROC OVCAR3 cells at an absorbance of 570 nm with a microplate reader. Drug loading from the scaffolds were determined using HPLC at absorbance wavelengths of 233 and 376 nm for Metformin and Y15, respectively. Release kinetics were determined using a spectrometer at absorbance wavelengths of 233 and 380 nm for Metformin and Y15 respectively at each timepoint. Metformin and Y15 treatment reduced cell viability by 34 and 46%, respectively, and 76% when combined. In studies with the fabricated PLGA scaffolds, Y15 only and metformin only scaffolds reduced cell viability by 36 and 11% respectively. When the drugs were combined in the scaffolds, there was a 95% reduction in cell viability. Drug loading and loading efficiency for Metformin only and combination scaffolds were 0.577 and 0.584%, respectively and 6.35 and 6.45%, respectively. Drug loading and loading efficiency for Y15 were 0.059 and 0.064%, respectively, and 12.01 and 14.23%, respectively. A lot of drug was lost into the setting solvent during fabrication. This can be improved by optimizing the setting solvent for Metformin and Y15. Only a short term sustained release was observed from the drug encapsulated scaffolds but may be improved by incorporating the drugs into particles prior to loading into the scaffolds. Although drug loading was low, it was still effective at resulting in cell death. In conclusion, the delivery of Y15 and Metformin in a PLGA biomaterial scaffold can result in an additive effect on cell viability and can be further explored as a promising approach for the treatment of PROC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Drug delivery,Metformin,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hannah Obregon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Viviana Villalobos<sup>1<\/sup>, Manuel A.

Despite the observed benefits in early-phase clinical studies, the clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines remains modest. Here, we aim to develop a vaccine delivery strategy to enhance the antitumor efficacy of cancer vaccines.<br \/>Method: We developed polycondensate-epitope vaccines (PEVs) for co-delivering of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II-restricted peptides (OVA<sub>257-264<\/sub> and OVA<sub>323-339<\/sub>) to elicit antigen-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells for long-term antitumor immunity. PEVs were prepared by polymerizing amino-functionalized MHC I and MHC II-restricted peptides with a TLR1\/2 agonist, Pam3CSK4, using a responsive linker. We characterized the physical properties (size, MW) and responsiveness of the prepared PEVs. The immunogenicity was evaluated in mice via flow cytometry and ELISpot assay. We finally assessed the antitumor efficacy in both prophylactic and therapeutic tumor models.<br \/>Results: The prepared PEVs have an average size of 20 nm to 50 nm, &#62;95% incorporating efficiency, and a remarkably high loading capacity of antigens and adjuvants (57.18~ 61.3 wt\/wt %). PEVs consisting of both MHC I and MHC II-restricted OVA peptides induced robust antigen-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses and long-term memory immune response against tumors. The vaccine-induced CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells exhibited high proliferative capacity and polyfunctionality upon antigen restimulation ex vivo. In a prophylactic model, mice immunized by PEVs completely rejected the first and the second challenge of YUMM1.7-OVA tumor cells with 100% rejection rate. In a therapeutic model, treatment with PEVs loaded OVA<sub>257-264<\/sub> and OVA<sub>323-339<\/sub> peptides induced marked tumor regression in mice bearing established YUMM1.7-OVA tumors showing enhanced anti-tumor efficacy as compared to PEVs loaded with CD8 epitope alone.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that PEV is a promising vaccine delivery strategy for eliciting highly effective and durable anti-cancer immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Nanoparticle,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Helper T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaomeng Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Li Tang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bbeeb01c-3d8e-4813-8236-aee5630c0ca3","ControlNumber":"1600","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Consequently, DARs are commonly limited to 4, forcing developers to incorporate very high potency payloads to achieve the required efficacy. This, combined with chemical instability and off-target uptake, often results in dose-limiting toxicities and narrow therapeutic indexes.<br \/>In this study, we used a novel and flexible multivalent linker technology to construct two ADCs targeting HER-2 with the monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab and interchain cysteine bioconjugation. One ADC incorporated monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) as the drug payload at average DAR 16 whilst the second incorporated the camptothecin analog, SN38, as the drug payload also at average DAR 16. The ADCs were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and SDS-PAGE and were then tested for efficacy in a range of HER-2 positive cell lines <i>in vitro,<\/i> and tumor growth inhibition studies using NCI-N87 cells in a mouse xenograft.<br \/>Both ADCs remained &#62; 95% monomeric (no aggregation) and demonstrated greater chemical stability in ex-vivo serum stability studies compared to comparator ADC constructs utilizing a clinically validated linker and the same payload release chemistry. In <i>in vitro<\/i> cell killing studies, the ADCs demonstrated target-specific cell killing with the SN38 average DAR 16 ADC achieving a disproportionate 30-fold increase in IC<sub>50<\/sub> (by ADC concentration) compared to a DAR 8 comparator. Dose dependent tumor growth inhibition was observed in an HER-2 positive NCI-N87 mouse xenograft model with no change in mouse body weight, and good systemic exposure.<br \/>These data demonstrate our capability, using a novel multivalent linker technology, to construct ADCs with DARs considerably greater than DAR 8 which are chemically stable, shield payloads from hydrophobic interactions (no aggregation), demonstrate good <i>in vivo<\/i> exposure profiles and which are highly efficacious <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo.<\/i><br \/>Higher DARs will permit the incorporation of lower potency and targeted small molecule payloads into ADCs which will result in targeted cancer therapeutics with wider therapeutic indexes through the delivery of greater concentrations of payload to the tumor microenvironment and lower, payload-associated, dose-limiting toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),high drug-to-antibody ratio,lower potency payload,solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ludovic Juen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Adam J.

Anthracyclines, a class of cytotoxic small molecules that include important clinical chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin, have long been of interest to the ADC field due to their high potency and unique MOA. Interest in anthracyclines has increased in recent years due to their status as canonical inducers of immunogenic-cell death (ICD), a feature that may lead to more durable tumor regressions and increased synergy with immune checkpoint blockade. In this work, we investigate several drug-linkers based on oxidized derivatives of the highly potent anthracycline analogue PNU-159682. Resultant ADCs are potent and immunologically specific with linker-dependent bystander activity in co-culture cytotoxicity assays displaying heterogeneous antigen (Ag+\/Ag-) expression. Rodent <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity and tolerability are shown with significant differences emerging between the toxicity profile of the cleavable and non-cleavable analogues. <i>In vitro<\/i>, tumor cells treated with anthracycline ADCs showed key hallmarks of ICD including markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the induction of ICD damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as HMGB1 and ATP. <i>In vivo <\/i>mouse xenograft studies show increased tumoral F4\/80+ macrophage infiltration by IHC in anthracycline ADC treated animals relative to controls. ADCs delivering monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) show comparable activity in ICD assays, confirming MMAE as an ICD inducing ADC payload alongside canonical inducers such as anthracyclines. Our results indicate there is a therapeutic window in rodents alongside ICD induction by anthracycline ADCs, positioning anthracyclines as a potentially impactful class of ADC payloads.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Anthracycline,Immunogenic cell death,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joseph  Z.
