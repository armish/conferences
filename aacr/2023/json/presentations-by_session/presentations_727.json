[{"Abstract":"<b>Background <\/b>Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that commonly harbors acquired somatic gene mutations in <i>JAK2, CALR<\/i>, or <i>MPL<\/i>. In the Phase 3 COMFORT-1 trial, which enrolled 309 patients (pts) with JAK inhibitor-na&#239;ve MF, ruxolitinib (RUX) showed spleen volume reduction of &#8805;35% (SVR35) and an improvement of 50% or more in the total symptom score (TSS50) in 42% and 46%, respectively compared to placebo. Activity has been shown with the combination of selinexor (SEL) plus RUX in preclinical studies.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>XPORT-MF-034 is an open-label, Phase 1\/2 study (NCT04562389) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SEL plus RUX in treatment-na&#239;ve MF pts. SEL is evaluated at 2 dose levels, 40mg and 60mg once-weekly plus twice daily RUX in 28-day cycles. For nausea, all pts receive prophylaxis with a 5-HT3 antagonist prior to each SEL dose and as needed. Primary endpoints are to determine maximum tolerated dose, recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and safety. Secondary endpoints include spleen and symptom response, and hemoglobin stabilization and improvement. The efficacy population for spleen and symptom evaluable pts included those who had a spleen assessment or at least one symptom score available, respectively, at baseline and the W12 or W24 timepoint.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>As of Oct 21, 2022, 24 pts have received at least one dose of 40mg or 60mg weekly SEL with RUX twice daily as per standard of care. Median age was 64 years old (range 44-77) and 11 pts had primary MF, 6 had post-ET MF, and 7 had post-PV MF. DIPSS risk category was int-1, int-2, and high risk for 7, 11, and 6, respectively. The median daily dose of ruxolitinib received was 20 mg. In efficacy evaluable pts, 63% (12\/19) and 92% (11\/12) achieved SVR35 at W12 and W24, and 83% (10\/12) and 67% (4\/6) achieved TSS50 at W12 and W24. Among the 11 pts who had a baseline hemoglobin level &#60;10 g\/dL, the median hemoglobin level decreased by 0.6 g\/dL from baseline to W12 and increased by 0.8 g\/dL from baseline to W24. The most common adverse events (AEs) were nausea (75%), anemia (63%), fatigue (58%), and thrombocytopenia (54%). The most common Grade &#8805;3 AEs were anemia (38%), thrombocytopenia (21%), neutropenia (17%), and atrial fibrillation (13%). Two pts discontinued treatment due to treatment-related AEs (G3 thrombocytopenia, G3 peripheral neuropathy) and no treatment-related deaths were reported.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>To date, in pts with treatment-na&#239;ve MF, the novel combination of SEL and RUX has been reasonably well-tolerated with a generally manageable safety profile and has shown encouraging activity in spleen and symptom responses, in addition to hemoglobin stabilization. Updated safety and efficacy, including symptom data amongst those pts non evaluable for TSS50 at the time of the Oct data cutoff, as well as RP2D, will be available for presentation at AACR 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL02-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Safety,Myelofibrosis ,Selinexor ,ruxolitinib ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haris Ali<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashwin Kishtagari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keri Maher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjay Mohan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karen Ansaldo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xulong Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kamal Chamoun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josef T.

Translational studies suggest that T cell exhaustion, characterized by upregulation of immune checkpoints LAG-3 and TIGIT, is a potential resistance mechanism to T cell redirection. These findings support the hypothesis that checkpoint inhibition with anti-LAG-3 or anti-TIGIT mAbs may restore anti-myeloma T cell activity. There is an unmet need to assess the feasibility and safety of checkpoint blockade in this malignancy.<br \/>Patients and Methods: MyCheckpoint (NCT04150965) is a phase 1\/2 platform trial for relapsed MM patients who have received &#8805;3 lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug, and anti-CD38 mAb. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability of the investigational agents alone and in combination with pomalidomide (Pom) and dexamethasone (Dex) and overall response rates in each arm. In the phase 1 portion subjects were randomized to Arm B (anti-LAG-3) or Arm C (anti-TIGIT mAb). Subjects received one cycle (C1) of mAb therapy alone, with the addition of Pom and Dex starting with cycle 2 (C2) onward. Bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood were obtained at screening, C2D1, C3D1, and end of study for correlative analysis.<br \/>Results: Fourteen (14) eligible subjects were enrolled (seven subjects in Arm B dose level (DL) 1, one not evaluable; six subjects in Arm C DL1, and 1 subject Arm C DL2 not evaluable). The most common adverse events (AE) were anemia and dyspnea. Grade 3-4 AEs related to therapy in the anti-LAG-3 arm were dyspnea and neutropenia; those in anti-TIGIT arm were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. There was 1 death due to progression of disease unrelated to the study treatment. There was 1 death due to a serious adverse event of pneumonia (unrelated). There was one adverse event of special interest in Arm B DL1 (grade 1 AST elevation). No autoimmune AEs were reported. Best overall responses for Arm B DL1 were 1 very good partial response (VGPR), 1 partial response (PR), 4 stable disease (SD); for Arm C DL1, 1 VGPR, 2 PR, and 3 SD. Eight subjects withdrew from treatment for disease progression, 2 for AE, and 2 for patient decision. Two subjects continue in Arm C DL1 as of December 2022, 1 PR as of C16D1 and 1 VGPR (C23D1).<br \/>Conclusion: Anti-LAG-3 and anti-TIGIT mAb alone and in combination with Pom are safe, feasible and clinically active in relapsed MM after Pom and anti-CD38 mAb. These data provide the first evidence of clinical activity of TIGIT and LAG-3 blockade in MM. Translational results utilizing serial analyses with mass cytometry suggest evidence of immune activation following combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunomodulation,Multiple myeloma,TIGIT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hearn J.

This study in healthy volunteers evaluated if taking sotorasib with an acidic beverage such as Coca Cola would alter sotorasib absorption when coadministered with omeprazole and improve sotorasib exposure .Two separate phase 1, open-label, fixed sequence, 2-period studies enrolled at least 14 healthy subjects each. In the first study, each subject received a single 960 mg dose of sotorasib under fasted conditions on day 1, followed by omeprazole 40 mg once daily for 5 days on days 4 to 8, and then received omeprazole 40 mg in combination with sotorasib 960 mg on day 9 with water. For the second phase 1 study all conditions were kept the same except subjects received omeprazole in combination with sotorasib on day 9 with an 8-ounce (240 mL) glass of acidic beverage (Coca-Cola) instead of water. In both studies, intensive pharmacokinetic plasma sampling occurred predose and at 13 timepoints up to 48 hours post-dose. Sotorasib plasma concentrations were measured using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Non-compartmental analysis was used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters. Safety and tolerability were monitored throughout the study.Increased sotorasib exposure was observed when sotorasib and omeprazole were taken with an acidic beverage compared to when sotorasib and omeprazole were taken with water for both AUClast (23200 vs 16700 h&#8729;ng\/mL respectively) and Cmax (4850 ng\/mL vs 3110 ng\/mL respectively). Compared to the geometric mean ratio of sotorasib and omeprazole taken with water, taking sotorasib and omeprazole with an acidic beverage resulted in an increase of 19.0 percentage-point in AUClast and a 24.6 percentage-point increase in Cmax. Coadministration of sotorasib and omeprazole with Coca Cola was safe and well tolerated.For patients on acid-reducing drugs, sotorasib taken with an acidic beverage is an effective strategy to increase sotorasib exposure and counteract the reduced exposures resulting from the drug-drug interaction effect of acid-reducing drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,KRAS,Phase I,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Natasha Strydom<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Panli Cardona<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marintan Spring<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Purkis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brett Houk<\/i><\/presenter>.

TIGIT inhibits T and NK cell function by binding to CD155 and CD112. SEA-TGT is an investigational human, nonfucosylated monoclonal antibody directed against TIGIT, blocking TIGIT's interaction with CD155 and CD112. SGNTGT-001 (NCT04254107) is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of SEA-TGT in patients (pts) with advanced malignancies (solid tumors and lymphomas). In this abstract, we present data from the dose-escalation phase (Part A).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Pts received SEA-TGT ranging from 0.01 to 6.0 mg\/kg of body weight intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W). The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-TGT and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended dose and schedule of SEA-TGT. The optimal biological dose was defined using the Clinical Utility Index. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity. Antitumor activity was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 or the Lugano classification criteria with Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>From June 12, 2020, to October 5, 2022, 41 pts were enrolled (2, 4, 5, 11, 12, and 7 pts in the 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 6 mg\/kg cohorts, respectively). Among the 39 pts who were treated 23 pts had solid tumors and 16 had lymphomas. The median number of prior therapies across all cohorts was 5. Treatment emergent adverse events of any grade were reported in 100% of pts, and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were reported in 69.2%. TRAEs seen in &#8805;10% of the pts were infusion-related reaction (38.5%), chills (25.6%), pyrexia (17.9%), fatigue (12.8%), maculopapular rash (12.8%), and rash (10.3%). Seven pts (17.9%) reported TRAEs grade &#8805;3, and rash (5.1%) was the most frequently reported. No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were reported. One dose-limiting toxicity, pruritic rash, was observed in 1 pt in the 6 mg\/kg cohort, and MTD was not exceeded. Based on the PK and pharmacodynamic data, 1 mg\/kg Q3W was selected as the optimal biological dose for the expansion cohorts.

Here we report PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumor activity from a Phase I open-label study (YP42514, CTR20210219) evaluating tiragolumab + atezolizumab in Chinese patients (pts) with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Pts &#8805;18 years of age with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, a life expectancy of &#8805;12 weeks, adequate hematologic and end organ function who were residents in mainland China were eligible. Pts received tiragolumab 600 mg + atezolizumab 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks. Serial PK sampling was obtained in the first dosing Cycle on Days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 21, followed by sparse peak and trough collection. PK parameters were assessed by noncompartmental analysis and summarized using descriptive statistics. The severity of adverse events (AEs) was assessed using NCI CTCAE v5. Confirmed overall response rate and duration of response (DOR) were determined by investigator. Data cutoff: Feb 10, 2022. To support the dosing approach, findings in the current study were compared with results of a global Phase I study GO30103 (NCT02794571) [Bendell JC, et al. <i>Cancer Res<\/i> 2020;80:(suppl 16; Abst CT302)] in pts from France, Korea, Spain, the United States, Canada, and Australia receiving the same combination and dosing regimen.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Twenty Chinese pts were enrolled and received a median of 5 doses of tiragolumab + atezolizumab. Pts had a median age of 57.5 (range 44-73) years, were mostly male (85%), had a median of &#8805;2 prior lines of therapy and 30% of pts received prior immunotherapy. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common tumor type (55%). Exposures in Chinese pts were comparable to the global population, with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1.07 for Cycle 1 tiragolumab area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 21 days, and a GMR of 0.92 and 0.93<sub> <\/sub>for Cycle 1 peak and trough atezolizumab exposure, respectively. The frequency of treatment-related AEs, all-cause grade 3\/4 AEs, grade 3\/4 AEs of special interest, and AEs leading to withdrawal from study treatment were generally similar for pts in China (85.0%, 40%, 10%, and 5.0%) and those in the global GO30103 study (71.3%, 41.7%, 5.3%, and 5.6%). Treatment exposure was similar in the YP42514 study vs the respective global GO30103 cohort. Two Chinese pts (10%) had a partial response, their DORs were 3 and 6 months (censored), and seven pts (35%) had stable disease.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Tiragolumab + atezolizumab was tolerable with preliminary anti-tumor activity.

Selective endothelin B receptor (ETBR) blockade stimulates T cell tumor infiltration and synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy in OC and PDAC mouse models. We are conducting an ongoing Phase Ib, open-label dose escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability of the selective ETBR antagonist ENB-003 (vodudeutentan) in combination with pembrolizumab in metastatic PDAC, OC and other advanced solid tumors (NCT04205227). The primary objectives are safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives include overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and disease control rate (DCR). Chemotherapy-resistant PDAC and platinum refractory\/ platinum resistant OC patients were microsatellite stable (MSS). The ENB-003 plus pembrolizumab combination was well tolerated across 6 dosing cohorts with no increase in toxicity above what is typically observed with pembrolizumab as a single agent. Encouraging preliminary efficacy signals have been observed. The DCR across 21 patients is 43% including 8 patients with stable disease (38%) and 1 (5%) with partial response (PR). The DCR for OC is 100% including 3 patients with stable disease (75%) and one MSS, PDL1 negative platinum refractory patient with a 95% PR (25%) of 12-month duration. In the current and final cohort, 3 PAC patients have been treated. One 4<sup>th<\/sup> line PDAC patient has exceeded 6-month survival (33%). We also observed a 7-month arrest of disease progression in a tonsillar SCC patient with innate resistance to anti-PD1.

We hypothesized that tumor-targeted delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy might enable tolerable and active combinations with DDR inhibitors. We conducted a phase I clinical trial combining ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor berzosertib with sacituzumab govitecan, a trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that delivers high tumoral concentrations of topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor SN-38. Depletion of ATR, the main transducer of replication stress is synthetically lethal with double-strand breaks (DSB) generated by TOP1 inhibitors. Patients with DDR gene-mutated or high replication stress solid tumors were enrolled since such tumors are particularly susceptible to ATR inhibition. Primary end point was identification of the maximum tolerated dose of the combination. Efficacy and pharmacodynamics were secondary end points. Using 3 + 3 dose escalation, sacituzumab govitecan (8-10 mg\/m2, days 1, 8) and berzosertib (140-210 mg\/m2, days 2, 9) were administered to 12 patients across three dose levels in 21-day cycles. The combination was well tolerated, with improved safety profile over conventional chemotherapy-based combinations, which allowed dose escalation to the highest planned dose level. There were no dose limiting toxicities. Common treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were neutropenia (41.7%), diarrhea (50%), and fatigue (50%). Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 58.3% of patients and included neutropenia (25%) and diarrhea (8.3%). There were no instances of febrile neutropenia or clinically significant grade 4 TRAEs. Pharmacodynamic studies showed evidence of ATR inhibition and enhanced DNA DSB in response to the combination. While no tumor responses were seen in three patients with DDR defects including <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>ATM<\/i> mutations, two patients with neuroendocrine prostate cancer, a highly aggressive subtype of prostate cancer, showed partial or metabolic responses. A patient with <i>EGFR<\/i>-transformed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) also experienced partial response, together yielding objective responses in 3 of 12 evaluable patients (25%). Ongoing phase II expansion cohorts are evaluating efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan 10mg\/m2 and berzosertib 210mg\/m2 in patients with SCLC, extra-pulmonary small cell cancers, and DDR-mutated solid tumors. ADC-based delivery of cytotoxic payload represents a new therapeutic paradigm to extend the benefit of DDR inhibitors to target replication stress and chemotherapy resistance, with minimal added toxicities.

Measurement of PARylation inhibition has been used to determine the pharmacodynamics (PD) of PARPi in clinical trials, but the assays used were insensitive and non-specific. Here we report on a new, highly sensitive and specific PARylation assay as evaluated in the PETRA trial (NCT04644068).<br \/><b>Methods <\/b> PETRA is a Phase 1\/2 clinical study investigating AZD5305 alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected at multiple timepoints during treatment (cycle [C] 0 day [D] 1 pre-dose, 1, 4, 24 and 48 hours [hrs] post-dose, and C1D1 pre-dose) were lysed, subjected to an <i>ex-vivo <\/i>PARylation reaction, and quantified with the novel MSD PARylation assay.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> PARylation data were available from 32 patients treated from 20 mg to 140 mg. AZD5305 significantly inhibited PARylation in PBMC with maximum PARylation inhibition occurring around time to plasma concentration maximum (Tmax, 1 to 4 hrs after dosing; Table). At longer timepoints, a majority of patients showed &#62;90% PARylation inhibition up to 48 hrs, 72 hrs, and even 168 hrs. Inhibition &#62;90% for up to 72 hrs was observed in 4\/4 evaluable samples at 140 mg, while inhibition &#62;90% for an extended period (up to 168 hrs) was observed in 3\/4 samples at 20 mg and 1\/2 samples at 60 mg. These data demonstrate that AZD5305 causes significant PARylation inhibition at doses &#8805;20 mg which is consistent with <i>in vitro<\/i> findings.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Significant and durable PARylation inhibition was demonstrated with the novel PARylation assay at all doses of AZD5305 in PBMC samples from the majority of pts tested. <b> <\/b><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{1A710CE2-4DC9-438D-A652-CFA3B4718A63}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">Table.

We developed a personalized genome vaccine (PGV_001) platform to generate neoantigen vaccines targeting each patient&#8217;s unique mutanome. Primary objectives of the study were to determine 1) the safety and tolerability; 2) the feasibility of PGV_001 production and administration; and 3) the immunogenicity of PGV_001. Secondary objectives included immunophenotyping vaccine driven cellular and soluble immune milieu in peripheral blood. We previously reported on the clinical efficacy, and here we report, analysis of vaccine-driven immune responses in all treated patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The study (Trial Registration NCT02721043) enrolled patients with resected malignancies, including Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, breast cancer and bladder cancer, or, in the case of multiple myeloma treated with autologous stem cell transplant; all patients determined to have a high risk of disease recurrence (&#62;30% over 5 years). Tumor-derived and germline RNA and DNA was sequenced to predict neoantigens utilizing our custom computation pipeline, OpenVax. Approximately 10 peptides were synthesized per patient, and a mixture of these peptides was administered as 10 subcutaneous and intradermal vaccines over 27 weeks in combination with poly-ICLC and helper Tetanus peptide as adjuvants. Immune responses were analyzed utilizing assays including IFN-gamma ELISPOT, antigen specific T cell expansion followed by flow cytometry, etc.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> In total 148 neoantigen peptides were manufactured for 15 patients. Overall, 136 PGV_001 doses were administered to 13 patients. Vaccine-specific T cell immunity was observed against multiple vaccine neoepitopes in all 13 subjects. Of the peptides administered, 45% of vaccine antigens (57\/126) induced <i>de novo<\/i> immunity, starting as early as Week8 and often sustaining past last vaccination. Notably, while the vaccine driven T cell immunity was CD4 T cell dominant, most evaluated subjects also displayed vaccine induced polyfunctional CD8-T cell responses. Additional studies are ongoing to define qualities of reactive T cells, evaluate vaccine-induced humoral responses and probe the circulating inflammatory immune milieu. These will be presented.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b> We have established a platform for generating personalized neoantigen vaccines. 100% of the vaccinated patients developed an immune response specific to the vaccine neoantigens predicted by OpenVax. Subjects who received treatment experienced mild Grade 1 or 2 adverse reactions as per the CTEP v 4.0 NCI CTCAE. This vaccine trial reached the primary endpoint of safety, tolerability, feasibility and immunogenicity.<b><i> <\/i><\/b> Based on the PGV_001 platform two clinical trials, one in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (NCT03223103) in combination with TT fields and second in patients with urothelial carcinoma (NCT03359239) in combination with Atezolizumab have been performed.

M1774, a potent, selective, orally administered ATR inhibitor with antitumor activity in preclinical models, was evaluated in Part A1 of an open-label, single-arm study (NCT04170153) for safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). M1774 monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors was well-tolerated and the totality of evidence, including quantitative model-based analyses, suggested the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) as 180 mg QD 2 weeks on \/ 1 week off.<sup>1<\/sup> Here, we report findings of the M1774 PD and immunophenotyping analyses.<br \/>Methods: M1774 PD was explored by assessing phosphorylation by ATR of CHK1 (p-CHK1) in tumor and of H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) in serial blood samples, stimulated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with the radiomimetic 4-Nitroquinoline N-oxide or Dimethyl sulfoxide as control. A flow cytometry quantitative assay was used to measure &#947;-H2AX in the CD45+ lymphocytes fraction. The effect of M1774 on the immunophenotype was explored by flow cytometry. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 3 and 24 hours after first M1774 administration on day 1 of cycle 1 for the &#947;-H2AX analysis, and on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2 before treatment for immunophenotyping.<br \/>Results: Preclinical tumor tissue-blood bridging PD analyses in a mouse model demonstrated that the inhibition of &#947;-H2AX in lymphocytes highly correlated with inhibition of p-CHK1 in tumor. Clinical data of &#947;-H2AX levels and immunophenotyping were generated for the blood samples collected from the 55 participants of Part A1 of the study. Exploratory PK-PD analysis using &#947;-H2AX levels 3 h post-dose on day 1 across the doses predicted target inhibition &#62;80% for doses &#8805;130 mg, suggesting target engagement. The levels of &#611;-H2AX at 24 h after first dose intake were variable and mean levels rebounded to baseline value. M1774 treatment did not cause any significant and consistent change in the levels of all explored immune cell subsets at the tested dose levels, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells, T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and natural killer cells.<br \/>Conclusions: PD analyses showed that M1774 efficiently inhibited ATR at the RDE without impacting the immunophenotype. <sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>1<\/sup>TA Yap, et al. <i>Ann Oncol.<\/i> 2022; 33(suppl_7): S197-S224.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,ATR,Solid tumors,Pharmacodynamics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ruth Plummer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Anthony W.

Rivoceranib is metabolized in the liver mostly by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4\/5, with minor contributions from CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2E1. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest rivoceranib may interact with various CYP substrates, including CYP 1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. The purpose of study is to evaluate the effect of rivoceranib on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of various CYP substrates.<br \/>Methods: This study was an open-label, 2-treatment, fixed-sequence drug-drug interaction phase 1 study evaluating the impact of multiple oral doses of 700 mg rivoceranib on the single-dose PK of CYP enzyme substrates administered in a 5+1 probe cocktail (caffeine [CYP1A2], S- and R-warfarin [CYP2C9] + vitamin K, omeprazole [CYP2C19], dextromethorphan [CYP2D6], and midazolam [CYP3A]) in healthy volunteers (N=32). On day 1, volunteers received a single dose of the 5+1 cocktail comprising 200 mg caffeine, 10 mg S- and R-warfarin with 10 mg vitamin K, 40 mg omeprazole, 30 mg dextromethorphan, and 2 mg midazolam. Blood samples were collected predose on day 1 and up to 120 hours post-dose for PK analyses of the substrates in the 5+1 cocktail. On days 6 to 15, volunteers received 700 mg rivoceranib once daily for 10 consecutive days with a single dose of the 5+1 cocktail administered on day 11. Blood samples were collected predose on day 11 and up to 120 hours post cocktail dosing (day 16) for PK analyses. Each dosing was under fasted conditions. There was a washout period of 5 days between Day 1 dosing and the first rivoceranib dose on Day 6; the 2 cocktail dosings were spaced by 10 days.<br \/>Results: Rivoceranib reduced caffeine AUC<sub>0-inf <\/sub>by 15%, and did not change caffeine C<sub>max<\/sub>, indicating a minimal effect of rivoceranib on the PK of CYP1A2 substrates. S-warfarin and R-warfarin AUC<sub>0-inf <\/sub>increased by 68% and 32%, respectively, and C<sub>max<\/sub> by 19% and 15%, respectively, when co-administered with rivoceranib, indicating rivoceranib weakly inhibits CYP2C9. Rivoceranib appeared to act as a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19, increasing omeprazole AUC<sub>0-inf <\/sub>3.3-fold and increasing C<sub>max<\/sub> 2-fold. Dextromethorphan metabolism (CYP2D6) was inhibited, with a 2- to 2.7-fold increase in dextromethorphan exposure. Rivoceranib appeared to moderately inhibit midazolam metabolism by CYP3A4, with 2.4- to 2.8-fold increases in midazolam exposures.<br \/>Conclusion: In the analysis, the effect of rivoceranib on the PK of CYP1A2 substrates did not appear to be clinically significant. Rivoceranib may inhibit the metabolism of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 substrates, suggesting that dose adjustment of substrates of these CYP isozymes and\/or cautiously monitoring patients&#8217; adverse events may be needed when they are co-administered with rivoceranib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Janelle Weyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xianzhang Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Reitano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vinoo Urity<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheol-Hee Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bill Strickland<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Van Tornout<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seong Jang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Each VB10.NEO vaccine contains up to 20 neoepitopes selected by the proprietary AI platform NeoSELECT and is designed to target antigen presenting cells using Nykode&#8217; s modular vaccine platform known as Vaccibody&#8482;.<br \/>Patients and Methods: The trial enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid cancers (renal cell carcinoma, urothelial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and melanoma), who did not obtain complete responses on immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CPI). Up to 14 VB10.NEO doses (3 mg per dose) were administered i.m. by PharmaJet Stratis&#174; for up to 1 year in combination with standard of care (CPI and\/or other anti-cancer therapies). Blood samples and tumor biopsies were collected at baseline and during treatment for evaluation of immune responses.<br \/>Results: At cut-off of May 2022, 41 patients had received at least one vaccination with VB10.NEO. The vaccine was safe and well-tolerated with no new or additional toxicity reported beyond that expected for CPIs alone. All patients displayed immune responses to a minimum of 3 neoepitopes (average 53% of vaccine neoepitopes), assessed by <i>in vitro<\/i> stimulation (IVS) interferon-gamma ELISpot. T cell responses were elicited in both high and low tumor mutational burden patients (TMB range 2-69mut\/Mb). Multiple vaccinations increased the breadth and magnitude of the immune responses with vaccine-induced T cell responses (<i>de novo<\/i> and\/or amplified pre-existing) measured in 95% of eligible patients. IVS intracellular cytokine staining of selected patients demonstrated that the majority of neoepitopes induced polyfunctional CD8 T cells. TCR sequencing of baseline and on-treatment samples (6 patients) showed expansion of T cell clones in both blood and tumor with selected clones being expanded in both compartments.<br \/>Conclusions: VB10.NEO was generally well tolerated in patients with various pre-treated and advanced cancers. Assessment of neoepitope-specific T cell reactivity demonstrated VB10.NEO-induced broad and long-lasting T cell responses, and the majority of tested neoepitopes activated polyfunctional CD8 T cells. Pre- and post-vaccination TCRseq analysis of blood and tumor samples demonstrated the presence of blood-expanded clones in the on-treatment tumor sample potentially indicating trafficking of VB10.NEO-expanded T cells to the tumor site.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA vaccine,Neoantigens,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jürgen Krauss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Krakhardt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephan Eisenmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastian Ochsenreither<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaja C.G Berg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kushi Kushekhar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars-Egil Fallang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikkel W.

We conducted a clinical trial to investigate agenT-797 activity as single agent and in combination (combo) with PD-1 blockade after prior progression on PD-1 therapy.<br \/>Methods: Patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory solid tumors were treated with single IV infusion of agenT-797 (no lymphodepletion) at 4.3 x 10^6 or 1.4 x 10^7 cells\/kg, as monotherapy or in combo with pembrolizumab (pembro) or nivolumab (nivo). Dose escalation followed 3+3 scheme. Endpoints included safety, persistence of agenT-797, objective responses, duration of response, progression-free survival, and time to response. Adverse events (AEs) were reported per CTCAE v5.0. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated. AgenT-797 persistence was assessed by assays utilizing SNPs and cfDNA analysis. Serum biomarkers were measured with MSD V-PLEX cytokine assays. On-treatment tumor biopsy was obtained for multiplex immunofluorescence staining and next generation sequencing.<br \/>Results: As of February 5<sup>th<\/sup>, 32 pts (median age 62y, range 30-83) were treated with agenT-797 monotherapy (n=26) or combo (n=6) with pembro or nivo. Pts had median 4 lines of prior therapy (range 1-13). Tumor types included pancreatic (6), NSCLC (4), rectal (4), cholangiocarcinoma\/biliary duct (4), and other (14)*. Tolerability was favorable, with no cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and no DLTs. Treatment-related AEs included 16.7% (5) grade 1, 3.3% (1) grade 2, and 3.3% (1) grade 3 (anemia). At data cutoff, agenT-797 monotherapy and combo revealed early clinical activity. Among 29 evaluable pts, a confirmed partial response in MSI-H gastric cancer refractory to PD-1 treated with agenT-797 + nivo (remains ongoing &#62;6 months) and 8 pts had stable disease (SD). Prolonged SD (&#62;3 months) for 3 monotherapy pts. Overall response rate 20% (1\/5) for pts treated with agenT-797 + pembro or nivo. AgenT-797 was detected in peripheral blood up to day 8 post infusion. Preliminary data identified transient increase in serum IFNgamma levels day 2 post infusion.<br \/>Conclusion: AgenT-797 was well tolerated as monotherapy and in combo with PD-1 (pembro or nivo). Anti-tumor activity in combo with nivo was observed in gastric cancer. Results support the potential of a novel therapeutic strategy employed by agenT-797 to enhance antitumor immunity in PD-1 refractory tumors.

The AhR pathway is downstream of the Trp-IDO\/TDO-Kyn axis. High levels of immune-suppressive AhR-activating ligands, such as kynurenine derived from IDO1\/TDO2-expressing tumors, have been implicated as a potential resistance mechanism and are associated with poor responses to PD-1 therapies. Compared with inhibition of IDO1\/TDO2 alone, direct AhR inhibition can block the activation of this transcription factor and may better counteract immune suppression. BAY2416964 is a novel, oral AhR inhibitor currently in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with solid tumors. Preclinically, BAY2416964 can block the activation of AhR by kynurenine and relieve its immune-suppressive effects, thereby restoring anti-tumor T-cell activity, reducing the level of inhibitory myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and improving the effectiveness of PD-1 blockade. We have analyzed PK and biomarker data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation study to explore a potential optimal dose and schedule for effective AhR inhibition.<br \/>Methods: PK data were intensely sampled from patients in 10 different groups with different dosing regimens (once and twice daily) and various food-intake scenarios. AhR downstream target gene expression after <i>ex vivo<\/i> kynurenic acid stimulation of patients&#8217; peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed. A population PK (popPK) model was developed and calibrated to characterize the PK of BAY2416964 across treatment groups. This model accounts for the non-linear relationship between dose and bioavailability as well as the effect of food intake.<br \/>Results: The preliminary popPK model identified a non-linear relationship between the BAY2416964 dose and its (relative) bioavailability which was dependent on the respective food condition. The popPK model was able to describe the clinical BAY2416964 plasma exposures from all dose groups, including the effect of food intake. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> analysis of PBMCs showed inhibition of kynurenic acid-induced AhR downstream gene expression (such as CYP1A1, CYP1B1), suggesting effective <i>in vivo <\/i>target engagement in the doses tested.<br \/>Conclusion: This modeling-based PK analysis along with target engagement in peripheral blood informed the posology to be tested in the dose-expansion part of the ongoing clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor,Pharmacokinetics,Phase I,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyriakos Papadopoulos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Cecchini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juanita S.

Several other cancers exhibit HER2 expression and\/or amplification of its gene (ERBB2), suggesting that HER2-targeted agents may have broader therapeutic utility. Zanidatamab is a humanized, novel bispecific antibody directed against two non-overlapping domains of HER2. The aim of this Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study (NCT02892123) was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zanidatamab across a range of solid tumors. Parallel to drug development, there has been rapid advancements in NGS technologies including the Guardant360 assay that can specifically sequence ctDNA and detect amplifications of the ERBB2 gene, which can lead to overexpression of HER2. FISH, the current gold standard for HER2 amplification detection, is a tissue-based assay that assesses the raw ERBB2 copy number as well as ratio of ERBB2 to a centromeric protein of chromosome 17 where the ERBB2 gene resides. We evaluated concordance of the FISH and Guardant360 assays to detect ERBB2 amplification in plasma samples. Unlike gene copy number in tissue analysis, the observed plasma copy number (pCN) is also a function of the tumor burden and rate of tumor shedding of ctDNA into the bloodstream.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> HER2 status was determined from a fresh tumor biopsy or in archival FFPE tissue samples by IHC and FISH according to ASCO-CAP guidelines from the Phase 1 study with zanidatamab in multiple cancer types (cholangiocarcinoma [21], colorectal carcinoma [27], all other [87]). Plasma samples were collected prior to the first cycle of zanidatamab and on-treatment for testing with Guardant360, 74 gene ctDNA NGS-based assays.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A concordance of 82% was observed in ERBB2\/HER2 amplifications between the Guardant360 and FISH assays. An exploratory adjustment method based on tumor DNA shedding was developed by Guardant using the maximum mutant allele fraction (maxVAF) as a surrogate for tumor content. Majority of patients experienced a decrease in HER2 pCN post treatment, with 9 PD patients having the least and 21 PR patients the largest changes in ctDNA fraction (maxVAF).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These results indicate that ERBB2 amplification detected by the Guardant360 assay could be used as a surrogate for FISH analysis in lieu of invasive surgical procedures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB2,ctDNA,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Diana Shpektor<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daryanaz Dargahi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonios Samiotakis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Wienke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ali Livernois<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arielle Yablonovitch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geethika Yalamanchili<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaina Gartner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Funda Meric-Bernstam<\/i><\/presenter>.
