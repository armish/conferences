It was hypothesized mRNA-4157 could synergize with adjuvant pembrolizumab to improve recurrence free survival (RFS) in patients with resected stages IIIB\/IIIC\/IIID and IV melanoma.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Eligible patients with completely resected, high-risk cutaneous melanoma were randomly assigned 2:1 (stratified by stage) to receive mRNA-4157 in combination with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. mRNA-4157 (1mg) was administered intramuscularly every 3 weeks for a total of 9 doses and pembrolizumab (200mg) intravenously was given every 3 weeks for up to 18 cycles. Safety was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. RFS in the overall intention-to-treat population was the primary end point. The study was designed with 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5 with an overall 1-sided type I error of 0.1 when a total of 40 RFS events were observed. The primary analysis for RFS was specified to occur after all patients completed a minimum of 12 months on study and at least 40 RFS events were observed.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 107 patients received the combination of mRNA-4157 with pembrolizumab and 50 patients were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy. Recurrence or death was reported in 24 of 107 patients (22.4%) in the combination arm and in 20 of 50 patients (40%) in the monotherapy arm, at a median follow-up of 101 and 105 weeks respectively. 18-month RFS rates (95% CI) were 78.6% (69.0%, 85.6%) vs 62.2% (46.9%, 74.3%) in the combination and monotherapy arm respectively. The combination showed protocol defined statistical significance and a clinically meaningful improvement in RFS compared to pembrolizumab, with a reduction in the risk of recurrence or death by 44% (HR = 0.561; 95% CI: (0.309, 1.017); stratified log-rank test 1-sided p-value of 0.0266. The majority of treatment related adverse events were Grade 1\/2. The number of patients reporting treatment related Grade &#8805; 3 adverse events was generally similar between the arms (25% vs 18%, respectively). The most common mRNA-4157 related Grade 3 event was fatigue. No Grade 4 or Grade 5 events related to mRNA-4157 were reported. No potentiation of immune-mediated adverse events were observed with the addition of mRNA-4157 to pembrolizumab.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> mRNA-4157 in combination with pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for resected high-risk melanoma significantly prolonged RFS compared to pembrolizumab without an increase in clinically meaningful adverse events. These results are the first to demonstrate improvement of RFS over adjuvant standard of care PD-1 blockade in resected high-risk melanoma and provide the first randomized evidence that a personalized neoantigen approach is potentially beneficial for cancer patients. A phase 3 study will be initiated in patients with melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Cancer vaccine,Adjuvant,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Adnan Khattak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matteo Carlino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tarek Meniawy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Ansstas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theresa Medina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew H.

Results from patients treated with neoadjuvant pembro (anti-PD-1) + vibo (anti-TIGIT; arm 1), pembro + geba (coxsackievirus A21; arm 2), or pembro alone (arm 3) are presented.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients were &#8805;18 y with resectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IIID melanoma per AJCC 8th ed criteria, &#8805;1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1, and ECOG PS &#8804;1. Patients were randomly allocated across open investigational arms. Before resection, patients in arm 1 received 2 administrations of pembro 200 mg Q3W + vibo 200 mg Q3W (cycle 1, day 1; cycle 2, day 1); patients in arm 2 received 1 administration of pembro 400 mg (cycle 1, day 8) + 5 administrations of geba at a fixed dose of 3 &#215; 10<sup>8<\/sup> tissue culture infectious dose 50% during cycle 1 (days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 22); and patients in arm 3 received 1 administration of pembro 400 mg. Surgical resection was performed at week 6. At week 12, patients started adjuvant pembro 400 mg Q6W for &#8804;8 administrations (total treatment duration, ~1 y). Primary end points were safety and tolerability and pCR rate by central review. Secondary end points were near pCR rate and pPR rate by central review and RFS by investigator review. ORR per RECIST v1.1 and EFS by investigator review were exploratory.<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (September 9, 2022), 66 patients had been assigned to treatment (arm 1 [pembro + vibo], n = 26; arm 2 [pembro + geba], n = 25; arm 3 [pembro alone], n = 15). Median follow-up was 14.1 mo (range, 8.0-26.1). Treatment-related AEs occurred in 92% of patients in arm 1, 84% in arm 2, and 80% in arm 3. Grade 3\/4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 8%, 24%, and 7% of patients, respectively, with no grade 5 treatment-related AEs. 3 patients (12%) in arm 1, 5 (20%) in arm 2, and 0 in arm 3 discontinued any drug because of treatment-related AEs. Immune-mediated AEs or infusion reactions were reported in 31% of patients in arm 1, 32% in arm 2, and 27% in arm 3. The pCR rate was 38% (95% CI, 20-59) in arm 1, 28% (12-49) in arm 2, and 40% (16-68) in arm 3; the near pCR rate was 12% (2-30), 12% (3-31), and 7% (&#60;1-32), respectively; and the pPR rate was 31% (14-52), 12% (3-31), and 27% (8-55), respectively. Median RFS was not reached in any arm; 18-mo RFS rates were 95% (95% CI, 70-99) in arm 1, 87% (56-97) in arm 2, and 73% (24-93) in arm 3. ORR was 50% (95% CI, 30-71), 32% (15-54), and 27% (8-55), respectively. Median EFS was not reached in any arm; 18-mo EFS rates were 81% (95% CI, 60-92), 61% (38-78), and 79% (47-93), respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Neoadjuvant pembro + vibo, pembro + geba, and pembro alone followed by adjuvant pembro had manageable safety and promising antitumor activity in patients with stage IIIB-D melanoma. Of the combination treatments, pembro + vibo showed the most promise.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Pembrolizumab,TIGIT,Oncolytic virus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Reinhard Dummer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline Robert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard A.

Atezolizumab (atezo) with bevacizumab (bev) is the standard of care for unresectable HCC based on the IMbrave150 study, which demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and objective response rate versus sorafenib (Finn NEJM 2020, Cheng J Hepatol 2022). On the basis of the antitumor activity of atezo + bev and its capacity to positively modulate the tumor microenvironment, IMbrave050 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant atezo + bev in delaying or preventing recurrence in patients (pts) with high-risk HCC.<br \/>Methods: IMbrave050 (NCT04102098) enrolled pts with HCC at high risk of recurrence following resection or ablation. High-risk criteria were based on tumor burden (tumor size and number), vascular invasion, and tumor differentiation. Pts were randomized to Arm A (atezo + bev) or Arm B (active surveillance). Stratification factors included geographic region (Asia-Pacific excluding Japan vs rest of world) and a composite factor encompassing the number of high-risk features, curative procedure, and use of optional adjuvant TACE (allowed for one cycle following resection). Pts in Arm A received atezo 1200 mg + bev 15 mg\/kg IV q3w for a period of one year or 17 cycles. Pts in Arm B underwent active surveillance for one year and were eligible to crossover to atezo + bev following independent review facility (IRF) confirmation of recurrence. The primary endpoint was IRF-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary efficacy endpoints included OS; investigator-assessed (INV) RFS; RFS and OS according to PD-L1 status; and time to extrahepatic spread and\/or macrovascular invasion.<br \/>Results: The ITT population included 334 pts each in Arms A and B. Baseline demographics were well balanced between arms. At interim analysis, with a median follow-up of 17.4 mo (cut off date: Oct 21, 2022), the primary endpoint was met with an IRF-RFS HR of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56, 0.93; <i>P<\/i>=0.0120), and results were generally consistent across clinical subgroups. INV-RFS was similar (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54, 0.91). The safety of atezo + bev was generally manageable and consistent with the well-established safety profile of each therapeutic agent and with the underlying disease.<br \/>Conclusions: Atezo + bev is the first adjuvant regimen to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in RFS vs active surveillance in pts at high risk of disease recurrence following resection or ablation. The benefit:risk profile of atezo + bev favors the use of this regimen as an adjuvant therapy and has potential to set a new standard of care in adjuvant HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL04-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,PD-L1,Adjuvant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pierce Chow<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minshan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ann-Lii Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed O.

This phase 1, open-label study (NCT03946800) showed that MEDI1191 in sequential (seq) or concurrent (conc) combination with IV D (anti-PD-L1) was safe and had preliminary antitumor activity in pts with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors who had progressed on SoC. Here we present updated analyses, including the first report of pts with deep-seated lesions.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In Part 1A (subcutaneous\/cutaneous [SC\/C] lesions), pts received MEDI1191 on Days 1 and 22, followed by D 1500 mg on Day 43 then Q4W. In Parts 1B (SC\/C) and 1D (deep-seated lesions), pts received MEDI1191 on Days 1, 29 and 57 then Q8W, with D on Day 1 then Q4W. Treatment continued for up to 2 years, until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary objectives included preliminary antitumor activity per RECIST v1.1 in injected\/non-injected lesions.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> As of October 5, 2022, 61 pts (40 had prior anti-PD-[L]1) received seq (Part 1A 0.1-12.0 &#956;g, n=25 [4\/25 had MEDI1191 only]) or conc (Part 1B 1.0-12.0 &#956;g, n=27; Part 1D 1.0-3.0 &#956;g, n=9) MEDI1191 + D. The most commonly represented cancer was melanoma (n=14). Pts in Part 1D had pancreatic (n=2), colorectal (n=2), gastric, anal, melanoma, neuroendocrine or unknown primary cancer (each n=1); all had hepatic metastases. There were no dose-limiting toxicities for MEDI1191 and no MTD was identified. Gr &#8805;3 MEDI1191-related AEs occurred in 3 pts (4.9%; Gr 3 asthenia and pyrexia, each n=1; Gr 4 lymphocyte count decreased, n=1); 2 pts (3.3%) had a MEDI1191-related serious AE (SAE; Gr 2 pyrexia and confusion, each n=1). Gr &#8805;3 D-related AEs occurred in 3 pts (4.9%; Gr 3 asthenia, pyrexia [both also MEDI1191-related] and pruritus; each n=1); 1 pt (1.6%) had a D- and MEDI1191-related SAE (Gr 2 pyrexia). In Parts 1A and 1B, 7 pts had partial responses (PRs): 5 confirmed (cPRs) in melanoma (n=2), sarcoma, breast and neuroendocrine cancer (each n=1), and 2 unconfirmed (uPRs) in melanoma and head and neck cancer (each n=1); no pts had PRs in Part 1D. 3\/5 pts with cPR had prior anti-PD-(L)1; 2\/3 also had prior anti-CTLA-4. For the 5 cPRs, DoR was 1.9-22.3 months (median not reached); 3 had ongoing PRs and 2 had stable disease (SD) at data cutoff. Non-target injected lesions shrank in 4 pts with cPRs. Overall, 15 pts had SD (including the 2 uPRs). MEDI1191 induced pharmacodynamic changes in the periphery and tumor microenvironment. A &#8805;2-fold increase in serum IL-12 levels was seen in 42\/46 pts, with increases in serum IFN&#947; in 37\/46; 9\/22 pts had &#8805;2-fold increases in CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and tumoral PD-L1 expression.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: MEDI1191 + D was safe and tolerable in pts with SC\/C or deep-seated lesions. Antitumor activity was seen in injected and distant lesions, and pharmacodynamic activity was consistent with expectations based on mechanistic biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Interleukin-12,Durvalumab,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eduardo Castañón<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitriy Zamarin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benedito A.

AEGEAN (NCT03800134) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial assessing neoadjuvant durvalumab (D) + chemotherapy (CT) followed by surgery (Sx) and adjuvant D in patients (pts) with R-NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Adults with treatment (Tx)-na&#239;ve R-NSCLC (stage II-IIIB[N2]; AJCC 8th ed) and ECOG PS 0\/1 were randomized (1:1) to receive D 1500 mg or PBO IV + platinum-based CT (every 3 weeks [Q3W] for 4 cycles) before Sx, then further D 1500 mg or PBO IV (Q4W, up to 12 cycles). Pts were stratified by disease stage (II vs III) and PD-L1 tumor cell expression (&#60;1% vs &#8805;1%, Ventana SP263). Pts with documented EGFR\/ALK aberrations were excluded from the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population for efficacy analyses. The primary endpoints were pathological complete response (pCR), evaluated centrally, and event-free survival (EFS; using RECIST v1.1), evaluated by BICR. Safety was assessed in all pts who received &#8805;1 study Tx dose.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Between Jan 2, 2019, and Apr 19, 2022, 802 pts were randomized to the ITT population (n=740 in the mITT population) of whom 799 received Tx (D arm, n=400; PBO arm, n=399). Baseline characteristics were largely balanced (mITT). Overall, 84.7% in the D arm and 87.2% in PBO arm completed 4 cycles of platinum-doublet CT and 77.6% and 76.7%, respectively, completed Sx (mITT). As of Nov 10, 2022 (data cutoff), median EFS follow-up in censored pts was 11.7 months (mITT). The pCR rate was significantly higher and EFS significantly prolonged in the D vs PBO arms (mITT) (Table). In the safety analysis set, maximum grade 3\/4 any-cause AEs occurred in 42.3% vs 43.4% in the D and PBO arms, respectively, during the overall Tx period.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The AEGEAN trial met both of its primary endpoints of improved pCR and EFS. Perioperative D plus neoadjuvant CT was associated with a manageable safety profile.<br \/>Clinical trial identification: NCT03800134 (release date: January 11, 2019)<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{7D53BC68-7C90-4958-8C5E-DB121E7F4583}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Endpoint<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">D arm<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBO arm<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tx effect<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P value<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">pCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n\/N: 63\/366 (17.2%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n\/N: 16\/374 (4.3%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Difference in pCR (95% CI), %: 13.0 (8.7-17.6)<sup>a<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.000036 (assessed at IA)<sup>b<\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">EFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n events\/N: 98\/366 (26.8%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n events\/N: 138\/374 (36.9%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI): 0.68 (0.53-0.88)<sup>d<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">0.003902<sup>e<\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median (95% CI), months: NR (31.9-NR)<sup>c<\/sup><br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median (95% CI), months: 25.9 (18.9-NR)<sup>c<\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\"><sup>a<\/sup>CIs by stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method. <sup>b<\/sup>Statistical significance was achieved at the IA (402 pts; data cutoff, Jan 14, 2022); no testing was performed at FA.
