[{"Abstract":"Objective: The microbiome is associated with the pathogenesis and progression of disease in gastric cancer (GC). Eradication of <i>Helicobacter pylori<\/i> has reduced overall GC incidence, however, gastroesophageal cancer (GEJC) continues to increase. While there are oncologic differences between GEJC and GC, distinctions based on microbial profiles are unknown. In this study, we characterize differences in the microbial profiles of GEJC and GC.<br \/>Methods: 562 patients with microsatellite stable GC (n=303) and GEJC (n=259) who had an institutional Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets assay on the primary tumor were included in the study. A validated microbiome bioinformatics pipeline that is generalizable across multiple next generation sequencing platforms was utilized to compare microbial enrichment and alpha diversity between GC and GEJC, defined by type 1-3 Siewert classification.<br \/>Results: Over 20 unique microbial species were enriched in GC when compared to GEJC, including <i>Helicobacter <\/i>and <i>Lymphocryptovirus<\/i><i> <\/i>(Table 1). <i>Prevotella <\/i>had increased incidence in GEJC (OR:1.57,95%CI:1.02,2.41). Siewert type 2 and 3 GEJC had a significantly lower alpha diversity compared to GC. There was no significant difference in alpha diversity between GC and Siewert type 1 GEJC.<br \/>Conclusion: There are distinct differences in microbial enrichment and alpha diversity between GEJC and GC. <i>Helicobacter<\/i> and <i>Lymphocryptovirus<\/i>, the genus family for Epstein Bar Virus, were noted to have the highest odds ratios in the GC group. Our findings showing the reduced incidence of microbes in GEJC which are the current targets of GC screening, prevention, and therapy, have implications in evaluating optimal preventative and treatment strategies in GEJC.<br \/>Table 1.

After quality control, reads were aligned with human reference genome with Kraken2 for species level identification of bacteria. Contaminants (false positives) were removed based on higher frequencies and negative control (reference control) of 2,491 sterile cell experiments. Seuret Findmarkers, scIntegrate, and scDensity Plot were utilized to normalize the data, cluster the cells, and calculate markers in each cluster of differentially expressed genes between the two conditions. We focused our analysis on <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/i> due to high urogenital virulence, and immunomodulation capabilities by pattern recognition receptors and inflammasome.<br \/>Results: We identified presence of three over-represented intracellular taxa in tissue biopsies of patients with BC compared to healthy controls (after false discovery rate correction and cross validation of contaminants). Patients with history of high-grade BC demonstrated increased presence of Aeromonas (175,473 reads, 54%), Pseudomonas (75,002 reads, 26.73%), and Bacillus (15,410 reads, 5.49%) in their tissue samples, not visualized in healthy controls (counts &#60;10).

However, the impact of microbiome on short-term postoperative complications after CRC surgery is not well investigated. This study aimed to investigate whether the gut microbial diversity and composition in CRC patients were associated with the occurrence of short-term postoperative complications.<br \/>Methods: We linked the clinical data and preoperative sequencing data of fecal samples of 331 patients who underwent CRC surgery from 2017 to 2019 in Seoul National University Hospital. Short-term postoperative complications were defined as first complications that developed within 30 days of surgery. We used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of effect size (LEfSe) in the Galaxy webserver to identify enriched bacteria in patients with and without complications. Then, we calculated microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) by each patient and compared them according to the complication status. Wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted to compare the alpha diversity indices according to the complication event. Subgroup analyses according to types of complications were also performed: surgical procedure-related (SP) group and nonsurgical procedure-related (NSP) group.<br \/>Results: Overall, 84 patients (25%) developed short-term postoperative complications: SP group (n=39) and NSP group (n=45). From the LEfSe analysis, <i>Bacteroides uniformis<\/i> (LDA score: 3.64, p-value 0.04) and <i>Clostridium colicanis<\/i> (LDA score: 3.39, p-value 0.01) were enriched in patients who developed short-term complications, whereas <i>Roseburia faecis <\/i>(LDA score: 3.26, p-value 0.05), <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum<\/i> (LDA score: 2.98, p-value 0.03), <i>Faecalibacterium sp. <\/i>(LDA score: 3.12, p-value 0.02) and <i>Prevotella nigrescens <\/i>(LDA score: 2.87, p-value 0.05) were enriched in patients without complications. When compared with patients without complications, taxa related to class <i>Gammaproteobacteria<\/i>, genus <i>Clostridium<\/i>, species <i>Roseburia faecis<\/i>, and <i>Desulfovibrio D168<\/i> were abundant in the SP group. Alpha diversity indices were not significantly different according to the complication status or the type of complication. MDI from the enriched bacteria were significantly higher in patients with complications compared to those without complications (p-value&#60;0.001), and MDI of the SP group were also significantly higher than that of patients free of complications (p-value 0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study suggests a potential relationship between microbial composition and surgical outcome in CRC patients. No significant difference in alpha diversity was observed according to the occurrence or the type of complication.

Newer treatments against solid tumors include an oncolytic adenovirus armed with T-cell activator OX40L, named Delta-24-RGDOX, which expresses the positive immune checkpoint OX-40L. While studies have revealed the interaction between the gut microbiome and immunotherapy agents, it&#8217;s still unknown how the gut microbiome might influence viroimmunotherapy efficacy. We hypothesized that the gut microbiota plays an important role in modulating the virus-driven anti-tumor response. To test this hypothesis, immunocompetent C57BL\/6 mice were subcutaneously implanted M12Luc gastric cancer cells and were administered PBS (control) or Delta-24-RGDOX by intratumoral injections. Mice fecal pellets were collected at three different time points: (1) before tumor implantation, (2) after tumor establishment, and (3) 14 days after the first dose of the treatment. Genomic DNA was isolated with the QIAGEN DNeasy Powersoil Kit from fecal pellets of cancer-bearing mice (n=60), and the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (prokaryotes) was sequenced using the Illumina platform. Data was deposited in QIITA for quality assessment, followed by microbial community analysis using the taxonomic reference database SILVA and the downstream platforms QIIME2 and R with a rarefaction depth of 9,187 reads per sample. We found significant differences in the gut microbiome community structure of viroimmunotherapy-treated mice compared to controls (ANOSIM p-value=0.025). No differences in gut diversity were observed, although control animals tended to show higher richness (Kruskal-Wallis p-value&#62;0.05).

Majority of patients with gastric MALT lymphoma are infected with <i>Helicobacter pylori<\/i> and also have clinical improvement with eradication therapy. However, it is unclear how <i>H. pylori<\/i> cause gastric MALT lymphoma. To explore it, we prospectively collected 13 patients who are newly diagnosed with gastric MALT lymphoma with <i>H. pylori.<\/i> We gathered samples from normal regions and lesions during endoscopy for diagnosis. Samples of lesion were harvested again after eradication of <i>H. pylori<\/i>. we sequenced 10 of WES (whole exome sequencing) and 13 of WTS (whole transcriptome sequencing) with these samples. With sequencing data, we aligned the sequenced reads to human reference genome (hg19) using BWA and called the variants with Mutect2. We aligned the reads and calculated TPM (Transcripts Per Million) from WTS with STAR and RSEM. We performed DEG (Differentially Expressed Genes) and GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) for three comparison groups which are divided into normal, lesion, and after eradication. Gene fusions were detected using STAR-Fusion and Arriba with WTS. To detect potential microbiome from the samples, we used Kraken2, a taxonomic classification tool. We found that <i>MUC6<\/i> was mutated from all samples and some samples have mutated <i>MUC3A, KMT2C<\/i>, <i>ZNF595<\/i>, <i>CDC27,<\/i> etc., and two have <i>BIRC3<\/i>-<i>MALT1<\/i> fusion. From DEG and GSEA analysis, G protein-coupled receptor activity was activated in the group of lesion samples and suppressed in normal samples and eradication samples. Lymphocyte activation and immune response were also activated in the cancerous lesion. Kraken2 classified the reads which were not aligned to the human reference genome as reads from microbiota including <i>H. pylori<\/i>. The reads of <i>H. pylori<\/i> were more abundant in the lesion group than the other groups. According to the result of differentially expressed species analysis between the groups of lesion and eradication, the following species were also more abundant in the lesion group; <i>Veillonella dispar, Helicobacter hepaticus, Helicobacter winghamensis, <\/i>etc. We analyzed genetic alterations and differentially expressed genes and also classified non-human reads as microbiome with sequencing data from gastric MALT lymphoma.

Over 90% of oral cancer is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). OSCC is a global health problem because of its late diagnosis and high rate of relapse and metastasis. Currently, cumulative evidence has suggested the association between oral microbiome and oral cancer. However, the correlation between the oral microbiome and OSCC recurrence remained unclear. Therefore, we investigated the OSCC patients&#8217; oral microbiota to understand the roles of oral microbiome in the recurrence of OSCC.<br \/>Materials and Methods: To evaluate the role of the oral microbiome in the recurrence of oral cancer, we compared the oral bacterial composition of tumor samples from the OSCC patients with or without recurrence based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of 54 oral swab samples. Then, the structures of the oral microbiome were analyzed to establish a prediction model for the recurrence of OSCC. To identify microbial signatures capable of distinguishing recurrence from non-recurrence, the 54 tumor samples from OSCC patients were used as a training dataset. Furthermore, 46 external tumor samples from other OSCC patients were used to validate the dataset.<br \/>Results: The oral bacterial compositions differed in OSCC patients between with and without recurrence. Compared to nonrecurrence OSCC, periodontitis-related bacteria were enriched in OSCC recurrence. Functional analysis of the oral microbiome showed several functions associated with OSCC recurrence including amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, glucose utilization, and drug resistance. Subsequently, we established a random forest prediction model with high accuracy (accuracy = 0.963) to discriminate OSCC recurrence from the original OSCC based on five specific microbial signatures. Moreover, the prediction model achieved an accuracy of 0.761 in another independent cohort (46 OSCC patients). On the other hand, the accuracy predicted by the current clinical-used model was 0.519 with the training dataset. Thus, our novel model could improve the prediction accuracy of OSCC recurrence.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, we elucidated the relationship between oral bacteria and the recurrence of OSCC. Moreover, we established a novel bacteria-based prediction model for the recurrence of OSCC. Thus, the present study provided a new insight and treatment strategy for the clinical prediction of OSCC recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral microbiome,Oral cancers,Recurrence,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wei-Ni Lyu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mei-Chun Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, Pei-Jen Lou<sup>2<\/sup>, Liang-Chuan Lai<sup>1<\/sup>, Mong-Hsun Tsai<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4bee149d-0339-4356-a2b5-15feacfa3cb7","ControlNumber":"2574","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

TNM classification varied across the cohort (15% pT1, 43% pT2, 35% pT3, 4% pT4). 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed to map the microbiome composition of tumor and paired normal mucosa. 20 bacterial from the genera whose abundance changed significantly between tumor and healthy tissue were incubated with 5FU to assess drug-bacteria interactions. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was employed to identify changes in drug concentration (Wilcoxon spare rank test) as well as products of bacteria-driven drug metabolism. A metabolic activity-based assay was used to assess viability of a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HCA46) following co-incubation with microbe-driven drug metabolites, aiming to determine significant effects on 5FU efficacy, assessed by 2-way ANOVA.<br \/>Results: <i>Escherichia coli<\/i> BW25113, <i>Bifidobacterium longum<\/i>, <i>Citrobacter <\/i><i>freundii<\/i> and <i>Enterococcus <\/i><i>f<\/i><i>aecalis<\/i> significantly modify 5FU <i>in vitro<\/i>, allowing us to conclude that bacteria can metabolise the drug <i>(q<\/i><i> <\/i>&#60; 0.001<i>).<\/i> <i>Ruminococcus<\/i><i> <\/i><i>gnavus<\/i> does not have the ability to metabolise the drug as no significant change in 5FU concentration was observed.

However, systematic assessment of its impact on DNA damage response is lacking and the effect of colibactin exposure on response to other genotoxic agents (such as chemotherapy) is missing.<br \/>Materials and Methods: We implemented an <i>in vitro<\/i> bacteria-coculture system to assess the effect of colibactin on a representative subset of 40 molecularly and pharmacologically annotated CRC cell lines and in a panel of isogenic DDR KO cell lines we generated. We further validated our results in patient-derived organoids. Finally, we recapitulated prolonged exposure to colibactin occurring during tumorigenesis by chronically infecting sensitive cells until the emergence of a tolerant phenotype. }<br \/>Results: We found that different cell lines display specific sensitivity to colibactin&#8217;s genotoxic stress: while colibactin-tolerant cells are capable to quickly and efficiently repair colibactin-induced DNA damage, sensitive cells lack this ability. Moreover, we found that homologous recombination (HR) proficiency discriminates colibactin-tolerant cells, which display higher levels of RAD51 foci (as marker of activation of HR) compared to sensitive cells upon infection with colibactin. Screening of isogenic DDR KO cell lines revealed that genetic inactivation of the intertwined pathways of HR (through KO of <i>ATM<\/i>) and replication stress (RS) response (through KO of <i>ATRIP<\/i>) significantly sensitized cells to colibactin. In addition, we found that restoration of HR activity was sufficient to induce a colibactin-tolerant phenotype in initially sensitive cell lines. Notably, thanks to a previous effort of pharmacological characterization of CRC cell lines in our lab, we found a significant correlation between sensitivity to colibactin and irinotecan active metabolite SN38, but not oxaliplatin. We validated the same correlation in patient-derived organoids annotated for response to SN38. While colibactin, SN38 and oxaliplatin all induced RS in treated cells, we found that colibactin and SN38 showed a similar DNA damage response which involved activation of ATM. Finally, chronic re-infection of sensitive, HR-deficient CRC cells with colibactin selected a tolerant phenotype characterized by restoration of HR activity. Of translational relevance, colibactin-tolerant derivative cells acquired cross-resistance to SN38 and PARP inhibitor olaparib but not to oxaliplatin.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results shed novel insight into colibactin&#8217;s genotoxic mechanism and support a model in which colibactin both promotes tumorigenesis and acts as an evolutionary bottleneck which selects HR proficient CRC cells. Furthermore, our study provides preclinical evidence on colibactin&#8217;s role in promoting chemoresistance in colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,DNA repair,Chemoresistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alberto Sogari<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emanuele Rovera<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicole Megan Reilly<sup>2<\/sup>, Simona Lamba<sup>3<\/sup>, Mariangela Russo<sup>2<\/sup>, Annalisa Lorenzato<sup>1<\/sup>, Erika Durinikova<sup>3<\/sup>, Livio Trusolino<sup>1<\/sup>, Sabrina Arena<sup>1<\/sup>, Manuela Donalisio<sup>4<\/sup>, Federica Di Nicolantonio<sup>1<\/sup>, David Lembo<sup>4<\/sup>, Alberto Bardelli<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Oncology, University of Torino - Candiolo Cancer Institute FPO-IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Torino - Candiolo Cancer Institute FPO-IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Candiolo Cancer Institute FPO-IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Orbassano, Italy,<sup>5<\/sup>University of Torino; IFOM - Istituto Fondazione di Oncologia Molecolare, ETS, Candiolo, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"46efe98f-0d8a-4c9d-8536-18a5edf0e5dc","ControlNumber":"4666","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

We examined the gut microbiome composition and tumor genomic profiles in a diverse cohort of rectal cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: Twenty-two patients with newly-diagnosed, Stage II-IV rectal cancer without pathogenic germline mutations (mismatch repair genes, <i>MUTYH<\/i>) were included in the study. Gut microbiome profiling was performed on genomic DNA extracted from collected fecal samples (16S rRNA sequencing, V4 region). Tumor specimens were tested for somatic and germline mutations using the Tempus xT 648-gene panel and whole transcriptome RNA sequencing, providing information on tumor mutation burden (TMB), pathogenic <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation status and consensus molecular subtype (CMS). We then assessed differential abundance of microbial taxa (using ANCOM-BC) between the following groups: high vs low TMB (dichotomized at median, 3.7 mut\/MB), presence versus absence of pathogenic <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation, and CMS subtype.<br \/>Results: The median age of study subjects was 49 years (range 37-78).

Twelve tumors carried a pathogenic <i>KRAS <\/i>variant and the median TMB was 3.7 m\/MB (range 0.5-8.9 m\/MB). Among 20 tumors that underwent whole transcriptome RNA sequencing, 1 was categorized as CMS1, 8 CMS2, 3 CMS3, 7 CMS4, and 2 CMS undetermined. There were no statistically significant differences in gut bacteria taxa abundance by <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation status or among CMS subtypes. The group with greater than median TMB, however, had statistically significant enrichment of <i>Pepostreptococcus stomatis<\/i> (18.4 fold increase, p=0.039 after Benjamini-Hotchberg adjustment with FDR = 0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: In this pilot study, we found that CRC patients with higher TMB had an enrichment of <i>Peptostreptococcus stomatis<\/i>, a bacteria associated with colonic dysplasia in mouse models and enriched in CRC patients as compared to healthy controls. (PMID 28823860, 35292756) Higher TMB is a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy across cancer types including CRC.

Most BTC patients are diagnosed at an unresectable stage; further, the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy for BTC remains unsatisfactory. Recently, there is growing evidence that gut microbial dysbiosis is related to multiple diseases, including biliary disease and cancer. However, the association between tumor and gut microbiome environments and BTC, especially extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCA), remains unclear. In the present study, we compared the microbiome from the tissue and stool samples of EH-CCA patients and healthy living liver donors (controls). Methods: A total of 24 people (13 EH-CCA patients and 11 healthy controls) were included. We collected fecal and swab samples, which were obtained from the EH-CCA tissues of the patients and normal gallbladder tissues of the controls during operation. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V3 and V4 region) was amplified using PCR and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The QIIME 2 pipelines were used to analyze the raw data. Results: The median age of the patients and controls were 70 (range, 58-79) and 29 (range, 19-35) years, respectively. The swab samples from EH-CCA patients showed significantly lower alpha diversity than the samples from the controls (pShannon &#60; 0.001). Proteobacteria was the most commonly found phylum (53%) in the EH-CCA patients; Firmicutes (79%) and Actinobacteria (13%) were the common phyla in the controls. The genera Streptococcus (25.1%), Escherichia_Shigella (16.9%), and Enterococcus (13.9%) were found in the patient samples, whereas Blautia (12%), Limosilactobacillus (12%), and Bifidobacterium (19%) were observed in the controls. The Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plot of the weighted UniFrac distances showed that the patient and control groups formed separate clusters. Among the fecal samples, Streptococcus (12.5%), bacterioides (8.2%) is most common in patients&#8217; group, whereas Blautia (13.8%) and Faecalibacterium (11.5%) is most common in control group at the gene levels. The PCoA plot of the fecal samples showed significant differences in microbiota composition between the EH-CCA patients and healthy controls (P=0.001 by PERMANOVA). In the beta diversity analysis of all samples (swab plus fecal), the patient-swab samples formed distinct clusters, whereas the patient-fecal, control-swab, and control-fecal samples showed overlapping clusters.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that compares the microbiome of tissues and stools from EH-CCA patients and healthy controls; the EH-CCA patients and healthy controls showed different microbiota profiles. Further studies are needed to investigate the clinical implications of microbial dysbiosis in BTC and formulate novel microbiome-based treatments for BTC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Cholangiocarcinoma,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sora Kang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jihee Kang<sup>2<\/sup>, Gun-Seok Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Seung-Hyun Ko<sup>2<\/sup>, Jung-Hyun Park<sup>3<\/sup>, Yunseon Jang<sup>3<\/sup>, Ik-Chan Song<sup>4<\/sup>, Hyewon Ryu<sup>5<\/sup>, Seok-Hwan Kim<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Division of Hemato-oncology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>AtoGen Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Translational Immunology Institute, Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Division of hemato-oncology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Division of Liver Transplantation and Hepatobiliary Surgery, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"38c36999-d7da-4492-910b-1adafce2158a","ControlNumber":"5504","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Samples were provided by eight members of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN). Non-response was determined as change in treatment after less than 12 months. Patients maintaining the same treatment regimen for greater than 12 months were classified as responders.<br \/>We applied our custom tool, {exotic} (Exogenous sequences in Tumor and Immune Cells), to carefully identify non-human sequences within the RNAseq data. After filtering reads aligning to the human reference genome, reads were further filtered of common laboratory contaminants, taxa inversely correlated with input RNA quantity, and taxa frequently found in the negative controls of microbiome experiments. A differential abundance analysis was performed on the response groups at every taxonomic level utilizing DESeq2. We calculated expression signatures using {tmesig}, and related them to ICB response using {IOSig}.<br \/>We observed significantly enriched taxa (p-value &#60; 0.05) with a high (&#62;1.00) fold-difference in abundance between responders and non-responders found within the tumor RNAseq data, including <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum<\/i> and several viruses in responders, and <i>Delftia lacustris<\/i> and Fungi in non-responders. These microbes were associated with immune cell expression signatures, including Th17 cells and CD8+ T-cells.<br \/>We calculated the gene expression scores of 30 signatures with literature precedence for the ability to predict ICB treatment outcomes in melanoma. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of the random forest classification model for prediction of response to ICB using the combined expression signature scores resulted in an AUC of 0.8750. Combining expression signature scores with microbe relative abundances at the genus level improved the ability to predict ICB response (AUC = 0.8958).<br \/>Combining tumor expression signatures with curated tumor microbiome relative abundances improves the performance of predictive models for treatment outcomes with ICB in melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Caroline  E.

Focusing on microbial dysbiosis, our lab discovered the pivotal role of the enterotoxigenic <i>Bacteroides fragilis<\/i> (ETBF) in promoting breast tumorigenesis through activation of key oncogenic pathways. A gap in knowledge exists regarding how microbes\/microbial toxins modulate the oncogenic pathways in cancer cells. Polyamines are imperative for various physiological processes, including cell growth, survival, differentiation and apoptosis and are strongly associated with breast cancer. We questioned the involvement of polyamine pathway in mediating the oncogenic effects of microbial dysbiosis on breast cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Human Her2 expressing spontaneous breast cancer model, MMTV.f.HuHer2 mice, were infected with ETBF and tumor incidence and progression were monitored for 18 months. We used qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry to examine expression of key nodes of polyamine pathway. Various growth, migration and invasion assays were performed to assess carcinogenic properties in breast cancer cells. We employed a colorimetric-based assay to analyze enzymatic activities of key polyamine metabolic members. ROS generation was examined <i>via<\/i> DCFA staining.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our <i>in vivo <\/i>data showed that ETBF colonization in mice led to a considerable increase in the level of spermine oxidase (SMOX) in breast tumors, hinting at a correlation between ETBF and polyamine metabolism. Moreover, a marked rise in expression of &#947;H2AX foci was observed in these tumors and in breast cancer cells, suggesting a critical role of ETBF in SMOX-related DNA damage. In agreement, we found SMOX upregulation in breast cancer cells. Our findings displayed a substantial increase in SMOX enzymatic activity in the presence of ETBF toxin, BFT, in breast tumor cells. BFT caused a marked rise in ROS generation of breast tumor cells, suggesting a plausible association of ETBF in SMOX-mediated oxidative stress. Interestingly, we noted a significant induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) expression and activity in response to ETBF or BFT in breast cancer cells. Treatment of BFT-exposed breast cancer cells with SMOX inhibitors led to a sharp inhibition of neoplastic transformations, like cellular migration and &#947;H2AX induction.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our collated evidences suggest the existence of an important cross-talk between key polyamine metabolic enzymes and ETBF that aids in exacerbating breast tumorigenesis. Of importance, therapeutic inhibition of SMOX dramatically impeded BFT-related breast tumorigenesis. Collectively, our results demonstrated the attractive potential of intervening the polyamine catabolic pathway for the management of breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Polyamines,Microbiome,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Deeptashree Nandi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sheetal Parida<sup>1<\/sup>, Sowjanya Thatikonda<sup>1<\/sup>, Jackson Foley<sup>1<\/sup>, Tracy Stewart<sup>1<\/sup>, Cynthia  L.

The emergence of long-term patient management has been transformed among health care professionals as patient survival rates are increasing significantly. Despite promising advances, patient outcomes are heterogenic and are correlative to host intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Multiple reports have highlighted the negative effects of cancer treatments towards inducing cognitive impairment and neurotoxicity often referred to as &#8220;chemofog&#8221;. More recently, the gut microbiome has been increasingly recognized to regulate antitumor immunity and further distinct microbiome signatures can confer favorable outcomes in the context of CICB. Interestingly, specific microbes within the gut microbiome have been shown to regulate social behavior and cognition via the bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis though changes in microbiota-derived metabolites and vagal afferent fibers. Insights into mechanisms of immunotherapy induced cognitive decline are warranted. Thus, we hypothesize CICB exacerbates cognitive impairment and neurotoxicity via the detrimental alterations to the gut microbiome. To address this, we profiled the gut microbiome, through 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples from patients (n=146) with advanced melanoma treated with CICB stratified based on severity of cognitive dissonance. Beta-diversity, incorporating weighted UniFrac distances by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), revealed a cluster of samples from patients with cognitive impairment as compared to samples from those with minimal to absent cognitive decline. Further, taxonomical analysis showed significant alterations in relative abundances of microbial candidates (e.g., <i>L. intestinalis<\/i>, <i>A. muciniphila<\/i>, <i>F. prausnitizii<\/i>, and <i>R. hominis<\/i>). These results suggests that CICB patients with cognitive impairments and neurotoxicity have altered microbiome signatures which may potentially exacerbate downstream neuroinflammatory signaling. Further studies investigating specific host-microbe pathways and profiling microbiota-derived metabolites which are implicated in these detrimental effects are essential for biomarker discovery and mechanistic insight.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gut microbiota,Metabolomics,Biomarkers,Neurotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anik Banerjee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christina Roland<sup>2<\/sup>, Sarah Johnson<sup>2<\/sup>, Nadim Ajami<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Wargo<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>MD Anderson UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedicial Sciences, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e94f03af-7e3e-471d-832f-076193f2726d","ControlNumber":"6691","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

We evaluated RNAseq data from n = 2,892 tumors , including colorectal adenocarcinomas, lung adeno- and squamous cell carcinomas, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, melanomas, and thyroid carcinomas, using the tool {exotic}. Matched cancers from the Cancer Genome Atlas were processed by the same method (n = 2,720 samples). Clinical data, including treatment information, lab values, detailed histology, and long-term follow-up, were collected and harmonized across sites. Microbe abundances (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) were associated with clinical features and human gene expression, which was deconvolved into immune cell composition using {CIBERSORT} and {TIMEx}, and aggregated into expression signatures using {tmesig} and {IOSig}. Microbes were found in all tumors and associated with treatment outcomes for all modalities tested, including radiation in colorectal cancer, chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer, and immunotherapy in melanoma. In the case of radiation treatment in colorectal cancer, the microbes also affected outcomes in preclinical model systems and were modified by altering hypoxia levels with the drug atovaquone. Virus prevalence associated with histological subtypes in lung cancer. Similar microbes in ORIEN and TCGA tumors associated with overall survival in subtypes of sarcoma (dedifferentiated liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and others).

Unfortunately, survival rates for cancer patients have stayed poor for many decades. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify novel strategies for early cancer detection and prevention. Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiome including bacteria may have a role in cancer initiation and progression. These bacteria play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. An imbalance in the bacterial composition may cause diseases including cancer. This evidence led us to hypothesize that the changes in the composition of the gut microbiome can be used as a biomarker for early cancer detection. To test this hypothesis, we focused on analyzing the microbial community of colorectal and blood cancers, which have poor survival rates.<br \/><b>Methods and Results: <\/b>To analyze the association of cancer with the microbiome, we used a published microbiome dataset of leukemic and healthy individuals that were collected by sequencing stool samples (Oliver et al., 2022). We identified that specific bacteria are either abundant, such as <i>Faecalibacterium<\/i> (1.17 fold), or reduced, such as <i>Clostridium<\/i> (0.32 fold, <i>p <\/i>value=0.0029), in leukemia patients compared to healthy controls. We observed similar correlations by analyzing the published colorectal cancer data (Flemer et al., 2017) in which <i>Prevotella<\/i> increased by 3.75 fold and <i>Escherichia\/Shigella <\/i>increased by 4.0 fold in colorectal cancer while <i>Blautia <\/i>is reduced compared to healthy controls. <i>Faecalibacterium,<\/i> which is abundant in leukemia, is reduced in colorectal cancer. Further, we found that treatment of leukemia patients normalized the abundance of these bacteria to the level of healthy patients. To improve analysis efficiency, we applied machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of cancer in patients based on the composition of bacteria, age, gender, and symptoms. Among the tested algorithms, the decision tree and Random Forest both had very high false-negative rates, with 45.5% and 40% respectively, as well as having low sensitivities, with 50% and 60% respectively. The support Vector Machine had a suboptimal false-negative rate of 28.6% and good sensitivity of 80%. Finally, the Neural network had a good false-negative rate of 16.7% and great sensitivity of 90%. Overall, our results suggest that different cancers have an abundance of specific bacteria that can be used as biomarkers for cancer detection.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We demonstrate that the increased abundance of certain bacteria in the microbiome can be used as a biomarker for cancer detection. Our data set was small for this project, but the machine learning approaches can be used to further predict cancer These are clinically relevant findings as a microbiome test would be non-invasive and easily accessible that can be performed at a routine checkup.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Microbiome,Cancer cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ekansh Mittal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Oliver<sup>2<\/sup>, Kenza El Alaoui<sup>2<\/sup>, Carolyn Haunschild<sup>2<\/sup>, Julio Avelar-Barragan<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura  F.

Many studies have demonstrated the important roles of the microbiome in cancer progression, anti-tumor immunity, resistance to therapies, metastasis formation, and in some rare cases even cancer development through the production of genotoxins. However, relatively few studies have analyzed the lung cancer microbiome, and both its composition and role in cancer progression are largely unknown. To characterize the microbiome of tumor and matched normal lung tissues, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 872 never smokers using the Kraken pipeline. At the phylum level, WGS analyses of tumor and normal samples showed predominantly <i>Proteobacteria<\/i> and <i>Actinobacteria <\/i>(58% and 32%, respectively). Notably, we found overall similar microbiome composition in tumor and normal lung tissue samples. At the genus level, <i>Cutibacterium, Klebsiella<\/i>, <i>Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, and Acinetobacter <\/i>genera were among the most abundant bacteria in tumor and normal tissues, alike, and the genera <i>Prevotella<\/i>, <i>Corynebacterium<\/i>, and <i>Streptococcus <\/i>were more abundant in tumor samples compared to normal lung tissue. Comparison of alpha diversity at the genus level between tumors and normal samples showed no substantial difference. We are currently investigating whether the microbiome composition varies by lung tumor anatomical location, sex, histology, study subjects&#8217; geographical location, and immune microenvironment. We will also investigate whether the tumor microbiome composition varies in relation to important genomic features, like cancer driver genes and mutational signatures. Finally, we have 16s rRNA seq data from 771 tumor and normal lung tissues from never smokers and we will compare bacterial microbiome composition and diversity based on WGS and 16s rRNA seq for the same samples. This study, based on the largest analysis of lung microbiome to date, is poised to provide important insights into the role of commensal microbiota in shaping lung tumor development and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Lung cancer,Whole genome sequencing,Never smoker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>John McElderry<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tongwu Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jianxin Shi<sup><\/sup>, Maria Teresa Landi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>NCI Div. of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, Rockville, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"83f8d27c-43bd-4ef6-b4a4-9da4c2f1b20c","ControlNumber":"7389","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

It has been reported that the composition of the oral microbiome was shifted in OSCC patients compared to healthy subjects. In particular, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/i> was enriched in the oral cavity of OSCC patients. Bitter taste receptors (taste 2 receptors, TAS2Rs), known as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), can recognize quorum sensing molecules, such as N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (oxo-C12) secreted from <i>P. aeruginosa<\/i>. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis, downregulation of TAS2Rs was correlated with poor prognosis in various cancers. This prompted us to investigate the role of TAS2Rs in oral dysbiosis and cancers. Here, we found that TAS2Rs mediated both apoptosis and pyroptosis, distinct types of programmed cell death, in response to oxo-C12, in OSCC cell lines. Of note, it was blocked by knockdown of <i>TAS2R4, 14<\/i>, or <i>38<\/i>. Unexpectedly, TAS2Rs-mediated apoptosis and pyroptosis were GPCR-independent. Given our observation that the blockade of NLRP3 inflammasome attenuated oxo-C12-induced OSCC cell death, TAS2Rs seem to recruit NLRP3 inflammasome rather than G protein signaling pathway in order to mediate the programmed cell death in OSCC. Once NLRP3 is activated, caspase-8 triggered both apoptosis and pyroptosis in response to oxo-C12, supporting the role of TAS2Rs-NLRP3-caspase-8 axis. Interestingly, siRNA knockdown of <i>MyD88<\/i> diminished oxo-C12-induced programmed cell death, implying the possible involvement of MyD88 in the TAS2Rs-NLRP3-caspase-8 axis. Taken together, bitter taste receptors promote the programmed cell death of OSCC in response to oral dysbiosis through activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which further supports TAS2Rs as prognostic markers in OSCC. Thus, these results will shed light on better understanding of interplay between microbiome and cancer, proposing TAS2Rs as novel therapeutic targets in oral dysbiosis-induced OSCC development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Bitter taste receptor,Cancer cell death,Quorum sensing molecule,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Byeong-Oh Hwang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Se-Young Park<sup><\/sup>, Na-Young Song<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cdb3cfbc-4aa3-42cf-9958-2fcf0ed7622b","ControlNumber":"3190","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Yet, 30% of patients do not respond and of those, half will later die of metastasis. Combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy (CT) thus presents a worthy candidate to fulfill this unmet need. In preclinical models, improved antitumor responses when RT is combined with PD-1\/ PD-L1 blockade have been described. Yet, there remains a flagrant lack of knowledge on the determinants of combination therapy success. In this context, the composition of the gut microbiome is critical in conditioning local and peripheral immunity. Recent metagenomic studies have shown the gut microbiome influences the efficacy of PD-1-based IT in epithelial tumors, melanoma, and lung cancer, to name a few. In addition, modification of the gut microbiome with oral gavage of immunogenic bacteria potentiates the activity of combined RT and anti-PD-L1 therapy. Furthermore, immune profiling shows enhanced systemic and antitumor immunity in responding patients with a favorable gut microbiome (such as enrichment in <i>Akkermansia muciniphila<\/i>, <i>Bifidobacterium<\/i> and <i>Faecalibacterium<\/i>). Therefore, we aim to document the role of patients&#8217; microbiome in polarizing anti-tumor immune responses to CT in order to eventually use its composition as a predicting factor of CT success.<br \/><u><\/u>METHODS : Fecal material from responder (R, n=3) and non-responder (NR, n=3) MIBC patients was gavaged into 20 germ-free (GF) mice in two administrations one week apart. 3 weeks after the last gavage, tumor cells (MB49) were delivered subcutaneaously. Once tumors reached 0.1-0.15cm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were randomized into 4 groups : control; anti-PD-L1 alone; RT alone; RT + anti-PD-L1. 7 days after the start of treatment, tumors were harvested, dissociated and frozen as cell suspensions for single cell immune profiling and TCR sequencing (10X Genomics). Stool were collected weekly for 16S sequencing. Correlation networks from sequencing data were built (TransNet and Microbiome R packages) and visualized using Cytoscape to show interactions between the tumor immune microenvironment and the gut microbiome in R and NR-receiving mice.<br \/>RESULTS : We show feasibility of the experimental design as well as robust engraftment of human FMT to germ-free mice in a bladder cancer tumor model. FMT from NR lessened the known beneficial effects of RT in the MB49 model compared to FMT from R. Transkingdom analysis of sc-RNA-seq and 16S show robust statistical interactions between immunosuppression and enrichment in microbes associated to poor outcome in immunotherapy.<br \/>SIGNIFICANCE : To our knowledge, this is the first study to use FMT as a modulator of response in the context of radiation therapy combinations in MIBC. Findings from this study have a strong predictive value that could be used to select patients who will benefit most from a personalized therapeutic approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Microbiome,Tumor microenvironment,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eva Michaud<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cynthia Faubert<sup>2<\/sup>, Jose Joao Mansure<sup>1<\/sup>, Irah King<sup>2<\/sup>, Wassim Kassouf<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montréal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>McGill Interdisciplinary Initiative in Infection and Immunity, Montréal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e027c3e5-e7a6-4388-b8fe-a3caeac5f175","ControlNumber":"5520","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

Microbiome has emerged as a central regulator of obesity and we recently discovered that microbes can not only potentiate breast cancer growth and metastasis but also affect therapeutic response. We showed weight-loss by Diet\/Exercise\/Behavioral intervention (POWER-remote trial) exerts favorable effects. Here, we examine molecular underpinnings of poor therapy response in obese state and explore the gut microbiome to mitigate the same.<br \/>Methods: We co-implanted lineage determined human White preAdipocytes (hWAT) with MCF7 breast cancer cells in the mammary glands of mice. Changes in tumor microenvironment and tumor cells were evaluated <i>ex situ<\/i> by RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, Raman spectroscopy, Quantitative phase microscopy, PCR, immunoblotting and functional assays. To inspect the gut microbiome, 16 obese breast cancer patients were subjected to weight loss intervention over 14 weeks. Gut microbiome was analyzed at baseline and post-intervention by microbial shotgun sequencing. Patients were divided into responders and non-responders based on % weight-loss.<br \/>Results: We found that human breast cancer cells co-implanted with hWAT formed more aggressive tumors compared to controls. RNA sequencing revealed significant upregulation of multiple oncogenic pathways along with robust innate immune response. Tumor dissociated cells from hWAT-MCF7 tumors showed extensive molecular reprogramming rendering them more proliferative, motile and stem-like along with dramatic physiological changes like increased intercellular lipid accumulation. hWAT-MCF7 cells attained resistance to multiple drugs including Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant, Letrozole and Palbociclib. Simultaneous targeting of multiple signaling pathways using pharmacological inhibitors is infeasible in clinical setting hence we explored the obesity-microbiome axis. Obese breast cancer patients underwent POWER-remote intervention and their gut microbiome analysis showed significant differential expression of many microbes. Based on abundance and metabolite profile, <i>F. prausnitzii<\/i> was selected as the candidate of interest. On treatment with <i>F. prausnitzii<\/i> growth media, acquired multi-drug resistance in hWAT-MCF7 cells could be reversed suggesting that increase in gut population of the bacterium could be helpful in sensitizing patients unresponsive to therapy.<br \/>Conclusion: Direct interaction between breast cancer cells and WAT rendered them resistant to multiple drugs. Metabolites produced by weight-loss-associated bacterium <i>F. prausnitzii<\/i> reversed adiposity-induced multi-drug resistance, hence, can potentially have therapeutic benefits in obese breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Microbiome,BMI,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sheetal Parida<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sumit Siddharth<sup>1<\/sup>, Nethaji Muniraj<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhenhui Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Ishan Barman<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Smith<sup>1<\/sup>, Jenni Sheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Vered Stearns<sup>1<\/sup>, Janelle  W.

HUB patient derived Organoids, (HUB-Organoids<sup>TM<\/sup> or PDOs) are self-organized epithelial cell structures with near-physiological features, extensively used to model aspects of cancer initiation and progression. Studies conducted by Pleguezuelos-Manzanos et al. (2020) showed that repetitive cycles of colibactin-producing bacteria into the organoid lumen via microinjection, led to two co-occurring mutational signatures appearance, a single-base substitution signature (SBS-pks) and an indel signature (ID-pks), identified in a subset of CRC patients (~2% and 7%, respectively). These results highlight the relevance of organoids for modelling host-pathogen interactions and the application of these systems as <i>in vitro<\/i> platforms for investigating long-standing cause-correlation relationship between the presence of genotoxic pathogens and CRC development. The limited scalability of sophisticated co-culture strategies with pathogens such as microinjection has represented a bottleneck in the use of organoids as throughput screening tools in the development of preventive therapies. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop alternative co-culture systems compatible with the process of compound screening. An organoid-bacteria co-culture system compatible with medium-to-high throughput screening readouts has been developed. This co-culture system is currently tailored for the modeling of colibactin genotoxic effects in the gut epithelium, but theoretically could be extended as a discovery platform to identify targetable, novel and complex interactions between host and pathogen. <u>Key words<\/u>: colibactin, organoids, CRC, screening","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Organoids,host-pathogen interaction,co-culture,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eider Valle-Encinas<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Roshni Nair<sup>1<\/sup>, Katerina Pisa<sup>1<\/sup>, Mayke Doorn<sup>1<\/sup>, Farzin Pourfarzad<sup>1<\/sup>, Lani San Mateo<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicole Desch<sup>2<\/sup>, Prashanth Gokare<sup>2<\/sup>, David Pocalyko<sup>2<\/sup>, Sylvia  F.

We have previously reported that rare long-term survival in pancreatic cancer is associated with an intratumoral microbial signature which correlates with enhanced TME immunoactivation, suggestive of microbial mediated immune cell recruitment. A gut-to-tumor microbial crosstalk was also found in a human-to-mouse Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) tumor model. While we have identified the vital role of microbiota in affecting tumor immunity, there is still a gap of knowledge about local microbial interactions within TME. Deeper understanding of the microbial mediated events that are triggered and follow PDAC development, which act to induce and support tumor growth, would provide us with potential novel targets that could be blocked to reverse PDAC immunosuppression and tumor growth. To interrogate the features of the pancreatic tumor microbial niche, we performed spatial co-detection of microbial and host targets to identify the cellular compartment which interacts with microbes inside the TME in clinical samples. We developed novel qualitative and quantitative imaging methodologies for evaluating crosstalk between the host and microbes. We also evaluated the effect of microbial burden on transcriptomic changes in host cells through multiple spatial sequencing approaches. Overall, we dissect the functional role of microbes in orchestrating TME organization and their effect on tumor signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Tumor microenvironment,Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vidhi Chandra<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hajar Rajaei<sup>1<\/sup>, Seyda Baydogan<sup>1<\/sup>, Javier Gomez<sup>1<\/sup>, Sammy Ferri-Borgogno<sup>1<\/sup>, Anirban Maitra<sup>1<\/sup>, Erick Riquelme<sup>2<\/sup>, Ismet Sahin<sup>3<\/sup>, Jared Burks<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Florencia McAllister<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Universidad Mayor, Santiago, Chile,<sup>3<\/sup>Texas Southern University, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0d7d69de-c45a-4280-90b9-5110a1a92cc8","ControlNumber":"7795","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

We found previously that following asbestos deposition in the pleura and in the peritoneum, mesothelial cells release HMGB1 that attract granulocytes and macrophages that, in turn, secrete HMGB1. It was unknown whether the primary source of HMGB1 that drives the inflammatory process caused by asbestos, which may ensue in mesothelioma, derives from the mesothelial cells exposed to asbestos or from the granulocytes and macrophages. To study separately the contribution of mesothelial cells and of the inflammatory cells to HMGB1 secretion that drives mesothelioma development, we used two tissue-specific HMGB1 knockout mouse models: (1) An inducible mesothelial conditional HMGB1 knockout (HMGB1<sup>&#916;pMeso<\/sup>) mouse model, and (2) a constitutive myelomonocytic-lineage knock out (HMGB1<sup>&#916;Mylc<\/sup>) mouse model. To investigate the role of HMGB1 in asbestos induced carcinogenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>, we conducted both short-term and long-term experiments in HMGB1<sup>&#916;pMeso<\/sup> mice and in HMGB1<sup>&#916;Mylc<\/sup> mice. For the <u>Short-term experiment<\/u>, we observed that one week following the completion of the 10-weekly crocidolite i.p. injections, all the mice in experimental and control groups showed inflammation with multiple granulomas around asbestos deposits in the various tissues and organs present in the abdomen, and diffuse mesothelial hyperplasia. However, the granulomas in HMGB1<sup>&#916;pMeso<\/sup> mice were significantly smaller compared to those found in the control WT mice. TNF&#945; IHC stain was minimal to non-detectable in the granulomas and areas of mesothelial hyperplasia of HMGB1<sup>&#916;pMeso<\/sup> mice, compared to a strong TNF&#945; staining in both HMGB1<sup>&#916;Mylc<\/sup> and WT mice. For the <u>Long-term experiment<\/u>, we observed that the incidence of mesothelioma was significantly lower in HMGB1<sup>&#916;pMeso<\/sup> mice compared with the 3 control groups including WT mice, HMGB1<sup>F\/F<\/sup> mice and Wt1ERT2<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup> control mice. Moreover, HMGB1<sup>&#916;pMeso<\/sup> mice had a significantly longer mesothelioma-specific survival compared to all three controls. Histologically, the HMGB1<sup>&#916;pMeso<\/sup> mesotheliomas were smaller and grew largely over the surface rather than infiltrating the abdominal organs, compared to the mesotheliomas that developed in the three control groups.In summary, our findings underscore the role of HMGB1 in asbestos pathogenesis, including asbestos induced chronic inflammation and mesothelioma. Moreover, our findings elucidated the mechanisms responsible for asbestos induced inflammation and asbestos carcinogenesis, and the causal link between HMGB1, TNF&#945; secretion and mesothelioma. Our results point to the HMGB1 secreted by mesothelial cells as the culprit and thus the ideal target to prevent the growth of mesothelioma upon asbestos exposure and during the early phases of mesothelioma growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-06 Inflammatory cells as regulators of tumor growth,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,TNF-&#945;,Carcinogenesis,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Joelle S.
