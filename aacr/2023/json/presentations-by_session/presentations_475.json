[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Although there is increased awareness leading to early detection and prevention, Hispanic American (HA) men with prostate cancer (PC) continue to have greater mortality rates compared to their Non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. Moreover, HA men with PC are more likely to have more advanced disease compared to NHW men. Here, we characterized the molecular and immune differences in HA and NHW tumors and their association with PC ethnic disparity.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 88 PC samples (HA=34, NHW=54) obtained from treatment-naive metastatic hormone-sensitive PC (mHSPC) were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (592, NextSeq; WES, NovaSeq), Whole Transcriptome Sequencing (WTS; NovaSeq) (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ). AR signature and NEPC score were calculated based on the expression level of previously defined genes (Hieronymus <i>et al.<\/i> 2006, Beltran <i>et al.<\/i> 2016). Medical record was reviewed in a deidentified fashion for clinal features. Statistical significance was determined using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U (p&#60;0.05).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> HA patients with PC had higher level of <i>PSA<\/i> (111.5 vs 52.6 ng\/ml, p=0.12) and stage (T4: 41% vs 14% p=0.01, M1c: 41% vs 16% p=0.04) but no significant difference in frequency of Gleason score <u>&#62;<\/u> 4 (79% vs 73%, p=0.61) or stage N1 (69% vs 61%, p=0.85) compared to NHW. HA PC had a significantly higher frequency of <i>TMPRSS2-<\/i>fusion<i> <\/i>(46.4%<i> vs <\/i>20.0%, p=0.04)<i> <\/i>compared to NHW PC. By Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, HA PC had enrichment of <i>KRAS <\/i>signaling (NES: 1.44, FDR=0.02), Hedgehog signaling (NES: 1.45, FDR=0.04)<i>, NOTCH <\/i>signaling (NES: 1.41, FDR=0.07), Hypoxia (NES: 1.38, FDR=0.10) and<i> IL2-STAT5 <\/i>signaling (NES: 1.35, FDR=0.10)<i> <\/i>pathways compared to NHW tumors. There was no difference in median Androgen Receptor signature (p=0.78) or Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (NEPC) score (p=0.79). Also, no significant difference in AR positivity by IHC (100% vs 95.7%) between HA and NHW PC tumors (p=0.51). HA PC had significantly higher expression of stem cell markers<i> ALDH1A1 <\/i>(2.1-fold), <i>ALDH1A2 <\/i>(3-fold),<i> <\/i>and<i> PROM1 <\/i>(1.6-fold) and immunoinhibitory genes <i>PDCD1LG2 <\/i>(1.68-fold)<i> <\/i>and<i> FOXP3 <\/i>(1.45-fold) compared to NHW tumors (all p&#60;0.05). Additionally, HA tumors had increased infiltration of M1 Macrophages (0.72% vs 0%) and NK cells (4.84% vs 3.55%, all p&#60;0.05), and increased T-cell inflamed score (44.0 vs -49.0, p=0.14) compared to NHW.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data suggest that HA mHSPC is associated with higher levels of PSA, stage, <i>TMPRSS2<\/i>-fusions, stemness marker expression, immunoinhibitory gene expression, and increased M1 Macrophage and NK cell infiltration. Together, these findings suggest a crucial role of differential molecular and tumor immune microenvironment in PC ethnic disparity. A better understanding of these differences with additional research may help in designing the approaches for reducing the ethnic disparities gaps in PC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Molecular profiling,Hispanic,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alejandro Recio-Boiles<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sachin Kumar Deshmukh<sup>2<\/sup>, Juan Chipollini<sup>1<\/sup>, Ken Batai<sup>3<\/sup>, Sharon Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Joanne Xiu<sup>2<\/sup>, Alex Farrell<sup>2<\/sup>, Milan Radovich<sup>2<\/sup>, Elisabeth Heath<sup>4<\/sup>, Rana McKay<sup>5<\/sup>, Chadi Nabhan<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ,<sup>2<\/sup>Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ,<sup>3<\/sup>Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Cen, Buffalo, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI,<sup>5<\/sup>Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4c1c1ff9-788e-4b56-aeac-ca282de6cbe6","ControlNumber":"5636","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

These health disparities may be contributed by environmental or biological factors, such as epigenomics. Differential DNA methylation can influence carcinogenesis and disease progression. Indeed, the most common molecular event in PCa is dysregulation of DNA methylation. Among these epigenetic changes, some specific changes may be associated with poor outcomes. Numerous studies reported that differential DNA methylation influences the likelihood of developing PCa and affects its progression. However, most studies were based on European American patients. There is a need to investigate methylation profiles to evaluate potential African American-specific methylated genes, since differential DNA methylation may influence health disparities in PCa. This study aimed to investigate differentially DNA methylated genes between tumor vs. adjacent normal, and aggressive vs. indolent PCa (based on Gleason Score) in 120 African American patients from Florida. Genomic DNA samples were extracted by macro-dissection from FFPE. DNA methylation patterns were assessed using the human Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array. We identified 5,097 differentially methylated CpG-sites (q&#60;0.01, l&#916;&#946;l &#62; 0.2) A few representative differentially methylated regions (DMRs) include immune genes, such as <i>CD40<\/i>, <i>OX40L<\/i>, Galectin 3, and <i>STING<\/i>, in prostate tumor tissues as compared with normal tissues. There was also a clear global increase of methylation level in the tumor samples compared to the normal tissues. Regarding PCa aggressiveness, 6,775 (Hypo:4,252, and Hyper: 2,523) differentially methylated CpG-sites (q&#60;0.05, l&#916;&#946;l &#62; 0.1) were identified when two groups GG1 (Gleason score 6) <i>vs<\/i> GG4\/5 (Gleason score 8&#8804;) were compared. Among these 6,775 CpG-sites, many CpG-probes are consistently significant in more than one comparison. For example, 1,182 hyper and 1,660 hypo-methylation sites were identified in the comparison between GG1 and GG2\/3 (Gleason score 7), while 362 hyper- and 1,640 hypo-methylation sites were found in the GG2\/3 vs GG4\/5 comparison. A small fraction of probes (51 hyper and 155 hypomethylated probes) was consistently found in all comparisons. These genes, <i>MMP16, CDH13, CCND2, <\/i>and<i> SEPT9<\/i>, were previously reported to have a role in PCa progression. This study identified several differentially methylated genes, associated with risk or aggressiveness. Most of these changes appear to overlap in different comparisons, thus GG1 vs. GG2\/3 or GG2\/3 vs. GG4\/5 comparison. Many differentially methylated genes identified here have previously been associated with PCa risk or tumor aggressiveness. These results will shed light on potential mechanisms contributing to PCa disparities in African American population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,Epigenetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Anders Berglund<sup>1<\/sup>, Kosj Yamoah<sup>1<\/sup>, Carlos Diaz Osterman<sup>2<\/sup>, Julie Dutil<sup>2<\/sup>, Jaime Matta<sup>2<\/sup>, Gilberto Ruiz-Deya<sup>2<\/sup>, Liang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyun Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Tamara Lotan<sup>3<\/sup>, Ryan Putney<sup>1<\/sup>, Sungjune Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Seung Joon Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Clement Gwede<sup>1<\/sup>, Rana Falahat<sup>1<\/sup>, James Mule<sup>1<\/sup>, Youngchul Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Ratna Chakrabarti<sup>5<\/sup>, <b>Jong Y.

Here we investigated whether RNA expression of 310 genes or non-coding RNAs that have shown differential expression (p&#60;0.05) in prostate tumors by race\/ancestry in past studies were associated with prostate tumor aggressiveness among African American men. We accessed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate tumor tissue for 191 African American men with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at the University of Maryland Medical Center from 1992-2021, as well as paired normal prostate tissue for a subset of the men (n=105). We generated RNA expression data using the ThermoFisher Human Clariom D array. Using Wilcoxon tests, we compared prostate tumor RNA expression by tumor aggressiveness (total Gleason score, GS, &#62;=7 vs. &#60;=6). The Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate approach was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Of the 310 genes\/non-coding RNAs, 110 were significantly associated with GS (p&#60;0.05), and 65 remained significant after multiple comparison adjustment (q&#60;0.05). Almost all (60\/65) of the top findings tended to have lower expression in higher- vs. lower-grade tumors.

Some single institution retrospective studies show higher breast densities in Hispanic patients (Oppong et al. Breast J. 2018). The prevalence of breast density based on Hispanic ethnicity has not been studied in large database studies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed a retrospective review of women &#62; 40 years undergoing screening mammograms from 2016-2022. Patients with prior history of breast cancer were excluded. We reviewed demographic variables such as race, self-reported ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), parity, breastfeeding and menopausal status. Breast density was characterized as predominantly fatty (PF), scattered fibroglandular (SF), heterogeneously dense (HD) and extremely dense (ED). We used Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallace tests to compare breast density across measured variables, and Ordinal Logistic Regression to compare breast density levels between self-declared ethnicity while adjusting for other variables.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 15946 patients were studied; 7317 (46%) identified as Hispanic, the rest non-Hispanic (NH). 6131 (83%) of Hispanics identified as white. Mean age on 1<sup>st<\/sup> screening mammogram was 57.64 (SD 7.21). Compared to NH, Hispanics had mean earlier age of 1<sup>st<\/sup> mammogram (56.8 vs. 58.3 years), higher BMI (30.5 vs. 28.6) and higher parity (2.53 vs. 1.71). There were significant differences in BI-RADS density categories by Hispanic vs. NH (p&#60;0.001), with differences in PF (20.2% vs. 18.5%), SF (41.7% vs. 39.0%), HD (35.8% vs. 37.2%), and ED (2.3% vs. 5.3%). The ordinal logistic regression model suggests that Hispanics have 17% lower odds than NH of 1 category higher density (OR, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.78-0.88). There were also significant ethnicity differences in age at first exam, BMI, parity, and number of children breast-fed (P&#60;0.001). Adjusting for these ethnicity-associated differences explained the observed differences in density between Hispanic and NH individuals (OR<sub>adj<\/sub>, 95% CI: 0.98, 0.92-1.04); adjusting only for BMI served to explain the observed differences in density (OR<sub>adj<\/sub>, 95% CI: 0.99, 0.94-1.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Hispanics were observed to have a lower age of first screening mammogram, higher BMI, higher parity, and breast-fed children compared to non-Hispanics. On univariate analysis, Hispanics were noted to have lower breast density compared to non-Hispanics, these differences do not persist on multivariate analysis. This suggests that BMI likely plays a predominant role in driving the ethnicity-related differences in breast density noted here. Further research efforts should focus on the influence of BMI and other individual-level factors on mammographic density, with a view towards understanding their potential roles in describing differential ethnicity-specific breast cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast density,Hispanic,Body mass index,Mammographic density,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sangeetha Prabhakaran<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Vernon  S.

However, some patients, particularly minorities, develop early adverse skin reactions (EASRs) or skin toxicities that negatively impact the quality of life (QOL). We assess RT-related EASRs and QOL using clinician-reported outcomes (CROs) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in a large multi-racial\/ethnic breast cancer population.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This prospective study recruited 1,000 breast cancer patients undergoing RT through the Wake Forest NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base between 2011 and 2013. We used the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) Skin Toxicity Criteria for CROs and Skindex-16 (SD-16) for PROs.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>This study included 405 non-Hispanic whites (NHW), 277 black\/African Americans (AA), 241 HW, 62 Asian\/Pacific Islanders (ASPI), and 15 others. About 42% and 15% of patients developed RT-induced ONS grade 3+ and 4+ skin toxicities, respectively. RT-induced EASRs differed significantly by race\/ethnicity at mid-RT, 1-month, and 2-month post-RT, but not at the end of RT. Total SD-16 scores differ by race\/ethnicity at pre-RT, 1-month, and 6-month post-RT, but not at the end of RT. Overall, PROs have a moderate but significant correlation with CROs at the end of RT.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>RT-induced EASRs differed significantly by race\/ethnicity. There was a moderate but significant correlation between PROs and CROs.

Breast cancer disproportionately affects Black women who have significantly higher mortality rates compared to White women with breast cancer. Although factors like access to healthcare and socioeconomic status contribute significantly to this disparity, there is a need to understand the underlying biological mechanisms that might play an important role. Survivin is a protein that belongs to the inhibitor of apoptosis family. Along with its anti-apoptotic function, it is also involved in the progression of the cell cycle. Survivin is normally expressed during development with no expression detected in most adult differentiated tissues. However, high expression of this protein is found in many cancers which correlates with poor prognosis. The goal of this study was to determine the expression of survivin in tumor tissue from Black and White breast cancer patients. Our first approach was to analyze the TCGA database to confirm our hypothesis that there is differential expression of survivin between the two racial groups and within different subtypes of breast cancer. Secondly, we used immunohistochemical analysis to investigate the expression of survivin in patient tumor tissue samples obtained from Black and White breast cancer patients. Results from the analysis of the TCGA database indicate significantly higher expression of survivin in tumors from Black patients compared to White. High survivin expression is also correlated with higher mortality rates. Immunohistochemical analysis of breast tumors also demonstrated higher expression of survivin in tumor tissue from Black patients. We also observed higher nuclear expression in Black patients compared to White patients. Differential expression was also observed between different subgroups of breast cancer. High expression was seen in the most aggressive triple negative (TNBC) form of breast cancer, which is known to disproportionately occur at higher rates in Black women. Our results along with data available in literature, suggest that survivin plays an important role in breast cancer progression (in correlation to race) and could be a useful diagnostic and\/or prognostic marker or a therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Survivin,Immunohistochemistry,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kerrie Brown<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yisheng V.

Yet, LC incidence and proportion of never-smokers among the heterogeneous racial-ethnic populations that compose Blacks and Hispanics, normally characterized in aggregate, are unknown. We used LC data from the Florida state cancer registry, 2012-2018, to compute first-ever LC age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR) for specific populations: US-born Black, Caribbean-born Black, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central American, and South American. For comparison, we computed Fay and Feuer incidence rate ratios (IRR) with non-Hispanic Whites as reference. We also assess the proportions of LCs that occurred among never-smokers by detailed race-ethnicity. We analyzed 120,550 LC cases in total. LC proportions in never-smokers varied from 9.4% in non-Hispanic White males to 66.7% in Caribbean-born Black females. AAIR in Cuban males was the highest of Hispanics, while those for US-born Blacks were over three times that of Caribbean-born Blacks. US-born Black men have significantly higher AAIRs than White men [IRR:1.14; 95%CI:1.11-1.18]. The lowest IRRs were observed among Caribbean-born Black and Central American females. This novel analysis of Florida LC incidence and never-smoker proportions by detailed race-ethnicity furthers knowledge, characterizing LC patterns across US minorities. Hispanic LC rates, higher than national rates, are heavily influenced by the high proportion of Cuban males with a documented high prevalence of smoking. Larger LC proportions in never-smokers for Central Americans and Caribbean-born Blacks show vast heterogeneity by detailed race-ethnicity and align with lower smoking prevalence. Aggregation of non-Hispanic Blacks or Hispanics obscures inherent disparities by origin. Understanding the potential effects of nativity on LC rates in US minorities is important for targeting public health measures for LC diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.<br \/><table border=\"1\"

Patients&#8217; sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the most frequent histological types (adenocarcinoma - EAC and squamous cell carcinoma - ESCC), and variables associated with advanced presentation at diagnosis, offering curative treatments, response to therapy and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Relative to EAC, patients with ESCC were younger (p=0.007); more frequently non-white (p&#60;0.001); most often did not have a partner (p&#60;0.001); showed lower education levels (p&#60;0.001); and were more frequently smokers and drinkers (p&#60;0.001). The frequency of patients not receiving any treatment was higher among ESCC (40.8%) relative to EAC (32.6%) (p=0.003). Furthermore, potentially curative treatments (surgery or trimodal treatment) were more commonly offered to EAC patients (p&#60;0.001). ESCC patients showed a median OS of 7.4 months (6.7 - 8.0 months) relative to 10.3 months (8.4 - 12.1 months) among EAC patients (p &#60;0.001). When analyzing specific histologic tumor types, variables associated with EAC stages I and II were female sex (p=0.016); non-metropolitan origin; and non-alcoholic (p=0.048). Also, in EAC, higher education levels (p&#60;0.001) were associated with curative treatments. EAC OS was significantly and independently associated with tumor stage at diagnosis (p=0.001) and curative treatments (p&#60;0.001). In ESCC, early diagnosis was associated with white skin color (p=0.031) and occurrence of second primary tumors (p&#60;0.001). Curative treatments were more commonly offered to ESCC patients who had a partner (p=0.028); higher education levels (p=0.010); and who were non-drinkers (p=0.042). Chemoradiotherapy resistance was associated with smoking (p=0.001) and low body mass index (p=0.028) among ESCC cases, while OS was significantly and independently associated with smoking (p=0.002) and staging (p&#60;0.001). In summary, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics affected outcomes and special attention should be given to modifiable risk factors such as smoking and nutritional status. In addition, our study evidenced how social aspects are inextricably linked to health outcomes, and efforts should be made to minimize this gap.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Prognostic factors,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Rachele Grazziotin Reisner<sup><\/sup>, Flávia Nascimento de Carvalho<sup><\/sup>, Luis Felipe Ribeiro Pinto<sup><\/sup>, <b>Sheila Coelho Soares-Lima<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d70e9c29-e77b-4394-94f2-5072f286c511","ControlNumber":"7421","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

RCC survival is highly dependent on histology. Survival rates range between 55-60% for clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and 80-90% for papillary RCC (pRCC) patients. African Americans (AAs) have lower survival rates when compared to their European American (EA) counterparts for both histologies (ccRCC 67.1 vs 72.6, pRCC 80.5 vs 87.5). RCC survival disparities may be accredited to population differences in tumor biology, such as somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) profiles of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and differential gene expression signatures with associated cellular pathway dysregulation. SCNAs are the most common structural change in the human genome and ccRCC and pRCC-specific SCNAs have been associated with clinical outcomes. ClearCode34, a 34 gene expression signature, was developed to classify ccRCC tumors into two distinct ccRCC subtypes (ccA and ccB). The ccB subtype is associated with worse survival and features like increased tumor size, grade, and metastasis rates. We hypothesize there are more aggressive tumor biology phenotypes in AA RCC patients compared to their European counterparts.<br \/>Methods: Comparative genome-wide, chromosomal, and gene SCNA analyses were performed in AA and EA ccRCC and pRCC patients in TCGA using Partek Genomics Suite 7 (1-way ANOVA, P&#60;0.05). Prediction analysis of microarray in R was used to classify ccRCC patients into ccA and ccB subtypes by race based on the ClearCode34 gene expression signature (t-test, P&#60;0.05). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AA and EA patients were identified using Partek Genomics Suite 7 (1-way ANOVA, P&#60;0.05). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using a pre-ranked gene list (Fold changes &#62;2 or &#60;-2, P&#60;0.01) and two Molecular Signatures Database collections (C6 oncogenic signatures, C7 immunologic signatures).<br \/>Results: AA-enriched SCNVs were identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 12 in ccRCC patients, and chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16 and 20 in pRCC patients. Six cytobands and genes experienced a SCNV across both histologies (1p21.1, 1p21.3, 6p12.1, 6p12.3, 6p21.1, 6q12), BMP5 (on 6p12.1), CD2AP (on 6p12.3), ENPP4 (on 6p21.1), and SLC44A3-AS1 (on 1p21.3). AAs and EAs had significantly different frequencies of ccA (AA 33.9% vs EA 52.2%) and ccB subtypes (AA 66.1% vs EA 47.8%). Unique DEGs were found between AA and EA ccA and ccB patients (131 ccA only, 165 ccB only), which corresponded with up- and down-regulation in kidney cancer with oncogenic KRAS (C6) and various immunologic pathways (C7).<br \/>Conclusions: Population-specific SCNAs, ccB subtypes, and pathways may help explain differences in RCC tumor biology amongst AA and EA patients.

With limited access to health care, Hispanics tend to present with later-stage CRC when compared to NHWs, which likely accounts for their inferior survival after CRC diagnosis. Given the rising incidence of CRC among 20-39-year-old Hispanic individuals and the rapid growth in this segment of the population, this is a significant problem to study. As tumorigenesis is contingent upon oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be one of the important progenitors in carcinogenesis. <i>Here, we have hypothesized that ethnicity-based variations in the stress survival response axis and other related pathways may influence the capacity to suppress ROS, repair DNA damage, and regulate cell death signaling pathways in Hispanic CRC patients.<\/i> To decipher the role of stress-survival pathway genes in Hispanic CRC disparities, we performed a meta-analysis of microarray and RNA-seq datasets obtained from the GEO, Oncomine, and TCGA and identified 28 stress-survival pathway-associated genes in the CRC datasets. These genes were screened for transcript-level expression by qRT-PCR in one normal colon and six CRC cell lines. cDNA arrays containing normal, and Stage I-IV human CRC samples were used to determine the transcript level expressions of the target genes in different stages of CRC from human tissues. Protein level expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in CRC tissue microarrays containing different stages of tumor and normal human CRC tissues. These genes were also analyzed for their transcript level expressions in Hispanic (n=10) and NHW (n=10) tissues. Twenty-three out of the 28 genes were found to be differentially expressed in Hispanic CRC tissues when compared to NHW CRC tissues.<i> <\/i>Genes such as <i>CHEK1<\/i> and <i>MCM10<\/i> were found to be upregulated, whereas <i>BCL2L12, CCNB1, CDK1, CDK4, FOXM1, <\/i>and <i>PDCD2L<\/i> were seen to be down-regulated. Transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) revealed that 213 and 363 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed in NHW and Hispanic CRC tissues compared to the normal adjacent tissues. The genes involved in cytochrome P450 and PPAR pathways were found to be enriched in the Hispanic cohort. Cytokine IL17 signaling and chemical carcinogenesis pathways were enriched in Hispanic males, whereas PI3K-Akt pathway and chemokine signaling pathways were enriched in Hispanic females as compared to their NHW counterparts. The PPAR and IL17 signaling were seen to be enriched in early-stage (I\/II) Hispanic CRC tissues, however, TGF-b and coagulation cascades were enriched in the later stages (III\/IV) of Hispanic CRC tissues as compared to NHWs. The genes identified to be differentially regulated in Hispanic tissues and the pathways in which they are involved in should lead to potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets specific to the Hispanic population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Differential gene expression,Hispanic,Colorectal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sourav Roy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aditi Kulkarni<sup>2<\/sup>, Urbashi Basnet<sup>1<\/sup>, Soumya Nair<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Biological Scinces, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3e6f2d00-8a72-487f-a5eb-2cdac7d68abf","ControlNumber":"6994","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Maintenance of proficient mismatch repair genes is important in colorectal cancer. Among them, MSH3 is found to be more important in colorectal cancer in AA particularly as its alterations associate with EMAST phenotype that has poor prognosis. However, there are regional variations in the classification and criteria used to determine the pathogenicity of these mutations particularly in AA due to their high genomic diversity. Aim: To analyze unique and novel MSH3 mutations using specific in-silico prediction tools and to validate their biological significances in AA-CRC. Results: In this study, we validated our targeted exome sequencing data of MSH3 mutations in AA and Caucasians (CA) CRC samples. A cost effective in-silico approach was employed to narrow down most significant MSH3 mutations. Interestingly, we and found six non-synonymous novel, pathogenic mutations in MSH3 gene (c.G1237A, c.C2759T, c.G1397A, c.G2926A, c.C3028T, c.G3241A) correspond to MSH3 protein (E413K; S466N; S920F; E976K; H1010Y; E1081K), in AA than CA samples. Also, we observed loss or gain of different chemical bonding patterns (hydrogen, ionic, hydrophobic, and di-sulfide bonding) between wild type and mutant MSH3 protein. Interestingly, some of these mutations were within the ATPase site while others are in MSH3-MSH2 interacting domains. Furthermore, Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) of these six mutants of MSH3 proteins showed an overall effect on MSH3 protein stability especially in MSH3-MSH2 interaction compared to wild type MSH3 protein.Conclusion: Our data showed that, six MSH3 non-synonymous mutations are deleterious as they affect important sites within MSH3-MSH2 interactive and ATPase domain. Assessing the real frequency of these mutations in large cohort and their specific effect on function may shed light on EMAST phenotype, high prevalence, and overall poor prognosis in the AA population.

However, most trials did not include large numbers of Black patients, who typically have lower vitamin D levels. We evaluated associations between vitamin D with all-cause and CRC-specific mortality after CRC diagnosis.<br \/>Methods: Data arose from 220 participants of the Southern Community Cohort Study diagnosed with incident CRC. Eligible patients were ages 40-79 at enrollment, non-Hispanic Black, English-speaking, and provided a blood sample at enrollment for biomarker measurement. Patients provided information on lifestyle factors, demographics, and personal medical history, primarily via in-person interviews. Concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured from blood samples taken at enrollment and were categorized by the Institute of Medicine&#8217;s categories of deficient (&#60;12ng\/mL), inadequate (12-19.9ng\/mL), or adequate (&#8805;20ng\/mL). Vital status was obtained through linkages with the National Death Index through December 31, 2020. Cox proportional hazards were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and mortality. Statistical models adjusted for the following covariates: age at diagnosis, race, sex, cancer stage, education, income, alcohol intake, smoking history, screening history, obesity, insurance coverage, and physical activity.<br \/>Results: Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was inversely associated with CRC-specific and all-cause mortality. Specifically, patients with pre-diagnosis 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration categorized as adequate had reduced all-cause mortality in comparison to participants with deficient vitamin D concentration with a HR of 0.58 (95%CI: 0.35, 0.97). Stronger associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and all-cause mortality were observed among participants where blood draw occurred three-five years before diagnosis. Associations were strongest among current smokers where the HR for each per-standard deviation increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration with all-cause mortality was 0.58 (95%CI: 0.36,0.92), and among obese participants the HR for a per-standard deviation increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with all-cause mortality was 0.45 (95%CI: 0.27,0.75). An inverse association was also observed with CRC-specific mortality, although the association was attenuated (HR for per-standard deviation increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D=0.83; 95%CI: 0.63,1.08).<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pre-diagnosis vitamin D concentration is inversely associated with mortality after a CRC diagnosis among Black individuals. Correcting vitamin D deficiency may be warranted among Black CRC patients, particularly for those who smoke or are obese.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Survival,Vitamin D,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shaneda Warren Andersen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Lawler<sup>1<\/sup>, Nikhil  K.

Yet, positive patient experience with health care is associated with higher likelihood of receiving GCT for noninvasive CRC. This research examines the relationship between patient experiences with care, receipt of GCT for CRC, and patient race and ethnicity among those diagnosed with CRC and comorbid chronic conditions.<br \/>Methods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) data to identify patients diagnosed with noninvasive CRC from 2001-2017 who were at least 67 years old at diagnosis; had diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and\/or hypertension; and responded to a CAHPS patient experience survey within 3 years of CRC diagnosis. GCT was defined as stage-specific National Comprehensive Cancer Center recommended treatment for CRC and was identified in Medicare claims files. CAHPS patient experiences of care coordination (CC), getting care quickly (GCQ), getting needed care (GNC), and physician communication (PC) were categorized as excellent and less than excellent. Multivariable logistic regression analyses included a product interaction term between patient race and ethnicity and experiences with care to measure the associations between race and ethnicity and receipt of GCT and how these differ by self-reported experiences with care.<br \/>Results: 3,442 SEER-CAHPS patients with CRC and comorbid chronic conditions, including 44.4% with diabetes, 74.2% with hyperlipidemia, and 92.0% with hypertension were included. 71.5% of non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), 68.3% of non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB), 72.2% of Hispanics, and 72.9% of non-Hispanic Asians (NHA) received stage specific GCT for CRC. Among those reporting excellent experience with GNC, NHBs, Hispanics, and NHAs were more likely than NHWs to receive GCT (NHB: OR=1.33, 99.38% CI=1.27-1.38; Hispanic: 1.09, 1.04-1.15; NHA: 1.49, 1.41-1.57). Among those reporting excellent experiences of CC and PC, NHBs were more likely than NHWs to receive GCT (CC: 1.45, 1.31-1.61; PC: 1.52, 1.46-1.57). However, Hispanics and NHAs reporting excellent experiences with PC were less likely than NHWs to receive GCT (Hispanic: 0.76, 0.72-0.79; NHA: 0.91, 0.86-0.96).<br \/>Conclusions: Improvements in patient experiences with care may help to alleviate some racial and ethnic disparity in receipt of GCT for CRC among those with multimorbidity. However, improvements in experiences should be specific to individual aspects of care (CC, GNC, and PC) and may not fully address treatment disparities in Hispanic and NHA populations with CRC and comorbid chronic conditions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Comorbidity,Colorectal cancer,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stephanie Navarro<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Tsui<sup>1<\/sup>, Afsaneh Barzi<sup>2<\/sup>, Mariana Stern<sup>1<\/sup>, Trevor Pickering<sup>1<\/sup>, Albert Farias<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>USC - University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"12c5070d-4e6e-4bd1-86f1-5a54a8e74a97","ControlNumber":"6578","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Racial and ethnic disparities in ovarian cancer outcomes are well-documented, wherein non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women are 40% more likely to die from their disease compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. However, the causes of these disparities are complex and multifactorial. Comorbidities are known to differ by race and ethnicity and have the potential to affect treatment and cancer outcomes. Our objective was to characterize the comorbidity burden by race and ethnicity in a large cohort of ovarian cancer patients.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The electronic health record-based Kaiser Permanente Research on Ovarian Cancer Survival (KP-ROCS) study includes individuals &#8805;18 years of age diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2000 and 2018. Comorbidities (<i>e.g.,<\/i> cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, hypertension, liver disease) were identified using ICD-9\/10 and procedural codes in the five years preceding the individual&#8217;s ovarian cancer diagnosis. We present the distribution of individual comorbidities as well as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) across racial and ethnic groups (non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, NHB, and NHW).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of 4,910 ovarian cancer patients in the KP-ROCS cohort, 625 (13%) are non-Hispanic Asian, 605 (12%) are Hispanic, 268 (5.5%) are NHB, and 3,321 (74%) are NHW. The mean age at diagnosis was lowest for non-Hispanic Asian (57 years, standard deviation [SD] 14), followed by Hispanic (60 years, SD=13), NHB (63 years, SD=13), and NHW (65 years, SD=13) ovarian cancer patients. At diagnosis, NHB and Hispanic ovarian cancer patients were more likely to present with diabetes than non-Hispanic Asian and NHW women (NHB=21%, Hispanic=21% vs non-Hispanic Asian=16%, NHW=12%). Cardiovascular disease was more common among NHB women compared with other racial and ethnic groups (NHB=41% vs. Hispanic=28%, non-Hispanic Asian=26%, NHW=32%). Moreover, the net burden of comorbidities (CCI=3+) was higher among NHB women compared with other racial and ethnic groups (NHB=30% vs non-Hispanic Asian=17%, Hispanic=23%, NHW=21%).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our preliminary data indicate that NHB ovarian cancer patients are more likely to present with comorbidities at the time of their ovarian cancer diagnosis compared with other racial and ethnic groups. These comorbid conditions may inhibit the ability to tolerate surgery and systemic therapies, contributing to racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes.

Due to its rarity, there is scarce literature on the demographic features of PMBL. Moreover, there is little to no research on outcomes of ethnic minority groups, particularly in Hispanics (HI) (PMID: 27399089.) Thus, there is a need for further investigation of disease characteristics to advance treatment options for the future. This is a national scale population-based analysis examining disparities in HI vs Non-Hispanics (NH) and its impact on survival outcomes in patients with PMBL.<br \/><b><\/b>Material and Methods: Data was analyzed on PBML patients in the United States reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2000 and 2018. SEER contains the most comprehensive population-based cancer information in the U.S., covering approximately 27% of the total US population, and up to 36% of Hispanics alone. Racial groups analyzed included non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians\/PIs (Pacific Islanders). Patient characteristics, age-adjusted incidence rate, and survival rate were compared across ethnic groups, Hispanics (HI) vs Non-Hispanics (NH). Stratification by age, gender, and stage at diagnosis was considered. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare overall survival (OS) between HI and NH. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed with adjustment for age, stage and B-symptoms.<br \/>Results: Of 1,014 PMBL patients, 15% were HI, and 85% were NH. PMBL affects mostly women in both HI and NH (66% and 60% p=0.215). HI were diagnosed at a younger median age, 30 y.o vs 36 y.o (p=0.001), compared to NH. The majority of HI and NH were diagnosed under 40 years old (p=0.010). Both groups were mostly diagnosed between 2015-2018 (44% vs 41%) (p=0.768). The majority of both groups did not receive radiation, however it was noted that HI received less radiation compared to NH (72% vs 66%) (p=0.180). The median survival time was not reached indicating a favorable prognosis. On survival analysis; the survival probability of HI vs NH at 2 years was 0.87 vs 0.86, at 5 years 0.85 vs 0.85, and 10 years 0.83 vs 0.82. and there was not an OS difference favoring HI\/NH (p = 0.94). On multivariate analysis, when adjusting for age, those who were older than 80 y.o and between 60 to 80 y.o, had worse OS compared to those younger than 60 y.o with HR 9.3 (95% CI: 4.3 - 20) and 8.8 (95% CI: 4 - 19).<br \/>Conclusions: Our study analysis shows that the demographic variables between HI and NH were generally homogenous. In patients with PMBL, HI were diagnosed younger compared to their NH counterparts, however this did not affect OS. In conclusion, HI and NH patients with PMBL had similar treatment and outcomes showing that, when there is equity in health, favorable prognosis is possible with the current standard of care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Hispanic,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lauren Diaz Boyle<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Esteban Toro-Velez<sup>1<\/sup>, Adolfo Enrique Diaz Duque<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Hematology and Oncology, Mays Cancer Center, San Antonio, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9bac7f57-14d5-4f33-95fb-ee2536ecc833","ControlNumber":"2542","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

It is currently the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The dismal prognosis of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer points to our limited arsenal of effective anticancer therapies and screening tools. Pancreatic cancer disproportionately affects the Black and Jewish populations; nationally we see lower survival and later stage at diagnosis among the black population when compared to their white counterparts.<br \/>Objectives:<i> <\/i>This study aims to measure racial disparity in overall survival, diagnosis, and treatment regimens of pancreatic cancer in Hampton Roads Virginia in comparison to the national average. We hope to highlight the similarities\/differences of cancer disparity in the two major racial groups in our local Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cohort.<br \/>Methods: This retrospective study uses a cohort of 640 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 2008 and 2016 within the Sentara Healthcare and\/or Virginia Oncology Associates (VOA) system in Hampton Roads. The cohort was stratified into two groups: 191 patients diagnosed with operable disease who underwent surgical resection, and 449 patients diagnosed with inoperable disease; and then further separated into a white and black populations. Survival was calculated from date of initial diagnosis to date of last follow-up or death from all-cause mortality. Clinical and pathological parameters (TNM classification) and standard treatment modalities were reviewed, validated, and compared using electronic medical records at Sentara EPIC and VOA iKnow Medicine.<br \/>Results: Of the<b> <\/b>191 pancreatic cancer patients, 45 underwent surgical resection only, 100 received surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, and 46 received NACT and surgery. In the operable cohort, 41.5% of the PDAC patients are African American (AA) and 55.8% are Caucasians. Thus, pancreatic cancer incidence among black patients was over-represented in Hampton Roads Virginia that has a 31.3% AA population. Treatment provided and stage of diagnosis for pancreatic cancer are comparable in the two major race groups. The total length of survival of our black patients was not worse when compared to the white patients in both operable and inoperable cohorts, however white patients more frequently met the 5-year survival milestone.<br \/>Conclusion: Our PDAC patients of the two race groups still have a lower 5-year survival as compared to that of the national average (SEER data). The underlying factors contributing to the dismal 5-year survival rate and higher incidence are likely multifactorial, possibly explained by unhealthy diet, genetic factors, mutant carriers, social economic status, insurance, and increased risk behaviors as compared to national averages.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Race,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zakary  L.

The purpose of this research was to describe incidence and mortality rates (2013-2017) for leading cancers in the CA, which consists of Cook County, IL; DuPage County, IL; Lake County, IL; Will County, IL; and Lake County, IN. Age-adjusted rates (per 100,000) were calculated for leading cancers by sex for each county, the CA, U.S., and IL. Racial disparities were also examined by comparing Black rates to White rates. Incidence rates were higher in the CA compared to the U.S for all cancers data was available for: all sites combined, breast, and prostate. For males, mortality rates of prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers were higher in the CA compared to the U.S. For females, mortality rates of breast, colorectal, myeloma, uterine, stomach, and bladder cancers, as well as all sites combined were higher in the CA compared to the U.S. By county, males experienced incidence rates 8% to nearly 2.5 times higher and mortality rates 3% to over 1.5 times higher compared to the U.S. for various cancers. By county, females experienced incidence rates 5% to over 4 times higher and mortality rates 4% to over 1.5 times higher compared to the U.S. for various cancers. Lake County, IN generally had the highest incidence and mortality rates. Racial disparities in incidence and mortality were present for most cancers in the CA overall and by county. For males, racial disparities in mortality for prostate, stomach, and larynx are of greatest concern. For females, racial disparities in mortality for myeloma, cervical, and uterine are of greatest concern.

However, there have been limited efforts to identify and address cancer disparities by sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). We sought to identify differences in demographics, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between sexual and gender minority (SGM) and non-SGM cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: Analysis include over 70,000 cancer patients at the Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa, FL) who completed our Electronic Patient Questionnaire (EPQ) at their initial appointment. Moffitt&#8217;s EPQ is a standard-of-care (SOC) questionnaire instrument used to collect self-reported demographics, prior medical history, history of cancer, utilization of cancer screening services, and lifestyle risk factors. The SOGI items in the demographics section were used to categorize persons as a SGM or non-SGM. Cancer registry data were used to obtain clinical covariates on the patients that completed the EPQ.<br \/>Results: SGM patients represented 2.3% of the patient population. The mean age of SGM patients was significantly lower (mean=56) compared to non-SGM patients (mean=62.3, p= &#60;0.001). There was a higher prevalence of racial (10.1% vs 9.4%, p= &#60;0.001) and ethnic (11.5% vs 8.8%, p= &#60;0.001) minorities among SGM vs non-SGM patients. SGM patients were significantly more likely to be single (32.8% vs 10.3%, p= &#60;0.001). For modifiable risk factors, there were significantly more current smokers among SGM vs non-SGM patients (5.4% vs 3.1%, p= &#60;0.001) and SGM patients reported higher number of pack-years smoked (mean=22.5 vs mean=22.5, p= 0.007). SGM patients reported higher rates alcohol consumption, especially significantly higher rates of more than 5 drinks per day (8.1% vs 6.2%, p= &#60;0.001). SGM patients reported significantly higher rates of depression (35.1% vs 19.8%, p= &#60;0.001). SGM patients also reported less utilization in all forms of exercise such as moderate to vigorous physical activity or walking). SGM patients reported lower utilizing of fecal occult blood test (26.6% vs 32.3%, p= 0.026) and sigmoidoscopy\/colonoscopy (75.1% vs 89.8%, p= &#60;0.001) for colorectal cancer screening compared to non-SGM patients. SGM patients had slightly higher rates of cancer diagnoses for GI, Endocrine, Sarcoma, GYN and associated with overall inferior survival (p= 0.001).<br \/>Discussion: The Moffitt Cancer Center began collecting SOGI information as SOC information on all new patients since 2016. In just 5 years of data collection, our institution has identified numerous real-world disparities among SGMs patients. These findings will be critical to develop tailored interventions to improve equality care across the cancer care continuum for SGM populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Diagnosis,Modeling,Outcome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shahrzad A.

Socioeconomic (SES) barriers (hereinafter as barriers) are associated with inadequate healthcare access and are exacerbated by differences in nativity status (foreign-born vs US-born). Since foreign-born individuals may experience greater barriers than their US-born counterparts, it is important to assess the association of SES barriers with HcD in a sample of US CS and explore nativity differences.<br \/>Methods: This study analyzed CS survey data collected from May 2018 to April 2021 from the &#8220;All of Us&#8221; research program. HcD was assessed by creating a binary indicator where those that responded <i>yes<\/i> to delaying care for any reason (financial, social, and accessibility), were considered to have experienced HcD, and those who responded <i>no<\/i> delays of care for all aspects were considered to have not experienced HcD. Barriers were assessed by creating a composite measure of SES (i.e., insurance, employment, education, income, and housing) with scores ranging from 0 (no barriers) to 3+ (3 or more barriers). Multivariable (sex, race, marital status, cancer type, nativity) logistic regression models tested the associations between 1) barriers and HcD and 2) explored whether this relationship varied by nativity.<br \/>Results: The median age in our sample was 64 years (IQR=17.04), with a higher proportion of White ethnicity\/race (82%) and females (66%) participants. Compared to US-born (n=9206) a greater proportion of foreign-born individuals (n=815) reported more HcD (31% vs 35%) and 3+ barriers (10% vs 15%). Multivariable analyses showed that CS who experienced 2 or 3+ barriers had 1.64 (95%CI: 1.43,1.89) and 2.15 (95%CI: 1.83,2.53) times the odds of experiencing HcD compared to those with no barriers, respectively. These associations varied by nativity (LRT p<sub>interaction<\/sub>=0.03), showing that for every 1 additional barrier, the odds of HcD were more than 2 times greater for foreign-born than US-born (OR=1.65, 95%CI:1.39,1.98, p<sub>trend<\/sub>&#60;0.001 vs OR=1.27, 95%CI:1.21,1.34, p<sub>trend<\/sub>&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: We found that SES-related barriers have a significantly negative impact on HcD among foreign- and US-born cancer survivors, with a greater effect among foreign-born individuals. Our study underscores that if health systems and practices want to achieve health equity, more emphasis should be placed on addressing the social determinants of health.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Cancer Health Disparities,Cancer Survivors,Socioeconomic Barriers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Angel Arizpe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stephanie Navarro<sup>1<\/sup>, Carol  Y.

Ascertainment of incident cancer was carried out via linkage to state cancer registries. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for confounders.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> This study included 81,525 participants (30.2 % (N=24,581) White; 65.9% (N=53,711) Black) of whom 36.2% (N=29,487) were diagnosed with diabetes. Among those with diabetes, 10.3% (N=3,024) were diagnosed with cancer. Individuals with T2D had an elevated risk of several cancers, including pancreatic cancer (HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.18-1.96); but a reduced risk of esophageal cancer (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34-0.89). Some racial differences were found regarding the association of T2D with cancer risk.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We found varying risks between T2D and risk of cancer between White and Black individuals. This highlights the importance of T2D prevention practices to help mitigate the risk of cancer and that further research is necessary to understand this association in minority individuals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"African American,Cancer risk,Race,Incidence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pranoti Pradhan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Wanqing Wen<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zheng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cee33b74-539e-4d83-9c55-2b019b30f7f8","ControlNumber":"8049","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Identification of germline predisposition can have implications for treatment and cancer prevention. While previous studies have found that universal multigene panel testing in patients with cancer yields increased detection of actionable heritable variants compared to targeted testing, patients belonging to racial and ethnic minority groups have been underrepresented in these studies. We undertook a prospective multi-site study of germline alternations among solid tumor cancer patients from under-represented minority (URM) populations receiving care at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Centers between January 2020 and November 2022. Patients with a new or active cancer diagnosis (all stages) not selected for family history of cancer were tested with a &#62;80-gene next generation sequencing panel. Of 532 patients (mean [SD] age, 57.2 [12.7] years; 320 (60.2%) female), 247 (46.4%) were Hispanic\/Latino, 130 (24.4%) Black\/African American, 80 (15.0%) Asian, 66 (12.4%) American Indian\/Alaskan Native, 2 (0.4%) Native Hawaiian\/Pacific Islander, and 7 (1.3%) other. PGV were found in 43 patients (8.1%), including 29 moderate- or high- penetrance cancer susceptibility genes. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were found in 272 patients (51.1%). Of those with a PGV, 29 (67.4%) had incremental clinically actionable findings that would not have been detected by established testing criteria, of which 16 were moderate- or high-penetrance variants. Younger age of diagnosis, gender, race, ethnicity, and stage of disease were not predictive of PGV. In this study of under-represented minority cancer patients, universal genetic testing found that 1 in 12 patients harbor a PGV, more than two-thirds of whom would remain undetected using current guidelines. The paucity of genomic data in URM populations also results in a large proportion of VUS which may lead to under-estimation of disease associated variants.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"

Despite these genomic advancements, disparities in precision medicine access and data have resulted in disparate impacts on different socioeconomic groups. Many of the gold standard datasets largely exclude minority populations, compounding their exclusion from medical research. This has resulted in a restricted understanding of cancer and other complex diseases. We demonstrate the effects of ancestral bias in gold standard genomics datasets through ancestral analysis of cancer-related genes in the Cancer Gene Census, spanning 17 ancestral populations. Additionally, we present a machine learning framework, PhyloFrame, that incorporates population genomics data to correct for ancestral bias by creating disease signatures representative of all ancestries. Our ancestral analysis results show that while a majority of the current cancer-related genes in the Cancer Gene Census have below average mutation frequency in non-European populations, there are peaks of ancestrally enriched mutations in ancestry-specific genes related to cancer, which can be targeted using PhyloFrame. PhyloFrame prioritizes gene expression from the cancer genes with high frequency mutations in a given human population in order to capture genes driving disease in each ancestry. It builds on existing disease gene signatures and big-data functional interaction networks to identify ancestry-relevant genes related to a disease, outputing an ancestry-agnostic disease signature. We test PhyloFrame on TCGA cancers with diverse patient populations, such as breast cancer, and compare PhyloFrame's disease signature output to the disease signature output of elastic net runs on cancer samples from a single ancestry. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of ancestral information allows PhyloFrame to recapitulate disease signatures trained on only one ancestry in a dataset with individuals from many unquantified ancestries. With the incorporation of ancestral information, PhyloFrame is able to create disease signatures with genes pertinent to each ancestral population, even when individuals from those populations are not included in the training data. This work offers a quick and cheap alternative to the mass sequencing that would be required to capture disease-driving genes in minority populations in hopes to contribute to equitable representation in medical research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Cancer genetics,Population genomics,SNP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leslie  A.

These disparities are driven by a complex interplay among social, psychosocial, lifestyle, environmental, healthcare, and biological determinants of health. A challenge is that the social constructs of race and ethnicity may not fully capture shared genetic background. Genomics can capture ancestry in a more precise way, allowing genetic in&#64258;uences to be teased apart from the impact of social and environmental factors. Here, we searched for associations between continental genetic ancestry and somatic mutations in cancer genes in a pan-cancer cohort of 100,000 patients. A sample of de-identified records from patients who underwent tumor profiling with the Tempus xT 648-gene assay was selected from the Tempus Database. We inferred global African (AFR), Amerindian (AMR), East Asian (EAS), European (EUR), and South Asian (SAS) continental ancestry proportions with a custom set of 658 ancestry informative markers. To properly account for the collinearity of ancestry proportions, we performed logistic compositional data analysis between mutation counts and ancestry proportions from data of cancer types with at least 300 patients and for genes for which a minimum of 10 and at least 1% of patients harbored variants. Odds ratios (ORs) represent the effect of a doubling in ancestry proportion, adjusted for age, gender, assay version, and all other ancestries. We examined associations for the presence of nonsynonymous somatic mutations and predicted driver mutations with the boostDM algorithm. We adjusted for multiple comparisons at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. We identified previously reported significant (p&#60;0.001) associations between EAS and predicted driver mutations in <i>EGFR<\/i> (OR=1.08) in lung cancer, and between AFR and <i>APC<\/i> (OR=1.03) and <i>KRAS<\/i> (OR=1.04) in colorectal cancer. Moreover, we found several novel associations, including AFR with <i>TP53<\/i> (OR=1.06) and <i>PTEN<\/i> (OR=0.90) in endometrial cancer and <i>BRAF<\/i> (OR=0.93) in colorectal cancer, and EAS with <i>CTNNB1<\/i> (OR=1.17) in lung cancer. The latter is noteworthy as <i>CTNNB1<\/i>, which has been proposed as a <i>TTK<\/i> inhibitor response biomarker, is overall infrequently mutated in lung cancer but activating mutations have been reported in East Asian patients. Indeed, we found that 7% of East Asian lung cancer patients in our cohort harbor a driver mutation in this gene <i>vs.<\/i> 1.6% in the other groups. Additionally, an association with nonsynonymous mutations was found between AMR with <i>PTPN22<\/i> (OR=1.26) in colorectal cancer. While these associations can be the result of a combination of environmental, social, and biological factors, our results suggest that genetic ancestry can be useful to understand disparities in cancer incidence, progression, and outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic factors,Race,Mutations,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brooke Rhead<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yannick Pouliot<sup><\/sup>, Justin Guinney<sup><\/sup>, Francisco M.
