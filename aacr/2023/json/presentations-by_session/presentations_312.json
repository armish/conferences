[{"Abstract":"Over the past two decades, an increasing number of small molecule drugs that target unique molecular changes underlying a specific cancer have been approved, and small molecule drugs represent a major therapeutic class for cancer treatment. Chemical &#8216;probes&#8217; are also indispensable tools to advance our understanding of pathologies at the molecular and cellular level and to validate novel drug targets.<br \/>A major bottleneck in identifying and developing these chemical compounds in academia is often access to robust disease-relevant assays, high-throughput screening platforms, comprehensive screening libraries, medicinal expertise for the hit-to-lead optimization. In order to democratize access to these resources for a broader scientific community, the publicly funded EU-OPENSCREEN (www.eu-openscreen.eu) initiative has been established with the aim to accelerate drug discovery efforts in an open-access setting in collaboration with researchers from academia and industry.<br \/>EU-OPENSCREEN&#8217;s 30 expert centers offer access to their cancer target-based and phenotypic drug screening expertise, capabilities in developing disease-relevant assays and hit-to-lead optimization capabilities. The identified bioactive &#8216;hit&#8217; compounds will be progressed into high-quality chemical starting points to be further developed into drug leads or chemical probes for the elucidation of mechanisms of cancer onset, progression, resistance and effects of drug therapy. All generated tool compounds and associated bioactivity data are made available to the global scientific community.<br \/>Here we will present an overview of anti-cancer drug discovery projects of EU-OPENSCREEN and explain the opportunities and benefits for other international scientists to collaboratively develop novel anti-cancer drug leads and chemical probes.<br \/><i>EU-OPENSCREEN receives funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe research and innovation programs under grant agreements No 654248 and 101058620.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Chemistry,Assay development,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bahne Stechmann<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Charlotte Wit<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>EU-OPENSCREEN ERIC, Berlin, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f7f98fcf-f5a2-4580-882d-cd4de9f8aad9","ControlNumber":"3595","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

However, limitations in the traditional discovery process, including immune tolerance of highly homologous genes, challenges with antibody sequence humanization, clone selection, and model selection for drug efficacy and safety evaluation, often hinder the process of identifying new therapeutic antibodies. The RenMice&#8482; HiTS (Hyperimmune Target Specific) Platform is a library of chromosome engineered mice with fully human immunoglobulin variable domains replacing the mouse loci, each with a specific drug target gene knocked out. These mice are designed to establish robust immune responses and generate antibodies that bind to more epitopes of the target protein, including conserved domains. The platform is ideal for challenging targets, such as proteins with high homology across species, or multi-pass transmembrane proteins (e.g. GPCRs\/ion channels). Here, we show that the platform can be used to generate antibodies that cross-react with multiple species, like human, monkey, dog, and mouse targets, by immunizing with both human and mouse or dog antigen. We provide examples for newer campaigns, including species cross-reactivity and internalization of novel antibodies targeting NECTIN-4, and high-throughput in vivo efficacy screening of novel anti-PD-1 antibodies in wild-type mice. In the future, we will evaluate the preliminary toxicity of these cross-reactive antibodies in preclinical animal models. Thus, selection of the best antibody candidate based on in vivo efficacy and safety allows for a streamlined and successful preclinical phase. In conclusion, the RenMice&#8482; HiTS platform facilitates the generation of developable antibodies that recognize novel epitopes and challenging targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Immunotherapy,Drug-discovery screen,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xiaoqian Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shufang Fu<sup>1<\/sup>, Shujin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Ji<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Li Hui<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, James Jin<sup>2<\/sup>, Jing Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Biocytogen Boston Corp, Wakefield, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"86fb3377-e7ee-420c-9b5f-e585ed302a7e","ControlNumber":"5170","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

However, responses can be context-specific, meaning there is a real need for large-scale studies to fully explore the drug combination response landscape.<br \/>We present a screen of 109 drug combinations in over 750 diverse cell lines covering 41 hematological and solid tumor types. Each combination was screened in a full 7x7 matrix format, representing over 2.3 million individual data points, the largest such study to date. We took a novel approach to assess combination benefit. Growth inhibition and highest single agent (HSA) and Bliss excess combination heatmaps were generated for all &#62;68,000 combination-cell line pairs, and each was scored for high activity (combination Emax&#62;0.5) and combination benefit\/synergy (HSA&#62;0.1). Out of 4578 combination-cancer type pairs 489 met the filtering criteria. We prioritized combinations based on their efficacy and cancer type selectivity to minimize risk of potential tissue toxicity. We identified several known combination-cancer type pairs (e.g. MCL1 inhibitor AZD5991 plus BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax in AML) as well as novel indications for combinations already known to be active in a different cancer type (e.g. AZD5991 plus AKT inhibitor capivasertib in endometrial cancer or AURKB inhibitor AZD2811 plus venetoclax in DLBCL). We selected 4 combinations based on clinical need and validated them further <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> (selumetinib plus venetoclax or AZD5991, AZD2811 plus venetoclax, and capivasertib plus AZD5991).<br \/>To understand how molecular context affects drug response, we also used GDSC tools ANOVA to perform over 5.4 million statistical tests to identify statistically significant associations between drug response metrics and multi-omics features including mutations, CNAs, gene expression and methylation. Associations were identified with five response metrics, covering both single agent and combination responses. We looked for significant associations across 21 different subgroups of cell lines and 6 molecular &#8216;baskets&#8217; (TP53, KRAS, MLL2\/KMT2D, PTEN, PIK3CA, and BRAF). We identified 11,611 biomarkers which met the significance criteria (p&#60;=0.001, FDR&#60;=10%, and both positive and negative Glass deltas &#62;=1). Moreover, we used biomarkers of single-agent response to identify any combination Emax or Bliss associated biomarkers that could not be explained by the action of either drug. This resulted in identification of 1,631 &#8216;emergent&#8217; biomarkers.<br \/>In summary, our screen and pipeline have been designed to optimize preclinical interpretation with a focus on actionability, particularly by our unique approach, and to provide a valuable resource for exploration by the wider research community. As a result of this screen, we identified and validated novel combination-tumor types in multiple cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,High-content screening,Biomarkers,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Azadeh Bashi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth  A.

Primary cancer cells were isolated from fresh surgical specimens that resected from 143 GC patients using Gentle Max tissue dissociation system. Primary cells were mixed with Matrigel, and placed on a micropillar for three-dimensional (3D) culture. After the primary cells were stabilized in the complete culture medium (CCM) than added various chemotherapeutic drugs containing 5-FU, Oxaliplatin, and Paclitaxel in CCM and incubated for 7 days. Cell viability was determined through calcein staining and quantified scanned images. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> for each drug was calculated by a sigmoidal dose-response curve, using the GraphPad Prism 9 program. The average weight of gastric cancer tissue used in the experiment was 300 mg (75 mg ~ 1930 mg), and the average number of dissociated viable cells for each tissue was 3.9 x 10^6 cells\/case. About 2.4 x 10^5 live cell was required per drug, we were able to obtain an average of 6.4 (Min.2, Max 14) drug reactivity data per tissue using the HTD screening system. GC tissues obtained from the operating room were dissociated within 16 hours and then loaded into the HTS system within 3 hours. Cells were stabilized for 1 day in 3D culture plate and exposed to the drug for 7 days, and then data reports were made within 3 days. As a result, it was possible to obtain within 14 days from fresh surgical GC tissue to drug response data. Additionally, we confirmed that 3D cultured primary cells derived from GC tissues consistently preserved primary characters using IHC. Similar to their parental cancer tissue, GC 3D cultured primary cells derived from adenocarcinoma large glandular patterns and retain the expression of some marker proteins. In this study, we evaluated the drug response data for 101 cases (success rate 71%; 101\/143) to 5-FU, Oxaliplatin, and Palitaxel, etc. using the HTD screening system and it was confirmed that individual patient had a difference response to each drug. Here we established the HTD screening system using 3D cultured GC patient derived primary cells. The advantages of this system were that it is the first model system that directly used patient-derived primary cells for drug screening, and it can rapidly evaluate drug reactivity to various anticancer drugs within 10 days. The HTD screening system based on patient-derived primary cells can provide that information to predict drug response and allow for finding more appropriate therapy for each patient.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-throughput assay,Screening,3D cell culture,Stomach cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jieun Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jung Eun Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Sanjun Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, Tae-Kyeong Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, In Hee Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, So Hee Yoon<sup>2<\/sup>, Mira Yoo<sup>1<\/sup>, Eunju Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Doo-Young Hwang<sup>1<\/sup>, So Hyun Kang<sup>1<\/sup>, Bo Sung Ku<sup>2<\/sup>, Dong Woo Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Young Suk Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Ji-Won K<sup>4<\/sup>, Jin Won Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Sang-Hoon Ahn<sup>1<\/sup>, Keun-Wook Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Hyung-Ho Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyun Jung Oh<sup>5<\/sup>, Yun-Suhk Suh<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Precision Medicine, Medical & Bio Decision (MBD Co., Ltd.), Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6aa6f8fc-fb4a-49e7-8ca7-fefcd45e01dd","ControlNumber":"1744","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

While the conventional antibody discovery process via animal immunization and <i>in vivo<\/i> hypermutation can generate sufficient hits for functional screening, this approach can only cover a limited subset of sequence diversity. In silico, artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods, by contrast, have the potential to cover 2-3 orders of magnitude more sequence diversity compared to conventional methods and more rapidly produce a drug candidate with a superior safety and efficacy profile. However, this approach requires wet lab validation of predicted sequences as well as targeted data generation to improve AI-predicted rankings. Traditional wet lab methods for protein generation and characterization are expensive, time consuming, and prone to human error. These limitations restrict the overall potential benefit of the AI-driven antibody discovery process. To accelerate this process, which consists of a complex series of cycles spanning different functional teams, a substantial increase in the throughput of the end-to-end production and characterization workflow is established in-house such that 10<sup>4<\/sup> antibodies with property data can be generated and analyzed within a short period of time. BioMap has implemented a highly integrated and automated protein expression, purification, and characterization platform linked with a unified informatics system to eliminate as much manual operation as possible. This high-throughput robotic platform interweaves multiple procedures including plasmid preparation, cell dispensing, mammalian transfection, protein purification, and characterization, and it is coupled to our in-house informatics system and database. Empowered by state-of-the-art liquid handling system and well-established experimental protocols, the integrated facility is capable of the delivery of 10<sup>3<\/sup> protein samples from plasmids in ten days within a single batch. Benefiting from our robust transient expression platform, the production scale ranges from 0.5 to 30 mL with an average antibody yield of 300 mg\/L. The high-throughput workflow brings a challenge to track the provenance of each protein and manage data flow across different stations. To address this bottleneck, a well-defined informatics platform and database have been developed to provide sample registration, interface with lab instruments, experimental process tracking, and automated data recording and analysis. The implementation of this system provides a massive amount of high-quality data available for AI training and validation with a very short turnover time and enables AI-driven development of next-generation biologics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Immunotherapy,Antibody,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Zhehao Xiong<sup><\/sup>, Wei Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Lijun Xia<sup><\/sup>, Jianhua Huang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Cheng-chi Chao<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biomap, Menlo Park, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f8b54ae2-6f27-4cbe-ae6d-826372055836","ControlNumber":"4118","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

This is, in part, due to their rarity (accounting for 0.7% of all cancers) and heterogeneity (over 50 different diseases fall under this category). Moreover, preclinical models are scarce, often exhibiting slow growth kinetics, which limits their study by large genetic and pharmacological libraries. Here, we present an update on our efforts to harness the power of patient-partnered research to create a platform for rare cancer drug target discovery as a broadly available community resource. We developed a patient-partnered tissue donation pipeline to enable patients anywhere in the United States to participate and piloted our approach for <i>CTNNB1<\/i>-driven desmoid tumors. To overcome challenges in tissue heterogeneity during ex vivo culture, we optimized a multiplexed sequencing protocol to quantitatively track changes in tumor cell fraction across hundreds of media formulations. Following this strategy, we were able to verify and expand three cell lines that preserve the <i>CTNNB1<\/i> mutations at high purity. To identify potential therapeutics, we completed a 6,750-drug repurposing screen, at 2.5uM in duplicate, in two verified cell line models. After extensive quality control assessments and data integration steps to leverage the power of other large scale drug screens, we selected 263 compounds for follow-up based on potency, selectivity, and association with molecular features associated with desmoid tumors. Approximately 70% of selected compounds were validated by an 8-point, 2-fold dilution, dose-response format with a top concentration of 10uM. Of the confirmed active compounds, 80 showed a strong pattern of selectivity, 20 are FDA approved drugs and 13 investigational compounds show a statistical association with <i>CTNNB1<\/i> hotspot mutation status or transcriptomic features associated with desmoid tumors. To prioritize potential therapeutic targets, we tested an efficient CRISPR\/Cas9 all-in-one library design. The reduction of the CRISPR\/Cas9 library size was achieved via multiple gene- and guide-level strategies, which enables statistically powered gene essentiality interrogation in slow-growing patient-derived models. We tested several plating and infection parameters and developed an optimized pipeline for the rapid introduction of this library into early patient-derived samples. Established cell lines of mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal origin, which have previously been tested by genome-wide libraries, were used to control for library and lineage effects. We are developing a biologist-friendly web portal that will enable the research community to easily interact with models and data produced by this effort. Our study provides evidence that a systematic patient-powered approach can facilitate discovery of therapeutic hypotheses for these understudied diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,&#946;-catenin,Drug discovery,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mushriq Al-Jazrawe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kathryn Cebula<sup>1<\/sup>, Elisabeth  A.

Currently, there are six CAR-T cell products available in the market including Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus, Breyanzi, Abecma, and Carvykt. The success of CAR-T cell therapy has stimulated the increase in the research and development of various CAR constructs to target different tumor types. Therefore, a robust and efficient in vitro potency assay is needed to quickly identify potential CAR gene design from a library of construct candidates. Traditionally, in vitro CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity is assessed using release assays such as 51Cr (radioactivity), calcein (fluorescence), and LDH (enzymatic). However, release assays indirectly measure cell death via molecules released in supernatant and typically limited to only endpoint assays. In addition, handling and disposing of 51Cr hazardous materials is less preferred. Luciferase reporter assay, although highly sensitive, has similar drawbacks as the release assays. Finally, flow cytometry method can directly measure cell death and viability, but can be time-consuming and requires a large number of CAR-T cells when the effector-to-target (E:T) ratio is high. Furthermore, additional steps are required for adherent cells that require trypsinization. Image cytometry methodologies have been utilized for various CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay using different fluorescent labeling methods, mainly due to their ease-of-use, ability to capture cell images for verification, and higher throughput performance. In this work, we employed the Celigo high-throughput plate-based Image Cytometer to evaluate and compare two CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays using GFP-expressing or fluorescent dye-labeled myeloma and plasmacytoma cells. Performing time- and E:T ratio-dependent CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays, the GFP-based method demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting the<br \/>level of cytotoxicity when compared to the CMFDA\/DAPI viability method. We have established the criteria and considerations for the selection of cytotoxicity assays that are fit-for-purpose to ensure the results produced are meaningful for the specific testing conditions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Image analysis,Cytotoxicity,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leo Li-Ying Chan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yu-Jun Sun<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi-Chun Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Wei-Kai Hua<sup>2<\/sup>, Sariena Chiung-Yuan Wu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Advanced Technology R&D, Nexcelom from PerkinElmer, Lawrence, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Research and Development, GenomeFrontier Therapeutics, Taipei City, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"16b5e242-38b1-49b6-bd9c-3a605d41e453","ControlNumber":"2630","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

Images underwent processing using Gen5 suite (Biotek, Inc) including Z-projection to render organoids into single two-dimensional planes. Baseline objects were defined between 50&#181;m and 750&#181;m, and filtration based on circularity defined as &#62;0.4. Object alignment was performed based on root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) between all combinations of objects to optimize match determination. This analysis was performed in drug screen of 80 independent agents in early clinical trials in combination with CDK7 inhibitor, SY-5609. Well level viability was performed using standardized 3D CellTiterGlo (CTG, Promega Inc.) (33% v\/v). Response was assessed using descriptive statistics, effect size (Glass&#8217;s &#916;), and Therapeutic Sensitivity Index (TSI) defined as the weighted average between elements with growth from media control versus treated population.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Z projection of 600um in Low-volume plating (10&#181;L) of matrix suspension yielded 1.68 organoids per &#181;L relative to the traditional hanging drop design (50&#181;L) 0.75 organoids per &#181;L (p&#60;0.005). Organoid alignment across the continuum of RMSD yielded maximum successful matches at 75&#181;m with 66.1% of objects versus 6.7% based on randomly assigned objects across validation experimental sets (n=1380). An optimal circularity value was determined at 0.4; an increase of circularity by 0.1 yielded a &#62;5% reduction in of matched objects, while a decrease in circularity by 0.1 yielded a &#60;5% reduction in unmatched objects. A poor correlation was seen for the percent of growing organoids within a population and well level normalized viability via CTG (R = 0.37). The normalized CTG value had improved in correlation when compared to effect size relative to control (R = 0.54) and TSI (R = 0.56).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We provide a method for high fidelity alignment of PCOs in low-volume format for matrix-based screening applications.

Gain&#8211;of&#8211;function missense mutations promoting oncogenesis cluster at codons 12, 13, and 61 of KRAS, NRAS and HRAS. These result in enhanced GTP binding due to fast exchange of nucleotide and\/or impairment of GAP (GTPase Activating Protein) binding. Although these mutants are all activating, they are not equal in their oncogenic potential and differences in patient survival are associated with different RAS mutants and which RAS allele is affected, with KRAS being the most prevalent. Current RAS therapeutic approaches have migrated to be isoform specific. With this in mind, we have developed an activation state specific high throughput screening compatible (HTS) assay that is specific for KRAS. A novel rabbit anti&#8211;KRAS recombinant antibody was isolated via cloning of immunoglobulin variable regions from antigen positive B cells isolated from rabbits immunized with a peptide immunogen targeting a region of low homology between the RAS isoforms. Antibody specificity was validated with recombinant HRAS, KRAS and NRAS proteins over a wide concentration range by both immunoblotting and by a bead&#8211;based multiplex ELISA where all three RAS isoforms were present. The new assay allows for direct in&#8211;well lysis of cells cultured in 96&#8211;well plate format, either directly in media or following a PBS wash step. Activated KRAS in the lysate is captured on the assay plate and detected via chemiluminescence using the KRAS specific antibody. Preliminary assay validation has included EGF treatment of HeLa cells to show activation in cells expressing wildtype KRAS and inhibition with the selective non&#8211;covalent KRASG12D inhibitor MRTX1133 in Aspc1 cells known to express KRASG12D over a wide range of cell seeding densities.

However, generating potent clinical responses against solid tumors remains a challenge for CAR T therapy. As the field strives to improve the therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells with novel target antigens and enhanced potency, the risks of on-target toxicity pose a major barrier to progress. To address these challenges, we have developed engineered CAR T cells to target solid tumors through AND logic gates, where CAR expression is conditionally induced by a transcription factor released from a priming receptor (PrimeRTM) upon binding to the PrimeR antigen. The AND gate limits off-tumor toxicity as it requires both CAR and PrimeR antigen expression in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>To ensure PrimeR expression and signal transduction upon antigen binding, while minimizing residual &#8216;&#8216;leaky&#8217;&#8217; CAR induction in the absence of PrimeR antigen, we screened hundreds of PrimeR binders using both arrayed and pooled strategies. In an arrayed strategy, we engineered T cells from four donors in multiwell plates using CRISPR-mediated, non-viral, site-specific integration of logic gates bearing a variable PrimeR binder and a fixed MSLN CAR. In addition, we employed a pooled screening strategy, where we engineered T cells from two independent donors with a pool containing a subset of &#62;300 of the same logic gates.<br \/>Engineered T cells from both strategies were co-cultured with cell lines bearing either both CAR and PrimeR antigens or a single antigen, in order to evaluate fidelity and on-target functionality. In the arrayed setting, on-target functionality was quantified based on the levels of CAR induction, cytokine secretion, T cell activation, and target cell killing in the presence of both antigens, while fidelity was assessed based on the absence of these activity signals in the presence of a single antigen. In the pooled setting, sorting based on functional markers was performed and sequencing was used to quantify the relative abundance of cells with each logic gate in different sorted populations. On-target activity and circuit fidelity were then quantified based on enrichments in different sorted populations.<br \/>Results from the pooled and arrayed screens were highly concordant. We combined the screen readouts to nominate a small set of PrimeR binders that exhibited both high fidelity and on-target functionality. We confirmed the desired characteristics of these binders with targeted arrayed screens in additional conditions as well as in in-vivo models. We have applied both screen strategies to select a small set of leads from hundreds of candidate PrimeR binders in the context of a logic-gated MSLN CAR. As pooled and arrayed screens come with different sets of limitations and advantages, both serve as important tools for the effective selection of receptors in the development of novel cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-throughput assay,CAR T cells,CRISPR,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Li Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sofia Kyriazopoulou Panagiotopoulou<sup><\/sup>, Rona Harari-Steinfeld<sup><\/sup>, Dasmanthie De Silva<sup><\/sup>, Michelle Tan<sup><\/sup>, Laura Lim<sup><\/sup>, Angela Boroughs<sup><\/sup>, Cate Sue<sup><\/sup>, Jon Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jamie Thomas<sup><\/sup>, Mary Chua<sup><\/sup>, Ed Yashin<sup><\/sup>, Christine Shieh<sup><\/sup>, Ryan Fong<sup><\/sup>, Sophie Xu<sup><\/sup>, Grace Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Brendan Galvin<sup><\/sup>, Aaron Cooper<sup><\/sup>, Tarjei Mikkelsen<sup><\/sup>, Nicholas Haining<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Arsenal Biosciences, Inc, South San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1b139177-37a1-4b92-bbec-ec16e945d1b2","ControlNumber":"7001","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

Some of the key parameters required for satisfying CMC (Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls) criteria standards for cellular therapeutic products are cell identity, count, viability, purity, potency, stability, and microbiological quality, which may be routinely performed using flow cytometry. Some of these critical attributes can be exceedingly trivial for flow cytometric analysis, which can be complex, requires a dedicated user, and may carry a high maintenance cost. In the past decade, affordable image cytometry has been developed for cell characterization and cell-based assays but has not demonstrated the sensitivity required for visualization and analysis of surface markers, cell health, and viability. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of the newly developed Cellaca PLX image cytometry system for population analysis of surface markers, viability of fluorescent protein expressing cells, and cell health in comparison to flow cytometry. For immunophenotyping assays, PBMCs were stained with anti-human CD3\/CD4\/CD8 antibodies with Hoechst. Additionally, viability detection of GFP and RFP-containing cell lines was performed by staining with RubyDead and Hoechst. Finally, apoptosis was induced in Jurkat cells with staurosporine and stained with Caspase 3-488, RubyDead, and Hoechst. All assays were imaged and analyzed using the Cellaca PLX image cytometer, and the data generated were compared directly to the CytoFlex flow cytometer.

Characterization of cell viability, in addition to cell identity, cell count and other CQAs, are essential to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy throughout various developmental stages of cell and gene therapies. To determine cell viability, a variety of viability detection methods have been used, such as trypan blue (TB) exclusion assay, and fluorescence-based dyes including acridine orange \/ propidium iodide (AO\/PI), acridine orange \/ 4&#8242;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (AO\/DAPI), all of which have been employed on flow or image-based cytometry systems. In this work, we employed the Cellaca MX high-throughput cell counter to characterize and compare AO\/PI and AO\/DAPI viability detection methods. First, we measured the viabilities of different ratios of viable and non-viable Jurkat cells created via two cell dying processes. Next, viabilities of the stained cells were measured multiple times within a 30 min staining time for each method in order to monitor the trend of viability changes. The viability results showed that the AO\/DAPI method were generally higher than AO\/PI method with differences ranging from 0% to 24%. We also observed the discrepancy of the measured viability differences between naturally-dying and heat-killed Jurkat cells, suggesting that the viability difference might be dependent on the cell dying process. In the time-dependent viability characterization, results from AO\/DAPI method showed increasing dead cell counts leading to decreasing viability, revealing an on-going staining process. In contrast, results from AO\/PI method showed more consistent cell count and viability measurements, indicating a more instantaneous staining process. Lastly, we conducted a cell proliferation assay as an orthogonal method to confirm replicability of the low viability cell samples. The proliferation assay results showed no significant increase in cell concentrations within the 4-day time frame. The viability results before the culture were approximately 0% for both naturally-dying and heat-killed Jurkat cells, using the AO\/PI staining method, and 12% and 9% using the AO\/DAPI respectively. Furthermore, spiked samples of natural-dying and heat-killed cells with healthy cells (&#62;90% viability) were generated and measured, which showed exponential growth. The viability results of these spiked samples before the culture were 11% and 9% by AO\/PI and 17% and 18% by AO\/DAPI, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that cell viability methods need to be optimized for different fluorescent stains in order to generate reliable, robust, and fit-for-purpose results for the downstream assays for cell and gene therapy products..","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-throughput assay,Gene therapy,Cell growth,Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yongyang Huang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Samir Patel<sup><\/sup>, Mackenzie Pierce<sup><\/sup>, Carolina Franco Nitta<sup><\/sup>, Bo Lin<sup><\/sup>, Leo Chan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"20dad121-1821-4268-a101-58544a6e9e3c","ControlNumber":"2323","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Despite extensive efforts and incremental successes in developing targeted drugs and immunotherapies for other cancers, chemotherapies continue to be the most used treatment of ovarian cancer. Although seemingly simplistic, identification of drugs targeting cellular machinery independent of genomic and genetic status continues to be a strong clinical need. Previously, we performed an RNAi-based screen of the druggable genome across a diverse histological panel of EOC cell line representing both platinum-sensitive and -resistant tumors (PMID: 23056589). This screen elucidated KIF11 as essential in maintaining EOC cell viability. KIF11, a mitotic spindle assembly motor protein, has been targeted clinically. Although drugs are well tolerated, potent, and specific, the objective response rates to KIF11 inhibitors in clinical trials were commonly less than 10%. The efficacy of KIF11 inhibitors is blunted via a compensatory motor kinesin, KIF15. The overexpression of KIF15 has been shown to compensate for absent KIF11 in the formation of the bipolar spindle apparatus during mitosis. Silencing KIF15 significantly sensitizes cells to KIF11 inhibitors and resensitizes resistant cells to KIF11 inhibitors. We developed a high throughput screening approach using Alpha technology to identify compounds that inhibit the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between KIF15 and TPX2, a unique approach to inhibiting KIF15 from previous efforts. Of the nearly 200,000 compounds screened, 177 compounds were selected to be further characterized based on assay performance and chemical properties. These compounds were screened for TPX2 or KIF15 binding by STD-NMR and waterLOGSY. Three compounds across two chemotypes were confirmed to bind KIF15. No compounds were found to bind TPX2. Additionally, 168 of the 177 compounds were screened for drug synergism <i>in vitro<\/i>. The synergism assay yielded 32 strongly and 8 weakly synergistic hits. The lead compound in each of the two chemotypes revealed by NMR were classified as strongly synergistic (max. bliss score of 8.0 and 29.9). To expand the potential lead compounds identified for further development, an antibody-free cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) is being completed with 168 compounds. Preliminarily, CETSA has shown that the two lead compounds significantly stabilize KIF15 (&#916;Tm = 5.6 &#176;C and 9.6 &#176;C). These two lead compounds behaved in a dose-dependent manner in the AlphaScreen (IC<sub>50<\/sub>= 2 &#181;M and 6 &#181;M), a favorable characteristic for further development. To date, two chemotypes have been identified as KIF15 inhibitors uniquely targeting the KIF15-TPX2 PPI. The data indicates KIF15 inhibition in combination with KIF11 inhibition is synergistic, thus demonstrating a potential novel treatment approach for people with EOCs.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Drug discovery,Chemotherapy,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin  K.

In patients, persistent and prolonged transgene expression correlated with positive clinical outcome, and thus temporal expansion of the transgene expression profile is expected to improve the therapeutic benefit even further. Recently, circular RNA (circRNA) has been discovered as a novel class of endogenously expressed RNA. CircRNAs, in contrast to mRNAs, are resistant to exo-nucleolytic decay which results in high intra-cellular stability and persistent expression within cells. Therefore, circRNA-based systems serve as an interesting new technology towards prolonged effects of treatment. Here, we show that our proprietary vector system, circAde, allows high expression of circRNAs through spliceosome-dependent biogenesis. By comparing the protein output from circAde and mRNA-based vectors, we show that the circAde-system out-performs conventional mRNA-based design, both in terms of transgene yield and temporal sustainability of expression. Moreover, using a panel of proof-of-concept-reporters, we show that certain design-features greatly influence the circRNA production and subsequent protein expression from the vector. Without the 5&#8217;cap, circRNAs are dependent on IRESs (internal ribosome entry sequences) for effective translation. By conducting two orthogonal IRES screens on 1000+ putative IRES elements, we have identified the most effective IRES sequence in melanoma and lung-cancer cells supporting effective circRNA production and high-yield protein expression, thereby improving our circAde vector system even further. Our results open a new platform towards development of novel, more effective strategies for the treatment of cancer and other settings in which durable transgene expression is desirable.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene therapy,Vaccines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Eoghan  T.

Activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs) consisting of seven type I receptor serine\/threonine kinases are responsible for TGF-&#946; family signal transduction by phosphorylating Smad proteins, which can activate target gene expression. Therefore, ALKs are attractive drug targets for intervention in TGF- &#946; signaling pathways as cancer immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Materials and methods<\/b>: We have produced seven human recombinant ALK proteins (ALK1-7). The in vitro kinase assays for all ALKs have been developed using TR-FRET system. To evaluated cellular potency, TGF-&#946;-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation assays in A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) and NMuMG (murine normal mammary gland cell line) cells were established. A TGF-&#946;-mediated Treg differentiation assay was performed as an ex-vivo cellular assay using naive CD4+ T cell isolated from mouse spleen. In vivo anti-tumor efficacies of selected compounds, alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody were assessed in a CT26.WT murine colon carcinoma syngeneic model.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We have implemented a high-throughput screening (HTS) against human ALK5 over our in-house compound library. Hit compound <b>1<\/b> was identified from the HTS, and the subsequent Hit-to-Lead study led to a novel thiazole analog 2 as the starting point of lead optimization. Our lead optimization efforts led to advanced lead compound AL1, which exhibited strong inhibitory potency for ALK5 with an IC50 value of single digit nanomolar. Unfortunately AL1 showed very low oral bioavailability in dogs, we continued the optimization study and identified compound AL2 having improved ADME property. In cellular assays, AL2 strongly suppressed the TGF-&#946;-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation in A549 cells. In addition, treatment with AL2 decreased in the percentage of mouse CD4+\/CD25+\/Foxp3+ Treg cells dose-dependently in the ex vivo TGF-&#946;-mediated Treg differentiation assay. As a monotherapy and combined with an anti-PD-1 antibody, oral administration of AL2 demonstrated robust in vivo antitumor efficacy in the CT26.WT murine colon carcinoma syngeneic model.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: On the basis of its in vitro potencies, PK profiles, and in vivo efficacies, AL2 is currently being further evaluated in preclinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,ALK5,Kinase inhibitors,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mai Arai<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Mitsuharu Hanada<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hideki Moriyama<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroshi Ohmoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Kazuhito Naka<sup>2<\/sup>, Masaaki Sawa<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Carna Biosciences, Inc., Kobe, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"29f26362-4114-4fd1-aae3-66e0d23d9997","ControlNumber":"5432","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

We present here an in vitro assay, the metabolism-dependent cytotoxicity assay (MDCA), for the evaluation of the roles of specific pathways on the efficacy of anticancer drugs. The assay employs a novel in vitro hepatic metabolic system, the permeabilized cofactor-supplemented human hepatocytes (MetMax Human Hepatocytes, MMHH), as an exogenous metabolic activating system for the evaluation of the in vitro cytotoxicity of anticancer agents towards a designated tumor and nontumor cells. MMHH are derived from cryopreserved human hepatocytes isolated from human livers procured for but not used for transplantation provided to our laboratory from the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine. We have previously demonstrated that MMHH retained all drug metabolizing enzyme pathways present in human hepatocytes. The advantages of MMHH include the following: 1. Drug metabolizing enzyme activities are not affected by cytotoxicity of the drug substrate, a major limitation of intact human hepatocytes; and 2. Drug metabolism pathways can be selected by cofactor specification (e.g. NADPH\/NAD+ for phase 1 oxidation; Uridine 5&#8242;-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) for glucuronidation; 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) for sulfation; N-acetyl coenzyme A for N-acetylation). We present here a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the role of various hepatic metabolic pathways towards the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide, a commonly used drug for the treatment of renal carcinoma, towards a renal cancer cell line, HEK293 cells. We observed that NADPH enhanced the cytotoxicity, consistent with the known metabolic activation of cyclophosphamide by P450 isoforms (e.g. CYP2B6; CYP3A4) to the known metabolic activation of cyclophosphamide to 4-hydroxycloophosphamide, followed by the formation of the ultimate cytotoxic metabolites phosphoramide mustard and acrolein, which are responsible for its anticancer properties. In addition, we found that the addition of L-glutathione attenuated cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity towards the HEK293 cells, an observation consistent with the roles of this cellular detoxification system in the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Minimal effects were observed for UDPGA and PAPS, consistent with the known noninvolvement of these phase 2 conjugating pathways in cyclophosphamide metabolism. MDCA represents an in vitro experimental system that can be routinely applied towards the discovery and development of novel anticancer drugs to evaluate the roles of drug metabolism in efficacy and safety, with various cancer cells (e.g. prostate carcinoma, neuroblastoma) and cells from normal tissues (e.g. cardiomyocytes, intestinal mucosal cells), respectively, as target cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver,Metabolism,Efficacy,Toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Albert  P.

The mEGFR inhibitors were found to retain their anticancer effects in NSCLC cells if given concurrently with AURK inhibitors. Dual-targeted small molecules designed to inhibit both mEGFR and AURK could demonstrate improved anticancer effects compared to monotargeted mEGFR inhibitors. We conducted molecular modeling studies to determine if there were similarities between the kinase pockets of mEGFR and AURK that could be exploited to develop dual-targeted mEGFR and AURK inhibitors. An overlap was observed for the active and allosteric sites of the kinase pocket for mEGFR and AURK. A series of compounds were synthesized and evaluated against mEGFR, AURKA, and AURKB. We found the kinase inhibitory profile to vary significantly depending on the substitution pattern ranging from selective mEGFR inhibitors to dual mEGFR and AURK inhibitors. The 4-substituted amino-<i>N<\/i>-phenylbenzamides were identified as dual mEGFR\/AURK inhibitors. Dual mEGFR\/AURK inhibitors demonstrated varied modes of binding within mEGFR and AURK.

Treatment efficacy against cancer is dependent on tumor metabolism and its adaptation for most therapies. Warburg effect is an important adaptation found in tumors where cells primarily catabolize glucose even in presence of sufficient oxygen and nutrients. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests cells in tumor microenvironments remain dependent on mitochondrial ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS also represents a major metabolic pathway in cancer stem cells and tumor cells of relapse patients. Molecular signatures of glycolysis and OXPHOS are both detected in tumors. This points to the OXPHOS pathway as a potential therapeutic target in cancer. Here we apply a data mining approach to identify OXPHOS inhibitors to evaluate as candidates for therapies against HGSOC. High-Throughput Screening (HTS) on mechanistic targets like OXPHOS are cost prohibitive for academic laboratories. As an alternative, we deployed a data mining pipeline to find active chemical classes among 8415 available OXPHOS-related bioassays in the PubChem data repository. Active compound clusters frequently contain &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl groups, which are also observed in both endogenous quinone electron carriers and atovaquone&#8211;a potent inhibitor of OXPHOS. Out of 312041 unique compounds tested in the assays, we selected 6 representative molecules from each of the 6 largest active chemical clusters to test for OXPHOS inhibition, ROS production, and reduced cancer cell proliferation. We assayed cell viability (MTT) to check for proliferation of human (OVCAR3, OVCAR5, OVISE) and mouse (ID8) ovarian cancer cells against 6 compounds, Oryzalin, Allylyestrenol, Esbiothrin, Lacidipine, Coumatetralyl, and CID929419 (MLS000713029), 72 h post treatment. ID8 and OVCAR5 significantly decreased cell proliferation after Lacidipine and Oryzalin treatment. Significant increase in intracellular ROS, a frequent consequence of OXPHOS inhibition, was observed in all cell lines after Lacidipine treatment. Elevated ROS was also observed in ID8 and OVISE cells after Esbiothrin treatment. To confirm OXPHOS inhibition as the mechanism of action, we performed Mito Stress Test on the Seahorse Analyzer and measured Oxygen Consumption Rate. Treatment with Oryzalin, Allylyestrenol, Esbiothrin, and Lacidipine significantly decreased basal respiration rate and ATP production in ID8 and OVCAR3 cells. This suggests that 4 of the 6 compound classes prioritized by the data mining pipeline inhibits OXPHOS in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, our pipeline provides an efficient alternative to HTS for identifying OXPHOS inhibitors. Next, we plan to test the <i>in-vivo<\/i> efficacy of these drugs against ovarian tumors in a mouse model and investigate their molecular mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-02 Chemoinformatics, in silico screening, and computational methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug-discovery screen,Anticancer therapy,Metabolism,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sejal  T.

There are numerous agonists and antagonistic treatment interventions available for therapy. However, all of them possess different detrimental consequences in addition to resistance and remission in sufferers. Medicinal plants have traditionally been employed to treat a wide range of ailments and problems.<br \/>Methodology: A total of 550 flavonoids and small molecules retrieved from literature and databases (Chembl, and PubChem) were analysed for molecular docking, biological activities, ADME, and drug-like properties through SwissADME and PreADMET, Molecular Simulation, and cytotoxicity studies. Simultaneously, review literature is employed to identify the novel protein targets viz. ROS1 (3ZBF) &#38; EGFR (6DUK). Additionally, the crystal structures of the proteins were obtained from PDB and their domains and active sites were predicted using ScanProsite, MOTIF Search, metaPOCKET2, and PrankWeb tools. Finally, the proteins and ligands were energy-minimized using Chimera and open babel tool and subjected to virtual screening and molecular docking using GOLD. Furthermore, the molecular simulation was performed at 100ns by utilizing GROMACS, and cytotoxicity studies were performed by employing the A549 Lung cancer cell line.<br \/>Results: Diosmin (64.57) and Hesperidin (60.98) had the greatest binding affinity with the identified targets, i.e., ROS1 (3ZBF) and EGFR(6DUK) respectively against Lung Cancer, and remained stable during 100ns of molecular simulation. Furthermore, we have performed cytotoxicity studies on A549 cell lines that show both the compounds have significant anticancer activity and do not affect healthy cells in the range of, i.e., Diosmin (500 &#181;g\/ml to 0.024 &#181;g\/ml.) and Hesperidin (500 &#181;g\/ml to 125 &#181;g\/ml).<br \/>Conclusion: After the analyses, we can conclude that it has the potential to be exploited as a novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of lung cancer.Keywords: Diosmin, Hesperidin, In-silico, A549, Lung Cancer, Simulation","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-02 Chemoinformatics, in silico screening, and computational methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Chemosensitization,ROS1,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Swati Arora<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sumit Sheoran<sup>1<\/sup>, Tanmayee Basu<sup>2<\/sup>, Naidu Subbarao<sup>3<\/sup>, Atul Kumar Upadhyay<sup>4<\/sup>, Sugunakar Vuree<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, India,<sup>2<\/sup>Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India,<sup>3<\/sup>Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, India,<sup>4<\/sup>Thapar institute of Engineering 7 technology, Patiala, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7c4e773c-09de-41d9-a449-f319ad300394","ControlNumber":"7071","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Despite the recent advances in melanoma therapy, the need for new targets and novel approaches to therapy is urgent. We previously reported novel melanoma leads, 2155-14 and 2155-18, that work via binding and downregulating spliceosomal proteins hnRNPH1 and H2. To determine the therapeutic potential of these compounds we tested them in A375 cell-line derived xenograft in nu\/nu mice. For determination of 2155-14 and 2155-18 potency in vivo, nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with A375 cell line and tumors were allowed to reach 100mm<sup>3<\/sup>. Animals were then randomized into four groups to receive subcutaneous administration of vehicle, 10mg\/kg vemurafenib, and 25mg\/kg 2155-14 and 2155-18 three times per week for 15 days. The result revealed that both 2155-14 and 2155-18 significantly decreased the growth of A375 tumors, which was comparable to vemurafenib. These results are well correlated with the exposure of leads in plasma. In summary, these results suggest a therapeutic potential of targeting spliceosomal proteins hnRNPH1 and H2 and support potential of 2155-14 and 2155-18 as drug candidates for treatment of melanoma.<br \/>Keywords: Melanoma, drug discovery, A375, xenograft.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-01 Basic and applied nanotechnology and therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Drug discovery,Xenografts,Spliceosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dmitriy Minond<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sadeeshkumar Velayutham<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nova Southeastern University, College of Pharmacy, Fort Lauderdale, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fc0f62a8-9dd3-4fd7-a884-3ed199f63ac3","ControlNumber":"822","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

TNBC is more common in younger patients and more likely to have a family history of breast cancer. TNBCs more likely have poor prognosis and postsurgical recurrence, with strong invasiveness and metastasis. However, there is lack of effective and TNBC-targeting drugs. The non-typical CDK16 was found highly expressed in TNBCs and clearly associated with prognosis and survival of patients. CDK16 could promote the progression and metastasis of TNBC by phosphorylating PRC1. Knockdown of CDK16 could significantly suppress tumor growth and metastasis.

Most commonly, the overexpression of HDACs is found in various cancer types including hematologic cancers, as well as solid malignancies. Of the many HDACs found in the body, class I HDACs, which consist of HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8, play an essential role in activating oncogenes underlying tumorigenesis, disease progression, and treatment resistance. Several HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been approved for cancer treatment, however, they are pan-inhibitors. This lack of specificity poses many disadvantages for HDACis, including toxicity and other off-target effects. Isozyme-selective inhibitors may reduce these off-target effects and thus enhance their safety. Though favorable, selectivity is difficult to achieve from conventional inhibitors due to the highly homologous catalytic domain among HDAC isozymes. In addition, several HDAC isozymes have deacetylase-independent scaffolding functions that cannot be blocked by traditional inhibitors. Recently, there have been advances in Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC), an emerging drug discovery technology designed to hijack cell&#8217;s existing protein degradation machinery, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to selectively degrade target proteins. Selective degradation by PROTAC is a potential solution to many of the concerns associated with current HDACis. Previously, we reported an HDAC3-selective PROTAC, XZ9002, and following that we reported the discovery of PROTAC YX968, which can degrade both HDAC3 and HDAC8 isozymes with single-digit nanomolar DC<sub>50<\/sub>, this highly potent dual degrader exhibits distinct effects on modulating gene expression and is much more potent in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation compared to XZ9002. Based on this, we are further modifying the PROTACs to be selective for HDAC8. The HDAC3, HDAC8 selective degrader and HDAC3 and HDAC8 dual degrader we developed could be useful chemical probes to dissect the complex biological function of HDAC3 and HDAC8 and potential therapeutics for treating cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Lead optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase,PROTAC,HDAC3,HDAC8,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yufeng Xiao<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Seth Hale<sup><\/sup>, Nikee Awasthee<sup><\/sup>, Xuan Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Yi Liu<sup><\/sup>, Zhiguang Huo<sup><\/sup>, Dongwen Lyu<sup><\/sup>, Lei Wang<sup><\/sup>, Weizhou Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Megan Mosteiro<sup><\/sup>, Daiqing Liao<sup><\/sup>, Guangrong Zheng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Florida, Gainesville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"07ff0b2f-eceb-4dcb-8ba0-782c44be0e00","ControlNumber":"4739","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

As previous studies report the superior therapeutic effects of BRAF\/MEK inhibitors over MEK inhibitor alone, phenotype characterization of the cells, as well as underlying mechanisms behind such response, worth further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,MEK inhibitor,BRAF,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sze Man Chan<sup><\/sup>, <b>Sin Ting Chow<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sai Fung Yeung<sup><\/sup>, Kwok Wing Stephen Tsui<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ed055538-2258-4c44-8f8d-2117e0e8db16","ControlNumber":"5607","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
