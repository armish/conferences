[{"Abstract":"Background: Metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is frequently manifested in the bone, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. We have previously demonstrated that &#947;&#948; Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) led to significant regression of established prostate cancer cells in the bone. Regression was further increased by combination with the bisphosphonate zoledronate (ZOL), routinely administered to mCRPC patients to prevent bone loss. To further optimize the use of &#947;&#948; CAR T cells for mCRPC, we aimed to determine the kinetics of &#947;&#948; CAR T cell in a mouse model of bone metastatic prostate cancer, either as single treatment or in combination with ZOL. In addition, we identified the sites of systemic ZOL accumulation in an immune competent model that could potentially induce off-target effects of &#947;&#948; CAR T cells.<br \/>Methods: Male NSG mice were injected with C4-2B prostate cancer cells expressing PSCA and luciferase in the left tibia, while the right tibia received PBS. ZOL (25 &#956;g\/kg) was injected every other day subcutaneously in half of the mice and was discontinued one day prior to administering T cells. When tumors were established, mice received &#947;&#948; PSCA-CAR T cells, &#947;&#948; untransduced (UT) T cells or were left untreated. Bone marrow from tumor-bearing tibia, tumor-naive tibia, femur, spleen and blood were recovered at multiple time points, and the number of &#947;&#948; T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. To determine systemic ZOL uptake, C57BL\/6 mice were injected with PTE-82 prostate cell line in both tibias. One week after injection, mice received ZOL-AF647 every other day for 2 weeks. Bone marrow, liver, kidney, peritoneal lavage, skin-draining lymph nodes, Peyer&#8217;s patches and spleen were recovered and analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: &#947;&#948; CAR T cells showed a rapid accumulation in the bone marrow recovered from tumor-bearing tibias, with 3 times more cells than those from mice treated with &#947;&#948; UT cells (p=0.0002). The number of &#947;&#948; T cells peaked at 5 days post infusion and were still detected after 21 days. Increased &#947;&#948; CAR T cell accumulation was not observed in tumor-free bones or in spleen or blood, suggesting a preferential localization of &#947;&#948; CAR T cells at tumor sites. Treatment with ZOL did not significantly affect the number or phenotype of &#947;&#948; T cells accumulated in bone. Analysis of ZOL distribution showed significant uptake by macrophages, specially from liver and peritoneal lavage (p&#60;0.0001), with an average of 30% and 70% of macrophages showing positive staining for ZOL-AF647, respectively (p&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: &#947;&#948; PSCA-CAR T cells accumulate and get activated at tumor sites with limited distribution outside the bone, while their kinetics is not affected by ZOL treatment in the NSG xenograft model. Additional studies will be necessary to determine the impact of ZOL uptake by myeloid cells on &#947;&#948; CAR T cells migration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Bone metastasis,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leticia Tordesillas<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Junior Cianne<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy  S.

We have previously shown that engineering therapeutic T cell products using CRISPR-based gene insertion of a dual shRNA cassette targeting Fas and PTPN2 significantly increased antitumor efficacy of Integrated Circuit T cells (ICTs) in ovarian cancer models. We sought to build on this finding to induce additional gene perturbations that improve the efficacy of ICTs. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b is an immunosuppressive cytokine that potently inhibits T cell responses and is present at high levels in numerous solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In order to render ICT cells less susceptible to TGF-b-mediated suppression, we developed a quadruple shRNA cassette that simultaneously targets Fas, PTPN2, and TGFBR. Candidate TGFBR-targeting shRNAs were selected for their ability to reduce surface TGFBR receptor expression and impair proximal (pSMAD) or distal (CD103, PD-1) signaling through TGFBR. While single shRNAs against TGFBR did not rescue ICT cell activity in the presence of TGF-b, likely due to partial knockdown of TGFBR signaling, a cassette encoding two shRNAs against TGFBR restored ICT function to similar levels observed in the absence of TGF-b. The quadruple shRNA cassettes targeting Fas\/PTPN2\/TGFBR significantly enhanced antitumor activity of ICT cells in multiple xenograft tumor models relative to Fas\/PTPN2 cassettes. These results demonstrate the utility of multiplexed shRNA strategies to render therapeutic T cells resistant to orthogonal suppressive pathways in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"shRNA,CAR T cells,TGF-&#946;,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thomas J.

As of today, the clinical trial situation aims on CAR-T applicability in solid tumors, which is more arduous due to antigen heterogeneity and limited CAR-T persistence. More personalized and multi-target oriented cellular products may offer a solution to overcome these problems but then CAR identification and selection display the major bottleneck in the drug development process. Usually, matching scFvs are selected from targeting screens of a phage-display library and hits are subsequently cloned in CAR backbones and tested for functionality and possible limiting factors as the occurrence of tonic signaling. This makes the whole process very time consuming and laborious. Within this project, we propose a novel CAR-T selection method that rapidly shortens the discovery procedure. We have developed a full length CAR library in nS\/MARt DNA vectors that is electroporated in a Jurkat reporter cell line reflecting entirely its full diversity. By this, we can quickly identify the amount of tonic signaling CARs and exclude them from further selection. For on-target selection we first perform a bulk pre-selection followed by a single cell functionality screening using the Berkeley Lights Lightning&#8482; device. This allows us to export hits as clonal viable cells that undergo long length Nanopore CAR-RNA sequencing. Our findings show the feasibility of our approach and that it can shorten the timeframe needed for the full selection process from weeks to days.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eren Boga<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Luisa Berger<sup>2<\/sup>, Alice De Roia<sup>2<\/sup>, Inka Zörnig<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Embacher<sup>3<\/sup>, Stefan B.

These modules contain well characterized tyrosine-containing moieties (YMNM and PYAP) that become phosphorylated upon CAR activation, and result in IL-2 secretion and T cell expansion. Previous work by our group has shown that an additional tyrosine residue, located in the C-terminus of CD28 (Y218), was also phosphorylated upon CAR activation. The kinase responsible for this phosphorylation remains unknown, but <i>in silico<\/i> studies point towards the IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), the protein-tyrosine kinase TEC and the bone marrow tyrosine kinase (BMX). In this work we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism and functional relevance of CD28-Y218 phosphorylation in CAR-T cells.To analyze the kinetics of Y218 phosphorylation, prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)-specific second-generation CAR-T cells were stimulated through co-culture with HPAC pancreatic cancer cells for 0, 1, 10, 30 and 60 minutes. Phosphorylation of CD28 Y218, Zap70, PLC&#947; and Vav1 was analyzed by Western blotting. To determine the role of ITK in CD28-218 phosphorylation: 1) PSCA-specific CAR-T cells were treated with ITK inhibitors 10 &#956;M (BMS-509744 or Ibrutinib) for 24h and 2) ITK-deficient Jurkat cells expressing a PSCA-specific CAR were cocultured with HPAC cells for 0 or 10 min. To determine the functional relevance of this phosphorylation event, we generated mutant CARs where the tyrosine residue was replaced with a non-phosphorylatable amino acid (Y218F) and evaluated its effects <i>in vivo <\/i>and <i>in vitro<\/i>. CAR-T cell cytotoxicity was monitored using the xCELLigence Real Time Cytotoxicity Assay (RTCA) and cytokine production was assessed following overnight co-culture with target cells using the ELLA system (Biotechne, CA, USA). To evaluate the <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor efficacy of PSCA-specific CAR-T cells, NSG mice were injected (s.c.) with 1 HPAC cells and infused 14 days later with 5 CAR-T cells (i.v.). Tumor growth was monitored for 35 days.Our results show that phosphorylation of CD28-Y218 occurs after the phosphorylation of early TCR signaling mediators, reaching maximum levels around 10-30 min post-stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition and genomic ablation of ITK impairs CD28-Y218 phosphorylation, suggesting an essential role of ITK in this signaling event. We observed that mutation of the Y218 residue did not affect CAR expression, <i>in vitro <\/i>cytotoxicity<i>, <\/i>or<i> <\/i>INF&#947; production. However, this mutation was<br \/>associated with reduced IL-2 and TNF&#945; secretion. <i>In vivo<\/i>, this mutation completely abrogated the therapeutic effect of CAR-T cells in a pancreatic cancer model. In conclusion, these results indicate that ITK is required for CD28-Y218 phosphorylation, a signaling event that plays an important role in CAR-T cell function, with direct impact on IL-2 secretion and antitumor efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Pancreatic cancer,Phosphorylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elena Martinez-Planes<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Miguel G.

It is also associated with aggressive progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Public database, a Kaplan-Meier plotter (http:\/\/www.kmplot.com) shows that L1CAM high-expression significantly reduced survival of ovarian and gastric cancer patients. We developed a novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell targeted to L1CAM. A novel scFV candidate (Clone H8) to L1CAM was obtained by bio-panning of phage displaying human synthetic scFv fragments to human and mouse L1CAM proteins. H8 scFV was linked to IgD-IgG1 hinge, CD28 transmembrane domain, CD28 and ICOS co-stimulation domain, and CD3&#950; domain, resulting in CX804 CAR-T. The efficacy of L1CAM CAR-T cells, CX804 showed correlation with the level of L1CAM in human ovarian and gastric cancer cells. CX804 exerted cytotoxicity toward 293T cells expressing human or mouse L1CAM protein. CX804 also reacted with L1CAM-positive ovarian SKOV3 cancer cell and gastric MKN-28 and AGS cancer cells and secreted T-cell activation cytokines, IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945;, in response to these cells. However, CX804 rarely lysed L1CAM-negative normal 293 cells and SNU-719 gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, L1CAM CAR-T cells dramatically lysed high L1CAM expressing patient derived cell (PDC) of gastric cancer compared with low L1CAM expressing PDC cell. Xenograft model of ovarian cancer was developed by intraperitoneal (IP) injecting SKOV3-Fluc cells into NOD\/SCID or NSG mice. CAR-T cells were administrated via intravenous (IV) or IP route on 5 days after tumor inoculation.

As our data with a syngeneic mouse model of CAR therapy showed significant hypoxia in the brain tumor microenvironment, we sought to develop a novel strategy to improve the metabolic state of the CAR-T cells in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. In mice bearing intracerebral SB28-EGFRvIII gliomas receiving an intravenous infusion of EGFR vIII-targeting CAR-T cells, we found mitochondrial ATP production in tumor-infiltrating CAR-T cells was significantly impaired compared to those migrating to the spleen. Therefore, we hypothesized that treating CAR-T cells with metabolic regulators that activate mitochondria before infusion would improve the therapeutic effect of CAR-T cells. Using a hypoxic incubator to mimic the tumor microenvironment of brain tumors, we screened drugs that would improve the metabolic state of CAR-T cells and maintain their anti-tumor effect. Although the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator metformin are ineffective when treated as single drugs, a combination of these drugs (met+rap) prolonged the anti-glioma effect of CAR-T cells under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, Seahorse assays revealed a higher mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity of met+rap-treated CAR-T cells compared to single drug-treated CAR-T cells or those without pre-treatment. A single intravenous infusion of CAR-T cells pre-treated with met+rap significantly prolonged the survival of mice bearing intracerebral SB28-EGRFvIII tumors compared with CAR-T cells without the pre-treatment. In mass cytometric analyses, a significantly higher number of glioma-infiltrating CAR-T cells were found in mice that received met+rap-treated CAR-T cells compared with mice that received control CAR-T cells. Interestingly, the glioma tissues infiltrated by met+rap pre-treated CAR-T cells were infiltrated by significantly fewer Ly6c+ CD11b+ monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells. As a major translational significance, because the CAR-T cells were pre-treated with the drugs during the in vitro expansion with no need for in vivo drug administrations, our strategy would circumvent any toxicity associated with in vivo treatments with the same medications.<br \/>These data warrant a translational and clinical evaluation of met+rap pre-treated CAR-T cells in human settings and the development of a CAR-T cell trial using this approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,CAR T cells,Metabolism,Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryusuke Hatae<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Keith Kyewalabye<sup><\/sup>, Akane Yamamichi<sup><\/sup>, Tiffany Chen<sup><\/sup>, Su Phyu<sup><\/sup>, Pavlina Chuntova<sup><\/sup>, Hideho Okada<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Neurological Surgery, UCSF - University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2e41c5aa-a920-443e-854f-23b31260e265","ControlNumber":"3068","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

These platelets were originally intended for use in patient transfusion. The safety of platelets used in transfusion is managed by the U.S. Food &#38; Drug Administration (FDA), as well as the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). These organizations set standards, including testing for transmissible diseases. The United States record for blood safety is well established, with extremely low rates of disease transmission, making the platelet units used for hPL manufacture low risk. The Covid-19 pandemic has increased awareness of emerging infectious diseases, even though transmission of Covid-19 via blood transfusion has not been documented. For that reason, gamma irradiated hPL offers an additional safety measure in the clinic. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) expressing T-cells have demonstrated potent clinical efficacy in patients with hematological malignancies. In addition, there are several phase I clinical trials evaluating the use of CAR-T-cells for targeting of solid tumor-associated antigens. Some of the challenging issues found during production of CAR-T cells are the efficiency of T cell transduction to generate CAR-T cells, the expansion of T cells to clinically relevant numbers and the long-term survival <i>in vivo<\/i> of the therapeutic cells. The use of human platelet lysate has been demonstrated to improve these issues. Our data from experiments performed using human CD3+ from donors demonstrates that human platelet lysates offer an improved performance on T cell expansion versus serum derived products. hPL efficiently promotes T cell expansion, with higher cell yields and lower cell exhaustion rate. Additionally, we efficiently developed a protocol for suspension culture of T cells, which could facilitate the large-scale expansion of allogeneic CAR-T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Mesenchymal stem cell,Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vanesa Alonso-Camino<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>R&D, Mill Creek Life Sciences, Rochester, MN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1cd87e2b-13cd-4fa9-b0c4-2bb8602d9f15","ControlNumber":"4814","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;V.

However, the elimination of all cells expressing target antigen including healthy tissues by CAR-T cells is a significant safety concern. Such on-target off-tumor toxicities are problematic for many types of cancer antigens and in some cases have resulted in patient deaths. There is a need to address these limitations and develop better and safer next generation CAR-T therapies as we move beyond these tumor types.<br \/>&#947;&#948; T cells can directly identify and kill malignant cells through the recognition of tumor and\/or stress antigens that are not generally expressed on normal healthy tissues. We hypothesized that we could demonstrate the potential of our non-signaling &#947;&#948; CAR platform to kill tumors, while protect healthy cells against a validated target such as CD19. We developed a non-signaling CD19 CAR (ns19CAR) for &#947;&#948; T cells by removing the CD3z signaling domain. In addition, IL-15 was co-expressed to enhance &#947;&#948; T cell fitness and persistence.<br \/>We first demonstrated CAR expression in Jurkat T cells with either a signaling CD19 CAR (s19CAR) or ns19CAR lentiviral vectors. As expected, after co-cultured with CD19+ Raji cells, s19CAR-Jurkat cells demonstrated activation by strong CD69 expression, while ns19CAR-Jurkat cells showed no activation. We next tested transduction of the ns19CAR in expanded V&#948;2+ &#947;&#948; T cells. In experiments with &#947;&#948; T cells from different donors (N=4), a high percentage (66-86%) of &#947;&#948; T cells were ns19CAR positive as measured by flow cytometry. ns19CAR &#947;&#948; T cells were shown to effectively kill CD19+ Nalm6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells at low effector-to-target ratios (E:T=1:1 to 4:1) in 16hr and 48hr co-culture assays and demonstrated enhanced (&#62;1.5x) cytotoxicity compared to non-transduced control &#947;&#948; T cells (NTC). After 48hr co-culture (E:T=2:1), the ns19CAR-&#947;&#948; T cells killed 79.7% Nalm6 cells (SD=6.6%) compared to NTC&#8217;s cytotoxicity of 46.1% (SD=7.2%). In comparison, minimal cytotoxicity was observed for ns19CAR and NTC &#947;&#948; T cells against B cells from healthy donor PBMC. At E:T=2:1, an average cytotoxicity of 5.2% (SD=6.6%) were observed with ns19CAR-&#947;&#948; T cells compared to -4.6% (SD=7.7%) with NTC. There is no significant difference in cytotoxicity against CD19- K562 cells between the NTC or ns19CAR &#947;&#948; T cells suggesting the enhanced cytotoxicity of ns19CAR-&#947;&#948; T cells is specific to CD19+ target cells. Our results demonstrate that our nsCAR-&#947;&#948; T cell platform may be able to target malignant cells while preserving healthy tissues where the antigen target may be widely expressed such as hematopoietic stem cells and solid tumor cancers.<br \/>Our unique combination of non-signaling CAR and &#947;&#948; T cells is a promising candidate for next generation CAR-T therapies and provides insights towards the development of future CAR therapies against other types of hematological and solid tumor cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gamma-delta lymphocytes,CAR T cells,CD19,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lei Ding<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yanjie Li<sup><\/sup>, Mariska ter Haak<sup><\/sup>, Lawrence Lamb<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>IN8Bio, Inc., New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c63bf1db-6e7f-43cf-a896-3e1ac4611fae","ControlNumber":"1696","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

However, early-phase clinical studies have shown limited activity despite potent antitumor activity in preclinical xenograft models, highlighting the need to develop better preclinical models. B7-H3 has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic target for pediatric solid tumors including OS, and we and other investigators are actively exploring B7-H3-CAR T cell therapies in early-phase clinical studies. Our goal was to develop a murine immunocompetent OS model (F331) for the realistic pre-clinical evaluation of B7-H3-CAR T cells and to explore additional genetic modifications to improve their effector function. We generated murine B7-H3-CAR T cells expressing a 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation B7-H3-CD28.&#950; CAR by retroviral transduction. In vitro, B7-H3-CAR T cells recognized B7-H3-positive F331 cells as judged by IFN&#947; production and cytolytic activity in contrast to B7-H3-negative tumor cells; Control (ctrl) CAR T-cells recognizing an irrelevant antigen (SP6) did not recognize or kill B7-H3-positive tumor cells confirming specificity. Since lung is the primary OS metastasis site, we focused on the intravenous (i.v.) disseminated lung F331 OS metastasis model. In this model, a single i.v. infusion of 5x10<sup>6<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> B7-H3-CAR T cells demonstrated significant antitumor activity compared to CD8<sup>+<\/sup> ctrl CAR T cells, resulting in a significant survival advantage (median: 70 vs 38 days respectively). Unfortunately, tumors invariably recurred. We found limited B7-H3-CAR T cell expansion and persistence, even though recurring tumors still expressed B7-H3, excluding tumor antigen escape mechanism. We therefore embarked on a comprehensive screen to knock out (KO) known negative regulators of T-cell function, starting with Regnase-1 (Reg-1). Reg-1 is known to have RNase activity and to regulate activation of immune cells. KO of Reg-1 in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> B7-H3-CAR T cells improved their expansion post-infusion in spleen and lungs as judged by flow cytometric analysis without systemic toxicities based on mice body weight assessment. This resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival in comparison to control KO B7-H3-CAR T cells at a cell dose (1x10<sup>6<\/sup>) at which ctrl-KO CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>B7-H3-CAR T cells were ineffective.

The second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration for hematological malignancies, exhibiting impressive efficacy. However, CAR T cell therapy has not been approved in solid tumors and it has intensively been the subjects of research and development. To develop CAR T cell therapy, it is crucial to identify target antigen specifically expressed on tumor cells. Mucin 1 (MUC1) was previously reported to be overexpressed in several tumors. In this study, we examined MUC1 expression in BC tissues and cultured cell lines, and to improve CAR T cell efficiency, we generated fourth-generation anti-MUC1 CAR T cells (&#945;M.CAR4 T cells), containing anti-MUC1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv), three costimulatory molecules (CD28, CD137, CD27) and CD3&#950;. High levels of MUC1 expression were observed in the tissues and cell lines. Comparing to second- and third-generations (&#945;M.CAR2 T and &#945;M.CAR3 T cells), the &#945;M.CAR4 T cells showed greater proliferation in the CAR T cell production process. The anti-tumor functions of all CAR T cells were specific to MUC1 expression since their killing activities were illustrated against MUC1-positive but not MUC1-negative BC cells. Interestingly, at low effector to target ratios, the &#945;M.CAR4 T cells exhibited higher tumor cell lysis than those of &#945;M.CAR2 T and &#945;M.CAR3 T cells. Furthermore, after exposure to MUC1-positive BC cells, the &#945;M.CAR4 T cells expressed lower programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) level. Taken together, the &#945;M.CAR4 T cells are potential to be further developed for treatments of MUC1-positive BC and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,MUC1,Breast cancer,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kamonlapat Supimon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Thanich Sangsuwannukul<sup><\/sup>, Mutita Junking<sup><\/sup>, Pa-thai Yenchitsomanus<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Division of Molecular Medicine, Research Department, Siriraj Center of Research Excellence for Cancer Immunotherapy (SiCORE&#8209;CIT), Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"568be4d5-1cbb-4873-987f-4e489d87ff24","ControlNumber":"3424","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

While hematological tumors have benefited most from cell therapy approaches, the treatment of solid tumors remains a challenge in part due to the limited availability of abundant and tumor-specific cell-surface antigens. Peptides derived from intracellular tumor-specific proteins, such as cancer-testis antigens (CTAs), that are presented via HLA (pHLA) enable a therapeutic opportunity to target tumors while sparing normal tissue. Surface-accessible pHLA complexes may be targeted with engineered T cell receptors or TCR mimetic antibodies reformatted to chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Using MAGE-A4 as a model CTA, we compared engineered human TCR- and CAR-T cells head-to-head to understand how to best deploy these modalities. To this end, we generated fully-human, HLA-A2\/MAGE-A4<sub>(230-239)<\/sub>-specific<sub> <\/sub>TCR and CARs harboring CD28\/CD3z or 41BB\/CD3z signaling domains. TCR and CAR-T cells demonstrated similar robust on-target reactivity, cytokine release, and target cell lysis in vitro. In vivo, each of these modalities showed potent, dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy against human xenograft tumors expressing low, endogenous levels (~500 cell-surface copies) of the MAGE-A4 peptide. However, differences emerged when we examined the in vivo kinetics and durability of tumor suppression. MAGE-A4 CD28\/z CAR-T demonstrated the most rapid and potent tumor clearance, while the 41BB\/z CAR-T showed delayed but ultimately complete efficacy. TCR-T cells induced tumor regressions during the first 2 weeks of treatment, but this response was transient and followed by tumor relapse. These differential responses correlated with early, modest accumulation of CD28\/z CAR-T in line with fast tumor clearance. 41BB\/z CAR-T showed a remarkable ~800-fold expansion in the tumor<i> <\/i>versus limited in vivo TCR-T proliferation. Mechanistically, the MAGE-A4 TCR induced strong CD3 proximal signaling associated with a greater induction of T cell dysfunction markers and limited cytotoxic potential in vitro. However, stimulating 41BB signaling pathways in the MAGE-A4 TCR T cells augmented long-term cytotoxicity. These data demonstrate that tumor-specific pHLA complexes can be potently targeted by both TCR and CAR-T cells, and that co-stimulatory signaling is necessary to mediate durable anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Chimeric antigen receptor,T cell,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Corinne  E.

ACT involves isolating immunocompetent cells from cancer patients, expanding them ex vivo, and infusing them back into the patient. Cells used for ACT are often effector cells, typically T cells, isolated from the patient&#8217;s peripheral blood and then engineered to target cancer cells by incorporating a T cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), with additional modifications to improve immune cell proliferation and persistence. While cell therapies for various lymphomas have led to dramatic tumor regressions, response in solid tumors remains varied. Solid tumors present unique challenges, such as tumor heterogeneity and the lack of tumor-specific targets, but also an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by poor T cell infiltration and terminal T cell differentiation and exhaustion at the tumor. To overcome the hostile TME, lymphodepleting regimens combined with an infusion of large numbers of T cells is often used. However, introducing large numbers of T cells significantly increases the risk of on-target\/off-target toxicity, neurotoxicity, and cytokine release syndrome. The use of engineered T cells that transiently express TCRs or CARs by mRNA gene transfer, reduces these risks. Additionally, they avoid the use of viral vectors, hence there is no risk of insertional mutagenesis and can be manufactured more easily at low cost and on a larger scale. Such transient-engineered T cells have shown significant antitumor activity in phase I clinical trials and in preclinical animal models. However, multiple infusions are often required, increasing patient discomfort and treatment cost. To mitigate this, we sought to improve the antitumor activity of transient engineered T cells by screening a panel of small molecules targeting epigenetic regulators for their effect on T cell cytotoxicity. Using a model for engineered T cells targeting hepatocellular carcinoma, we found that short-term inhibition of G9a\/GLP increased T cell antitumor activity in <i>in vitro<\/i> models and an orthotopic mouse model. G9a\/GLP inhibition increased granzyme expression without terminal T cell differentiation or exhaustion and resulted in specific changes in the expression of genes and proteins involved in pro-inflammatory pathways, T cell activation, and cytotoxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,CAR T cells,Epigenetics,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Maxine  S.

However, attempts to model the behavior and effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapies for blood cancers and solid tumors have been challenging due to the unique tumor microenvironments in which these cancer cells are found. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is often characterized by hypoxia, increased acidity, and high interstitial fluid pressures, allowing cancer cells to effectively evade immune surveillance. This immunosuppressive TME also contributes to CAR-T cell exhaustion, thereby limiting its antitumor activity and function. To address these concerns, we have developed a proprietary cell-based assay to measure CAR-T cell potency and cytotoxic function in three-dimensional (3D) <i>in vitro <\/i>cell culture system, human acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia mouse model, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Utilizing the AVATAR system, we replicated the oxygen and interstitial fluid pressures found in the vasculature, the bone marrow and solid tumor microenvironments. Tumor cytolysis assays were conducted in these environments to measure cell exhaustion as analyzed by flow cytometry and electrical impedance. In addition, serial tumor challenge assays were performed to examine CAR-T potency and effectiveness in TME. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed using ROR1 CAR-T cells targeting the ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line, SKOV3. CD19 CAR-T were also used targeting the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, NALM6. Defined ratios of effector T cells to tumor cells was assessed to model CAR-T potency <i>in vitro<\/i> and elevated CD19 CAR-T mediated cytotoxicity was confirmed with the increased ratio of effector T cells to tumor cells in both 2D and 3D culture system. CD19 CAR-T cells also exhibited <i>in vivo<\/i> dose dependent efficacy against the systemic NALM6-Luc acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mouse model, quantified by bioluminescence (BLI) image monitoring method. Multiple pressure and oxygen settings were examined to model the cross-section of the bone marrow and solid tumor microenvironments (0 PSI to 5 PSI, 1% to 10% O2). Initial results from these screening experiments show significant decline in ROR1 CAR-T mediated cytotoxicity when performed under TME conditions. However, CD19 CAR-T showed effective cell killing under TME conditions. Interestingly, acclimating and expanding ROR1 CAR-T cells to high pressure and decreased oxygen culture conditions improved potency levels and warrants further investigation. In summary, we observe CAR-T cells comprise the tumor cell killing ability in both <i>in vitro<\/i> 3D and <i>in vivo<\/i> animal models. We also describe a physiologically relevant potency assay that incorporates hyperbaric and hypoxic incubation technology to predict the behavior of cell therapies in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Tumor microenvironment,Adoptive cell therapy,Tumor hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yelena Bronevetsky<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Evan Massi<sup>1<\/sup>, Candy Garcia<sup>1<\/sup>, Ningchun Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yewei Xing<sup>2<\/sup>, Natalie Czeryba<sup>2<\/sup>, Scott Wise<sup>2<\/sup>, James Lim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Xcellbio, San Francisco, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Labcorp Drug Development, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"838842a6-df1a-4e57-9398-64029da0e9f7","ControlNumber":"2971","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Advances in genome engineering and synthetic biology have provided an increasingly complex set of features that can be introduced into CAR-T cells to augment their function. However, combining multiple features may result in unpredictable negative interactions between components. Here, we report the use of high-throughput screening to optimize the design of a highly-engineered Integrated Circuit T Cell (ICT) product for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). ICT cells are CAR-T cells that contain an AND logic gate requiring two antigens to be present to trigger tumor cell killing together with multiple enhancement modules.<br \/>\u0009First, to create the logic gate we generated hundreds of novel scFv and VH\/VHH binders targeting PSMA (as a priming target) and CA9 (as a cytolytic target) via two parallel de novo binder discovery efforts: 1) transgenic mice immunizations and 2) internally-developed phage display panning campaigns. Two independent arrayed screens with 500 PSMA prime receptors (PrimeRTM) and 750 CA9 CARs were conducted to find PrimeRs with high inducibility and CARs with strong on-target potency.<br \/>From these screens, the top 25 PSMA PrimeRs and 20 CA9 CARs were combined with an shRNA cassette for targeted knockdowns along with two variations of a persistence module. We used a fully-automated workcell to perform end-to-end arrayed screening of the resulting 1,000 member library in T cells engineered from four human donors. Non-viral editing techniques were used to electroporate primary CD4\/CD8 cells and robotic handlers were used to set up co-cultures. Circuit specificity and potency were assessed by flow and cytokine secretion and resistance to exhaustion was assessed in a seven day killing assay. Although the library was built from components that functioned well independently, we found that when combined, many of the circuits displayed suboptimal function.

RMS tumors express high levels of the cell surface receptors FGFR4 and CD276, and both are direct targets of the PAX3-FOXO1 chimeric oncogene. However, CAR T have shown poor performance in solid tumors due to T cell exhaustion, limited persistence, and heterogeneous expression of target antigens. We hypothesize that engineering CAR constructs targeting FGFR4 and CD276 will enhance their activity and dual targeting will overcome the heterogenous target expression to effectively eliminate RMS tumors.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We modified and tested different hinge and transmembrane domains (HTM) or intracellular domain (ICD) of FGFR4 CAR constructs and developed multiple dual targeting Bicistronic CARs (BiCisCARs) against FGFR4 and CD276. We tested these CARs in aggressive mouse models and performed Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) of tumor infiltrating CAR T cells to functionally characterize these constructs.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> FGFR4 targeting CAR construct with CD8HTM and 4-1BB ICD could eliminate low burden RMS but was less effective against orthotopic tumors. Replacing CD8HTM with CD28HTM improved the efficacy in a moderate burden RMS model but did not show any benefit against a more aggressive RMS559 orthotopic model. Further modification using the CD28 ICD significantly enhanced the activity in a large burden RMS model but was unable to eradicate all tumors. Similarly, CAR T cells targeting CD276 alone, showed significant anti-tumor activity in moderate burden RMS models but could not eliminate all tumors. The BiCisCAR with FGFR4.CD28HTM.CD28ICD and CD276.CD8HTM.4-1BBICD was the most potent construct, eradicating 100% tumors in all tested orthotopic models, and those with heterogenous expression of target antigens. CITE-seq and flow cytometry assays demonstrated that this BiCisCAR showed the most significant tumor infiltration, and persistence, with limited exhaustion. This BiCisCAR exhibited a synergistic effect on cytokine production and anti-tumor activity, compared to single targeting CARs. Moreover, biochemical characterization revealed that the combined use of both CD28 and 4-1BB ICDs in the BiCisCAR resulted in the activation of three TCR downstream signaling pathways including AKT, Erk1\/2 and p65.<br \/><b>Conclusions and Future Directions<\/b>Thus, we have developed a potent BiCisCAR with dual targeting of FGFR4 and CD276 that shows optimal biochemical activity, persistence, and limited exhaustion, and addresses heterogenous expression of target antigens. This BiCisCAR will be further developed for future clinical trials in patients with high-risk RMS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meijie Tian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jun  S.

As such, there is a need for allogeneic, &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; CAR T cells to make these transformative treatments widely available. However, allogeneic therapies require multiple genetic engineering steps to express CAR and to delete proteins responsible for graft-versus-host disease. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a promising approach for expression of therapeutic proteins and gene editing nucleases. In this work, we demonstrate a new method for multi-step engineering of gene-edited CAR T cells using RNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).<br \/>LNPs encapsulating Spy-Cas9 mRNA, TCR and CD52 guide RNA (sgRNA), and CAR mRNA were produced using microfluidics. The CAR construct contained an anti-CD19 scFv binding domain and CD3&#950;\/4-1BB co-stimulatory domains. Microgram quantities of RNA LNPs were produced to optimize LNP packaging, cargo ratios, and sgRNA combinations. Lead candidates were scaled to milligrams. Purified human primary T cells were cultured, activated, and expanded in serum-free media in plates, flasks and bioreactors. CAR+, TCR&#8722; or CD52&#8722; cells were generated by addition of the corresponding LNP to activated cells. Cytotoxic killing was determined by co-culture assays with leukemia cells. Gene knockout, CAR expression, viability and cell killing were measured using flow-cytometry.<br \/>CD19 CAR was selected as a relevant protein for expression, with TCR and CD52 proteins as gene knockout targets. Single-step addition of CAR LNPs to T cells resulted in transfection efficiencies of 95.0 &#177; 2.1% and high protein expression. Upon TCR or CD52 LNP addition to T cells, the onset of gene editing was within 48 hours, reaching single target knockout efficiencies of 92.3 &#177; 3.0% (TCR&#8722;), and double knockouts (TCR&#8722;\/CD52&#8722;) of 74.5 &#177; 6.1%. Similar results were obtained when comparing different LNP batch sizes (microgram to milligram RNA) and cell culture vessels (125,000 to 45 million cells), demonstrating scalability of both the LNP production and cell treatment. Cell viabilities above 90% were maintained at all steps and for all RNA LNPs. Finally, as proof-of-concept for multi-step engineering, sequential addition of TCR LNPs and CAR LNPs resulted in simultaneous CAR expression and TCR gene knockout. These &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; gene-edited CAR T cells were functionally equivalent to non-edited cells in a B cell killing assay, efficiently clearing over 80% of leukemia target cells at a 1:1 ratio.<br \/>Our findings demonstrate the advantages of LNPs for RNA delivery to T cells. The simple and gentle nature of LNP cell treatment allows for multiple genetic engineering steps for simultaneous expression and deletion of proteins. Furthermore, LNPs can be easily manufactured using microfluidics, enabling small-scale screening of RNA libraries and rapid scale-up of lead candidates for clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Gene Editing,RNA,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samuel Clarke<\/b><sup><\/sup>,  R.

Owing to the low molecular weight, increased stability, and low immunogenicity of nanobodies, nanobody-based CAR T cells are an attractive alternative to antibody-based CAR T cells for improving <i>in vivo<\/i> persistence and overcoming loss of antigen in solid tumors. However, no such agent has been described that can target mesothelin, a tumor antigen that is highly expressed in mesotheliomas, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung carcinomas. Here, a novel nanobody-based CAR T cell that targets both mouse and human mesothelin was created and evaluated in a pre-clinical model of lung adenocarcinoma that encompasses a fully functional murine immune system. To obtain the nanobody, a selection of camel-derived nanobodies were screened for human mesothelin binding using phage panning. Binding of the lead candidate to mouse mesothelin was confirmed using flow cytometry. The antigen binding variable region of the nanobody was incorporated into a second-generation CAR backbone and the sequence was optimized for expression in the mouse host. To generate the nanobody-based CAR T cells, CD3 T cells were isolated from the spleens of na&#239;ve mice and transduced using a lentiviral vector. Following expansion, the functionality of the CAR T cells was assessed in cytotoxicity assays and by monitoring the subcutaneous tumor growth rate of the mouse-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell line 344SQ (mouse mesothelin positive) in <i>129S2\/SvPasCrl<\/i> syngeneic female mice. Murine CAR T cells demonstrated antigen specificity by selectively targeting tumor cells expressing mesothelin in co-culture assays. When mice were treated with a single dose of 10 million CAR T cells, there was a threefold reduction in tumor size one-week post-treatment (n = 6) with complete responses observed approximately two weeks post-treatment in 83% of the treated mice (n = 5\/6). Complete responses were maintained for at least two months after treatment in those mice. Collectively, this demonstrates that the nanobody-based CAR T cells can effectively target established subcutaneous tumors even after a single dose and without the need to manipulate the immune system of the host to enhance persistence. This study constitutes a first attempt to establish an immunocompetent pre-clinical model for the study of mesothelin-targeting, nanobody-based CAR T cells in unprimed hosts. This model will facilitate the study of the dynamic changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment following nanobody-based CAR T cell therapy while also providing valuable insight into the tumor resistance mechanisms and methods to overcome them.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Mesothelin,Tumor microenvironment,Nanobody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chaido Stathopoulou<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jessica Hong<sup><\/sup>, Mitchell Ho<sup><\/sup>, Raffit Hassan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"12e8394a-6262-4cf1-84fa-8d3ec427a37a","ControlNumber":"3619","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

For establishment of a productive immunologic synapse between the CAR T cell and cancer cell, multiple CARs on the T cell surface must engage multiple tumor antigens on the cancer cell surface. Whereas these binding interactions are mediated in classical CAR T cells by direct recognition of the tumor antigen by the scFv on the CAR, in the case of universal CAR T cells this recognition must be created by a bispecific adapter that can bridge between the tumor antigen and the CAR. While a diversity of bispecific adapters have been explored in the literature, the bispecific adapter used here is comprised of a low molecular weight ligand that binds avidly to the desired tumor antigen, the yellow dye fluorescein (FL) that binds tightly to an anti-fluorescein scFv on the CAR, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer that spans between the two. The length of this PEG spacer appears to be critical to ensure that 1) the bispecific adapter is long enough to mediate engagement of the universal CAR T cell with the cancer cell, and 2) the resulting intercellular distance is optimal for activating the necessary co-receptor interactions.In our study, we have utilized protein structure data and molecular modeling to estimate the optimal adapter spacer lengths for bridging between our CAR T cell and two important target cells, namely PSMA positive prostate cancer cells and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressing cancer associated fibroblasts. We then synthesized the desired bispecific adapters with a variety lengths of PEG spacer and evaluated their effects in mediating the cytotoxicity of our universal anti-FL CAR T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal that the optimal spacer lengths in the bispecific adapters for targeting PSMA (DUPA-FL) and FAP (FAPL-FL) are different and depend on the locations of the adapter binding pockets on their respective protein targets, as predicted by molecular modeling. Specifically, a shorter PEG spacer is required for maximal cytoxicity when employing the PSMA-targeted adapter, whereas a much longer PEG spacer is needed to achieve maximal cell killing with the FAP-targeted adapter. In addition, spacer length can also be adjusted to avoid overactivation-induced T cell exhaustion. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that instead of optimizing the hinge length of a CAR for each antigen epitope, our bispecific adapter\/universal CAR platform provides a highly flexible strategy for optimizing the intermembrane distance between the universal CAR T cell and cancer cell to achieve maximal target cell killing with minimal CAR T cell exhaustion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Tumor antigen,bispecific adapter,intermembrane distance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Suilan Zheng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bo Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yashapal Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Haiyan Chu<sup>2<\/sup>, Suresh  K.

Further, we evaluated the efficacy of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-targeting third-generation CD30-encompassing CAR constructs for targeting solid tumors. The CD30-signaling CAR-T cells exhibited similar levels of cell proliferation, cytolytic efficacies, and cytokine secretion <i>in vitro<\/i>, and demonstrated improved tumor regression and prolonged survival<i> in vivo<\/i> with increased persistence of the CAR-T cells as those of other CARs with CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domain, which are currently in clinical use. Also, third-generation CARs including the CD30 costimulatory domain retained potent antitumor efficacies <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> independent of their position or type of partner costimulatory domain. More significantly, EpCAM-targeting CAR-T cells containing CD30-signaling domain revealed effective cytolytic activities correlating with EpCAM expression levels in the target cells. Our results demonstrate that the CD30-derived costimulatory domain could be an alternative for developing CAR-engineered therapeutics which may be applicable for various designs of CAR constructs, with an emphasis on effectiveness against solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,CAR T cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyun-Il Cho<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chung-Hyo Kang<sup><\/sup>, Sang-Eun Lee<sup><\/sup>, Mi-So Kim<sup><\/sup>, Bo-Ra Lim<sup><\/sup>, Jung-Min Ha<sup><\/sup>, Hyun-Jung Sohn<sup><\/sup>, Tai-Gyu Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Vigencell Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"07e316b1-269d-4582-ac9c-a7ada97a5535","ControlNumber":"3332","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

The Wnt ligand, WNT5A, is required for normal prostate gland development and is increased in bone metastatic, castration resistant PCa (CRPC) patients. WNT5A signaling is mediated in part through ROR1, a non-canonical Wnt receptor and fetal oncoprotein for which the therapeutic inhibitory antibody, Zilovertamab, has been developed. Its safety has been clinically proven in trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and metastatic breast cancer. We sought to investigate Zilovertamab-based anti-ROR1 therapies for metastatic prostate cancer.Our Hypothesis is that WNT5A may activate a stem-cell-like program via ROR1 which leads to therapy resistance in metastatic prostate cancer. The anti-ROR1 biologic, Zilovertamab, may inhibit this mechanism of resistance. The expression of ROR1 on CRPC and NEPC tumors and its lack of expression on normal adult tissues makes it a promising CART cell target.<br \/>Methods: We used the patient-derived xenograft (PDX), PCSD13, small cell bone metastatic prostate cancer model and the neuroendocrine PCa cell lines, PC3 and DU145, to test the effect of Zilovertamab and Zilovertamab-CART cells in vitro using the real time cell viability, proliferation, and cell cycle tracking assays in an Incucyte S3. We used in vivo bioluminescence and tumor caliper measurements to monitor effects in vivo.<br \/>Results: Studies using RNASeq, qRT-PCR, FACS and Westerns showed high expression of ROR1 in PC3, DU145, and in PCSD13. CRISPR-Cas9 Knock out of ROR1 in PC3 and DU145 cells showed increased inhibition of proliferation at lower docetaxel concentrations. Treatment of PCSD13 PDX in vivo with Zilovertamab increased docetaxel-mediated tumor growth inhibition. Mice bearing PC3 xenografts injected intravenously with Zilovertamab anti-ROR1 CAR-T cells showed durable, tumor ablation in 67% of mice compared to 22% of mice injected with activated T cells from the same donor and 0% of untreated mice. Survival of mice at Day 70 injected with CART was 78% compared to 0% of mice injected with control donor T cells and 0% of untreated mice. Zilovertamab antibody could inhibit Zilovertamab CART cell tumor cell killing.<br \/>Conclusions: ROR1 was expressed at high levels on castration resistant small cell PCa and neuroendocrine PCa cell lines and PDX models. Zilovertamab synergized with docetaxel to inhibit tumor growth in patient derived xenograft in vivo and in organoid cultures. Zilovertamab-based CART cells durably eradicated ROR1+ prostate cancer xenograft tumors. These studies supported the recently launched Phase 1b clinical trial of Zilovertamab plus docetaxel in metastatic CRPC patients. Clinical development of GMP Zilovertamab CART cells for a clinical trial in CLL is in progress and may lead to rapid progression to a clinical trial for metastatic CRPC and NEPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Bone metastasis,CAR T cells,Wnt pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christina A.M.

Therefore, modern MB treatment modalities rely on broadly cytotoxic chemotherapy and\/or radiation, leaving survivors with side effects that diminish quality of life, stressing an urgent need for novel approaches. Gamma delta (&#947;&#948;) T cells represent an emerging class of cellular immunotherapy with preclinical potency against the CNS tumor glioblastoma and pediatric solid tumors. The ability of &#947;&#948; T cells to recognize tumor stress antigens, alongside their MHC independence, supports &#947;&#948; T cell usage as an off-the-shelf allogeneic cellular immunotherapy for MB and other immunologically cold cancers. Our team recently identified protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) as a novel immunotherapy target highly expressed in neuroblastoma, with low pediatric healthy tissue expression. Alpha beta T cells engineered with CARs targeting PTK7 demonstrated impressive antitumor efficacy against PTK7<sup>+<\/sup> neuroblastoma xenografts. In that study, we also noted MB and other pediatric solid tumors express elevated levels of PTK7 mRNA. This work therefore serves to test the susceptibility of MB to &#947;&#948; T cell immunotherapy and validate if targeting PTK7 can further enhance &#947;&#948; T cell potency.<br \/>Six MB cell lines representing three out of the four MB molecular subgroups were chosen: DAOY, ONS-76, UW228, D341, D425 and D283. Western blot analysis showed five of six MB cell lines express PTK7 protein, and flow cytometry confirmed PTK7 membrane localization. PTK7<sup>high<\/sup> (DAOY) and PTK7<sup>low<\/sup> (ONS-76) cells were chosen to test for the antigen-specific killing potential of PTK7-targeted CAR &#947;&#948; T cells against MB. To generate PTK7-targeted &#947;&#948; T cells, previously cryopreserved &#947;&#948; T cells were electroporated with mRNA encoding a PTK7-targeted CAR construct containing the CD28 co-stimulatory domain. After a four hour co-culture, both ONS-76 and DAOY showed moderate rates of apoptosis from exposure to mock electroporated or na&#239;ve &#947;&#948; T cells at 1:1, 2:1 and 5:1 effector:target (E:T) ratios, with approximately 30-40% cell death at 5:1. There was no change in susceptibility of ONS-76 cells to PTK7-CAR &#947;&#948; T cells when compared to mock electroporated or na&#239;ve &#947;&#948; T cell controls. However, co-culture of DAOY cells with PTK7-CAR &#947;&#948; T cells markedly increased tumor cell death by as much as 40% compared to the mock controls at E:T ratios as low as 1:1.<br \/>In summary, na&#239;ve expanded &#947;&#948; T cells induce pronounced MB tumor cell death. Cytotoxicity is further increased against PTK7<sup>high<\/sup> MB cells following the introduction of an anti-PTK7 CAR. These results provide a strong rationale for additional preclinical studies regarding the feasibility of &#947;&#948; T cell-based immunotherapy against MB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Medulloblastoma,Gamma-delta lymphocytes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Benjamin  S.

This disruptive approach has been validated in clinical and pre-clinical studies for both hematologic and solid tumors. UltraCAR-T cells, manufactured using an overnight process with minimal <i>ex vivo<\/i> manipulation of autologous T cells. UltraCAR-T cells are engineered to co-express CAR, membrane bound IL-15, and kill switch genes using non-viral gene transfer via high-throughput UltraPorator&#8482; system. Multigenic design and overnight manufacturing renders UltraCAR-T cells with enhanced <i>in vivo<\/i> expansion and persistence for durable antitumor activity.<br \/>Chronic antigen stimulation from the tumor can lead to CAR T having an exhausted phenotype contributing to treatment failures. Next generation UltraCAR-T cells also incorporate a novel cell intrinsic blockade of PD-1, superseding the need for combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors and mitigate classic T cell exhaustion that occurs from chronic stimulation, thereby expanding the therapeutic window for efficacy. Using mesothelin (MSLN) as an exemplar from the CAR-target library, we developed a robust <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> model of continuous tumor antigen exposure to evaluate antitumor activity of the UltraCAR-T cells.<br \/>MSLN UltraCAR-T cells were generated with and without intrinsic PD-1 blockade. <i>In vitro<\/i>, UltraCAR-T cells with intrinsic PD-1 blockade demonstrated enhanced inflammatory cytokine expression and cytotoxicity at low effector:target ratios. In long-term co-culture assays with recurring challenge of MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells every 2-3 days, UltraCAR-T cells with intrinsic PD-1 blockade showed sustained potent cytotoxicity which was superior to CAR-T cells lacking PD-1 blockade and in combination with &#945;PD-1 antibody. Intrinsic PD-1 blockade markedly enhanced polyfunctionality of UltraCAR-T cells in the presence of MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor.<br \/>In xenograft solid tumor model, a single administration of MSLN UltraCAR-T cells manufactured using UltraPorator demonstrated significant antitumor efficacy.

Rechallenging the mice, who became tumor-free after a single UltraCAR-T infusion, with tumor for a second time to simulate tumor relapse led to the significant reduction in tumor burden without additional UltraCAR-T treatment.<br \/>Collectively, these pre-clinical data highlight the improved efficacy of intrinsic PD-1 blockade in next generation UltraCAR-T cells using non-viral gene delivery and an established rapid, decentralized manufacturing process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,PD-1,Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Giorgio Zenere<sup><\/sup>, Carol Poortman<sup><\/sup>, Afreen Sayed<sup><\/sup>, Devi Gunasekera<sup><\/sup>, Cheryl Bolinger<sup><\/sup>, Pooja Chauhan<sup><\/sup>, Jacques Plummer<sup><\/sup>, Shamim Ahmad<sup><\/sup>, Rutul  R.

Approximately 90% of epithelial ovarian cancers express tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG72), thus making it an effective target for the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cell therapies. Our previous studies have demonstrated efficacy of TAG72-CAR T cells in reducing tumor growth and improving survival using <i>in vivo<\/i> human tumor xenograft mouse models; however, these models are limited in their ability to capture the effects of the immune system and the tumor microenvironment on the impact of CAR T cell therapy. Thus, we have established a novel spontaneous OvCa model using the hen to preclinically evaluate our TAG72-CAR T cell therapy. Hens are one of the only spontaneous preclinical animal models for OvCa, because naturally occurring chicken ovarian tumors pathologically resemble and behave similar to human ovarian tumors. However, to date, the use of the hen as a preclinical model has been directed towards prevention strategies versus targeted therapies for the disease. In this study, we designed and tested a chicken TAG72-CAR construct in an epHIV7 lentivirus backbone under the EF1a promoter that contains all the major CAR domains specific to chickens for the transduction of chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After optimizing the production of CAR T cells, we further characterized their effector function by investigating various cell surface markers, targeted-killing capabilities, and activation\/exhaustion marker expression. We observed a greater killing capacity within a 24-hour exposure period to ovarian cancer cells, such as human immortalized ovarian tumor cells (OVCAR3), displaying the target antigen compared to the later time exposures of 48 hours and\/or 72 hours. The activation and exhaustion surface markers analyzed throughout the experiments support the high killing capacities earlier in exposure, with elevated activation and exhaustion occurring at later time points. In this study, chicken TAG72-CAR T cells were successfully generated, characterized, and tested as a therapeutic approach for treating OvCa in the hen, and will be further used to evaluate their <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy in the hen model. The ability to test therapeutic strategies in an <i>in vivo<\/i> model that biologically and physiologically parallels the disease in women allows for the improvement of OvCa diagnosis and prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,T cell,Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Emily  L.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the quality of the starting cell material for CAR T cell production and the composition of the CAR T cell infusion product for clinical response. In our study, we have evaluated the clinical response to third generation anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in 23 patients with B cell lymphoma. Further, we evaluated the CAR T cell infusion products using targeted single-cell RNA sequencing and multi-color flow cytometry to find potential T cell subsets associating with clinical response. Patients were divided into responders (CR + PR) and non-responders (SD + PD) at the 1-month follow-up after treatment. The CAR T cell products of both responding and non-responding patients were dominated by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CAR T cells. When comparing cells from the two patient groups we found that the presence of effector-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CAR T cells with a high cytotoxic and cytokine secretion and low dysfunction gene expression profile were associated with clinical response. Furthermore, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CAR T cells of responders displayed a higher polyfunctional gene expression profile, which has previously been shown to associate with clinical response. In contrast, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CAR T cells from the infusion products of non-responders displayed an elevated dysfunction gene expression profile. Our study reveals that single-cell RNA expression analysis of individual CAR T cell infusion product can identify subsets of effector cells correlating with clinical response. This can be used as a guidance in the CAR T cell production processes, to obtain CAR T cells with the desired characteristics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Lymphoma,Single cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tina Sarén<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mohanraj Ramachandran<sup>1<\/sup>, Gustav Gammelgård<sup>1<\/sup>, Tanja Lövgren<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristina Wikström<sup>2<\/sup>, Jamileh Hashemi<sup>1<\/sup>, Eva Freyhult<sup>3<\/sup>, Claudio Mirabello<sup>4<\/sup>, Åsa K Björklund<sup>5<\/sup>, Håkan Ahlström<sup>6<\/sup>, Rose-Marie Amini<sup>7<\/sup>, Hans Hagberg<sup>7<\/sup>, Angelica Loskog<sup>1<\/sup>, Gunilla Enblad<sup>1<\/sup>, Magnus Essand<sup>7<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>VECURA, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden,<sup>3<\/sup>Uppsala University, Dept Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden,<sup>4<\/sup>IFM Bioinformatics, National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden, Science for Life Laboratory, Linköping, Sweden,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden,<sup>6<\/sup>Dept Surgical Sciences Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden,<sup>7<\/sup>Dept Immunology, Genetics, Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e16fb6e9-573c-4ef8-9ea9-e4871760ff52","ControlNumber":"5915","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

While the contribution of key, state-specific transcription factors to these processes has been extensively explored, the role for chromatin regulatory complexes remains less clear. The mammalian SWI\/SNF (mSWI\/SNF) complexes are a diverse family of ATP-dependent remodeling complexes that regulate DNA accessibility and hence facilitate timely and appropriate gene expression. Recent genome-scale CRISPR screens have highlighted the involvement of mSWI\/SNF complexes in the acquisition of divergent T cell states; however, the mechanisms by which these complexes regulate T cell activation and exhaustion and how such activities may be leveraged for therapeutic benefit remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> system to map chromatin-level changes occurring during acute and chronic TCR stimulation in human T cells and to investigate the contribution of the mSWI\/SNF complexes throughout these processes. By gene expression and chromatin profiling, we show that our <i>in vitro<\/i> model closely recapitulates the T cell activation and exhaustion phenotypes observed in human tumors. We demonstrate that the mSWI\/SNF complexes contribute to shaping the epigenome of T cells at different activation and exhaustion stages, directing subsequent changes in gene expression. Specifically, deletion of components demarcating the cBAF subcomplex within the mSWI\/SNF family improves T cell survival and proliferation and leads to the down-regulation of exhaustion hallmarks. Notably, by using four different compounds that either degrade or inhibit the catalytic activity of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, we demonstrate that mSWI\/SNF disruption significantly increases human T cell fitness, decreases exhaustion and is associated to memory-like hallmarks in chronically stimulated human T cells. Finally, pharmacologic mSWI\/SNF inhibition improves CAR-T fitness and expansion and results in improved anti-tumor control <i>in vivo<\/i>. These findings reveal a central role for mSWI\/SNF complexes in the processes of T cell activation and exhaustion, and suggest SMARCA4\/2 ATPase inhibitors and degraders as potential strategies to enhance current T-cell based cancer immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Epigenomics,Chromatin remodeling,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elena Battistello<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kimberlee Hixon<sup>2<\/sup>, Dawn E.
