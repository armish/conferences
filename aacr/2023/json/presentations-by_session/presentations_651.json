[{"Abstract":"Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of human cancer not only permit us to gain a detailed insight into the specific genetic changes that drive tumor development and metastasis but also provide powerful tools to study the mechanisms underlying drug response and acquired resistance. Once these processes are understood in sufficient detail it may be possible to design combination therapies that not only cause complete remissions but also eliminate remnant cells that elicit recurrent disease. We have developed GEMMs and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), BRCA1\/2-associated breast cancer (BABC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). We have also developed somatic engineering technologies for rapid modelling of breast cancer in mice and rats using intraductal injection of lentiviruses. We have successfully used these models to (1) identify factors that contribute to invasive progression of DCIS, (2) identify and validate cancer driver genes in BABC and ILC, (3) study the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer, (4) identify and validate mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapeutics such as PARP inhibitors (PARPi), and (5) identify strategies to overcome PARPi resistance. In this Meet-the-Expert session, I will give an overview of the state-of-the-art of current technologies for modeling breast cancer in mice and rats and discuss recent results from our work.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jos Jonkers<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
