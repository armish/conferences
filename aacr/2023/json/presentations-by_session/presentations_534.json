However, clinical data show that resistance develops rapidly after initial responses, suggesting that combination therapies will be needed. Ideally, these combinations should not only overcome adaptive or acquired resistance but also maintain or even enhance the positive immunomodulatory effects that KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors (G12Ci) have in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Most of the G12Ci being tested in clinical trials target GDP-bound KRAS (OFF state), which makes them vulnerable to upstream pathway reactivation. In this study we use a covalent tri-complex KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor, RM-029, which targets KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> in the active state. Treatment with RM-029 still resulted in some degree of adaptive RAS pathway reactivation, which can be blocked using the SHP2 inhibitor RMC-4550. In vivo, this combination enhanced tumor regressions and improved overall survival in two different KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> lung cancer models. In an immunogenic KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> lung cancer model both KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) and SHP2 inhibitors remodel the TME and are able to drive durable responses, which are enhanced when both compounds are combined. However, in this anti-PD1 sensitive model the combination of RM-029 with anti-PD1 generated more complete responses than the combination of RM-029 and RMC-4550. In an immune-excluded anti-PD1 resistant model, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) and SHP2 inhibitors also promoted a profound remodelling of the TME, with increased infiltration and activation of T cells accompanied by a reduction of tumor-promoting myeloid cells. Importantly, only the combination of both KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) and SHP2 inhibitors sensitized these immune-excluded tumors to anti-PD1 blockade, resulting in durable responses and immune memory. Our preclinical results show that RM-029 as single agent or in combination with RMC-4550 and\/or anti-PD1 can induce anti-tumor immunity and generate complete responses, especially in immunogenic models. To study if this immunological response could also target G12Ci-resistant subpopulations within the tumor, we used our immunogenic cell line (KPAR) to generate reporter-traced G12Ci sensitive (KPAR<sup>G12C<\/sup>) and resistant (KPAR<sup>G12D<\/sup>) cells that can be monitored over time via in vivo luciferase imaging and end point flow cytometry. We find evidence of bystander immune mediated killing of G12Ci-resistant cells in response to the different treatment combinations. Overall, our preclinical results demonstrate the potential of the combination of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(ON) inhibitors with SHP2 and\/or immune checkpoint blockade not only by targeting KRAS-driven proliferation in tumor cells but by stimulating anti-tumor immunity to target both G12Ci sensitive and resistant cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,Immune response,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Panayiotis Anastasiou<sup><\/sup>, Mona Tomaschko<sup><\/sup>, Jesse Boumelha<sup><\/sup>, Sareena Rana<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Moore<sup><\/sup>, <b>Miriam Molina-Arcas<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Julian Downward<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"26dcd8a3-ef8c-4d00-b73e-0f2853ed89b6","ControlNumber":"4884","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Targeting the pathway using BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) in combination with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) is now the standard of care for metastatic melanoma patients harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. However, effective targeted therapies are lacking for most cancers driven by other pathway alterations, including those with RAS activating mutations. The effectiveness of current clinical BRAFi relies on the fact that they bind selectively and inhibit the mutationally activated monomeric form of the BRAF(V600E) kinase in tumors but not wild-type BRAF in normal tissue where BRAF signals in its dimeric form. Yet, the development of adaptive resistance, frequently due to RAF dimerization, limits BRAFi therapeutic effectiveness. Another class of BRAFi equipotent for both monomeric and dimeric BRAF have been developed, but are predicted to have lower therapeutic index due to inhibition of dimeric wild-type BRAF in normal tissues as well. Recently, we identified and characterized a novel class of BRAFi that preferentially binds and inhibits dimeric BRAF over monomeric BRAF(V600E) (i.e. RAF dimer-selective inhibitors). Furthermore, we rationally designed a combinatorial approach utilizing a BRAF monomer-selective plus a BRAF dimer-selective inhibitor plus a MEK inhibitor, that potently disrupts the BRAF\/MEK complex, to maximally inhibit BRAF(V600E) signaling in tumors while retaining a broad therapeutic index. This triple combination potently suppressed tumor growth of multiple BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer and melanoma models resistant to the current clinical BRAFi and MEKi combinations both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. To design effective therapeutic approaches for RAS-mutated tumors, we also assessed the effectiveness of RAF and MEK inhibitors belonging to diverse biochemical and structural classes, either alone or in combination in RAS-mutant tumor models and normal cells with wild-type RAS signaling. We found that RAF dimer-selective inhibitors potently antagonized MAPK signaling and growth in various RAS mutant cancer models as compared to normal cells. We found further that RAF and MEK inhibitor combinations belonging to certain biochemical classes resulted in more potent MAPK suppression in RAS-mutant tumor as compared to wild-type RAS normal cells (&#8220;therapeutic synergy&#8221;) and should be prioritized for clinical testing. In contrast, those combinations which are more potent in normal over tumor cells (&#8220;adverse synergy&#8221;) are unlikely to be clinically successful. Thus, rationally designed combinations of selected RAFi and MEKi, based on their distinct biochemical properties, can uncover new therapeutic opportunities tailored for more effective targeting of BRAF or RAS mutant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,MEK,Ras,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ana Orive-Ramos<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christos Adamopoulos<sup>1<\/sup>, Beau Baars<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Lam<sup>1<\/sup>, Ankita Punetha<sup>2<\/sup>, Jason Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Vasileios  I.

Among KRAS mutations, KRAS G12D is the most frequent driver mutation and is found in approximately 34% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), 12% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), 4% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and in a subset of patients with other solid tumors. We have identified ASP3082 as a novel KRAS G12D degrader with high potency and selectivity. Here, we have evaluated in vivo antitumor activities and pharmacodynamic properties of ASP3082 in various KRAS G12D-mutated xenograft models. ASP3082 was intravenously administered to KRAS G12D-mutated cancer-xenograft-bearing mice, and plasma and tumors were collected at defined time points. The drug concentration and KRAS-related signal transduction were measured in the xenograft model. The in vivo efficacy of ASP3082 monotherapy was confirmed in multiple xenograft mouse models following intravenous administration. Once&#8209;weekly intravenous administration of ASP3082 induced dose-dependent and significant growth inhibition of KRAS G12D PDAC tumors, resulting in profound tumor regression without body weight loss. ASP3082 showed sustained<br \/>concentrations in the xenograft tumors after a single intravenous administration and decreased KRAS G12D-mutated-protein levels according to the duration of the sustained ASP3082 concentrations. ASP3082 also demonstrated marked inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and its downstream genes, and potently induced cleavage of caspase 3. In addition, ASP3082 exhibited potent antitumor activities in not only PDAC but also CRC and non-small cell lung cancer KRAS G12D-mutated mouse models. These studies demonstrated that ASP3082 induced degradation of KRAS G12D protein, inhibition of KRAS downstream molecules, and an apoptotic response to show dose-dependent antitumor activity in multiple KRAS G12D-mutated cancer models. ASP3082 is a potential therapeutic agent for patients with tumors harboring the KRAS G12D mutation. Currently, a phase 1 clinical trial is underway in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with KRAS G12D mutation (NCT05382559).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Preclinical,Xenografts,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Takeyuki Nagashima<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tomohiro Yoshinari<sup><\/sup>, Yoshihiro Nishizono<sup><\/sup>, Mamoru Tasaki<sup><\/sup>, Kohei Inamura<sup><\/sup>, Hiroki Ishioka<sup><\/sup>, Atsushi Suzuki<sup><\/sup>, Fumio Osaki<sup><\/sup>, Yosuke Yamanaka<sup><\/sup>, Masahiko Hayakawa<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Astellas Pharma, Inc., Tsukuba-shi, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cd33b70f-6629-4b35-8889-0ed693b01262","ControlNumber":"1629","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.

Mechanisms of resistance include secondary mutations of EGFR and cMET and other downstream oncogenic pathways such as KRAS and amplification of alternate growth factor receptors. MET amplification or protein overexpression has been established as the most common mechanism of clinical resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as osimertinib. AZD9592 is a first-in-class bispecific ADC designed to target EGFR and cMET, while overcoming pathway-mediated resistance mechanisms that limit other targeted agents. Here we describe the generation, characterization and preclinical evaluation of AZD9592. The ADC was constructed on the backbone of the clinically validated DuetMab monovalent bispecific IgG platform and was engineered with higher affinity for cMET compared to EGFR (&#62;15 fold), with the aim of reducing EGFR-driven toxicity in normal tissues. The antibody is conjugated via a cleavable linker to a proprietary topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload (AZ14170132). The internalization and <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> in the low nM range) of AZD9592 were found to be optimal when both EGFR and cMET were engaged. When EGFR alone was engaged, cytotoxicity was significantly reduced, consistent with the lower affinity for EGFR. Treatment of cells with AZD9592 induced multiple DNA damage response pathway markers (like ATM, ATR, &#947;&#919;2&#913;X), consistent with the proposed primary mechanism of action (MOA) of direct tumor-cell killing caused by double strand DNA breaks. AZD9592 monotherapy showed activity <i>in vivo<\/i> in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing multiple EGFR and cMET expressing tumor types, including both EGFR mutant (m) and wild-type NSCLC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Responses (&#8805;30% regression from baseline tumor volume) were observed across a wide range of clinically relevant dose levels, including a 41% response rate in EGFRm NSCLC tumors treated at the lowest tested dose of 2 mg\/kg. AZD9592 combined with osimertinib also showed benefit in PDX models derived from patients who progressed on osimertinib alone, as well as models representing primary resistance (EGFR ex20ins). AZD9592 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys over a 6-week period (dosing every 3 weeks). The key safety findings were limited hematological effects, consistent with the MOA of the TOP1i payload. Plasma pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys showed an acceptable profile at tolerated doses, in line with other EGFR and cMET directed antibodies. These results demonstrate that AZD9592 has a promising efficacy and safety profile in preclinical models representing diverse opportunities in multiple clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),c-Met,EGFR,HNSCC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Frank Comer<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yariv Mazor<sup>1<\/sup>, Elaine Hurt<sup>1<\/sup>, Chunning Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Fleming<sup>1<\/sup>, Harini Shandilya<sup>1<\/sup>, Balakumar Vijayakrishnan<sup>2<\/sup>, Meghan Sterba<sup>1<\/sup>, Ruoyan Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Edward Rosfjord<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolas Floch<sup>3<\/sup>, Anton I.

AZD9592 selectively binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-MET, two cell surface receptors highly expressed in solid tumors including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here we evaluate the pharmacodynamic activity of the TOP1i payload delivery by AZD9592 in an NSCLC-derived xenograft model using immunohistochemistry (IHC) approaches. Treatment-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and apoptotic cell death were measured using &#947;H2AX, phospho-RAD-50 (pRAD50), and cleaved-caspase-3 (CC3) across increasing exposure to AZD9592. Furthermore, we report <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor efficacy of AZD9592 in a panel of NSCLC and HNSCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that were characterized for somatic tumor alterations, including oncogenic driver mutations in EGFR, tumor cell expression of EGFR and c-MET by IHC and deep-learning based image analysis, and targeted proteomics by mass spectrometry. Results demonstrate dose-dependent increases in pRAD50 and &#947;H2AX upon treatment with AZD9592, signifying induction of DNA damage. Increased CC3 and reduced tumor volume (TV) in all treatment groups compared with control groups supports that AZD9592 induces tumor cell death due to formation of DNA DSB. In PDX experiments, tumor growth inhibition (TGI), defined as &#8805;30% reduction in TV from baseline after a single dose of AZD9592 8 mg\/kg, was observed in 73% (16\/22) of EGFR mutant NSCLC models. The models evaluated included tumors with or without prior exposure to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and harboring diverse mutational profiles and heterogeneous expression levels of EGFR and c-MET. In EGFR wildtype NSCLC and HNSCC PDX, TGI was observed in 60% (12\/20) and 44% (4\/9) of models, respectively. IHC demonstrated an association of target expression and response to treatment, suggesting a potential predictive feature of response in tumors with elevated antigen expression. Targeted proteomics demonstrated an association between the expression of SLFN11, a known TOP1i sensitivity marker, and treatment response. Collectively, these results support the hypothesized mechanism of action of AZD9592: TOP1i induced tumor cell death due to formation of DNA DSB, and suggest opportunities in the treatment of tumors with a range of molecular features. AZD9592 is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced solid malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,c-MET,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lara McGrath<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ying Zheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Simon Christ<sup>3<\/sup>, Christian C.

Specifically, KRAS G12 mutation (89%) is the most common in tumors, followed by G13 (9%) and Q61 (1%). These mutations were once considered &#8220;undruggable&#8221; for many years until appearance of sotorasib . However, it was developed only for G12C mutation.<br \/>We designed a Pan-Ras neoantigen mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1521), which covers all prevalent RAS mutations to achieve broad-spectrum cancer therapy. We synthesized a multiepitope neoantigen KRAS mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1521) and examined its immune response and anti-tumor efficacy in the colon cancer of Balb\/c mice . Two groups (A, B) of mice were immunized with mRNA-1521 on days 0, 21, and 49, while PBS was given to two other groups (C, D) as the control on the same days. All mice were inoculated with CT26 cells (colon carcinoma cell line harboring G12D mutation) on day 56. Afterward, anti-PD1 antibodies were administered to groups A and C every two days. Tumor sizes were measured every 3 days after inoculation until anyone exceeded 1500mm<sup>3<\/sup> in the control group. The serum IgG titer and T cell response of mice were explored using ELISA and splenocyte ELISpot assay after euthanasia. Tumor tissues were harvested and embedded in paraffin for the immunohistochemistry (IHC) test. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was also applied to investigate the whole transcriptome analysis.<br \/>Tumor growth rates in all treatment groups were slower than in the control group. Among them, the mean tumor size and weight in the combination group of mRNA-1521 and anti-PD1 (372mm<sup>3<\/sup>, 0.48g) were only 25% of the PBS group (1488mm<sup>3<\/sup>, 2g). On average, the anti-PD1 and vaccine groups had moderate tumor size and weight (1100mm<sup>3<\/sup>\/1.5g and 886mm<sup>3<\/sup>\/1.26g, respectively). The splenocytes from the mice in each group were collected. The IFN-&#947; secreting splenocytes in the combination group were 50% higher than the mRNA-1521 group. Furthermore, the total IgG titer of vaccine-immunized mice (OD450nm&#62;2) was 3 and 4 times higher than the anti-PD1 and control groups. The IHC showed that the tumor tissues in the vaccine groups had more CD8+ and granzyme B+ CD8+ T cell infiltrations than in the control group. Whole transcriptome analysis showed that RAS downstream gene expressions were significantly lower in the vaccine group, indicating that the RAS vaccine was effective in inhibiting signaling pathways accounting for tumor proliferation, progression, and migration.<br \/>In conclusion, prophylactic immunization of mRNA-1521 inhibited tumor growth in the mouse model of colon cancer. Its inhibitory effects on tumor growth were more remarkable in the combination of anti-PD1 antibodies. Moreover, the vaccine could elicit specific T and B cell responses, which are crucial in anti-cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Vaccines,RNA,Cancer vaccine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Renxiang Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, David  M.

To expand therapeutic potential of sotorasib, combination strategies need to be developed. In this study, we conducted a large-scale screening to identify novel combination candidates with sotorasib. In addition, molecular mechanisms of synergistic effects were investigated in multiple preclinical models.<br \/>Methods: To identify novel combination partners of sotorasib, we conducted high-throughput screening using a kinase inhibitor library containing 1,400 chemical compounds. Anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in vitro were assessed by ATP-based cell viability assay and\/or clonogenic assay, and caspase 3\/7 assay and\/or Annexin V assay, respectively. Synergistic effects were evaluated by calculating the BLISS index and visualized by SynergyFinder Plus. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies against pCDK1 (Tyr15), pERK, pAkt, MCL1, BIM, PUMA, BCL2, or BCL-xL. In vivo efficacy studies were performed using a KRAS G12C mutant H358 xenograft nude mouse model.<br \/>Results: Through the large-scale unbiased combination screening of -1,400 kinase inhibitors, we identified a WEE1 inhibitor (AZD1775), a G2\/M checkpoint abrogator in clinical-stage development, as a promising combination partner of sotorasib in KRAS<sup> <\/sup>G12C mutant NSCLC. The synergistic effects in vitro were broadly observed in multiple KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC cell lines, regardless of single-agent sensitivity to sotrasib or co-occurring oncogenic mutation profiles. The combination treatment upregulated pro-apoptotic protein BIM, leading to apoptosis. In vivo efficacy studies in H358-xenografted models also demonstrated remarkable tumor regression and durable response in mice treated with sotorasib and AZD1775 compared to ones with a single agent alone.<br \/>Conclusion: We identify AZD1775, a WEE1 inhibitor, as a novel combination candidate, which enhanced the anti-tumor activity of sotorasib both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models. These findings can lead to a novel therapeutic strategy for KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gaku Yamamoto<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kosuke Tanaka<sup><\/sup>, Ryo Kamata<sup><\/sup>, Shunta Mori<sup><\/sup>, Jie Liu<sup><\/sup>, Toyohiro Yamauchi<sup><\/sup>, Yuta Sakae<sup><\/sup>, Akihiro Ohashi<sup><\/sup>, Susumu  S.
