[{"Abstract":"Cancer genome sequencing studies have identified multiple novel tumor suppressor genes, including the FTSJD1 or CMTR2 gene that is subject to statistically significant levels of both nonsense and frameshift mutations in lung adenocarcinoma. However, these analyses are insufficient to determine the importance and modes of action of the gene in the disease. Follow-up functional studies are essential to elucidate these gene functions. The protein product of CMTR2 has been described as an mRNA cap methyltransferase, which O-methylates the ribose of the second guanine residue of the 5&#8217; cap, likely serving to modify efficiency of transcript processing, translation and stability, but the details of how and why specific transcripts undergo methylation by the enzyme, as well as its role in oncogenesis, remain to be elucidated. In this study we report the first comprehensive analysis of the physiologic consequences of Cmtr2 deficiency in knockout (KO) mice and primary human cells. Constitutive deletion of Cmtr2 results in embryos that die in midgestation with defects in embryo size, placental malformation and yolk sac vascularization. Endothelial-specific deletion of Cmtr2 in mice also results in vascular defects and perinatal lethality, suggesting that vascular development is a key function of Cmtr2 in animals. In summary, our study reveals that Cmtr2 plays a critical role in vascular development, maturation and remodeling. Further studies of CMTR2 function may provide insight not only into lung cancer biology but also to its broader roles in ontogeny.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,RNA,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alena Yermalovich<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zarin Mohsenin<sup>1<\/sup>, Bruno Giotti<sup>2<\/sup>, Douglas Wheeler<sup>1<\/sup>, Kelly Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander Tsankov<sup>2<\/sup>, Matthew Meyerson<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a719fce1-e6df-48d4-b1b4-cedcfa852617","ControlNumber":"8122","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of RCC and is characterized by a highly vascularized tumor microenvironment (TME). While current anti-angiogenic therapies targeting VEGF signaling are initially effective, almost all patients develop resistance to these therapies. Therefore, there is a need to identify clinically relevant alternative molecular targets to suppress tumor angiogenesis and progression in ccRCC. We previously discovered transcriptional upregulation of actin-binding profilin1 (Pfn1) in tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells (EC) in ccRCC and higher expression of Pfn1 correlated with adverse clinical prognosis. The goal of the present work was to further explore whether genetic manipulation of Pfn1 specifically in EC has therapeutic benefit in kidney cancer. We found that triggering vascular endothelial Pfn1 gene deletion, either in a widespread manner or locally in a kidney-restricted manner, suppresses tumor initiation and\/or growth progression of pre-established kidney tumors in syngeneic mouse models. Loss of endothelial Pfn1 dramatically impacts the TME characterized by prominent suppression of tumor angiogenesis with massive tumor cell death and reduction of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. By performing cytokine array and Luminex assays of tumor lysates, we further identified Pfn1-dependent downregulation of several pro-angiogenic cell-secreted factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines that are major drivers of tumor progression in RCC including VEGF, endothelin-1, Cyr61, Macrophage Inflammatory Protein, G-CSF and IL6 <i>in vivo<\/i>. As a clinical correlate for mouse model data, we performed multiplexed quantitative immunohistochemistry analyses of human ccRCC specimens constructed on tissue microarray which also showed a positive correlation between Pfn1 expression (either in endothelial cells or tumor cells) and tumor infiltration of predominantly macrophages. Furthermore, through small molecule screening, we identified a novel inhibitor of the Pfn1-actin interaction (Pfn1i) and showed its ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth aggressiveness of tumor cells resembling various genetic landscapes of human ccRCC. Collectively, these findings establish endothelial Pfn1 as a critical regulator of TME and tumor progression in RCC, and provide a proof-of-concept for targeting Pfn1 as a potentially novel therapeutic strategy in RCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Angiogenesis,Angiogenesis inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David M.

However, recent studies from our group have demonstrated that tumor lymphangiogenesis promotes intratumor T cell infiltration and potentiates the efficacy of a wide range of immunotherapies in melanoma-bearing mice as well as patients undergoing checkpoint blockade. Radiotherapy (RT) can also induce immunogenic tumor cell death, so we investigated whether lymphangiogenic tumors would yield more immunogenic responses to RT than non-lymphangiogenic tumors. Here, we compared effects of RT in mice bearing B16-F10 melanomas expressing either a control vector (B16-Ctrl) or overexpression the lymphangiogenic factor VEGF-C (B16-VC), where lymphatic vessels were significantly increased in number and size compared to B16-Ctrl tumors. First, we find that B16-VC regress faster than B16-CT after RT (either a single 20 Gy dose or two 15 Gy doses), and that this regression was correlated with enhanced CD8+ T cell activity. On the other hand, lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) can be more sensitive to damage from RT if they are undergoing lymphangiogenesis. We found that irradiated B16-VC tumors showed higher levels of intra-lymphatic fibrin. Consistent with this, LECs in the irradiated B16-VC tumors expressed higher levels of tissue factor and caspase-3, which correlated with the degree of lymphatic clotting. Fibrin clotting was also observed in the subcapsular sinus of the draining lymph nodes of irradiated B16-VC tumors. These findings highlight the complex role of tumor lymphangiogenesis in radiotherapy responses, where they may potentiate acute anti-tumor immune responses but may also cause localized damage of the vasculature, potentially leading to increased metastasis. Further studies are needed to investigate therapeutic targets to inhibit lymphatic coagulation and look at its effects on cancer immunotherapy and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Tumor microcirculation and the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphangiogenesis,Radiotherapy,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Lymphangiogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anish Mukherjee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nikolaos Mitrousis<sup>1<\/sup>, Mari Stella Sasso<sup>1<\/sup>, Margo MacDonald<sup>1<\/sup>, Ainhoa Arina<sup>2<\/sup>, Phillip Ang<sup>3<\/sup>, Ariana Baginski<sup>1<\/sup>, J.

Up to 50% of individuals with primary uveal melanoma will eventually develop liver metastases through mechanisms that remain poorly described. At this time there are no systemic therapies that are effective against the majority of UM liver metastases. The goal of this study is to better understand the role of tumor-host cell crosstalk in the progression and therapeutic response of UM liver metastases.<br \/>METHODS: We used UM liver metastatic mouse models to study bidirectional cell-cell communication. Mice were treated with MEKi (trametinib, daily),HDACi (panobinostat, 3 times a week), or the combination for the period of 21 days.The tumor progression was monitored using MRI. Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) was performed to delineate the host-tumor crosstalk and mechanisms of therapy response. Similarly, scRNA seq was conducted <i>in vitro<\/i> with mono- and co-cultures of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and uveal melanoma cells. Human cytokine arrays were carried out between mono and co-culture to identify and confirm unbiased growth factors released between HSCs and UM. ELISA assays were conducted to quantify the cytokine IL8 in mono and coculture cell culture supernatant. A vascular tube formation assay was carried to study the angiogenesis in presence of IL-8 and GDF15.<br \/>RESULTS: Our scRNA-Seq analyses of UM liver mets revealed a large infiltration of HSCs, along with myeloid derived suppressor cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and hepatocytes. As HSCs were the major host cell type in UM liver mets we performed scRNA-Seq on UM monocultures and UM-HSC co-cultures to determine the patterns of cell-cell interaction upon co-culture and in response to drug. Singlecell SignalR analysis identified key interactions between UM-HSC mediated through FGFR2 and RPS27A associated with increased IL-6, FOS\/JUN, STA3, &#38; NF&#954;B signaling in the UM cells. Further studies showed that Class 2 UM cells secreted GDF15 that activated the HSCs resulting in the secretion of multiple growth factors, including MMPs, VEGFA, TGF-&#946;1, IL8 and multiple ECM genes.As many of the identified growth factors were associated with angiogenesis, we performed co-culture assays with UM, HSC and endothelial cells and noted increased vascular network formation in the presence of activated HSCs. Addition of exogenous IL-8 was found to mimic the effects vascular network formation <i>in vitro<\/i>, suggesting this to be a potential mediated of HSC-driven angiogenic response in UM mets. Treatment of established UM liver mets with the MEKi+HDACi combination significantly decreased angiogenesis in UM liver mets, an effect associated with inhibition of IL-8 and GDF15 release.<br \/>CONCLUSION: Bidirectional communication between hepatic stellate and UM cells induces angiogenic pathways in UM both in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, leading to vascular network formation and tumor progression in the liver.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-02 Host-tumor interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sathya Neelature Sriramareddy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zhihua Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiannong Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Ann Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonathan  D.

However, clinical trials of generic strategies targeting PDAC stromal components have mostly failed or, in some cases, even accelerated tumor progression. These findings prompt us to re-evaluate the functional heterogeneity and selective targeting of the tumor stroma. Tumor stroma involves the prominent accumulation of type I collagen (Col1), the most abundant protein in PDAC and the human body. However, the precise molecular and mechanistic contributions of Col1 to PDAC remain unknown, due to the lack of mouse models for precise knockout of Col1. I have established a variety of novel transgenic mouse models that allow specific genetic deletion of Col1 in various cell populations including fibroblasts or cancer cells of spontaneous PDAC (Chen et al., Cancer Cell, 2022; Chen et al., Cancer Cell, 2021; Chen et al., Nature Communications, 2021). In addition, my prior studies underscore the importance of deciphering the functional heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment with both tumor-restraining and tumor-promoting functions (McAndrew, Chen, Darpolor et al., Cancer Discovery, 2022; Chen et al., Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, 2021; Chen et al., EMBO Molecular Medicine, 2018; Chen et al., PLoS Biology, 2018). Specifically, my recent studies identified that Col1 deletion in fibroblasts significantly aggravates tumor progression and immune suppression, with enriched myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and inhibited T\/B cells (Chen et al., Cancer Cell, 2021). On the contrary, Col1 deletion in cancer cells inhibited PDAC progression and immunosuppression, leading to beneficial intra-tumoral microbiome and enhanced efficacy of immunotherapy (Chen et al., Cancer Cell, 2022). In contrast to the normal Col1 heterotrimer (&#945;1\/&#945;2\/&#945;1) produced by fibroblasts, pancreatic cancer cells produce abnormal oncogenic Col1 homotrimer (&#945;1\/&#945;1\/&#945;1). Col1 homotrimers produced by cancer cells exhibits potent tumor-promoting functions, in contrast to the tumor-restraining functions of Col1 heterotrimers produced by fibroblasts. These findings, as validated in both transgenic mouse models and pancreatic tumor patient datasets, identify the distinct impact of various Col1 subtypes on tumor progression, immune landscape, and microbiome profile. Furthermore, my results underscore the need for new therapeutic strategy preferably targeting Col1 homotrimer-specific oncogenic effects in cancer cells via cancer-specific receptors, without disturbing Col1 heterotrimer-induced tumor-restraining functions. My current studies aim to dissect the cancer cell-intrinsic response and immune response to Col1 homotrimer versus Col1 heterotrimer, which may unravel the fundamental collagen-responsive mechanism by which cancer cells survive in the desmoplastic microenvironment, revealing potential vulnerabilities of PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Tumor microcirculation and the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yang Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Translational Molecular Pathology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c21d8a0c-eb97-4bd1-908c-5c1c1b87a8c7","ControlNumber":"1649","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

VEGFA is identified as the major angiogenic factor and VEGFR2 binds to all VEGFA isoforms and VEGFR2 (KDR) is a dominant mediator in regulating the angiogenic and permeability-enhancing effects of VEGFA. Importantly, in numerous solid tumors, VEGFA and VEGFR2 are overexpressed to promote intratumoral angiogenesis to support local tumor survival, tumor growth and distant metastasis. Given that VEGFA\/VEGFR2 interaction plays a crucial role in promoting intratumoral angiogenesis and tumor growth, it is appealing to develop novel potent anti-angiogenic agents for cancer treatment by direct against VEGFA-VEGFR2 interaction. However, the preclinical assessment of anti-angiogenesis agents are limited due to lack of suitable preclinical models for human-specific therapeutic antibodies which usually don&#8217;t cross-bind to mouse targets. To this end, we developed the KDR (VEGFR2) humanized mouse model (hKDR model), in which the extracellular regions of mouse VEGFR2 corresponding to exons 4-15 are replaced by human counterparts via ES cell-based homologous recombination. As a result, hKDR humanized mouse expresses a chimeric VEGFR2 receptor containing the human extracellular domain plus mouse trans-membrane and intracellular domains. Firstly, we characterized the chimeric h\/m KDR expression on the endothelial cells as well as in intratumoral blood vessels derived from hKDR knockin mice. Subsequently, we investigated the anti-tumor responses of anti-human VEGFR2 antibody (Cyramza, Ramucirumab) in hKDR mice bearing B16-F1 and MC38 syngenic solid tumors and we observed that Cyramza inhibited the tumor growth in vivo remarkably in a dose-dependent way, indicating the binding of anti-human VEGFR2 antibody to the chimeric h\/m KDR receptor. Notably, we further generated hKDR knockin model in Rag2 knockout background (hKDR\/Rag2<sup>KO<\/sup>) by crossbreeding which lack mature T cells and B cells. The female hKDR\/Rag2<sup>KO<\/sup> mice were subcutaneously inoculated with human hepatocellular carcinoma LI0612 PDX model and human gastric cancer GA2419 PDX model to assess the anti-tumor effects of anti-angiogenic agents in xenograft solid tumors. The data suggested that Cyramza displayed moderate tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in LI0612 model at 10 mg\/kg and weak TGI in GA2419 model at 10 mg\/kg, respectively. Our findings support the notion that normalization of tumor vasculature is critical for tumor inhibition based on anti-angiogenic therapy and may synergize the anti-tumor effects with the immune checkpoint blockade or promote the cancer immunotherapy of immunomodulators in the future trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antiangiogenesis,VEGFR2,Solid tumors,Humanized,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel He<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b639b7e7-e16b-4748-8794-8b1feada6002","ControlNumber":"3198","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Despite the key role of VEGF signaling in promoting endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, survival, and migration, the clinical use of VEGF inhibitors has modest success and faces many challenges. In particular, patients demonstrate variable initial responses to anti-VEGF therapy, and many of those who respond to treatment subsequently develop resistance. These challenges suggest that there may be VEGF-independent mechanisms driving EC proliferation in the tumor microenvironment. To study these mechanisms, we established an <i>in vitro<\/i> model using a dual-reporter system in a co-culture model of ECs and tumor cells. Specifically, we used an immortalized endothelial cell line (SVEC4-10) expressing GFP and <i>Renilla<\/i> luciferase and a mouse renal carcinoma cell line (RENCA) expressing Tomato and Firefly luciferase. This model allowed us to independently evaluate the growth rates and cell viabilities of both ECs and tumor cells in direct co-culture. Our preliminary data revealed that ECs exhibit increased growth rates when directly co-cultured with tumor cells. Interestingly, this EC proliferation is VEGF-independent and not impacted by VEGF-A knockout in tumor cells or with treatment of a pan-VEGFR small molecule inhibitor (axitinib). To further characterize if our phenotype was due to other tumor secreted factors, we used a transwell setup to eliminate direct contact between ECs and tumor cells and found that EC growth rates were substantially mitigated. These results revealed that tumor cells induced EC proliferation through a physical cell-to-cell interaction that is independent of VEGF. Further characterizing this unknown mechanism may inform therapeutic interventions to overcome the clinical challenges of anti-VEGF therapies for cancer. To expand our understanding of this VEGF-independent EC proliferation, we aim to characterize the cell surface proteome from tumor-conditioned ECs using cell surface mass spectrometry. We will validate hits from this study using our <i>in vitro <\/i>model and translate these findings to <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse models. We expect that our current and future research will reveal new insights into tumor co-option of the vascular system and identify novel targets for developing therapies to effectively treat cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-02 Host-tumor interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,Blood vessel co-option,Endothelial cells,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kevin L.

Despite improving survival in only a small percentage of patients, bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody toward vascular endothelial growth factor-A, is frequently used to treat recurrent-GBM. To find predictors of poor-response to bevacizumab, we performed RNA-sequencing on multiple GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors after orthotopic propagation in athymic nude mice. The study was repeated, and once PDX-tumors were established, mice were treated with bevacizumab and grouped based on survival. Bioinformatic-analysis of RNA-sequencing data demonstrated differential gene expression in tumors that were poor-responders to bevacizumab (no survival change) as compared to tumors that were good-responders (longer survival), along with upregulation of an angiogenesis gene set in poor-responders. Within this gene set, multiple genes known to be regulated by the early growth response 1 (<i>EGR1<\/i>) transcription factor were identified; <i>CHRNA7<\/i> (cholinergic-receptor-nicotinic-&#945;7-subunit) was selected for further study based on the reported role in promoting cancer cell migration and proliferation. Results were validated at the protein level using immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, Sry-box transcription factor-10 (<i>SOX10<\/i>) showed upregulation in poor-responders, potentially driven by impaired proteosome degradation. <i>SOX10<\/i> is known to promote mural-cell coverage of neovasculature, cancer cell migration, and glioma development when cooperating with platelet-derived growth factor-B (<i>PDGFB<\/i>). In summary, GBM PDX-tumors with upregulated expression of an angiogenesis gene set and of two transcriptional regulators (<i>EGR1<\/i> and <i>SOX10<\/i>) demonstrated a poor response to bevacizumab; upregulation of these genes could be used to predict bevacizumab response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bevacizumab,Glioblastoma multiforme,Angiogenesis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Roshan Lodha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gaelle Muller-Greven<sup><\/sup>, Lydia Guo<sup><\/sup>, Candece Gladson<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"08b348e1-8202-4f9a-9803-1ea4aa04a4cc","ControlNumber":"6107","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Intriguingly, ADC and SCC exhibit distinct responses to the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib and other antiangiogenic drugs, suggesting that angiogenesis may depend on the histologic subtype in lung cancer. In addition, tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) are known regulators of angiogenesis, and we have recently reported that TAFs exhibit enhanced fibrosis and response to nintedanib in ADC compared to SCC, owing to the stronger epigenetic repression of SMAD3 in SCC-TAFs caused by excessive exposure to cigarette smoke particles. However, how the histotype-dependent fibrotic phenotype in TAFs impacts their pro-angiogenic functions remains unknown.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A panel of angiogenesis markers was assessed in patient samples using publicly available databases. The pro-angiogenic function of the conditioned medium of TAFs from ADC and SCC patients pre-activated with TGF-&#946;1 was analyzed <i>in vitro<\/i> using migration and network formation assays of endothelial cells. The secretion of pro-angiogenic factors in TGF-&#946;1-activated TAFs was analyzed using an angiogenesis antibody blot array. Selected factors were functionally validated <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> using genetic models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> All angiogenesis markers were consistently upregulated in ADC compared to SCC concomitantly with a lower necrosis in ADC, unveiling a larger angiogenesis in ADC. We also observed that the conditioned medium of TGF-&#946;1-activated TAFs elicited a larger endothelial cell network formation and migration in ADC than SCC, revealing that ADC-TAFs exhibit enhanced angiogenesis. Our immunoblot array analysis identified a subset of pro-angiogenic factors that were selectively overexpressed in ADC-TAFs compared to SCC-TAFs, including TIMP-1. Notably, TIMP-1 overexpression in ADC-TAFs was SMAD3-dependent and knocking down TIMP-1 by siRNA in ADC-TAFs impaired angiogenesis <i>in vitro<\/i> and in tumor xenografts <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our results reveal a larger angiogenesis in ADC compared to SCC, and implicate the TGF-&#946;1\/SMAD3\/TIMP-1 pathway in the enhanced angiogenesis of ADC-TAFs. Our findings identify a biological process underlying the poor response of SCC to antiangiogenic therapies like nintedanib, and provide a rationale for the earlier metastasis of ADC patients compared to SCC patients based on the enhanced pro-angiogenic role of ADC-TAFs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Tumor microcirculation and the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenic factors,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,TIMP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Natalia Isabel Diaz Valdivia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Paula Duch<sup>1<\/sup>, Rafael Ikemori<sup>1<\/sup>, Eduard Monso<sup>2<\/sup>, Noemi Reguart<sup>3<\/sup>, Jordi Alcaraz<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Unit of Biophysics and Bioengineering, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>CIBERES, Hospital Parc Taulí de Sabadell, Sabadell, Spain,<sup>3<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5e0e93b8-5ed8-4bab-b471-6dabbfe86276","ControlNumber":"4876","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

However, its effect in preventing cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis is not yet clearly understood. It is known that angiogenesis plays a significant role in the growth and spread of many cancers but the role of benfotiamine in neovascularization is not yet known. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that benfotiamine would prevent VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. To examine this, we have treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; 10 ng\/ml) in the absence and presence of benfotiamine (0-100 uM) in a time and dose-dependent manner. We then examined the cell viability by MTT assay and apoptosis by Annexin-V staining and found that benfotiamine alone had minimal effect on cell viability and it prevents VEGF-induced cell proliferation. In vitro angiogenesis assay indicates that benfotiamine prevented the VEGF -induced tube formation of HUVECs. Further, benfotiamine regulated the expression of VEGF-induced growth factors such as VEGF, PIGF, IGFBP-1, ECGF, FGF-1 and 2, anti-angiogenic enzymes such as Serpin E1, TIMP-1, MMP-8, TSP-1, PTX3 and uPA and cytokines such as IL-8, Prolactin, ET-1, Endostatin, and CCL3. We will next examine how benfotiamine prevents in vivo angiogenesis by utilizing a rat Matrigel plug model of angiogenesis in rats. The Matrigel sections will be stained with CD36, vWF, and other angiogenic markers to visualize the effect of benfotiamine on VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In conclusion, our current results indicate that benfotiamine has anti-angiogenic potential via inhibition of various pro-angiogenic growth factors and promoting anti-angiogenic factors in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our studies demonstrate that benfotiamine could be further developed as a novel therapeutic agent to prevent cancer growth and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,Antiangiogenic agents,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),Chemopreventive agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kieran  V.

To reduce tumor IFP, researchers tried to decrease solid stress and normalize hyperpermeable blood vessels (BV) in tumors, but how lymphatic vessels (LV) are impaired in the tumor microenvironment is poorly understood. Several studies reported that vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) treatment defeated tumors by promoting lymphangiogenesis and boosting T cell recruitment, while it has also been recognized to promote lymph node metastasis. Given the controversial roles of VEGFC, the main goals of this study are to control LV permeability and promote drainage by identifying currently unappreciated roles of rho-associated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ROCK1\/2) in regulating lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) contractility, junctions, and drainage in tumors. We will have blood endothelial cells (BEC) as controls to understand how ROCK1\/2 and cell contractility affect LEC\/BEC junctions and permeability differently. Here, we created a three-dimensional (3D) bioengineered model of vascularized pancreatic and breast tumors to study vessel junctions, permeability, and IFP formation. The device consisted of a LEC or BEC lined, perfusable channel and a tumor-filled ECM chamber. We observed impaired barrier function of tumor BV\/LV with increased permeability and loss of tight junctions compared to healthy vessels. To quantify the contractility of LEC\/BEC, we employed traction force microscopy (TFM) by creating a 2D biomimicry of the endothelial monolayers using micropatterned polyacrylamide gel substrates with tunable stiffness. Using TFM, we showed that the combination of tumor-secreted factors and elevated matrix stiffness increased the traction of LEC\/BEC, resulting in their loss of tight junctions. Using Rho kinase blockade to inhibit ROCK1\/2 reduced the contractility of endothelial cells, reconstructed vessel structural integrity and functionality, and reduced intratumoral IFP in animal models. We expect that a decrease in the tumor IFP due to the restoration of lymphatic drainage would increase T cell infiltration, suppress tumor growth, and improve the survival of tumor-bearing mice combined with the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy in our future studies. Together, our study provides new insights into understanding the physical interaction of endothelial, tumor, and immune cells, evidence of rho-kinases as a target for cancer immunotherapy, as well as a promising way to increase the efficacy of immunotherapies in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Tumor microcirculation and the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Endothelial cells,Tumor lymphatics,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yansong Peng<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Esak Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nancy E. and Peter C.

Women with TNBC, who constitute 15-20% of breast cancer patients, are often diagnosed with aggressive\/metastatic disease. Advanced studies implicated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in aggressive\/metastatic properties of TNBC subtype. Alternatively activated immature myeloid cells including tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN), tumor-associated dendritic cells (TADC) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) constitute a major component of TME. However, anti-tumorigenic microenvironment is also reported and that may have clinical relevance in early TNBC patients. Therefore, our hypothesis is that myeloid cells polarize to become immunosuppressive and infiltrate tumors and pre-metastatic niches in patients with advanced disease, while patients with early TNBCs may elicit anti-tumor immune response eliminating disseminated tumor cells (DTC). The utilization of syngeneic immunocompetent mouse models has contributed to our current understanding of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory TME. Using these models, we have demonstrated that tumor dissemination and growth at metastatic sites is facilitated by MDSC&#8217;s. Emerging technologies; single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), mass cytometry (CyTOF) or cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing (CITE-Seq) has been powerful platforms for detailed characterization of tumors and TME compartments. We performed scRNA-Seq and CyTOF analyses of the myeloid cell populations of tumors and spleens from metastatic 4T1 and non-invasive EMT6 tumor-bearing mice. Tumors and spleens from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice exhibited a marked expansion of myeloid cell subsets that are characterized by the expression of immunosuppressive as well as progenitor markers. On the contrary, indicated tissues from EMT6 mice were enriched in NK cells, T and B lymphocytes and they were lacking immunosuppressive myeloid cell subsets. Furthermore, we identified a distinct differentiation pattern of immature myeloid cell subsets from neutrophil progenitors (NP) in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Using the murine TNBC models in syngeneic mice, we provide evidence that early TNBC tumors may elicit anti-tumor immune responses and thus the survival outcome in those patients is substantially increased after complete surgical resection of the primary tumors. Whereas immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributes to the poor overall survival in patients with advanced TNBCs. Therefore, identifying an anti-tumor immune signature in early TNBC patients may be utilized as a clinical biomarker before surgical intervention as well as improve the survival outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-02 Host-tumor interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor metastases,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hasan Korkaya<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Elayne Benson<sup><\/sup>, Fulya Koksalar Alkan<sup><\/sup>, Justin Wilson<sup><\/sup>, Tulshi Patel<sup><\/sup>, Hilmi K.

Herein, we conducted a retrospective cohort study that comprised 106 CRCLM patients to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the HGPs of the tumours and the 5-year overall survival (OS). Interestingly, we found an inverse correlation between vitamin D supplementation and the presence of RHGP tumours in CRCLM patients. Additionally, the population who used vitamin D supplementation had significantly better 5-year OS. Moreover, our in vivo results suggested that vitamin D supplementation significantly improves the response of CRCLM tumours to anti-angiogenic therapy. Mechanistically, we found that vitamin D can suppress cancer cell motility, which is essential for the development of vessel co-option tumours and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. Collectively, this study suggests vitamin D supplementation is a promising way to attenuate resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy and improve the prognosis of CRCLM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-04 Novel pro- and antiangiogenic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vitamin D3,Metastatic tumors,Antiangiogenic therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miran Rada<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lucyna Krzywon<sup><\/sup>, Audrey Kapelanski-Lamoureux<sup><\/sup>, Stephanie Petrillo<sup><\/sup>, Anthoula Lazaris<sup><\/sup>, Peter Metrakos<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"96a6658d-5d94-421e-945e-d2fccbc8c781","ControlNumber":"5746","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Cancer development is a multi-step process in which transforming cells gradually gain malignant properties through a series of oncogenic genetic alterations. Successful cancer progression also depends on the remodeling of the surrounding stroma, which feeds the cancer cells in a host-parasite interaction. Tumor angiogenesis, the process of blood vessel formation, is an essential feature of solid tumors that ensures that they have the needed supply of food and oxygen to sustain their proliferative growth. We previously demonstrated that nicotine, an addictive component of tobacco smoke, promoted tumor angiogenesis by impacting the growth of endothelial cells. In the present work, we examined the differences in tumor vasculature between smoker and non-smoker patients to find clinical support for our laboratory findings. After searching the available tumor cases in the repository for the patient&#8217;s smoking history, I selected 27 smokers (12 lung and 15 prostate adenocarcinomas) and 19 non-smokers (4 lung and 15 prostate adenocarcinomas) cases. The tissue blocks were sectioned and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry using an antibody against CD31, a biomarker for endothelial cells. Following digital scanning, all slides were reviewed to identify tumor areas and CD31<sup>+<\/sup> tubular structures (blood vessels). We observed that lung and prostate tumor tissues from smoker patients had a significantly higher number of blood vessels than those from non-smoker patients. Thus, increased tumor vascularization appears to be a common feature of smoking cancer patients providing clinical support for a novel mechanism by which smoking may contribute to tumor pathobiology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Tumor microcirculation and the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,Smoking,Prostate cancer,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shubhangi Singh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mohammad Aslam Khan<sup>2<\/sup>, Elba  T.

As the tumor grows, they secrete ligands such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, anti-tumor effect could be achieved by preventing tumor-associated angiogenesis. In previous reports, CDK4\/6 has been acknowledged to regulate VEGF transcription in addition to cell cycle regulation. There are few studies explaining the angiogenesis-related effects of CDK4\/6 inhibitors in gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we aim to verify the anti-angiogenesis effect through CDK4\/6 inhibition. First, we confirmed proliferation and angiogenesis in endothelial cells. Next, the change in VEGF expression induced by CDK4\/6 inhibitor in GC cell lines was investigated. <i>In-vitro<\/i> angiogenesis research was conducted using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Abemaciclib was used as a CDK4\/6 inhibitor. To determine the efficacy of abemaciclib, HUVEC was treated with abemaciclib for 3 days and cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay. IC<sub>50<\/sub> value was determined by the CalcuSyn software. Furthermore, tube formation assay, wound healing assay, cell cycle analysis and SA-&#946;-gal assay were performed to explore effect of abemaciclib on HUVEC. VEGF-A expression was evaluated by ELISA. First, we identified direct anti-angiogenesis effect of abemaciclib on HUVEC. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> value was 1.28 &#956;M. At clinically achievable concentrations of abemaciclib (Cmax, 0.5 &#956;M), HUVEC only showed a 20% growth inhibition. Abemaciclib did not suppress tube formation and migratory potential of HUVECs. However, abemaciclib induced a G1 arrest in HUVEC after 0.5 &#956;M abemaciclib treatment for 24hr. To ensure whether the increase in the number of G1 phase cells is due to senescence, SA-&#946;-gal assay was performed. The levels of SA-&#946;-gal-positive cell staining in abemaciclib-treated group were higher than control, suggesting that abemaciclib induced cell senescence on HUVEC. While our results suggested that CDK4\/6 inhibitor did not show direct anti-angiogenic effect on endothelial cells, we studied indirect anti-angiogenesis effect of abemaciclib in GC cell lines through regulation of VEGF transcription. Conditioned media of 49 GC cell lines had a wide range of VEGF secretion ranged from 0.146 to 22.676 ng\/mL. (ave. 4.07 ng\/mL). We have set the cut off of secreted VEGF as 10 ng\/mL, at which angiogenesis can be induced. There were four cell lines (4\/49, 8.2%) whose VEGF concentrations were more than the angiogenesis-inducing VEGF concentration (10 ng\/mL). Interestingly, 3 of these 4 GC cell lines demonstrated a decrease in VEGF secretion, following 0.5 &#956;M abemaciclib treatment. In conclusion, we did not observe inhibition of angiogenesis in HUVEC. However, CDK4\/6 inhibition can cause senescence in HUVEC, inhibit tumor growth, and indirectly induce anti-angiogenic effects in gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antiangiogenesis,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sang Woo Cho<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Woo Sun Kwon<sup>2<\/sup>, Tae Soo Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Juin Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Eun Seo Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyun Cheol Chung<sup>3<\/sup>, Sun Young Rha<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"77280fb4-6604-40dc-96eb-d7f795e56fd9","ControlNumber":"6002","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

At present, NASH is a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma cancer (HCC) and liver transplant within the United States. Pathological angiogenesis of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) is one of the hallmarks of liver injury that disrupt normal LSEC physiology. Therefore, strategies which target factors involved in LSEC dysregulation may improve the progression of hepatic diseases. Examination of a human tissue microarray identified increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) in NASH livers compared with healthy individuals. Additionally, single nuclei RNA sequencing and immunofluorescent staining revealed that the receptors for VEGF-C, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, are primarily expressed by the LSECs. Using murine models of NASH, we further investigated the role of VEGF-C during disease progression. Chronic over expression of VEGF-C by adeno-associated viral (AAV) infection in mice fed a western diet with carbon tetrachloride injections increased NASH progression compared with control AAV infected NASH mice. Interestingly, overexpression of VEGF-C C156S, a variant of VEGF-C which exclusively binds to VEGFR3, resulted in significantly increased hepatic steatosis, but only minimal fibrosis. To determine whether blockade of VEGF-C signaling would delay disease progression, we administered lenvatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which primarily blocks VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 at low doses, to NASH mice. We discovered that low dose lenvatinib resulted in significantly decreased amount of fibrosis, steatosis, and tumor formation. Analysis of vehicle treated and lenvatinib treated livers by single nuclei RNA sequencing uncovered significant changes in endothelial cell genes associated with extracellular interactions and inflammation, as well as hepatocyte genes involved in lipid synthesis and metabolism. Taken together, these findings indicate that chronic VEGF-C production in NASH plays a role in promoting liver fibrosis and steatosis as well as HCC development, and that blockade of the downstream receptors for VEGF-C, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, may be a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 Angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver,Liver cancer,Angiogenesis inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seock-Won Youn<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jason W.-L.

In contrast, luminal MCF7 or ZR75-1 cells display approximately 70% apoptosis when treated with TNF&#945;. Overexpression of A20 in luminal cells not only protected them from TNF&#945;-induced cytotoxicity by upregulating HSP70 and EMT\/CSC phenotype, but also exhibited aggressive metastatic properties in mouse xenograft models.<br \/>We determined that TNF&#945;-induced HSP70 upregulation in TNBC cell lines was dependent on A20 de-ubiquitinase activity that protected its degradation. Interestingly, our preliminary findings also suggested that A20 protein upregulation may be dependent on HSP70 chaperone activity. We show significant overexpression of HSP70 and A20 proteins in 4T1 cell line when treated with TNF&#945; or chemotherapeutic agents. However, A20 expression is significantly reduced when we block HSP70 activity in cells treated with TNF&#945; or chemotherapeutic agents (Docetaxel-DTX or Doxorubicin-DOX). We proposed that A20 transcriptional upregulation upon TNF&#945; stimulation leads to suppression of E3-ligase and accumulation of HSP70 which then stabilizes A20 with chaperone activity. Based on our reasoning, we performed the LIMBO chaperone binding assay which predicted A20 being the potential HSP70 client protein.<br \/>Furthermore, we show that A20\/HSP70 pathway attracts tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) while inducing the accumulation of immunosuppressive MDSCs in syngeneic mouse models. Interestingly, pulmonary DTCs as well as the immune infiltrates from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice exhibited significantly higher HSP70 expression. Therefore, targeting HSP70 will have a dual activity on tumors and MDSCs and thus it may potentiate the efficacy of immunotherapy in preclinical models of breast cancer. As previously reported, murine 4T1 tumors fail to respond to check point inhibitors. We reasoned that this may be an appropriate model to test the efficacy of HSP70 inhibitor, JG-231. Expectedly, there was no difference in tumor growth and metastasis between control and anti-PDL1 treated animals, however, combination of anti-PDL1 antibody with JG-231 and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide-CTX) significantly reduced primary tumor growth (&#62;10 fold) and eliminated metastasis. Collectively, our pilot experiments provide a strong rationale for testing our hypothesis and may lead to a rapid translation into the clinical utility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-02 Host-tumor interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,Heat shock proteins,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fulya Koksalar Alkan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Justin Wilson<sup>1<\/sup>, Elayne Benson<sup>1<\/sup>, Tulshi Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Virginia McEvoy<sup>1<\/sup>, Nate Francois<sup>1<\/sup>, Emma Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Hilmi Kaan Alkan<sup>1<\/sup>, Ahmed Chadli<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Gestwicki<sup>2<\/sup>, Hasan Korkaya<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Augusta University, Augusta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0e186dab-dc16-4518-a95f-e505438a1bf1","ControlNumber":"6206","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

TNBC constitutes 10-20% of all breast cancer and has a higher rate of distal recurrence and a poorer prognosis than other breast cancer subtypes. Less than 30% of women with metastatic TNBC survive 5 years and almost all die from their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Angiogenesis is a critical factor in the development of tumors and metastases in numerous cancers. Clinical trials with anti-angiogenic drugs showed to be inadequate, with moderate response rates and insignificant survival gains for patients. To understand the genetic forces involved in TNBC, we performed a transposon mutagenesis screen in Pten mutant mice that identified several candidate trunk drivers and progression genes. A major finding of our screen was the discovery and functional validation of, Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1), a GATA-like transcription factor, which functions as a transcriptional repressor or activator, depending on cell type, stage of development, or pathological conditions. Based on this data, we explored the role of TRPS1 in angiogenesis.<br \/><b>Methods and Results.<\/b> Tube formation and sprouting assays were performed using overexpression and inactivation of TRPS1 in MDA-MD-231 and HCC70 cells, respectively. Interestingly, inactivation of TRPS1 expression accelerates tube formation structures compared to the vector control as well as cell branching in the sprouting assay. Overexpression of TRPS1 prevents tubing and branching formation in vitro assays. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining of CD31 detected a reduced number of blood vessels in MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts overexpressing TRPS1, and an increase of angiogenic vasculature in HCC70 TRPS1-shRNA tumor xenografts. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate the role of TRPS1 in tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, human ChIP qPCR angiogenesis array identified 10 top candidate genes potentially regulated by TRPS1 transcription factor. Of these candidates, JAG1 and TYMP showed to have a higher fold enrichment compared to other angiogenic related genes. Finally, we validated its direct functional binding by using luciferase reporter assay, such demonstrated that TRPS1 is a direct transcriptional regulator of JAG1 and TYMP.<br \/><b>Conclusion.<\/b> TRPS1 is a tumor suppressor involved in the mechanisms regulating tumor angiogenesis by repressing the expression of JAG1 and TYMP genes in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liliana Guzman<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Breast Oncology, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c8f8880a-f741-4aa2-9df8-e966c371ba29","ControlNumber":"8117","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.
