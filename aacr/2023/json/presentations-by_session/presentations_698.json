[{"Abstract":"Here, we demonstrate a novel approach for generating affinity detuned cytokines that can be fused to antibodies for selective immune cell activation to improve anti-tumor responses and mitigate systemic toxicity. Although cytokine therapies have demonstrated curative effects in some cancer patients, clinical use remains limited with current toxicity profiles accompanying systemic administration. Next generation cytokine approaches include conditional signaling focused to sites of interest, including the tumor microenvironment or specific immune cell populations. In this presentation, we share a novel approach for generating detuned cytokine therapeutic candidates using the <i>AlphaSeq<\/i> platform, which involves the repurposing of yeast agglutination and mating to quantitatively measure protein-protein interactions at a library-on-library scale. We show, for the first time, how <i>AlphaSeq<\/i> can be used to measure interactions between cytokines and their receptors as well as generate engineered cytokines with a broad range of affinities. A saturated mutational library was created for a cytokine of interest and subsequently screened against a second library consisting of axis receptor chains, their species orthologs and off-target receptors. Cytokine variants with lower affinity than parental were recombinantly expressed as Fc fusion proteins to orthogonally measure affinity with biolayer interferometry and characterize potency with an <i>in vitro<\/i> human PBMC phosflow assay. Finally, detuned cytokine candidates were fused to antibodies recognizing surface antigens of interest to demonstrate cell population-specific signaling. Our results show the <i>AlphaSeq<\/i> platform can accurately quantitate thousands of cytokine variant affinities simultaneously against multiple relevant receptors which translates to signaling potency in primary human cells. When engineered as antibody fusion proteins, candidate immunocytokines are identified that only induce signaling in intended cell populations. <i>AlphaSeq&#8217;s<\/i> rapid, comprehensive affinity determination can be utilized to develop a portfolio of clinically relevant therapeutic immunocytokines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Immunotherapy,Protein-protein interactions,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan Swanson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Davis Goodnight<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeff Adamo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyle Minch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emily Engelhart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Randolph Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Younger<\/i><\/presenter>.

We therefore sought to determine the combined effects of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor WP1066 and the STING agonist IACS-8803 in a preclinical model of glioma.<br \/>Experimental Design: C57BL\/6 mice (n=9-10\/group) with orthotopically engrafted GL261 cells were treated orally with WP1066, a blood-brain-barrier penetrant inhibitor of STAT3, in combination with the STING agonist IACS-8803 administered directly into the tumor. Analysis of treatment effects included immunoblots, ubiquitination, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and NanoString immune phenotyping of glioma-infiltrating immune cells.<br \/>Results: The STING agonist 8803 at 2.5&#181;g\/mouse, in combination with WP1066 dosed at 30mg\/kg with a 12-hour delay, increased animal subject median survival (MS) to 58 days, in contrast to monotherapy (WP1066=25 days, 8803=29 days) or control (25 days) (p=0.002 of combo relative to all other groups). Dose escalation of WP1066 to 60 mg\/kg, administered simultaneously with 8803, completely abrogated the therapeutic combinatorial effect. Five ubiquitin-binding domains were predicted on STING using the UbPred program; concentrations of 5&#181;M or higher of WP1066 induced polyubiquitination of phosphorylated STING. Immune profiling during the therapeutic window demonstrated a multi-pathway induction of anti-tumor immunity.<br \/>Conclusions: Co-administration of a reduced effective dose of WP1066 is necessary with STING agonist 8803 to effectively enhance the anti-glioma immune reactivity in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Immunomodulation,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hinda Najem<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shashwat Tripathi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moloud Sooreshjani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Hurley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corey Dussold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Arrieta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Ott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Wei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Curran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anantha Marisetty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Waldemar Priebe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leondias C.

IL-12 can activates both innate and adaptive immunity to elicit strong antitumor immunity. Nevertheless, the poor pharmacokinetic and severe side effects of IL-12 limit the application. We have recently developed pH-sensitive polymeric micelles loading IL-12 (IL-12\/m) that can selective activate in tumor tissues to invigorate immunotherapy and enhance efficacy. Herein, we elucidated the mechanisms behind the enhanced efficacy of IL-12\/m and their ability to synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).<br \/>Methods: To determine the contribution of the immune cells on the efficacy on IL-12\/m, mice bearing orthotopic 4T1 tumor models were treated with anti-CD4 (for depleting CD4+ cells), anti-CD8 (for depleting CD8+ cells), anti-asialo GM1 (for depleting NK cells). The tumor volume was tracked after treatment with IL-12\/m. The immune status of the tumors was studied by histology, flow cytometry and RNA-seq after treatment with free IL-12, IL-12\/m and their combination with ICIs. The efficacy of the treatments was assessed by following the tumor growth and mice survival.<br \/>Results: IL-12 can promote the growth and function of T cells to initiate the enhanced anti-tumoral immune reactions. Flow cytometry analysis IL-12\/m significantly enhanced tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells compared to free IL-12. The immune cell depletion study revealed that the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ T cells and NK cells significantly lessen efficacy of IL-12\/m, which is consistent with the biological function of IL-12. The depletion experiment suggests CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are the most important fraction for IL-12\/m efficacy. Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis of 4T1 revealed IL-12\/m promoted high infiltration of CD8+ cells and the upregulation of Granzyme B in CD8 + Cells. IL-12\/m also increased PD-L1 levels in tumors. The effects of IL-12\/m on the TME was further investigated as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies. The combination of IL-12\/m with anti-PD-1antibodies presented high CD45+ cells in tumors. Lymphoid cells and T cells were upregulated by IL-12 and the anti-PD-1 antibody combination. The general CD4+ T cells also showed upregulation in the IL-12\/m treated groups. While anti-PD-1 monotherapy did not show any suppression on Tregs in the tumor model, the combination of IL-12\/m plus anti-PD-1 depleted Tregs. Moreover, IL-12\/m increase the presence of Th cells. We then investigated the activation by transcriptome analysis. The heatmap of global gene expression indicated differentiated gene profiles. GOBP and KEGG analysis showed that IL-12\/m upregulated the stimulation of proliferation, differentiation and activation of various effector immune cells, differentiation of T cells into Th cells, and T cell activation and T cell receptor signaling pathway. The enhanced the intratumoral immunity of IL-12\/m plus ICIs allowed eradicating 4T1 tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Systemically injected IL-12\/m ensured strong stimulation of antitumor immunity leading to high safety and strong therapeutic outcomes in cold tumor models. The enhanced immune response of IL-12 synergize with checkpoint blockade to eradicate cold tumors. The approach has potential for developing safer and more effective immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunostimulation,Cytokines,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Horacio Cabral<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pengwen Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koji Nagaoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takuya Miyazaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazunori Kataoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuhiro Kakimi<\/i><\/presenter>.

CBL-B depletion enhances the production of IFN&#947; and the cytotoxicity of activated NK cells. Similar to the effect of depleting CD8 T cells in mice, depletion of NK cells abolishes the tumor growth delay observed in Cbl-b-\/- mice. With emerging data supporting the potential role of exogenous NK cells in anti-tumor immunity, inhibition of CBL-B represents a promising approach to enhance both adaptive and innate immunity for cancer immunotherapy. Using one of our small molecules, allosteric CBL-B inhibitors, HOT-A, we demonstrated that CBL-B inhibition enhanced NK activation, IFN&#947; production and granzyme B secretion in response to the various stimulation conditions, including cytokines (such as IL-15 and IL12 + IL-18) and stimulatory receptors (such as NKp30 and NKG2D + CD244). NK cell proliferation was also enhanced in the presence of HOT-A. Single cell analysis further suggested that HOT-A increased NK polyfunctional cytokine expression during IL-12 + IL-18 activation. In a coculture system of NK cells and K562 target cells, HOT-A dose-dependently promoted primary human NK cell activation, cytokine production and cytotoxicity in the K562 cells. In the <i>in vivo<\/i> CT-26 tumor model, granzyme B+ NK cells in the TIL were significantly increased in the HOT-A treated tumor bearing mice and NK function gene signature was also increased by Nanostring analysis, suggesting an enhanced NK function in the tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the pre-clinical data presented here demonstrate that our CBL-B inhibitor enhances NK cell function <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo,<\/i> suggesting that its enhancement of anti-tumor immunity may be driven through both effector T cell and NK cell-driven biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,CBL-B,Natural killer cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yilin Qi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Kuai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yingzhi Bi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Greco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samira Jaeger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken Carson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hadi Danaee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Reilly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geraldine Harriman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

STAR0602, a molecule that selectively targets T cells expressing V&#946;6 and V&#946;10 TCRs and delivers IL-2R co-stimulation, activates and expands human V&#946;6 and V&#946;10 T cells that are enriched in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) relative to other V&#946; subsets. Using this molecular design, STAR0602 and molecules targeting other V&#946; T cell subsets simultaneously engage a novel, non-clonal mode of TCR activation with cytokine co-stimulation.<br \/>Methods: The effects of STAR0602 on activation and expansion of primary human T cells were assessed in vitro by flow cytometry, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence, TCRseq, and NanoString. Several murine surrogate molecules targeting different V&#946; T cell subsets with a range of baseline frequencies were tested in murine syngeneic tumor models. Tumors were excised for phenotyping of TILs including tetramer staining of antigen specific T cells using flow cytometry, and scRNAseq\/TCRseq.<br \/>Results: In vitro, STAR0602 induced TCR signaling and IL-2R pathway activation in human T cells that preceded expansion of V&#946;6\/V&#946;10 T cells that acquired an atypical central memory T cell (T<sub>CM<\/sub>) phenotype. Across PD1-refractory syngeneic murine tumor models, monotherapy with fusion molecules targeting different V&#946; TCR and delivering IL-2R co-stimulation induced potent anti-tumor activity that was associated with expansion and accumulation of targeted V&#946; T cell subsets in blood and tumors. In vivo anti-tumor activity was dependent on the accumulation of effector memory T or T<sub>CM<\/sub> V&#946; T cells expressing a novel effector gene signature. Additional analysis of TILs showed increased clonality in <i>de novo<\/i> expanded V&#946; T cells compared to controls in addition to increased numbers of tumor-specific T cells.<br \/>Conclusions: To our knowledge, the use of therapeutic antibodies to selectively target and expand V&#946; T cell subsets and thereby modulate the germline TCR repertoire for therapeutic benefit is novel. Here we show that STAR0602 selectively binds and activates human V&#946;6\/V&#946;10 T cells and promotes a novel T<sub>CM<\/sub> phenotype. Murine surrogate molecules targeting different V&#946; T cell subsets demonstrated potent and durable single-agent anti-tumor activity even when targeting low frequency V&#946; subsets. These expanded V&#946; T cells appear to drive enhanced anti-tumor activity due to their increased effector potentials, novel memory phenotype, and a striking enrichment in clonal diversity. In summary, STAR0602 and similar V&#946; TCR-targeting constructs have the potential to remodel the adaptive immune response to solid tumors that are refractory to anti-PD1 therapy. A Phase 1\/2 clinical trial of STAR0602 is ongoing in patients with advanced metastatic cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunostimulation,TCR,PD-1 refractory,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jacques Moisan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Madan Katraggada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Lowry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roya Servattalab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gurkan Guntas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raj Chopra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhen Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Bayliffe<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, innate and adaptive resistance in patients with DNA damage repair (DDR) gene mutations were reported after treatment with PARPi, highlighting the potential implication of other compartments such as the role of immune cells in the mechanism of resistance. Importantly, PARPi is shown to have an immune-modulatory capacity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) by activating the STING pathway and increasing interferon gamma (INF-gamma) and chemokine secretion and hence increasing the recruitment and function of CD8 T cells. In addition, PARPi is shown to affect other cells within the TME such as, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promoting either an immune enhancement or immune suppressor milieu that could indirectly affect CD8 T cell function. However, little is known about the direct effect of PARPi on CD8 T cells. In this study using two cold tumor models, we show that PARPi controls the tumor growth and increases survival in tumor-bearing mice. This effect is due to the enhancement of number and cytotoxicity of antigen-specific CD8 T cells and the maintenance of memory population within the TME. <i>In vitro <\/i>study shows that PARPi activates the SIRT-1\/ FOXO1 pathway, leading to the modification of gene expression related to memory and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) metabolism in CD8 T cells. As a result, a unique subpopulation of superior central memory cells with high recall responses and anti-tumor effects are generated after PARPi treatment. Interestingly this unique subpopulation was also generated after PARPi in human cells. Together, our findings highlight the direct effect of PARP inhibition on CD8 T cells and its ability to modulate and reprogram CD8 T cells within the TME, leading to a greater anti-tumor immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Tumor microenvironment,T cell,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wael Traboulsi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhadip Kundu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pankaj Gaur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zainab Ramlaoui<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dareen Sarhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nour Shobaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacob Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nazli Jafarzadeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon T.

However, many screening workflows are still performed in cancer cell lines and coupled to simplistic read-outs such as cellular fitness. At Myllia Biotechnology, we combine CRISPR screening with single-cell RNA sequencing, leveraging two transformative technologies to enable genetic screening for complex phenotypes. We utilize the CRISPR screening workflow to map the impact of thousands of genetic perturbations on the global transcriptome at single-cell resolution. Our powerful approach has broad applications in identifying novel drug targets or elucidating unknown mechanisms of actions of drugs.<br \/>Primary human T cells are currently of great interest in the scientific community. They are not only key players in autoimmunity and other inflammatory diseases, but also represent attractive targets for immunotherapy of cancer. To enable the discovery of novel targets, we built a workflow that utilizes CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and allows functional genomic screens in these cells. Upon activation, na&#239;ve CD4+ T cells proliferate and differentiate into specific T helper cell subsets, such as Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells. Here, we present data of an experiment in which we screened for regulators of T helper cell differentiation and skewed cells towards the Th2 subset. We aimed to identify genes whose knockout boosts or attenuates the ability of primary na&#239;ve CD4+ T cells to become Th2 cells. Th2 cells support the humoral immune response, and their dysfunction has been linked to inflammatory diseases, including asthma.<br \/>In our screen, the different T cell subsets could be captured using curated transcriptomic signatures. Importantly, several gene KOs introduced in a pooled fashion using CRISPR\/Cas9 accumulated in distinct subpopulations, suggesting that these genes regulate the differentiation of na&#239;ve T cells into the various T helper cell subsets.<br \/>Overall, our pooled screening approach in primary human T cells allows for novel insights in the plasticity of T cells and identifies genes that could serve as drug targets in autoimmunity, inflammation and immuno-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,T lymphocytes,Differentiation,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Anke Loregger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johanna Irnstorfer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Untermoser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nikola Vinko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Krejci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Henrik Schmidt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tilmann Bürckstümmer<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cancer rates are rising for several obesity-related cancers, such as liver, pancreatic, thyroid, and uterine, as well as for colorectal cancer in patients under 55. Preclinical studies for new cancer drugs are often performed in models of cancer that are hosted in mice that are metabolically healthy and of normal weight. To establish models of cancer in hosts that are more reflective of the clinical population, we established the tumor growth kinetics of commonly used murine models of cancer in diet induced obese (DIO) mice. Syngeneic tumor models, MC38 and Hepa1-6, implanted in 18-week-old DIO C57BL6 mice showed accelerated tumor growth when compared to the growth rate in age-match control C57BL6 mice. We also studied the growth of three other C57BL\/6J syngeneic tumor models; MB49, TC-1 and PAN 02. Interestingly, pancreatic PAN 02 demonstrated slower growth in DIO mice compared to age matched controls. We then tested the response of anti-mPD-1 (&#945;PD-1) against MC38 syngeneic mouse tumor model comparing response of &#945;PD-1 in 18-week-old DIO mice versus age matched control diet (CD) mice. The &#945;PD-1 treatment showed a strong anti-tumor response (TGI=53%) against MC38 in DIO mice in contrast to no response (TGI=0%) in CD mice. Evaluation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on Day 13 revealed comparable numbers of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T Cells in 18-week-old DIO mice tumors compared to CD tumors. Treatment with &#945;PD-1 resulted in a statistically significant increase in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T Cells in DIO mouse tumors compared to CD tumors (p&#60;0.008). An increase in LAG3<sup>+<\/sup> cells were detected in &#945;PD-1 treated DIO tumors compared to CD (p&#60;0.05). A global metabolomics assessment of serum metabolites showed significant alterations in metabolites between CD and DIO mice. DIO &#945;PD-1 treated mice had 88 metabolites significantly altered compared to only 16 metabolites in CD &#945;PD-1 treated mice. Thirty-six metabolites increased after &#945;PD-1 treatment in DIO mice but were decreased after &#945;PD-1 treatment in CD mice. Amongst these 36 metabolites were alterations in the pentose phosphate pathway particularly with ribose 5-phospate and sedoheptulose 1-phosphate intermediates. DIO accelerated MC38 tumor growth and showed improved sensitivity to &#945;PD-1 treatment compared to CD in 18-week-old mice. The significant increase in LAG3<sup>+<\/sup> cells in the TME of DIO MC38 tumors treated with &#945;PD-1 could represent an opportunity for greater antitumor efficacy of &#945;PD-1treatment combined with anti-LAG3 in DIO mice. Use of syngeneic tumor models in DIO mice may provide improved models for identification and development of immunomodulatory, or other cancer therapeutics in a more metabolically challenged, clinically relevant system. These models could also permit the detection of novel circulating metabolites that could be targets for therapeutic development to improve treatment efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Immuno-oncology,Mouse models,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael Boice<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Whitney Tuoti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Logan Chesney<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie Murray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul M.

Complement signaling through cognate C3a receptor (C3aR) and C5a receptor (C5aR) modulate effector T cell stability, proliferation and differentiation. We have previously shown that complement C3 plays a mechanistic role in driving synergistic anti-tumor effects of blocking indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) during radiation and chemotherapy in a murine brain tumor model that expresses the gp100<sub>25-33<\/sub><sub> <\/sub>peptide antigen. We hypothesize that, when anti-tumor responses are allowed to happen, complement C3 production by local DCs acts as a costimulation factor, operating through C3aR and C5aR on the T cell surface to allow optimal T cell activation and proliferation. To study the role of complement C3 as a costimulation factor during T cell responses against a nominal tumor antigen (gp100<sub>25-33<\/sub> peptide, expressed by B16F10 melanoma), we used T cells from syngeneic pmel-1 mice (TCR transgenic with CD8 T cells that recognize the cross-presented gp100<sub>25-33<\/sub> peptide) co-cultured with gp100<sub>25-33<\/sub> peptide and dendritic cells from either wild-type (WT) or C3-defiecient (C3-KO) mice. In addition, we used <i>in vitro<\/i> culture conditions where gp100<sub>25-33<\/sub> tumor peptide was in stringent limited supply to model homeostatic conditions of the tumor microenvironment. We found that, when stimulated by DCs from C3-KO mice, pmel-1 CD8 T cells had decreased activation marker expression, proliferation, and cytokine effector function relative to stimulation by DCs from WT mice. Next, we bred pmel-1 mice onto a syngeneic background deficient in receptors for both C3a and C5a complement factors (C3aR-KO\/C5aR-KO double knock-out mice). We used CD8 T cells from the resulting mouse strain (pmel-1\/C3aR-KO\/C5aR-KO) co-cultured with WT DCs to study the role of complement signaling in T cells during responses to tumor antigen. Using the same stringent antigen conditions, CD8 T cells from the pmel-1\/C3aR-KO\/C5aR-KO mice had decreased activation marker expression and proliferation, and differences in cytokine function compared to CD8 T cells from the pmel-1 mice. These findings suggest that lack of local complement production by the DCs in the tumor microenvironment may inhibit anti-tumor immune responses, and that complement signaling through C3aR and C5aR on T cells may play an important role during such anti-tumor responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor antigen,Dendritic cells,Cytotoxic T cell,Local complement,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Caryn L.

PC is known to have a low mutation burden resulting in low level of neoantigens, so shared tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and translocations presumably represent a dominant source of antigens in this disease. While PC is thought to be a poorly immunogenic tumor, the frequency and breadth of tumor antigen reactivity in PC patients is unclear.<br \/>Methods: We utilized novel programmable immunogenic mRNA nanoparticle platform and created formulations encoding a range of full-length prostate TAAs (TAA<sub>mRNA<\/sub>) to systemically study T cell immune responses to across a range of TAAs in PC patients. We administered 8 PC TAA<sub>mRNAs<\/sub> (NY-ESO-1, HK2, STEAP1, TMPRSS2-ERG, PAP, PSA, PSCA and PSMA) to <i>in-vitro <\/i>cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 43 treatment-na&#239;ve localized PC patients compared to 17 age-matched non-cancer control patients. We assessed upregulation of early T cell activation markers and interferon-gamma (INFg) cytokine production through flow cytometry and ELISPOT, respectively.<br \/>Results: 20% of PC patients possessed TAA-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses to at least one antigen. NY-ESO-1, HK2 and TMPRSS2-ERG had the highest T cell recall responses at an average of 35%, with NY-ESO-1 demonstrating the strongest responses per patient. Of the patients that respond to any given TAA, 47% of patients responded to three or more antigens, with 11% of PC patients responding to all TAAs. PC patients also showed heightened production of IFNg, with 35% of patients showing pan-responsiveness to three or more antigens. Particularly, HK2 stimulated the highest levels of INFg production. These levels of responsiveness are not seen in the control cohort.<br \/>Conclusions: Encapsulated mRNA nanoparticles can be used to systematically map antigen reactivity across a cohort of cancer patients and reveal frequent pan-responsiveness to multiple TAAs in what has considered to be an immunologically cold cancer These results also reveal a hierarchy in immunogenicity of candidates that can enable future vaccine development. Continual efforts to assess the immunogenicity of shared PC TAAs in more advanced disease, and how patient responses to TAAs are modulated by immunotherapies, can aid in refining combinatorial therapies for PC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elena Montauti<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ole Haabeth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Rae<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Deutsch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lawrence Fong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Oh<\/i><\/presenter>.

Here, we reported that a subcutaneous 3D scaffold implant acted as a lung-mimicking dormant metastatic niche in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer, recruiting lung-tropic circulating tumor cells yet suppressing their growth through potent <i>in situ<\/i> antitumor immunity. We compared it with the immunosuppressive lungs developing lethal metastases and the dormant lungs suppressing tumor growth derived from breast cancer models with varying tumor aggressiveness and host immunity. Our data suggested that breast cancer-induced Gr1<sup>+<\/sup>CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup> granulocytic myeloid cells (neutrophils) infiltrated the scaffold implants and lungs, secreting the same signal to facilitate the metastatic seeding of lung-tropic cancer cells in these two types of niches. However, circulating neutrophils with opposing phenotypes and functions (N1 and N2) were selectively recruited and enriched in the dormant scaffolds\/lungs and immunosuppressive lungs, respectively, responding to two distinct groups of chemoattractants. N1 or N2 neutrophils established activated or suppressive immune environments in the metastatic niches, directing different fates of cancer cells. The clinical relevance of these scientific findings was validated by the strong positive correlation of a high N1-to-N2 neutrophil chemoattractant ratio with a low-grade primary tumor, a low metastases incidence, and a better prognosis in breast cancer patients. Overall, our study revealed the multifaceted roles of neutrophils in regulating lung metastasis and underscored the importance of N1 neutrophils in driving breast cancer metastatic dormancy in the lungs, inspiring next-generation immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Immune cells,Breast cancer,Chemokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramon Ocadiz-Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Hall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Bushnell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Orbach<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Decker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravi Raghani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yining Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Morris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacqueline Jeruss<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lonnie Shea<\/i><\/presenter>.

Average BMI was 31.4 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, and average baseline fiber intake was 17.8 g\/day (range 7.4-28.3 g\/day). Overall compliance was 88% (95% CI 83%-93%) with 45.8 g\/day fiber reached (range 40.0-50.0 g\/day). HFDI was well-tolerated with 1 participant experiencing grade 2 diarrhea and all other AEs were grade 1: diarrhea (40%), bloating (50%), flatulence (60%) and abdominal pain (10%). Exploratory analyses of global and targeted metabolomics showed increases in the short chain fatty acid acetate, shifts in omega-3\/6 PUFAs, and indole\/tryptophan metabolism.

Immunotherapeutics are designed to boost or harness the power of the immune system to prevent, control, or eliminate cancer; while many immune therapies have been found to be safe others have induced severe toxicities. For instance, even compounds that target the same molecule\/antigen can have dramatically differing safety profiles. Current preclinical models evaluating these therapies are underequipped to assess the safety of these compounds: <i>in vitro<\/i> assays fail to predict systemic responses and traditional animal models often fail to correlate with human responses. To better meet the needs of assessing preclinical toxicity we developed a PBMC-humanized mouse model to test a variety of therapeutics, including both monoclonal and bispecific antibodies and induce human cytokine release responses which can manifest within hours or days later resulting in tissue damage and lethality of the mice. To date we have tested a variety of therapeutics, including Blinatumomab, Rituximab, EGFRxCD3 BiTE, CAR-T, and others in our platform while evaluating the ability of the therapeutic to induce human cytokines, bodyweight loss, clinical symptom assessment, and survival in the context of toxicity alone or along with the evaluation with efficacy. We found that many of the therapeutics tested in our platform showed similarities to clinical data in humans. For example, urelumab and utomilumab are both fully humanized monoclonal antibodies against 4-1BB (CD137). However, during clinical trials, urelumab was shown to induce severe liver toxicities while utomilumab was well tolerated. In our huPBMC mouse model, we likewise showed that huPBMC mice dosed with 10 mpk of urelumab experienced body weight loss, showed liver necrosis, and met the clinical criteria for early euthanasia compared to mice treated with 10 mpk utomilumab and PBS treated controls. Serum levels of enzymes associated with liver damage: AST, ALT and GLDH were significantly higher in urelumab treated mice and terminal serum cytokine analysis revealed similarities with those found to be increased in urelumab clinical trials, including elevated IFN&#947;, IP-10, MIG, and MIP-1&#945; and MIP-1&#946;. Further, HuPBMC mice are also capable of detecting variability among donors. We have screened well over 60 human PBMC donors in huPBMC mice treated with OKT3 and &#945;CD28 and while we always see an increase in cytokines such as IFN&#947; - the range of induction varies greatly among donors. Further, we see PBMC-donor variability in body weight loss and survival rate after OKT3 and &#945;CD28 treatments. We demonstrate that the PBMC humanized mouse model shows clinical relevance. The use of these models for preclinical safety assessments has the potential to become an important part of novel immunotherapeutic development for patient safety and reducing drug development costs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Immunotherapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Destanie Rose<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Won Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guoxiang Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiwon Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingshan Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenqian He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernard Buetow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allison Vitsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bart Jessen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Keck<\/i><\/presenter>.

Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with both benign and malignant epithelial lesions. High-risk HPV subtypes are the causative agents of cervical and the majority of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Persistent HPV infection is required for HPV-associated tumorigenesis; however, cellular factors needed to support the viral persistence and HPV genes expression are not completely understood. Several transgenic mouse models, developed in last decades, helped tremendously to study HPV-induced carcinogenesis. However, the absence of HPV non-coding upstream regulatory region and late coding region, as well as targeted early genes expression driven by an artificial promoter - features that are shared by all existent HPV transgenic mice - limit our ability to investigate HPV-associated malignant transformation and the role of host factors in this process. Therefore, we generated HPV16 transgenic mouse by using CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated genome editing to insert the full-length HPV16 genome into the Rosa26 locus. Two founder mice, with single HPV copy and with tandem HPV integration, were used to establish mouse colonies. Interestingly, regardless of HPV copy number, ~30% of the HPV knock-in mice exhibited early death during the first 2 weeks after birth, while survived pups were significantly smaller than the same age wild-type mice, and had severe hair loss. Intriguingly, the growth retardant and hair loss phenotype in the HPV16 knock-in mice disappeared in ~4 weeks, most likely indicating that viral genes compromise specific stages of mouse development. We evaluated the expression of HPV genes during development, in different mouse organs, and in established fibroblasts and epithelial cell cultures. Our newly developed HPV16 knock-in mouse model provides viral gene expression from natural viral promoters offering an essential basis to explore the role of cellular factors in HPV-driven pathologies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Mouse models,Head and neck cancers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Xue Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Travis Schrank<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aditi Kothari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hina Rehmani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Tasoulas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sulgi Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wendell Yarbrough<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalia Isaeva<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, the primary mediators of cell killing, recognize peptide antigens presented in the context of Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (MHC-I). MHC-I presents an astoundingly diverse array of peptides, collectively known as the immunopeptidome. The biosynthesis of the immunopeptidome, which integrates gene expression, protein synthesis, and proteolytic processing, is not well understood. Additionally, most studies interrogating the immunopeptidome use cultured cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, which lack physiologically relevant stimuli.

KRAS, the predominantly mutated isoform of RAS, is mutated in 40% of colorectal cancer (CRC), leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK (RAS\/RAF) pathway and other downstream effectors. Due to the difficulty of targeting RAS, the first KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> selective inhibitor has only been developed recently and approved by the FDA for non-small cell lung cancer. However, the inhibitor demonstrated much lower response rates in CRC (&#60;20%) than other cancer types. Thus, developing effective therapies for KRAS mutant (KRASm) CRC still remains challenging. Oncogenic KRAS signaling has been shown to have immunosuppressive effects on tumor microenvironment, thus we hypothesized that KRAS inhibitor can indirectly enhance antitumor immunity, providing a rationale for their combination with immune checkpoint blockade. Indeed, using a syngeneic KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> CRC mouse model with knockout of APC, TP53, SMAD4 and expressing KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, we observed significant increase in the percentage of CD3+CD8+ T cells as well as changes in myeloid populations in tumors treated with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor compared with vehicle control. Combination of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\/PD-1 inhibition produced a more substantial and sustained reduction in tumor growth compared with KRAS or PD-1 inhibition alone. KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> CRC mouse model represents a proper tool to study tumor cell-intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity between KRAS inhibition and immune response, since KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor targets KRASm tumor cells only without having direct effects on stromal and immune cells. Interestingly, we found tumor-intrinsic immune programs induction by KRAS\/MAPK inhibition in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> CRC mouse models and patient-derived organoid models. We also found that KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition upregulates T-cell recruiting chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 via <i>IRF1<\/i> in KRASm tumor cells, which might be one of the potential mechanisms underlying enhanced infiltration of CD3+CD8+ T cells. These data suggest a link between KRAS inhibition and anti-tumor immunity, thus provide insights into novel combination strategies for KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> colorectal cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Colorectal cancer,Tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jun Tian<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ferran Fece de la Cruz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Burke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomonori Oka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacquelyn M.

HLA-I molecules present a diverse array of antigens, known as the &#8220;immunopeptidome&#8221;, which are recognized by cytotoxic CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells. Recent evidence suggests that cryptic peptide antigens derived from non-canonical open reading frames (nuORFs) contribute to the immunopeptidome and drive CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cell responses. Integrating ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) with mass spectrometry (MS) analyses has enabled the identification of several cryptic peptides derived from nuORFs including from putative non-coding regions including the 5&#8217;UTR, 3&#8217;UTR, long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and retained introns. Notably, many nuORFs undergo cap-independent translation. Various physiological and pharmacological stressors arrest canonical cap-dependent translation initiation and induce cap-independent translation. However, how this shift in translational dynamics influences the immunopeptidome is unknown. Using lung cancer cell lines, we show that the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol induces cap-independent translation and reshapes the landscape of nuORF-derived peptide antigens. Silvestrol induced changes in the immunopeptidome strongly contrast with the global translation inhibitor homoharringtonine, which dampens antigen presentation. These observations suggest that the presentation of nuORF antigens in lung cancer is dynamic and tightly controlled by translational dynamics. More broadly, our study provokes reconsideration of translation inhibitors as immunomodulatory drugs that can change the HLA-I antigen repertoire and generate peptides that can act as new targets for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HLA class I,Translation,Immunotherapy,Proteomic analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anika N.

We and others have found that high levels of Somatic Copy Number Alterations (SCNAs) in tumors are associated with decreased infiltration by cytotoxic immune cells and predict patient&#8217;s response to ICB. Recently, we predicted that the strongest SCNA driver of cytotoxic T cell depletion in HPV-negative oral cancer, was the loss of the entire 9p arm and that it was a marker of poor survival in recurrent oral cancers treated by anti-PD1 therapy. 9p arm loss is among the most common SCNAs in solid tumors and we revealed its importance beyond 9p21.3 deletion (i.e., <i>CDKN2A<\/i> and the<i> IFNA<\/i> cluster).To systematically investigate the immune-related role of 9p deletion and other SCNAs in cancer, we have developed a computational pipeline to identify the genes altered by SCNAs predicting the strongest risk of cancer immune evasion. We analyzed 7 solid tumor types and identified thousands of tumor-specific SCNAs predicting an immune cold phenotype but only ~100 SCNAs were conserved across all tumor types. Strikingly, 60% of the conserved deletions were localized on the 9p arm and the strongest 9p candidates included some known cancer drivers but also new candidates such as <i>RANBP6 <\/i>and <i>TOPORS<\/i>, that have been suggested to decrease proinflammatory and pro-immunogenic molecules. We have identified a 17-gene cluster deletion in 9p13 composed mostly of genes involved in proteasomal degradation or membrane trafficking, suggesting that its deletion might disturb MHC-mediated antigen presentation. We are now engineering human and mouse oral cancer cell lines to recapitulate 9p deletion and decipher its role in immune evasion through in vitro and in vivo immunological assays. We are also using the parameters we determined in our computational pipeline to develop a machine learning method improving our prediction of SCNAs driving immune evasion. Our findings identified 9p deletion as a novel biomarker for predicting clinical benefit of ICB and will allow a better understanding of the SCNA-mediated mechanisms suppressing tumor immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunosuppression,Copy number alterations,Chromosomal instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joy Bianchi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
