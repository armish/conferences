[{"Abstract":"NOS2 and COX2 expression is significantly correlated with poor prognosis in ER- breast cancer. Multiple pro-oncogenic pathways involving metastasis, proliferation, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and chemoresistance are stimulated in a synergistic manner by NOS2 and COX2, resulting in much more aggressive cancers. In this study, our single-cell RNAseq data demonstrated that certain combinations of cytokines, IFNg with TNFA or IL1B, drove NOS2 and COX2 expressions in vitro in the MDA-MB-231 cell line after 48 hours. Analysis of t-SNE plots indicates that the clustering patterns of NOS2 and COX2 are also related to cytokine expression. Moreover, according to our spatial proteomic analysis, CD8 that are associated with IFNg are more likely to have a positive response, indicating a dichotomy in the requirement for IFNg. To better understand this mystery, the spatial distribution of NOS2 and COX2 with CD8 cells in 21 ER- breast tumors was evaluated. In the presence of tumor-excluded CD8, high expression and clustering of NOS2-positive cells were seen near the tumor-stromal interface, showing that NOS2-positive cells were excluded from the tumor. Within the tumor nest, strong expression and population clustering of COX2 reached into the immune desert. In contrast, tumor-penetrant CD8 cells were few and poorly expressed. Metastasis and chemoresistance were among the leading causes of death in this cohort, and it was shown in vitro that IFNg\/IL1B or TNFA increased tumor cell migration, suggesting that the interface of tumor with stromal restricted lymphoid aggregates provides the unique spatial environment to increase NOS2 expression and increase metastatic potential. The spatial study of the TME (tumor microenvironment) provides vital insight into how NOS2 and restricted CD8 lead to a higher probability of poor survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nitric oxide,Interferons,COX-2,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuk Sing Robert Cheng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lisa Ridnour<sup>1<\/sup>, Abigail Walke<sup>2<\/sup>, Noemi Kedei<sup>3<\/sup>, Adelaide Wink<sup>2<\/sup>, Elijah Edmonston<sup>2<\/sup>, Donna Butcher<sup>2<\/sup>, Tiffany Dorsey<sup>3<\/sup>, William Heinz<sup>2<\/sup>, Richard Bryant<sup>4<\/sup>, Robert Kinders<sup>1<\/sup>, Stanley Lipkowitz<sup>3<\/sup>, Stephen Wong<sup>5<\/sup>, Milind Pore<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen Hewitt<sup>3<\/sup>, Daniel McVicar<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen Anderson<sup>1<\/sup>, Jenny Chang<sup>5<\/sup>, Stefan Ambs<sup>3<\/sup>, Stephen Lockett<sup>2<\/sup>, David Wink<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Leidos Biomedical Research Inc. for the NCI, Frederick, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD,<sup>4<\/sup>University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom,<sup>5<\/sup>Houston Methodist Weill Cornell Medical College, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"907f62d0-16da-4044-9daf-4ece909b40c6","ControlNumber":"972","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Concerted efforts from our group and others have identified that loss of IFN-&#947; signaling genes in melanoma is a major mechanism of resistance to ICBs. However, strategies of overcoming this resistance have been largely elusive. Moreover, given the indispensable role of T cells in governing ICBs, little is known about how tumor-intrinsic loss of IFN-&#947; signaling impacts tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs). In this study, we report that melanomas with defective IFN-&#947; signaling (IFN&#947;R1<sup>KO<\/sup>) have reduced infiltration and function of TILs. Intriguingly, IFN&#947;R1<sup>KO<\/sup> melanoma cells harbor a network of constitutively active protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) centered on JAK1\/2, essential downstream components of the IFN-&#947; signaling. Additional mechanistic studies reveal that JAK1\/2 activation is mediated by augmentation of the mTOR pathway. Importantly, targeting active JAK1\/2 with FDA-approved Ruxolitinib (Ruxo) selectively suppresses growth of IFN&#947;R1<sup>KO<\/sup> but not scrambled control melanoma, in a T cell and host TNF-dependent manner. Together, our results highlight an important role of tumor-intrinsic IFN-&#947; signaling in shaping TILs and manifest a therapeutic target that can be leveraged to bypass ICB resistance of melanomas defective of IFN-&#947; signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Ruxolitinib-JAK2 inhibitor,loss of IFN-g signaling,TNF-&#945;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hongxing Shen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fengyuan Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiangmin Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Oluwagbemiga A.

In various tumor types, amino acid-metabolizing enzymes such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and arginase 1 (ARG1) have been found to be among the culprits responsible for generation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. More recently, interleukin 4 induced 1 (IL4I1) was put forward as a promising anticancer drug target, whereas its expression may also contribute to resistance against IDO1 inhibition. Similar to IDO1, IL4I1 can metabolize tryptophan (Trp) resulting in the formation of AhR agonists, although phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) are also major substrates of IL4I1.<br \/>Plasma and ascites (<i>i.e.<\/i>, peritoneal fluid buildup) were collected from advanced-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients to determine whether aberrant metabolism by amino acid-metabolizing enzymes occurs in these patients and to evaluate ascites as a potential source of biomarkers related to these enzymes. Activity of the enzymes was indirectly determined through measurement of relevant amino acids and metabolites by targeted metabolomics using LC-MS\/MS, while levels of secreted IL4I1 were determined by ELISA. Amino acid, metabolite and enzyme concentrations were compared to healthy control subjects and were examined for correlations with clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes. Pleural effusions from non-small cell lung cancer patients were included to evaluate whether the results could be extended towards another type of cancer-related fluid buildup.<br \/>Metabolism of Trp was significantly elevated in HGSOC patients compared to control subjects, likely attributable to increased IDO1 expression. Kynurenine (Kyn) levels and Kyn\/Trp ratios were higher in ascites compared to plasma samples, demonstrating the value of utilizing this fluid for biomarker detection. Whereas elevated metabolism of Trp by IL4I1 could not be detected in the patients, high levels of Phe- and Tyr-derived metabolites associated with IL4I1 activity were found in their ascites. Levels of these metabolites significantly correlated with the concentration of IL4I1. Moreover, enhanced metabolism of Phe and Tyr correlated with disease stage, suggesting a role for IL4I1 in HGSOC progression. Elevated levels of IL4I1-associated metabolites were also found in the pleural effusions of a subset of non-small cell lung cancer patients, demonstrating that enhanced IL4I1 activity is not limited to ovarian cancer ascites.<br \/>In conclusion, our results suggest that IL4I1 may be involved in HGSOC progression, indicating this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target. The levels of IL4I1- and IDO1-generated metabolites in ascites may additionally serve as valuable diagnostic or predictive biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunosuppression,Ovarian cancer,Liquid biopsies,Amino acid metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yvonne Grobben<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Judith  E.  den Ouden<sup>2<\/sup>, Cristina Aguado<sup>3<\/sup>, Anne  M.  van Altena<sup>2<\/sup>, Aletta  D.

The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide, induced by aging stress, is a major player in these changes, as its accumulation at the mitochondrial membranes of both mouse and human aging T-cells induces ceramide-dependent mitophagy, which decreases T-cell viability, cytokine secretion, and anti-tumor activity. Using knock-out mouse models and pharmacological inhibition, we show that C14-ceramide accumulation in the mitochondria and mitophagy in the T-cells of aging mice are dependent on Ceramide Synthase 6 (CerS6), an enzyme responsible for C14\/C16-ceramide synthesis. Interestingly, sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), another enzyme involved in ceramide metabolism inhibits HDAC1\/2 function in aging T-cells, epigenetically inducing CerS6 expression and the resultant ceramide-dependent mitophagy, which ultimately decreases T-cell anti-tumor function. Both CerS6<sup>-\/- <\/sup>and SphK2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> aging T-cells were protected from the reduction in T-cell function, and their anti-tumor function was maintained in adoptive-cell transfer experiments to mice with melanoma. Besides lipid signaling, other metabolic changes associated with this aging-induced process have not been explored, and the utility of correcting these metabolic changes to restore T-cell function has not been evaluated. We studied the total hydrophilic metabolome of aging T-cells undergoing ceramide-dependent mitophagy to assess the metabolic changes occurring in these cells. Our findings show a general depletion of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolites in aging T-cells, with pools of fumarate, malate, and argininosuccinate significantly decreasing in both mouse and human aging T-cells. Interestingly, these changes were mirrored by similar changes in human cancer cells undergoing ceramide-dependent mitophagy, suggesting that these changes might constitute a general metabolic signature for this specific mitophagy process with deleterious effects on anti-tumor functions of aging T-cells. Both <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>supplementation of fumarate to mouse T-cells seemed to correct some of the functional defects observed in aging, with a protection of T-cell viability, cytokine production, and tumor killing capacity in co-cultures with tumor cells. The fumarate supplementation also led to a decrease in ceramide-dependent mitophagy in the aging T-cells, indicating an interplay between ceramide-dependent mitophagy and fumarate metabolism. Overall, these studies help explain the mechanisms behind aging-related dysregulation of T-cell anti-tumor activity, which can be restored by inhibiting ceramide-dependent mitophagy by pharmacological and genetic tools or by reprogramming fumarate metabolism in aging T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ceramide,Mitochondria,T cell,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mohamed Faisal Kassir<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Han Gyul Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Natalia Oleinik<sup>1<\/sup>, Paramita Chakraborty<sup>2<\/sup>, John  J.

However, the limited response rates to ICB across multiple cancer types suggest that new approaches and targets are clearly needed to fully elucidate the underlying biology of dysfunctional and exhausted CD8 T cells in cancer in order to achieve durable responses (cure). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most intensively studied drug targets, primarily due to their druggability and relevance to most physiological processes and disease conditions. However, the role of GPCRs in cancer and particularly in cancer immunology has been largely underexplored. We have applied a new computational pipeline to cross-integrate hundreds of thousands of CD8 T cells from multiple single cell RNA-seq datasets from 13 distinct cancer types. Using this approach, we identified many GPCRs that are overrepresented in exhausted CD8 T cells. A new computational strategy enabled us to predict the G protein coupling specificity of most GPCRs. This led to the discovery that G&#945;<sub>s<\/sub>-coupled GPCRs are significantly enriched in exhausted CD8 T cells. These include EP<sub>2<\/sub>, EP<sub>4<\/sub>, A<sub>2A<\/sub>R, &#946;<sub>1<\/sub>AR, and &#946;<sub>2<\/sub>AR, and we found that all of these receptors promote CD8 T cell dysfunction by inhibiting cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. However, these receptors are also expressed in other immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. To address the direct impact of these receptors on T cell function we used a novel synthetic biology approach, involving the development of a chemogenetic CD8-restricted G&#945;<sub>s<\/sub>-DREADD (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by A Designer Drug) transgenic mouse model in which activation of G&#945;<sub>s<\/sub> signaling is temporally and spatially controlled. Utilizing this G&#945;<sub>s<\/sub>-DREADD model, we discovered that the G&#945;<sub>s<\/sub>-signaling axis represents a previously uncharacterized signaling axis that dampens the anti-tumor CD8 T cell activity and leads to ICB immunotherapy failure. Our central hypothesis is that secretion of GPCR ligands in the tumor microenvironment and their actions on CD8 T cells lead to the activation of the G&#945;s signaling cascade leading to T cell dysfunction, by decreasing cytotoxic and migratory activity that abolished the effectiveness of ICB. Our findings reveal that G&#945;<sub>s<\/sub>-coupled GPCRs may represent new targetable immune checkpoints that can be combined with ICB as part of novel multimodal precision approaches to enhance the response to immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Tumor immunity,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bryan  S.

But less epigenetic studies have been performed on tumor associated M2 macrophages that plays a key role in the functional regulation of epithelial cancer development. In this study, we used 5-Aza-2&#8217;5&#8217;Aza-deoxycytidine (Aza) or decitabine (5-Aza) plus Trichostatin A (TSA) as epigenetic drugs to study the M2 macrophage modulation in the tumor microenvironment. Epigenetic therapy, not only modulated the M2 macrophages to a tumoricidal phenotype, but also strengthened the tumor immune surveillance and eventually attenuated tumor growth. In vitro studies on M2 macrophages, showed that these epigenetic modifiers, namely 5Aza+TSA, fine-tuned the M2 macrophages into a &#8216;no more tumor friendly&#8217; phenotype. Using comparative miR profiling, we identified nearly 79 miRs that were upregulated in M2 macrophages after epigenetic drug treatment. Of all miRs, miR-7083-5p showed 32 fold upregulation in M2 after epigenetic therapy and csf2ra, a GM-CSF receptor that helps in IL3 and GM-CSF signaling to M2 polarization, and CD43,a leukocyte marker, were one two of the important genes targeted by this miR-7083-5p. Nevertheless, re-expression of miR-7083-5p in M2 Macrophages in vitro, modulated M2 Macrophage to an anti-tumor phenotype and 4T1 tumor tissues showed inversed correlation between the expression of miR-7083-5p and its target,csf2ra and CD43,implying the pathological relevance of targeting. Considering the vital role of M2-TAM in tumor growth and metastasis, epigenetic drug mediated reactivation of miRs in M2-TAM could act as a promising therapeutic approach in cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,MicroRNA,Tumor associated macrophages,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Poongkavithai Vadevoo Sri Murugan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gunassekaran Gowri Rangaswamy<sup><\/sup>, Byungheon Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biochemistry and Cell biology, Kyungpook National University, School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b6917aea-832c-4bc3-b4e2-e263acfe0954","ControlNumber":"2165","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

These aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition and create subregions in the tumor that evade treatments and provide a critical support niche for continued tumor growth and metastasis. Conventional chemotherapy plus radiation, or in advanced disease chemotherapy plus targeted drug therapy can lengthen patient survival. However, even in patients with local disease, the 5-year survival rate remains at around 40%, demonstrating that there is need for improved conventional and immune therapies for all pancreatic cancer patients. In this study, dozens of biomarkers have been used to probe tumor heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissue. We rely on the published finding that hypoxia gene expression is consistent in PDAC, regardless of tumor location, whether primary tumor or metastasis. With the spatial biology solution, Cell DIVE<sup>TM <\/sup>and proprietary Spatial AI analytics software, dozens of biomarkers can be used to computationally reduce tumor heterogeneity, and to spatially define cells in the microenvironment within hypoxic and normoxic regions of PDAC, and in normal pancreas. We found that these hypoxic PDAC regions are devoid of immune cells in general, with the appearance of spatially co-localized populations of cell types consistent with tumor desmoplasia and inflammation. Taken together, multiplexed whole slide imaging and analysis enables spatially resolved whole tissue analysis of the tumor microenvironment, including new insights into spatial biology in the hypoxic PDAC environment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Biomarkers,Immuno-oncology,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Michael J.

CT26 is a popular syngeneic colon carcinoma model that is known to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors when engrafted into Balb\/c mice as a subcutaneous flank tumor. The subcutaneous flank implant location provides a robust model, that is easy to set up, and allows for continuous measurement of the tumor growth by calipering. However, the location of tumor implant has been shown to impact tumor microenvironment and immune response for a number of cancer cell lines (Zhao 2017, Brand 2021, Oliver 2018). In addition to subcutaneous flank tumors, CT26 can be implanted to generate a lung metastasis or peritoneal metastasis model. We were interested to see if the lung metastasis or peritoneal metastasis CT26 model responded differently to immune checkpoint inhibition compared with the subcutaneous model and whether the different implant locations resulted in changes to the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. CT26 cells were either injected intravenously to induce a lung metastasis model, intraperitoneally to produce a peritoneal metastasis model, or subcutaneously to generate a solid flank tumor model. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy began on Day 5 following implant in each model, and tumor progression or survival provided the endpoint for analysis. In addition, tumor infiltrating leukocytes were assessed by flow cytometry to determine differences in the overall tumor microenvironment for each model. The response to both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 monotherapies were strongest in the subcutaneous flank model, followed by moderate responses in the lung metastasis model, and no significant response to either ICI in the peritoneal metastasis model. This provides researchers with an opportunity to assess the ability of novel immune-oncology therapies to provoke an immunogenic response in models with identical antigenicity, but different tumor microenvironments based on the tumor location.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Tumor microenvironment,Metastatic tumors,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Fei Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Caitlin Thompson<sup><\/sup>, Nicole Barnes<sup><\/sup>, José Roques<sup><\/sup>, Terrence Coleman<sup><\/sup>, Tyler Rowe<sup><\/sup>, Joseph Kolb<sup><\/sup>, Chassidy Hall<sup><\/sup>, <b>Patrick Fadden<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Durham, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6bd9600a-9973-4414-8feb-d423d46f9822","ControlNumber":"4505","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Newly diagnosed patients therefore have a dismal five-year survival rate of 11%. However, PDAC progresses from pre-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) over at least a decade. Throughout this transition, the tissue microenvironment becomes increasingly immunosuppressive. Early PanINs may therefore be more amenable to immune-based interception strategies; however, little is known about the pre-malignant lesion immune microenvironment in PDAC. We hypothesized that the identification of the immune landscape of PanINs will elucidate the immuno-dynamic changes that occur during PanIN-to-PDAC progression and identify novel strategies for intercepting PDAC. Here, we use an inducible mouse model to study the evolution of immunosuppression from PanINs to PDAC. We pair spatial molecular profiling of our mouse model with profiling of human tissue in a cohort of patients with normal tissue, chronic pancreatitis, PanIN, and PDAC. To examine the evolution of the immune microenvironment throughout PanIN-to-PDAC progression, we first optimized a tamoxifen-inducible <i>Pdx1<\/i>-<i>Cre<\/i><sup>ERT2<\/sup> mouse that controls <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> expression and knocks out p53. The impact of <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> expression on the immune cell landscape in PanIN and PDAC lesions was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA in situ hybridization on mouse pancreas. We used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) of 35 immune markers to better classify and quantify the immune cell subtypes. Our analyses thus far reveal increased Tregs as PanINs progress to PDAC. Furthermore, although CD3+ T cells are recruited to tumors, these immune cells are strictly restricted to the immediate edge of the tumor and predominantly consist of Tregs. For our human analyses, FFPE pancreas sections from treatment na&#239;ve patients who had undergone surgical resection without neoadjuvant chemotherapy were evaluated. Each section contained regions of normal tissue, chronic pancreatitis, PanIN and PDAC. These were evaluated using IHC, IMC, and spatial transcriptomics to allow us to spatially evaluate the immune populations associated with lesions and PDAC. The relative density and localization of myeloid and lymphoid cell types in both PanIN and PDAC regions revealed an initial influx of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to PanINs and a progressively immunosuppressive microenvironment in subsequent stages. While PanINs and PDAC both recruited immune cells, the phenotypes of the immune infiltrates were distinct and revealed unique immune pathways that could contribute to immunosuppression as PanINs develop into PDACs. Our proteomic and transcriptomic data from mouse and human pancreas show that mutant <i>KRAS<\/i> driven premalignant lesions recruit an evolving immune response that readily becomes immunosuppressive as progression to PDAC occurs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer progression,Immune microenvironment,KRAS,Preclinical animal model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Melissa  R.

Most HNSCC patients have a history of oral epithelial dysplasia; however, there are limited diagnostic criteria used to determine which lesions will progress to cancer. There is an unmet clinical need to determine what cellular events occur during tumor initiation that enables anti-tumor immune evasion and heightened disease activity. Amplification of <i>SOX2<\/i>, a transcription factor that regulates stem cell pluripotency and fate, is a high-risk event that correlates to cancer initiation in squamous cell carcinomas. We have previously shown that <i>SOX2<\/i> amplification results in dampened STING-type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, a crucial pathway for innate immune sensing of cancers. Our clinical data from a longitudinal study following SOX2-positive patients with oral epithelial dysplasia and then HNSCC diagnosis confirmed infiltration of suppressive myeloid subsets and exclusion of effector T cells upon malignant transformation. Subcutaneous implantation of Sox2-expressing tumors exhibited expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and loss of infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment displayed secretion of cytokines involved in myeloid recruitment including<i> Csf-2<\/i> and <i>IL1a<\/i>. Moreover, expression of <i>SOX2<\/i> in HNSCC cell lines and human-derived epithelial progenitor cells enhanced IL-1&#945; expression. To recapitulate tumor formation in the oral cavity, we engineered a keratin-5-restricted, tamoxifen-inducible Cre to trigger Sox2<i> <\/i>expression in the buccal mucosa of mice. We observed that immune landscape substantially shifted before the HNSCC histology occurred. Upon analysis of immune infiltrates at 2-weeks and 4-weeks post tamoxifen painting, we found the recruitment of a distinct myeloid population following malignant transformation. These early myeloid cells display a dichotomous IFN-I-low and IL-1&#945;-high signature. Upon culturing bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with recombinant IL-1&#945; and then waiting four days to challenge with agonists to induce IFN-I signaling, we show that priming with IL-1&#945; and IL-6 but not IL-10 desensitizes myeloid cells to STING stimulation. We then found that blockade of IL-1\/IL1r1 signaling in our pre-clinical model delayed the influx of myeloid cells and the onset of Sox2-driven cancer initiation. From this, we propose that Sox2-mediated epithelial transformation results in expression of IL-1&#945; which primes myeloid cells to generate an immune-tolerant niche. We employed pharmacological and genetic approaches to show that blockade of IL1 signaling during the cancer initiation stage delays the onset of Sox2-driven HNSCC. Overall, we identified a novel cancer-immune cell interaction axis where Sox2 in cancer cells drives IL1&#945;-mediated STING suppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SOX2,Cancer initiation,Early myeloid infiltration,Oral cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hulya  F.

Although not all DCISlesions progress to cancer, most DCIS are treated as early breast cancer, given the uncertainty of which lesions will progress. The current increase in the incidence of DCIS has sparked interest in the immune contexture of the DCIS lesions as well as the immune status of DCIS patients, as a means to predict which DCIS lesions will progress to cancer. Studies done so far in invasive breast cancer showed that the immune system can mediate both tumor-promoting influence (via T regulatory (Treg) cells, M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)), as well as tumor-suppressing influences (via CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> effector T cells, natural killer cells (NK), M1 macrophages, tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells, B cell and dendritic (DCs) cells). Similar studies are still lacking in DCIS. Our aim was to start closing the gap in our understanding of the DCIS immune microenvironment, which will pave the way for novel preventative and therapeutic strategy.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed by flow cytometry peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from newly diagnosed DCIS patients for the presence of various immune cell types expressing specific phenotypic markers of immune effectors or immune suppressors and compared them with PBMC from age-matched healthy individuals.<br \/>Results: We found a statistically significant increase in the frequency of FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup> regulatory T cells in DCIS PBMC compared with healthy controls. There was also a significant increase in Tim-3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T effector memory cells (P= 0.035) and Tim-3<sup>+ <\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> NKT cells (P = 0.033) in the PBMCs of patients with DCIS compared with healthy controls. T cells expressing other exhaustion markers, such as PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> and LAG-3<sup>+<\/sup> were present at very low levels in both groups.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that some of the many immunosuppressive mechanisms seen in patients with invasive breast cancer, such as regulatory T cells, are already present in pre-cancer DCIS. Evidence of the beginning of immune suppression is also reflected in the increased frequency of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing the exhaustion marker Tim-3.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DCIS,Foxp3,T cell,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sedigheh Taghinezhad-S<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Amir Hossein Mohseni<sup>1<\/sup>, Pamela  L.

Therefore, more effective treatment approaches are urgently required. The P2X4 purinergic receptor is well studied for its role in inflammation. Our previous studies demonstrated that the P2X4 receptor is highly expressed in PCa compared to benign regions and is associated with poor prognosis. We observed intense P2X4 expression on most macrophages and some neutrophils in the primary tumor microenvironment (TME). Our study also showed that P2X4 knock-down in mouse PCa Myc-CaP cells resulted in significantly attenuated subcutaneous allograft growth in mice when compared to control cells. Allograft tumors were heavily infiltrated by P2X4-positive host immune cells. However, which components of the prostate TME express P2X4 receptors and the functional consequence of that expression is not well defined. Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize P2X4 receptor expression and function in the prostate TME and metastatic niche. A P2X4 antagonist has completed Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of neuropathic pain. As such, deciphering a role for P2X4 in the prostate TME promises novel cancer therapeutic approaches against aggressive PCa.&nbsp;We used RNA <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization and immunohistochemistry to assess P2X4 expression on immune cells in human PCa tissues and Myc-CaP allograft primary and metastatic tumor tissues. To determine P2X4 function in macrophages <i>in vitro<\/i>, we used THP1 human monocytic cells differentiated to M0 macrophages and polarized to the M1 and M2 subtypes. M1 and M2 cells were treated with P2X4 agonist, CTP or antagonist, 5-BDBD. RNA was extracted from cells to examine the expression of macrophage subtype-specific genes, and cytokine levels in cell media were measured by ELISA. Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism.&nbsp;Dual staining revealed abundant CD163<sup>+<\/sup> M2 macrophages that express P2X4 in human PCa tissues. In Myc-CaP allograft primary and metastatic tumor tissues, we observed abundant F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages and few Ly-6G<sup>+<\/sup> neutrophils. Staining patterns suggest that P2X4<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells likely include both cell types. CTP treatment of THP1 cell-derived M2 macrophages promoted anti-inflammatory IL-10 secretion while 5-BDBD treatment induced IL-6 secretion in M1 cells. M1 marker CD80, and M2 markers CD163 and CD206 mRNA expression were comparable across treatment groups, suggesting that treatment does not likely influence macrophage polarization.&nbsp;In conclusion, our study indicates that tumor-associated macrophages express P2X4 receptors both in primary and metastatic tumors. Our <i>in vitro<\/i> studies suggest a role for P2X4 receptors in macrophage cytokine secretion. Future studies will include functional assays to determine the role of P2X4 receptors on macrophages in the context of PCa.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Therapeutic target,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vahinipriya Manoharan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Angelo  M.

These cells play critical roles in supporting tumor growth and progression and their induction has been associated with the inactivation of PTEN. To date, few therapies targeting these cells are available which is partly due to their increasingly complex nature and context-dependent functions. Moreover, there is no clear definition to identify these cells. Enhancing our understanding of this cell population will aid in developing more effective cancer therapies. Here, we used gene expression profiling, flow cytometry, and quantitative immunohistochemistry to characterize tumor-infiltrating and circulating MDSCs in prostate carcinogenesis and progression in transgenic mouse models of prostate cancer driven by the conditional inactivation of <i>Pten and Trp53<\/i>. Transcriptomic profiling revealed enrichment of various myeloid-derived cell signatures in the early stages of prostate cancer including MDSCs, macrophages, and neutrophils. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the increased infiltration of CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>\/Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup> (polymorphonuclear MDSCs (pMDSCs)) and CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>\/Ly6C<sup>+<\/sup> (monocytic MDSCs (mMDSCs)) cells in prostate tumors. The temporal dynamics of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells were further profiled and showed that pMDSC and mMDSC abundances were 1.6 and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in older mice with late-stage locally invasive adenocarcinomas (AdCa) compared to younger mice with early-stage prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). In both instances, pMDSCs comprised most of the leukocyte infiltrate, however, mMDSCs tended to be positively correlated with tumor burden in AdCa but not PIN. In peripheral blood, CD44<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD62L<sup>+<\/sup> immature neutrophils were associated with high tumor burden in aged mice. Treatments targeting the androgen receptor (AR) signaling further exacerbated pMDSC infiltration in tumors and was associated with resistance to second androgen receptor-targeted agent (ARTA) therapy in a model of castration resistant prostate cancer. Our findings indicate that MDSCs are a prominent population in <i>Pten<\/i>-null prostate cancer and are implicated with resistance to prostate cancer treatment. MDSCs constitute a potentially targetable population and these models serve as viable platforms to further investigate their biological activity and further evaluate novel MDSC-directed therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Prostate cancer,Inflammation,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marco A.

However, studies from our group have reported that intervention of class-specific HDAC inhibitors can differentially affect immune-related pathways in macrophages and influence their pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotype and function. For example, specific HDAC6 inhibitors demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects by suppressing tumor-promoting M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In contrast, inhibition of HDAC11 promoted the anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages. Besides the divergent roles and distinct signaling pathways, a comprehensive study on the effect of HDCA6 and HDAC11 inhibition on macrophage phenotype and the implications on TME and inflammation is warranted.<br \/><i> <\/i><i>Objective:<\/i> To determine the effect of HDAC6 and HDAC11 inhibition on the phenotype and function of macrophages in the context of the TME.<i> <\/i><br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from C57BL\/6 mice were pre-treated with HDAC6 (NexturastatA) or HDAC11 (FT895) inhibitors prior to polarizing them to M1 and M2 phenotypes. Similarly, BMDMs were isolated from total knockouts (KO) of HDAC6 and HDAC11 mice. The changes in gene expression were identified by RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, single-cell secretome analysis on Isoplexis platform was performed from human and mice BMDMs on a panel of cytokines and chemokines.<br \/><i> <\/i><i>Results:<\/i> Transcriptomic analysis revealed that HDAC6 inhibition in M1 polarized BMDMs sustained inflammatory gene signature while suppressing the tumor-promoting and anti-inflammatory genes in M2 macrophages. This supported our previous reports where HDAC6i increased M1\/M2 ratio in murine melanoma models. In contrast, HDAC11 inhibition in M2 macrophages upregulated classical M2 markers, whereas M1-associated gene signature was minimally affected. These results were recapitulated in HDAC6KO and HDAC11KO macrophages, suggesting a high specificity of the inhibitors. Further validation at protein level by single-cell secretome analysis indicated that HDAC11 inhibition in M2 polarized BMDMs increased secretion of growth factors such as Egf and Pdgf and of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as Il10 and Il13. On the contrary, HDAC6 inhibition upregulated inflammatory cytokines such as Ifng and Tnf and T-cell recruiting chemokine Cxcl10 in the M1 phenotype.<br \/><i>Conclusions:<\/i>Transcriptomics and single-cell secretome analyses of macrophages indicate that HDAC6 and HDAC11 affects macrophage function in diametrically opposite directions. Therefore, our study underscores the importance of class-selective inhibition of HDACs over pan-HDAC inhibitors and the potential use of selective HDAC inhibitors as a therapeutic option to control macrophage phenotype in cancer and other conditions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Manasa Suresh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hawa Coulibaly<sup>2<\/sup>, Xintang Li<sup>2<\/sup>, David Quiceno-Torres<sup>2<\/sup>, Nithya Gajendran<sup>2<\/sup>, Karen Tan<sup>2<\/sup>, Matias Hepp<sup>3<\/sup>, Karthik Musunuri<sup>4<\/sup>, Satish Noonepalle<sup>2<\/sup>, Alejandro Villagra<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Ctr., Washington, DC,<sup>2<\/sup>Oncology, Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Ctr., Washington, DC,<sup>3<\/sup>Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile,<sup>4<\/sup>Advaite Therapeutics, Malvern, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f92d441d-3216-4a92-882f-4815223df261","ControlNumber":"7896","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) effectively treats primary disease, but 20-30% of patients relapse after ~5 years, resulting in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which has limited treatment options. We have previously shown in a murine model of CRPC that macrophages promote AR signaling in CRPC and that depleting tumor macrophages extends survival in response to ADT with Lupron. This correlates with reduced androgen levels in macrophage-depleted tumors and the ability of macrophages to transfer cholesterol, the anabolic precursor of androgens, to prostate cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which this transfer occurs, and whether cholesterol exchange mediates resistance to ADT, is currently unknown.<br \/>Methods: To assess cholesterol transfer from macrophages to cancer cells, we established a culture system involving prostate cancer cell lines and either the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line or bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Macrophages were pre-loaded with cholesterol using fluorescently labeled low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and were co-cultured or placed in a transwell system with tumor cells for 24 hours. Cholesterol transfer was then measured by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: Fluorescent signal from LDL was detected in 50-70% of tumor cells after 24 hours of co-culture. Cell contact was required for cholesterol transfer, as no fluorescence was detected in prostate cancer cells during transwell experiments. Macrophages were also able to internalize and transfer acetylated LDL, which is poorly taken up by tumor cells compared to unmodified LDL. Macrophage polarization with interleukin-4 did not impact cholesterol transfer and uptake of acetylated LDL occurred independently of the scavenger receptor CD36. The scavenger receptor SR-B1, which is often upregulated in prostate cancer cells, was dispensable for transfer, as knocking out SR-B1 via CRISPR\/Cas9 in cancer cell lines did not reduce LDL uptake.<br \/>Conclusion: Cholesterol transfer between macrophages and prostate cancer cells occurs in a contact-dependent manner, independently of the scavenger receptors most commonly associated with cholesterol accumulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholesterol,Prostate cancer,Macrophages,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Olabisi Osunmakinde<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Brian Ruffell<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9b98613e-e5cd-47fe-8200-111004b2e85d","ControlNumber":"3629","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>O.

Increasing reports have suggested that galectin-9 can bind and interact with immune-modulatory molecules including TIM-3 in several pathophysiological conditions, especially in T cells. However, to date, little is known about the galectin-9 in myeloid cells under tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explored the expressional characteristics and roles of galectin-9 in the brain tumor microenvironment using an intracranial mouse brain tumor model and <i>in vitro<\/i> system.

Yet, the interplay between the gut microbiome and immune responses in cancer is still poorly understood. We recently showed that gut microbiome changes are closely associated with development of <i>Kras<\/i>-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (KM-LUAD) in a human-relevant, tobacco-associated mouse model (<i>Gprc5a<sup>-\/-<\/sup>; <\/i>G<i>)<\/i>. Knockout of the antimicrobial protein <i>Lcn2<\/i> in these mice (<i>Gprc5a<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/<i>Lcn2<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>; GL) further reduced microbial diversity while enhancing inflammation and tumor development. We thus hypothesized that microbial dysbiosis in the gut, such as that incurred by loss of <i>Lcn2<\/i>, may exacerbate LUAD development<i>.<\/i> Here, we investigated the effects of gut microbiome modulation on LUAD pathogenesis using fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) in both syngeneic and tobacco carcinogenesis models. Syngeneic G mice (transplant of G LUAD cells) that received FMT from GL donors (G &#60; GL) exhibited significantly increased tumor growth relative to littermates with FMT from G mice (G &#60; G). These effects were recapitulated in an independent syngeneic model (<i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> LKR13 cells in wild type mice). Tobacco carcinogen-exposed G &#60; GL mice also exhibited increased lung tumor development compared with similarly exposed G &#60; G littermates. 16S rDNA-Seq analysis of fecal pellets revealed significant differences in gut beta diversity between syngeneic G &#60; G and G &#60; GL mice. G &#60; GL mice additionally displayed elevated relative abundance of tumor-promoting <i>Alistipes,<\/i> while <i>Ruminoccocus<\/i> and <i>Akkermansia,<\/i> taxa associated with favorable response to immunotherapy, were reduced. We next performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to comprehensively probe the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and the immune milieu near the gut of tumors and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), respectively. The TIME in G &#60; GL mice displayed an overall enhanced immunosuppressive phenotype evidenced by prominently increased fractions of T regulatory and <i>Cd4<\/i>+ <i>Izumo1r<\/i>+ exhausted T cells and, conversely, reduced levels of activated <i>Isg15<\/i>+ <i>Cd8a<\/i>+ T cells. MLNs from G &#60; GL mice showed markedly increased fractions of memory B cells expressing the immunosuppressor <i>Bank1<\/i> and reduced levels of follicular B cells and <i>Cd8a<\/i>+ <i>Clec9a<\/i>+ class 1 dendritic cells (cDC1). Flow cytometry further showed enhanced immunosuppression in G &#60; GL relative to G &#60; G mice, including increased fractions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the TIME of the former group. Our findings show that gut microbiome dysbiosis fosters lung cancer development by promoting immunosuppression, perhaps via a local and systemic <i>gut microbiota-immune system crosstalk<\/i>.

Using a BL\/6 mouse model engineered with alanine-to-serine point mutation, we showed that RASSF1<sup>A133S<\/sup> is associated with systematic defects in regulatory T cells (Tregs). When blood was phenotyped through a 17-color spectral flow cytometry panel, both RASSF1<sup>A133S\/WT<\/sup> and RASSF1<sup>A133S\/A133S<\/sup> carriers had a smaller circulatory CD25+FoxP3+ Treg pool than WT controls.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Wnt\/&#946;-catenin (<i>CTNNB1<\/i>) signaling activation is highly prevalent and has been reported to be associated with an immune avoided tumor microenvironment. ICG-001 is a small molecule inhibitor that prevents &#946;-catenin from binding to cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CBP) by competitively binding itself to CBP. The inhibition of CBP\/&#946;-catenin selectively induces apoptosis in transformed cells and have shown tumor suppressive effects in several cancers.<br \/>Aim: This study aims to investigate the role of tumor-intrinsic Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway in controlling the expression of chemoattractants in HCC that influence immune cell migration into the tumor site.<br \/>Methods: We established a syngeneic C57BL\/6 mouse model using a hepatoma murine Hepa1-6 isogenic cell line to allow us to interrogate how gain-of-function <i>CTNNB1<\/i> mutation (S45P) affects immune surveillance and response to ICG-001 in HCC. The mice were divided into two groups and were subcutaneously injected with either Hepa1-6 vector (n=29) or Hepa1-6 <i>CTNNB1<\/i> (S45P) (n=29). At day 6, each group were subdivided into two treatment groups: ICG-001 and untreated. The effect of ICG-001 on immune infiltrates was investigated by Opal multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.<br \/>Results: Untreated mice bearing <i>CTNNB1<\/i> (S45P) HCCs (n=15) showed larger tumor growth in comparison to their vector controls (n=14), suggesting <i>CTNNB1<\/i> (S45P) conferred a more aggressive clone. After a week of ICG-001 treatment by continuous osmotic pump perfusion, 42.9% (6\/14) of <i>CTNNB1<\/i> (S45P) mice showed a positive response to ICG-001, where a tumor regressed volume was indicated in 4 mice and stable disease in 2 mice. Progressive disease with continuous tumor growth, on the other hand, was shown in all untreated mice. Multiplex fluorescent IHC of tumors obtained from ICG-001 treated <i>CTNNB1<\/i> (S45P) mice showed an increased influx of M1 macrophage and CD8 T cells in the tumor site compared to an immune avoidance phenotype in untreated controls. Accordingly, our vector control group did exhibit response to ICG-001 when compared to their respective untreated groups. Based on these findings, it is plausible that <i>CTNNB1<\/i> activation impairs the expression of chemoattractant in HCC, and prevents immune cell migration into the tumor site. Consequently, we further examined tumor tissues for chemokine expressions and found higher levels of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 in ICG-001 treated <i>CTNNB1<\/i> (S45P) when compared to their untreated control groups. In conclusion, our results suggested Wnt\/&#946;-catenin activation plays a role in immune evasion and contribution to a &#8220;cold&#8221; immune tumor microenvironment in HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Wnt signaling,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aikha Melissa Go Wong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alissa Michelle Go Wong<sup>1<\/sup>, Loucia KY Can<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph Kwong<sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony WH Chan<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinna Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Kahn<sup>2<\/sup>, Nathalie Wong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>2<\/sup>Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8af52e87-5e60-4f11-96ff-ab0b4e4e4d47","ControlNumber":"2144","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Rare long-term survivors after surgical resection have been characterized as having high quality immune responses to primary tumors. However, the mechanisms that regulate immune surveillance in PDAC remain ill-defined.<br \/>METHODS: Here, we used patient data and genetic mouse models to study potential determinants of T cell surveillance in PDAC.<br \/>SUMMARY: Long-term survivors (&#62;3 years) compared to short-term survivors (&#62;3 months and &#60;1 year) after resection of treatment-na&#239;ve PDAC had increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration into tumors and lower systemic inflammation as measured by neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). In a panel of 10 PDAC cell lines orthotopically injected into mice, higher NLR correlated with decreased T cell infiltration into tumors and increased liver inflammation. Specifically, IL-6\/STAT3 signaling was enriched in livers of mice with tumors with fewer T cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that pancreatic cancer development triggers liver-directed immunosuppression that restrains productive anti-tumor T cell surveillance. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed IL-6 in hepatocytes, which was sufficient to convert a primary tumor with a T cell &#8220;inflamed&#8221; phenotype to T cell &#8220;non-inflamed&#8221;. This biology was dependent on STAT3 signaling in hepatocytes. To this end, loss of STAT3 specifically in hepatocytes drove an influx of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells into non-inflamed primary tumors. We next identified acute phase reactants serum amyloid A proteins 1 and 2 (SAA) as necessary for the inhibition of T cell infiltration by hepatocytes. In mice lacking SAA, tumor-specific T cell infiltration was increased, T cells in tumors expressed activation markers, and tumor growth was inhibited. In patients, we similarly found that high levels of SAA correlated with a decrease in T cells and an increase in monocytes in the peripheral blood; furthermore, long-term survivors after tumor resection had significantly lower SAA levels than short-term survivors. To test the direct role of SAA in survival after tumor resection, we developed a novel mouse model of distal pancreatectomy\/splenectomy, which recapitulated observations from patients that higher T cell infiltration into tumors associates with improved survival. Further, mice lacking SAA survived significantly longer after surgery in a T cell-dependent manner.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings define a pivotal role for hepatocytes in regulating productive T cell surveillance in cancer. Specifically, our data show that IL-6 can activate STAT3 in hepatocytes to release SAA which then suppress productive T cell surveillance. Taken together, these data suggest that activation of hepatocytes and their release of SAA are novel therapeutic targets for improving the productivity of cancer immunity and patient outcomes after surgery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Liver,Inflammation,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meredith L.

Recently, the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1 neutralizing antibody has become available for the first-line treatment of gastric cancer (GC) in Japan. However, there is no correlation between PD-1 or PD-L1 expression in Treg or GC tissues and clinical responses to anti-PD-1 antibody. MDSCs are immature myeloid cells thought to suppress immune cell action, but the functional cell surface markers that define MDSCs correlated with cancer progression has not yet been clarified well. In this study, we identified a new subset of potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets for MDSCs in GC patients. Significantly higher levels of immune checkpoint molecules, PD-1 and PD-L1, were expressed on granulocytic MDSCs from advanced than early-stage of GC patients. Interestingly, we found that a subset of G-MDSCs expressed not only PD-1 but also PD-L1 and the pretreatment of G-MDSCs with anti-PD-1 antibody ameliorated T cell responses in vitro. We also found that G-MDSCs isolated from patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibody had a lower ability to suppress T cells. These data indicate that a novel subset of G-MDSCs expressing PD-1 found in advanced GC could be novel therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDSC,Gastric cancer,PD-1,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Takumi Iwasawa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Suguru Yamauchi<sup>2<\/sup>, Tetsu Fukunaga<sup>3<\/sup>, Hajime Orita<sup>3<\/sup>, Kazunori Kato<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Research Center for Biomedical Engineering, Toyo Univ., Saitama, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Surgery, Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>Upper gastrointestinal surgery, Juntendo Univ., Bunkyou-ku, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"84b1c4d2-767b-4f81-85a9-5bf27c32442b","ControlNumber":"4143","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Tryptophan catabolism by enzymes Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) into metabolite L-Kynurenine (Kyn) has been shown to drive an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). We have shown tumors overexpressing IDO1 recruit and activate the Treg\/macrophage suppressive axis and blockade of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation abrogates this. Preclinical models demonstrate inhibition of IDO1 delayed tumor growth and increased T cell function. However, a phase III clinical trial in melanoma patients combining IDO1 inhibition with anti-PD-1 blockade showed no improved efficacy when compared to anti-PD-1 blockade. Kyn can act as a key signaling molecule through activation of AHR. We hypothesize that AHR engagement by kyn within the TME is highly dynamic and elevated AHR engagement must coincide with intervention to maximize therapeutic response. Using an AHR biosensor, we designed a construct with a dioxin response element (DRE) promoter that is engaged upon AHR-ligand complex, translocated to the nucleus, and drives a luciferase gene with a luminescence readout. This allows us to use an image-guided approach to track AHR bioactivity in real-time. <i>In-vitro<\/i>, we were able to validate our construct using transduced murine B16 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer models. We treated transduced cells with endogenous AHR ligands, kynurenine, and AHR agonist (FICZ), and observed a significant dose-dependent increase in AHR reporter readout. Additionally, the AHR inhibitor (CH-223191) abrogated AHR activity and subsequent luminescence below control threshold. We implanted both DRE transduced B16 (B16-DRE) and 4T1 (4T1-DRE) intradermally and intramammary fat pad respectively. Tumors were imaged and we observed total luminescence flux corresponding to increased tumor growth. After three weeks, we assessed IDO, AHR, and HIF1a expression which all converge on the IDO-Kyn-AhR pathway using a broad panel of lymphocyte and myeloid markers from tumors and spleen. We identified high expression of IDO, AHR, and HIF1a markers in myeloid cells with an increased frequency of dendritic cells and macrophages. Future experiments will focus on using our reporter construct in the context of ICB treatment and assessing AHR activity overtime as well as sampling peripheral blood to assess the magnitude of tryptophan, kyn, and other polycyclic hydrocarbons including gut microbiome-derived indoles. The characterization of the IDO-Kyn-AhR modulation after therapeutic intervention will inform the rational design of treatment regimens to abrogate immune suppression associated with AHR activity in combination with ICB treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune checkpoint blockade,AHR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mamadou Alpha Bah<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Inna Serganova<sup>2<\/sup>, Sadna Budhu<sup>3<\/sup>, Tanya Schild<sup>4<\/sup>, Jonathan  F.

Using measurements of CyC and creatinine, another established marker of renal function, we used genome-wide association and structural equation modeling to determine the genetics of the latent trait CyC production in UK Biobank, thereby uncoupling CyC from renal function. CyC production and a polygenic score (PGS) capturing germline predisposition to CyC production predicted elevated all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Using phenome-wide association, we further identified an association between germline predisposition to CyC production and accelerated onset of metabolic syndrome. As a potential explanation for these associations, we provide multiple lines of evidence that CyC is a direct transcriptional target of GC receptor, with GC-responsive CyC secretion exhibited by macrophages (cf. monocytes) and co-opted by multiple cancer cell lines, potentially explaining selective CyC elevations in disease states. Using isogenic CyC-knockout tumors (CRISPR-Cas9), we discovered a markedly attenuated tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> that was associated with a significantly reduced fraction of non-epithelial cells. To investigate whether depletion of specific non-epithelial cells could explain this, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing, which revealed abrogated recruitment of Trem2+ macrophages in knockout tumors, subsequently validated by Trem2 immunohistochemistry in a non-overlapping cohort. Trem2+ macrophages have previously been linked to immune suppression and failure of cancer immunotherapy. Consistent with this, we show that the CyC production PGS predicted checkpoint immunotherapy failure in a combined clinical trial cohort of 685 metastatic cancer patients. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CyC may be a direct effector of GC-induced immunosuppression, acting through the recruitment of Trem2+ macrophages, and therefore could be a target for combination cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glucocorticoid,Macrophages,Immune checkpoint blockade,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sam  O.

Indeed, DC-mediated T cell stimulation is essential for generating responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Tumors have been shown to hijack DC function in a process broadly known as tolerization. Despite the significant implications of this process on the modulation of anti-tumor immunity, the underlying mechanisms of this process remain unclear. We have identified a unique population of DCs in transgenic models of both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer that arise within the tumor microenvironment and migrate to the draining lymph node (LN) tissues during the course of disease progression. RNAseq and flow cytometry studies revealed this DC population to exhibit a unique CD63 surface marker, enabling us to determine this subset to drive regulatory T cell (Treg) and T<sub>H<\/sub>2 expansion while suppressing conventional DC-mediated activation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses, even at rare numbers. Additional transcriptional and metabolic studies showed these CD63<sup>+<\/sup> DCs to be a subset of the previously identified 'mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules' (mregDC) population and to exhibit both enhanced activity of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway as well as increased lipid stores and dependence on fatty acid oxidation. Inhibitor studies confirmed that mevalonate biosynthesis drives CD63<sup>+<\/sup> mregDC-mediated immune tolerance while scATACseq studies have identified open regulatory elements in CD63<sup>+<\/sup> mregDCs associated with key rate-limiting genes associated with the mevalonate pathway. Additional lineage analysis revealed the CD63<sup>+<\/sup> mregDC population to evolve primarily from type 2 conventional DCs <i>in vivo<\/i>. Both DC-specific genetic deletion of the SREBF2 master transcription factor as well as SREBP2 pharmacologic inhibition suppresses melanoma progression while enhancing tumor CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration. Adoptive transfer of CD63<sup>+<\/sup> mregDCs enhances melanoma metastases and promotes the accumulation of Tregs in draining LN tissues. scRNAseq studies as well as spatial transcriptomic analysis has confirmed this same DC population in the sentinel LN tissues of melanoma patients. We propose that this novel DC subset represents a key target for augmenting anti-tumor immune responses and suppressing metastatic progression. Ongoing work is focused on dissecting the regulatory pathways dictating the transcriptional program of CD63<sup>+<\/sup> mregDCs and developing a CD11c-CD63 bispecific depletion antibody for further pre-clinical testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunosuppression,Dendritic cells,Metabolism,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Michael P.
