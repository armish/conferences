[{"Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite the advancement of targeted therapies and immunotherapies, the outcome of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains poor at the metastatic stage, with a median survival of mere 7 months. This devastating outcome is partially due to an inadequate understanding of the metastatic mechanism of ccRCC. Previously, we found that two distinct cell populations co-exist in the malignancy: one with the functional von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene (VHL(+)) and the other without (VHL(-)). This heterogeneity in VHL plays an essential role, where the VHL(-) cells serve as the metastatic driver and promote VHL(+) cells to disseminate to distant organs such as the lungs. In this study, we sought to find small molecules that can selectively inhibit the VHL(-) cells' growth and survival. We hypothesize that these molecules will effectively inhibit ccRCC metastases by targeting the metastatic driver population.<br \/>METHODS: CRISPR knockout was conducted to generate VHL(-) cells from a murine RCC cell line, RENCA. Both VHL(-) and (+) cells were then fluorescently labeled and went through high-throughput screening (HTS) with 2,530 FDA-approved drugs. We followed a ratiometric black-box approach to identify selective modulators of cell growth and survival of VHL(-) cells without affecting VHL(+) counterparts. CRISPR knockin was conducted on human ccRCC cells, as well, generating VHL(+) and (-) pairs of 786O, RCC4, and a patient-derived primary cell line.<br \/>RESULTS: HTS yielded 9 hits that selectively inhibited the survival of the metastatic drivers VHL(-) cells. 4 out of 9 hits belonged to the same drug family called statins. Statins bind to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and help lower cholesterol, thus are widely prescribed to high-risk patients for cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, not all statins showed the VHL(-) suppressing effect, resulting in IC<sub>50<\/sub> varying from 0.6uM to &#62;50mM. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, the two most potent and prescribed statins for cholesterol-lowering with the highest HMGCR affinity, did not show as much efficacy as other statins. This observation also held true in human ccRCC cell lines, suggesting an involvement of a non-cholesterol\/HMGCR pathway in statins&#8217; inhibitory effect on VHL(-) cells. Animal studies were conducted using fluvastatin, which had the lowest IC<sub>50<\/sub> in our model. Intraperitoneal injection of 15mg\/kg fluvastatin Q.O.D for 2 weeks successfully suppressed the growth of primary tumors, especially by eliminating VHL(-) cells, and most importantly, prevented lung metastases in the treatment group, whereas all of the control group developed metastases.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Translational potential of this project is enormous. By investigating the mechanism of action further, we could potentially reposition the FDA-approved, cheap, and widely available small molecules as a novel anti-metastatic therapeutic in ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Small molecule drugs,Heterogeneity,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Moe Ishihara<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Junhui Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Celine Cano-Ruiz<sup>1<\/sup>, Maia Jackson<sup>2<\/sup>, Aimee Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Stuart Conway<sup>3<\/sup>, Robert  D.

Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC; malignant ascites or implants) in GAC patients is common and poses a challenge with short survival and lack of effective therapeutics. We and others have demonstrated that deregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway particularly with upregulation of its coactivators-YAP1 or TAZ drive cancer progression and metastases in gastroesophageal cancers suggesting YAP1 and TAZ are potential drug targets in solid tumors. However, discovery of effective drugs to target YAP1 or TAZ remains challenging due to the nuclear localization and lack of inhibitory pocket for YAP1 or TAZ. In this study, using scRNAseq and immunofluorescent staining, we observed that both YAP1, TAZ and their transcriptional factors-Tead1, Tead2, Tead3 and Tead4 are highly expressed in PC tumor cells and high expression of these proteins were associated with poorer prognosis. Further, we note that recently developed YAP or TAZ antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) can effectively and specifically suppress YAP or TAZ expression and transcription accompanied by decreased tumor cell invasion and tumor sphere formation. Further, we observed that YAP1 can interact with TAZ and both bind TEAD1,2,3 but not Tead4 transcriptional factors, while YAP1 ASO or TAZ ASO can decrease the interactions between YAP1 or TAZ with TEAD1,2,3 in GAC cells. Interestingly, inhibition of YAP1 or TAZ alone using the ASOs can complementarily increase the other at the protein and mRNA levels. Further, we revealed that YAP1 KO patient derived tumor cells (GA0518) are more sensitive to TAZ ASO than control cells and simultaneously inhibition of YAP1 and TAZ by ASOs reduces both YAP1and TAZ proteins and mRNA levels with significant decrease in cell proliferation and invasive capacity of YAP1 high tumor cells. Most importantly, co-targeting YAP and TAZ by the ASOs significantly attenuated progression and PC in the PDX model and sensitized to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in the KP-Luc syngeneic model. Taken together, our studies open a new avenue for developing novel therapeutic strategy by co-targeting both YAP1 and TAZ using the ASOs against GAC with PC. <b>Keywords<\/b>: Gastric Adenocarcinoma, YAP1, TAZ, Hippo pathway, Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs), Peritoneal Metastases, Targeted Therapy","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,YAP\/TAZ,Antisense oligonucleotides,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jingjing Wu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ailing Scott<sup>2<\/sup>, Yan Xu<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuan Li<sup>4<\/sup>, Yibo Fan<sup>5<\/sup>, Ruiping Wang<sup>6<\/sup>, Xiaodan Yao<sup>7<\/sup>, Katsuhiro Yoshimura<sup>8<\/sup>, Melissa Pool Pizzi<sup>9<\/sup>, Kohei Yamashita<sup>10<\/sup>, Shan Shao<sup>11<\/sup>, Christopher Vellano<sup>12<\/sup>, Linghua Wang<sup>13<\/sup>, Alexey Revenko<sup>14<\/sup>, Eric Dolinski<sup>15<\/sup>, Jaffer A.Ajani<sup>16<\/sup>, Shumei Song<sup>17<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Jingjing Wu, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Ailing, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>First Hospital of China Medical University, YanXu, Shenyang, China,<sup>4<\/sup>First Hospital of China Medical University, Yuan Li, Shenyang, China,<sup>5<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Yibo Fan, Houston, TX,<sup>6<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Ruiping Wang, Houston, TX,<sup>7<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Xiaodan Yao, Houston, TX,<sup>8<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Yoshimura Katsuhiro, Houston, TX,<sup>9<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Melissa Pool Pizzi, Houston, TX,<sup>10<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Kohei Yamashita, Houston, TX,<sup>11<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Shan Shao, Houston, TX,<sup>12<\/sup>MD anderson cancer center, Christopher Vellano, Houston, TX,<sup>13<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Linghua Wang, Houston, TX,<sup>14<\/sup>Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Alexey Revenko, Carlsbad, CA,<sup>15<\/sup>Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Eric  Dolinski, Carlsbad, CA,<sup>16<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Jaffer A.Ajani, Houston, TX,<sup>17<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Shumei Song, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"df0d355c-6bb2-4389-af86-11c4bcd85b84","ControlNumber":"5345","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

The ISR kinase family member PERK controls one of the three arms of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR is considered an Achilles&#8217; heel in B-cell cancers. Myelomas and B-cell lymphomas are dependent on a well-balanced UPR pathway to cope with the high demand for protein folding and their secretory nature. Given the double-edge sword nature of the UPR, the activation of PERK and downstream pathway can have cytoprotective or cytotoxic effects. In B-cell cancers the UPR is at close to maximum cytoprotective capacity, such that further pharmacological stimulation of PERK drives a cytotoxic outcome leveraged to induce antitumoral effects. Methods: Recombinant WT and mutant PERK constructs were assayed in the presence of DP-9024. Structures of compound-bound PERK were determined by X-ray crystallography. Kinome profiling was determined using enzymatic and cellular assays. Cellular modulation of the ISR\/UPR pathway (phospho-GCN2, PERK, ATF4, CHOP) or the apoptosis pathway (cleaved-PARP, cleaved-Caspase 3\/7) was measured by Western blot or ELISA. The level of DP-9024-induced PERK activation was determined using a cellular nanoBRET dimerization assay utilizing WT and mutant PERK constructs. Results: DP-9024 was designed as a selective and potent modulator of PERK and GCN2. DP-9024 was found to upregulate the ISR\/UPR pathway (ATF4, CHOP). The mechanism by which DP-9024 induced the UPR pathway was found to be through dimerization-dependent activation of PERK. Utilizing recombinant biophysical and cellular assays of WT and mutant PERK constructs, we found that DP-9024 directly binds to a switch control site in the kinase domain of PERK that governs dimerization and that the binding of the compound to one monomer was sufficient to induce dimerization-mediated activation of the unoccupied monomer. This paradoxical stimulation of the unbound PERK monomer is reminiscent of the phenomenon observed with some BRAF inhibitors.<sup>1<\/sup> X-ray crystallography studies revealed that PERK crystalizes as a dimer with both monomers bound to compound, due to the high concentration of compound used during crystallization. DP-9024-mediated PERK dimerization and transactivation led to the activation of downstream pathways (ATF4, CHOP), apoptotic pathway (Caspase 3\/7, PARP1), and growth arrest in cell lines with high levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress such as multiple myeloma and B-cell lymphoma. Conclusions: Paradoxical stimulation of the ISR family member kinase PERK, through direct binding and dimerization by DP-9024, led to unresolved ER stress that can potentially be leveraged as a novel mechanism to induce growth arrest in UPR vulnerable cancers, including myelomas and B-cell lymphomas.

The key regulator of Hippo pathway is transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) transcription factors, which directly bind with YAP\/TAZ and then drive the multiple signaling by activating target gene expression on nuclear. Loss-of-function mutations in the upstream activators, NF2-LATS1\/2-MST1\/2, trigger YAP\/TAZ nuclear translocation and target gene transcription (Hippo-off state). This YAP\/TAZ-TEAD complex is overexpressed and leads to metastatic progression in various cancers including malignant mesothelioma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer or cholangiocarcinoma. A recent development in targeting the Hippo pathway has been focused on the discovery of a central lipophilic pocket in TEAD amenable to the small-molecule binding site of autopalmitoylation. Within this lipophilic palmitate pocket, post-translational S-palmitoylation of TEAD at a conserved catalytic cysteine (Cys) residue (e.g., C380) leads to TEAD stabilization and is believed to be critical for maintaining appropriate protein folding to enable the formation of the transcriptionally active YAP\/TAZ -TEAD complex. Therefore, targeting the palmitate pocket with allosteric small molecules inhibitor disrupt the formation of the YAP\/TAZ-TEAD complex and modulate YAP\/TAZ-TEAD driven gene transcription. We have identified a series of novel, potent small-molecule inhibitors of the YAP\/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complex. It showed under 20 nM of potency in the inhibition of TEAD luciferase reporter assay in MCF7-TEAD-luc cells. These TEAD inhibitors inhibited YAP\/TAZ-TEAD protein-protein interaction in H226 cells harboring neurofibromin 2 (NF2) alteration. In addition, our lead compounds exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects in Hippo pathway-altered cancer cell lines and reduced the YAP\/TAZ-TEAD target gene expression, CTGF, and CYR61 in H226 cells. Our lead compounds, singled out and optimized based on <i>in vitro<\/i> functional assay, displayed favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Furthermore, orally administered lead compound effectively suppressed tumor growth within tolerable doses in xenograft mice with tumors harboring NF2 alteration as a major upstream molecule of the Hippo pathway. In summary, we pointed our novel YAP\/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors that showed excellent efficacy in Hippo-altered mutant cancer <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft models. These data best support a therapeutic option for the treatment of cancers with amplified or overexpressed YAP, TAZ, or TEAD genes. Further preclinical studies will be performed and reported soon after the establishment of a preclinical candidate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP\/TAZ,TEAD,Hippo pathway,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jisook Kim<sup><\/sup>, Seung Hyun Jung<sup><\/sup>, Seon Yeong Han<sup><\/sup>, Jihee Yoon<sup><\/sup>, Minjeong Kim<sup><\/sup>, Jooyun Byun<sup><\/sup>, <b>Heesun Moon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Eunyoung Lee<sup><\/sup>, Yu-Yon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Hyunjin Park<sup><\/sup>, So-Ye Jeon<sup><\/sup>, Young Gil Ahn<sup><\/sup>, Young Hoon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Kwee Hyun Suh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hwaseong-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0d1dfd9a-0049-4b4a-acbd-4230a4d23fd0","ControlNumber":"5679","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

These kinases are key effectors of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and amino acid Response (AAR) branches of the integrated stress response (ISR). ISR downregulates protein synthesis while upregulating specific genes in response to various cellular stresses, thus allowing adaptation and survival. PERK and GCN2 cooperate to modulate survival under stress conditions in cancer cells, with GCN2 activation compensating when PERK is inhibited, therefore suggesting a certain degree of redundancy between the two. Multiple myeloma (MM) and other protein-secreting tumors are highly dependent on UPR for survival, due to their high protein load. Therefore, PERK inhibition represents a promising anticancer approach in these tumor types. Notably, in these contexts, dual PERK\/GCN2 inhibition may be more effective than inhibiting the single kinase.NMS-03597812 is a novel, very potent, ATP-competitive PERK\/GCN2 inhibitor, NMS-812 is preferentially active <i>in vitro<\/i> on multiple myeloma cell lines; activity has however been observed also on lymphoma and selected solid tumor cell lines, suggesting a broader but still specific role of PERK and GCN2 inhibition depending on cell context. In assays revealing the mechanism of action, as expected, a transient dose-dependent eIF2&#945; pathway activation is observed, suggesting the attempt of GCN2 to compensate for PERK inhibition. However, at higher doses, NMS-812 strongly induces pathway downmodulation and apoptosis compared to prototype PERK selective inhibitors. NMS-812 treatment of a MM xenograft model significantly prolongs the median survival time as single agent and demonstrates synergistic activity with MM standard of care (SOC) agents.

Several oral SERDs are being developed using non-steroidal pharmacophores with the goal of improving efficacy while reducing toxicities. Recently, two advanced non-steroidal oral SERDs failed to meet the primary endpoint of longer progression-free survival. Whereas Elacestrant demonstrated efficacy only in a subset of the population (ESR1 mutant) with poor gastrointestinal tolerability. KSHN001126 was developed as a steroidal SERD by exploring multiple ER-protein conformations and identifying a subpocket around the core hydrophobic site where the molecule can be extended. KSHN001126 perfectly occupies both the original and subpocket formed by the pocket breathing phenomenon. Being steroidal SERD, KSHN001126 has the potential to be efficacious in the mutant\/non-mutant conditions. KSHN001126 was studied in MCF-7 cells <i>in- vitro<\/i> to understand ER localization confirming cytosolic abundance and ER&#945; immobilization. Furthermore, ER&#945; protein quantification using a simple western revealed dose-dependent degradation following KSHN001126 treatment. The MCF-7 xenograft study was performed in nude mice to evaluate antitumor activity of KSHN001126 (10, 30, and 60 mg\/kg) administered for 28 days revealing dose-dependent efficacy and ER degradation. Furthermore, KSHN001126 demonstrated dose-dependent reduction in tumor volume in ESR1 Y537S patient derived xenograft (PDX - ST2177), confirming activity against the ESR1 mutation. Following that, the combination of KSHN001126 with Palbociclib or Alpelisib was tested in an MCF-7 xenograft model, as these molecules are clinically approved in combination with SERD. Furthermore, KSHN001126 was evaluated in combination with FLV to assess any potential mechanistic synergy. When KSHN001126 was combined with Palbociclib, Alpelisib, or FLV, significant tumor regression was observed compared to standalone treatment (p0.05 or 0.01). KSHN001126 is currently being tested in additional PDX models. Overall, KSHN001126 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy (wild type and ESR1 mutation), confirming target engagement and mechanistic synergy (CDK4\/6-Palbociclib and PI3K-Alpelisib). Furthermore, KSHN001126 demonstrated additive antitumor efficacy when combined with FLV, indicating a potential additional mechanism other than SERD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Parva Purohit<sup><\/sup>, Heta Pandya<sup><\/sup>, Vishal Unadkat<sup><\/sup>, Ketan Variya<sup><\/sup>, Sonam Sinha<sup><\/sup>, Mahesh Barmade<sup><\/sup>, Shishir Rohit<sup><\/sup>, <b>Ganesh Sangle<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Kashiv Biosciences, LLC, Ahmedabad, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2f1d5cfc-534d-4b22-aede-8cbc851d7854","ControlNumber":"6033","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Nearly 100% of AGCT cases are caused by an oncogenic point mutation in the Forkhead Box L2 (FOXL2) transcription factor. Weis-Banke et al. found this gain-of-function mutation (FOXL2<sup>C134W<\/sup>) allows FOXL2 to hijack the nuclear SMAD2\/3\/4 complex, the downstream effector of transforming growth factor- &#223; (TGF-&#223;), and redirect to novel transcription sites, inducing transcription of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and other oncogenes. We hypothesized that FOXL2 mutant AGCT would be sensitive to TGF-&#223; inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we treated two GCT cell lines with TP-6379, an orally available, investigational small molecule kinase inhibitor of TGFBR1 that has been shown to block the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in cells. TP-6379 was tested in the KGN cell line, derived from an AGCT patient and heterozygous for the FOXL2<sup>C134W<\/sup> mutation, and the COV434 cell line, derived from a juvenile GCT patient, which is FOXL2 wild type (WT). KGN cells (IC50 = 135 nM) were observed to be more than 70-fold more sensitive to TP-6379 treatment than COV434 (IC50 = &#62;10,000 nM), after a 6- and 7- day treatment, respectively. KGN cells that were edited to remove the WT FOXL2 or both the WT and FOXL2<sup>C134W<\/sup> alleles were observed to be 1.6-fold more sensitive to TP-6379 and 22-fold less sensitive than the parental KGN cells. In vivo testing using KGN cells is ongoing. Viably cryopreserved dissociated tumor cells (DTCs) from two AGCT patients and one JGCT patient, which contain a mixture of tumor, immune, endothelial, and other stromal cells, were also tested in proliferation assays with TP-6379. All three <i>ex vivo<\/i> samples were positive for the FOXL2<sup>C134W<\/sup> mutation as detected by a qPCR genotyping assay and were sensitive to TP-6379 (IC50 = 555-1600 nM) after 6-day treatment. Xenograft models using these patient samples are currently under development. TGF-&#223; signaling is also a master regulator of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune evasion by modulating deposition of extracellular matrix and suppression of immune cells. We performed an immunophenotyping assay in tissue microarrays of thin-needle biopsy cores of multiple cancer types by looking at the distribution of CD8 T cells within tumor and stroma. AGCT showed the strongest excluded and desert phenotype among the tested cancer types, where CD8 T cells were confined to the stroma or absent entirely. TP-6379 treatment was observed to increase expression and reverse TGF-&#223; induced suppression of HLA class I in KGN cells. These data suggest that TGF-&#223; may play a significant role in the TME of AGCT. In conclusion, preclinical data shows inhibition of TGF&#223; signaling with TP-6379 in FOXL2<sup>C134W<\/sup> mutant AGCT is active at blocking cell growth and may prove to be a potential therapy in this rare disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,Small molecule inhibitor,Kinase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Curtis  A.

TLR8 activation can reverse Treg and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) mediated immune suppression by tumors that lead to a restore of immune response to inhibit tumor growth. ZG0895 is a potent and novel TLR agonist that shows a highly selective activation of TLR8 and has a more than 300-fold potency over TLR7 in EC<sub>50<\/sub> values. The agonist screening results further confirmed that ZG0895 without activation of TLR isoforms like TLR2, 4 or 9 in cells. In pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, ZG0895 has a preferable ADME and PK profile and can activate immune system via subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. For in vivo anti-tumor efficacy studies, ZG0895 at 1~30 mg\/kg exhibited significant dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in immunocompetent myeloid-sufficient murine models with CT26, EMT6 or HH subcutaneous xenografts. Furthermore, ZG0895 administration resulted in a complete tumor regression by ZG0895 at high dose via s.c. injection. Mechanism studies of ZG0895 in ex vivo human PBMC assay showed a strong induction of TLR8 related cytokines. In vivo study in tumor-bearing mouse demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF&#945;, IL12p40, IL6 and IL10, were quickly released after ZG0895 treatment but soon returned to normal that can avoid continuous activation of systemic immunity and reduce the risk of cytokine release storm. Consistently, in vivo cynomolgus monkey study by consecutive treatments with ZG0895 (day 30) resulted in a significant increase of immune system cells including intermediate monocytes, non-classic monocytes, cDCs and NK cells, along with notable decrease of classical monocytes but unchanged pDCs, suggesting a possible reversion of tumor-initiated MDSC via TLR8 activation. All these changes were back to normal after period of recovery (day 57), indicated the immune effect of ZG0895 was restrained. These preclinical results support that ZG0895 as a highly TLR8-selective agonist inhibits tumor growth via the activation of TLR8 eliciting immune responses but under a better safety than other conventional TLR8 agonists, and it is worth to be further explored as an anti-cancer drug candidate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TLR7,TLR8 agonist,Preclinical study,Antitumor activity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Dawei Cui<sup><\/sup>, Ruifeng Liu<sup><\/sup>, Huanyi Yang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Bing Zhu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zelin Sheng<sup><\/sup>, Binhua Lv<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Suzhou Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cf7a9d3d-9b6d-4e2c-8f3e-9530c0f2bfc6","ControlNumber":"5872","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

The compound works as a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). Structurally similar to estrogen, fulvestrant binds to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the ER, altering the stability of the protein, leading to its accelerated proteasomal degradation. While effective, fulvestrant must be given intramuscularly, which has limited its clinical adoption. Based on the success of fulvestrant, multiple attempts have been made to generate orally available SERDs. These attempts have focused on compounds that, like fulvestrant, bind within the LBD of the ER. Overall, these intensive efforts have generated limited success. We reasoned that it may be possible to identify potential SERDs that bind to the ER in regions outside the LBD. Such an approach would be useful for tumors bearing wildtype ER, and likely for those bearing a mutant form of the ER, since most mutations cluster in the LBD. We have recently developed a high throughput platform that allows for the identification of ligands that can bind to wide variety of protein targets. Using this approach, we screened a diverse chemical library of 100,000 small molecules to identify compounds that bind outside of the LBD, and in particular to the N-terminal region of the ER. This strategy identified CL-ER-100, a small molecule that directly bound to the N-terminal region of the ER and functioned as a SERD. While CL-ER-100 rapidly induced ER proteasomal-dependent degradation, it had no effect on the protein levels of other, structurally related nuclear receptors. Based on its structure and size (~ MW 300 Da), CL-ER-100 is expected to have excellent bioavailability. Consistent with its binding outside of the LBD, addition of tamoxifen had no effect on the ability of CL-ER-100 to induce ER protein degradation. In cells, CL-ER-100 was able to markedly inhibit the growth of breast cancer cell lines such as MCF7 and T47D (IC50 of ~ 100 nM) while not inhibiting the growth of a wide array of normal and non-breast cancer tumor cell lines. Taken together, these results identify a novel strategy to develop small molecule SERDs that induce ER protein degradation by binding to previously untargeted regions of the estrogen receptor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Ubiquitination,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yuan Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jason  R.

A variety of therapeutic approaches exist including steroid synthesis inhibitors and next-generation ligand binding domain (LBD) antagonists [e.g., enzalutamide (Enza)]. However, these approaches are only effective against tumors bearing the full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL). In the course of their disease, many patients acquire androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7), a mutant form of the receptor which lacks the LBD and is constitutively activated. To date, no effective therapy has been demonstrated for patients with metastatic prostate cancer bearing the AR-V7 signature. We have recently developed a high throughput platform that allows for the identification of ligands that can bind to wide variety of protein targets. Using this approach, we screened a diverse chemical library of 100,000 small molecules to identify compounds that bound to AR-V7. One such molecule, CL-AR-100, directly bound to AR-V7 and moreover, induced proteasomal-mediated targeted protein degradation of both AR-V7 and AR-FL. This compound did not affect the expression of other structurally related ligand-activated nuclear receptors. In prostate cancer cell lines expressing AR-FL, CL-AR-100 induced a gene expression profile similar to cells treated with Enza including a marked reduction in KLK3 (PSA) expression. Moreover, CL-AR-200 inhibited the growth of 22RV1 cells (IC50=0.3uM), a cell line that predominantly expresses AR-V7. In contrast, the compound did not affect the growth of a wide variety of non-tumorigenic cells, non-prostate tumor cell lines or PC3 cells, a prostate cell line that exhibits AR-independent cell growth. These results thereby identify a small molecule molecular degrader that can specifically induce the targeted protein degradation of the AR-V7 splice variant. Given the strong association of this isoform with treatment resistance, this approach would appear to provide an attractive strategy for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Prostate-specific antigen (PSA),Enzalutamide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yuan Liu<sup><\/sup>, Bo Lin<sup><\/sup>, Mads  B.

However, disease progression occurs when Ventoclax long-term treatment as a single agent driven by the recurrent Bcl-2 mutations, such as G101V, D103Y, D103E, et al. Here, we described the discovery of a next generation Bcl-2 inhibitor L105 with high potency against Bcl-2, Bcl-2(G101V) and Bcl-2(D103Y) for treatment of Bcl-2 dependent and venetoclax resistant hematological cancers.<br \/>Methods: Biochemical inhibition assays were conducted by TR-FRET based assay. Proliferation inhibition assays on a panel of hematologic tumor cells were carried out by MTS assay. Caspase-3 activation in RS4;11 was determined by western blot. Preclinical pharmacokinetics studies were assayed in mice and dogs and parameters were determined by LC-MS. <i>In vivo<\/i> pharmacodynamic studies were performed in RS4;11 and OCI-LY10 derived xenograft SCID mouse models. <i>In vitro<\/i> human platelet toxicity was measured by CellTiter-Glo assay. Cytochrome P450 inhibition was measured in fluorometric assay.<br \/>Results: In biochemical assays, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of L105 against Bcl-2 WT, Bcl-2 G101V, Bcl-2 D103Y, Bcl-2 D103E with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.42, 0.83, 0.97 and 5.78 nM respectively,while those of venetoclax were 1.89, 704.27, 470.19 and 243.30 nM respectively. In cellular assays, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of L105 in RS4;11, RS4;11 overexpressing Bcl-2 G101V, OCI-LY10, MV4-11, Mino, Toledo, Maver-1, SU-DHL-6 and REC-1 were 0.30-243.36 nM, while those of venetoclax were 2.91-3360.79 nM. L105 showed &#62;2000 folds Bcl-2 selectivity over Bcl-xL. Furthermore, <i>in vitro<\/i> platelet viability assay showed L105 induced hypotoxicity at similar level of venetoclax. In pharmacodynamics studies, 5mpk L105 induced more rapid and robust antitumor effect in RS4;11 xenograft than venetoclax at 10 mpk did, and 15mpk L105 showed significant longer and stronger tumor suppression response than venetoclax at 25 mpk did. In the preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, L105 showed excellent PK properties in ICR mice and beagle dogs, in terms of long T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> and high dose-normalized AUC. L105 also exhibited a less drug-drug interaction potential, as no evidence on CYPs inhibition (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62;20 &#956;M), while venetoclax potently inhibited CYP2C9 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> at 1.12 &#956;M. In 14-days oral gavage toxicity study in mice, no compound related deaths occurred at 15, 50 and 300 mpk, and only leukopenia was observed at similar level of venetoclax.<br \/>Conclusions: L105 showed great potency on wild type and acquisition resistance mutations of Bcl-2, excellent oral bioavailability, and superior preclinical anti-tumor activities and safety profiles. It may provide new thoughts on treatment for a wide range of Bcl-2-dependent and Venetoclax-resistant hematological cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcl-2 protein family,Small molecule inhibitor,Resistance,Hematology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xingguo Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yang Lou<sup>2<\/sup>, Yizhe Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Mingbo Su<sup>2<\/sup>, Anhui Gao<sup>2<\/sup>, Jinglai Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Li Zhong<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Xinglu Zhou<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>HealZen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Biopolar Hongye (Nantong) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Nantong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e6180467-95ec-4f40-8497-a4ef2015f7b3","ControlNumber":"5717","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Ecubectedin exhibits potent antitumor <i>in vitro<\/i> activity with mean GI<sub>50<\/sub> values in the very low nanomolar range. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift assays demonstrate that ecubectedin binds to DNA and experiments of <sup>3<\/sup>H-uridine incorporation show that the drug efficiently inhibits mRNA synthesis (85% reduction after 90 min). Moreover, ecubectedin specifically inhibits transactivated transcription, as evaluated in a reporter system of the transcriptional activity mediated by NF-&#954;B after activation with TNF&#945;. In the presence of ecubectedin, transactivation was almost completely abolished. The mechanism of transcriptional inhibition involves the stalling and irreversible proteasomal degradation of elongating RNA Pol II. As a final event, ecubectedin induces double strand breaks in the DNA, inducing cell cycle arrest in the S-phase that can be followed through flow cytometry and triggers apoptotic death of the tumor cell as seen through Annexin V flow cytometry assays. The <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity of ecubectedin was characterized in xenografted tumors of human origin in athymic <i>nu\/nu<\/i> mice, namely breast (MDA-MB-231), soft tissue sarcoma (HT-1080), SCLC (H526 and H82) and prostate (22Rv1).

Targeted therapies following hormonal or chemotherapeutic approaches offer some benefit. Subsequently, molecular profiling has identified over 100 mutations that render inhibitor resistance, creating challenges for physicians, patients, and the healthcare system broadly. While advances in therapeutic options have improved treatment outcomes by prolonging PFS with better QOL, long-term solutions remain a challenge for the majority of patients. The aim of our work is to drive strong mechanistic responses in this large patient population by developing targeted therapies to a key fundamental mechanism at the convergence of many oncogenic signaling pathways through which resistance arises. Our work in established cell lines and primary patient derived organoids demonstrated potent and complete responses in breast cancers that represent patient populations where unmet needs remain high including ER positive, TNBC, PTEN and RB null molecular profiles. The regulation of CAP dependent protein translation is a central element in oncogenesis. One of a family of CAP binding proteins, eIF4E serves to anchor the m7GTP CAP of RNA into several protein complexes and regulates multiple aspects of mRNA processing such as nuclear export and ribosomal translation. Previous communications revealed our eIF4E regulators potently cause cell death in primary breast cancer organoid models differentially to models derived from healthy tissue. We have expanded our efforts following our observations of both rapid apoptosis and differential sensitivity of healthy cells. In vitro, in breast cancer cells we observed stable responses in mechanistic markers of pharmacodynamic response, including phospho-Rb, with short term drug incubation. <i>In vivo<\/i>, in a ZR-75-1 breast CDX model, intermittent dosing (QW) of our lead compound resulted in strong tumor growth inhibition (&#62;95%). Consistent with growth impacts, we observed stable pharmacodynamic marker (p-Rb) changes in tumor tissue at 24 and 48 hours. To understand the impact on immune cells, we evaluated our regulators against primary cells including PBMCs, CD4+ T cells, and bone marrow mononuclear cells. Our eIF4E regulators did not impair survival of these cells up to a maximum tested dose of 25 micromolar. Primary CD4+ T cells were also functional in the presence of eIF4E regulators up to 5 micromolar, which included assessments of CD3\/CD28 stimulated cytokine production and proliferative responses. Our findings suggest that allosteric modulation of eIF4E provides a unique and efficient way to address multiple resistance mechanisms while sparing normal immune cellular function. Thus, our allosteric eIF4E regulators represent a potential beneficial therapeutic approach to address multiple resistant cancer patient populations and fulfill the promise of this elusive target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EIF4E,Breast cancer,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lisa-Marie Sturla<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xuemei Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Katherine Bowdish<sup>1<\/sup>, Susan  E.

KRAS cycles between GDP-loaded &#8216;off&#8217; and GTP-loaded &#8216;on&#8217; states induce downstream signal transduction to promote cell proliferation and survival. Interconversion between &#8216;on&#8217; and &#8216;off&#8217; states is assisted by SOS (Son of sevenless), a binary molecular switch of KRAS. SOS family as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) is composed of SOS1 and SOS2, but SOS1 is a node in the negative feedback regulation of the KRAS pathway while SOS2 is not. Since SOS1 is a direct upstream of KRAS, SOS1 inhibitor has the potential to be a pan-KRAS inhibitor affecting various cancers harboring diverse KRAS mutations. Here, we suggest HM99462 as a novel SOS1 inhibitor for KRAS regulation and present its promising druggability. We developed HM99462 for an orally bioavailable SOS1 inhibitor which abrogates GTP-binding to KRAS and the profile of drug potency and mechanism of action was examined with <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Biochemical activity on SOS1 was evaluated by a GTP-exchange assay on KRAS G12C, D, and V, and HM99462 showed excellent inhibitory activity, while SOS2 action was not affected. Moreover, HM99462 decreased ERK phosphorylation in various cancer cell lines harboring different major KRAS mutation statuses such as KRAS G12C, G12V, G12D, or G13D. Growth inhibition assay was performed using a three-dimensional (3D) conformation culture that mimics the complexity and heterogeneity of tumors and has elevated p-ERK. In this 3D spheroid growth inhibition assay, HM99462 demonstrated significantly effective GI<sub>50<\/sub> against various KRAS mutant cell lines. HM99462 also had almost no inhibition of seven CYP isozymes guided by the FDA, and a low plasma protein binding rate around 80%, offering high unbound drug concentration. Additionally, HM99462 was evaluated in cancer cell xenograft mouse models harboring various KRAS mutations. Reasonable tumor growth inhibition activity was shown within tolerable doses when administered alone. Also, the combination of HM99462 with KRAS G12C or MEK inhibitors led to synergistic anti-tumor activity in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i> models with several KRAS mutations. Through our exploratory study, a novel SOS1 inhibitor, HM99462 could be suggested as an appropriate therapeutic agent for diverse inhibitory activity against cancers causing by the hyperactivation of oncogenic KRAS signaling. And it has the potential to overcome the limitations of KRAS G12C or MEK inhibitor through combination. HM99462 is currently in IND enabling GLP-toxicity studies, planned to initiate clinical study in early 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,SOS1,Targeted therapy,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Seung Hyun Jung<sup><\/sup>, Jaeyul Choi<sup><\/sup>, Wongi Park<sup><\/sup>, Jooyun Byun<sup><\/sup>, Semi Lim<sup><\/sup>, Youngjoo Lee<sup><\/sup>, Yu-Yon Kim<sup><\/sup>, <b>Hyunjin Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, So-Ye Jeon<sup><\/sup>, Taehun Song<sup><\/sup>, Kyungjin Choi<sup><\/sup>, Tae-yeon Kong<sup><\/sup>, Heecheol Kim<sup><\/sup>, Wook Jang<sup><\/sup>, EunYoung Lee<sup><\/sup>, Minhwa Kim<sup><\/sup>, Young Gil Ahn<sup><\/sup>, Young Hoon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Kwee Hyun Suh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Research Center, Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hwaseong-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d236c678-f3fb-4dbc-a61e-dd95473eb78c","ControlNumber":"5655","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

In addition, ecDNA+ tumors have tremendous copy number heterogeneity mediated through acentric, non-Mendelian segregation. These properties afford ecDNA+ tumors with unparalleled genomic plasticity permitting circumvention of therapeutic pressure. However, these features also confer heightened levels of DNA replication stress (RS), and we have found that ecDNA amplified tumor cells are hyper-reliant on CHK1, a master regulator of the cellular RS response. We identified CHK1 as an ecDNA essential target in a CRISPR genetic screen using a methotrexate-induced ecDNA amplification model in HeLa cancer cells. ecDNA-dependent cell fitness assessment of CHK1 was confirmed using a flow cytometry-based CRISPR competition assay. The target was further validated using a CHK1 inhibitor (CHK1i) tool compound in MYC-amplified COLO320 isogenic cell lines that demonstrated a 10-fold enhanced cytotoxicity in the ecDNA amplified setting.Based on these results, we developed a highly potent, selective, and orally bioavailable CHK1i optimized as an ecDNA-directed therapeutic (ecDTx). An advanced lead, BBI-cmpd1, robustly induced RS biomarkers (e.g., pRPA) in ecDNA+ COLO320 tumor cells as compared to matched chromosomally-amplified (ecDNA-) COLO320 cells, consistent with the increased reliance on CHK1 to manage elevated RS in the ecDNA amplified setting.

Big data and artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug discovery platform and cell-based investigation identified PHI-501 repurposable against melanoma as a novel pan-RAF inhibitor. BRAF activated by the common V600E and other mutations, as well as by upstream NRAS mutation are frequent in malignant melanoma. Regardless of the therapeutic effect of class I BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, dabrafenib and encorafenib, melanoma patients with BRAF non-V600\/RAS mutations remain limited response. In this study, we evaluated PHI-501 to potently inhibit the tumor cell growth and overcome the limited response in melanoma.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The growth inhibitory activity of PHI-501 was determined using CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay in a panel of cancer cell lines. The effect of PHI-501 on anchorage independent growth and cell proliferation compared to vemurafenib or belvarafenib (pan-RAF inhibitor) were tested in A375 (BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>), C8161 (BRAF<sup>G464E<\/sup>) and SK-MEL-2 (NRAS<sup>Q61R<\/sup>) melanoma cell lines by soft agar assay, western blot and FACS analysis. To measure cell motility in a controlled environment, cells were cultured in monolayer followed by a wound-healing assay in a treatment with 0.1 &#181;M of each compound for 12 hours. Anti-tumor activities of PHI-501 were evaluated in A375 or C8161 xenograft mouse in vivo model.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> PHI-501 showed 3- to 119-fold more effective growth inhibition than other RAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and belvarafenib, in SK-MEL-2 (GI50: 0.15 &#181;M for PHI-501 vs 7.13 &#181;M and 0.37 &#181;M, respectively) and C8161 (GI50: 0.33 &#181;M for PHI-501 vs 39.56 &#181;M and 2.10 &#181;M, respectively) melanoma cell lines, and did not show a potential to paradoxical activation. PHI-501 induced melanoma cell apoptosis more efficiently than other RAF inhibitors, as shown in increased G0\/G1-arrested and annexin V-positive cell population and abundant cleavage of PARP1 after drug treatment. In the cell wound-healing assay, PHI-501 exhibited promising antimetastatic potential via inhibiting migration of all tested melanoma cells by up to 70%, unlike other RAF inhibitors. Anti-tumor activity of PHI-501 was dose-proportional in A375 xenograft model. Tumor growth was significantly reduced in C8161 xenograft mice treated with PHI-501 (TGI: 75.0%), compared with vehicle and vemurafenib (TGI: 12.3%).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> PHI-501, a novel pan-RAF inhibitor, has potent oral anti-tumor activity. Melanoma cells harboring BRAF non-V600\/NRAS or BRAF common V600E mutations exhibited significantly reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and inhibited migration upon treatment with PHI-501. The results of this study suggest that PHI-501 has a potential to overcome the limited response in the treatment of melanoma, and warrant evaluation of PHI-501 as a single agent to treat both BRAF-and NRAS-mutated metastatic melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Raf,Ras,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Namkyeong Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Jung Hee Park<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Ky-Youb Nam<sup>2<\/sup>, June H-J Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Kyu-Tae Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Sandip Sengupta<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeong Hyeok Yoon<sup>2<\/sup>, Taebo Sim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Graduate School of Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Pharos iBio Co., Ltd., Anyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e2784dd6-566e-4e0a-88f8-f7c37e3dbaeb","ControlNumber":"5442","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;N.

Analysis of systematic RNAi and CRISPR screening data has previously revealed that WRN is essential for the survival of cancer cell lines with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). We have developed potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors of WRN helicase (WRNi) and showed that pharmacological inhibition of WRN causes lethality and induction of DNA damage markers selectively in MSI-H cancer cell lines compared to microsatellite-stable (MSS) cell lines. Screening of WRNi across a large panel of pooled, barcoded cell lines in the PRISM format revealed selective sensitivity in MSI-H cell lines and showed that pharmacological inhibition of WRN is highly correlated with genetic ablation of WRN across this panel, confirming selectivity for WRN. In vivo evaluation demonstrated robust and MSI-selective tumor regressions.

Halda has invented an innovative cancer treatment approach that does not rely on oncogenic drivers. Regulated Induced Proximity Targeting Chimera (RIPTAC&#8482;) therapeutics are heterobifunctional small molecules that work via a hold and kill mechanism that has the potential to overcome drug resistance mechanisms. RIPTAC therapeutics function by holding together two proteins, a cancer-specific protein, and a protein with essential function (EP) in a ternary complex, resulting in abrogation of the essential function and subsequent cancer cell death. We exemplify this platform to treat metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), where the RIPTAC therapeutic utilizes the Androgen Receptor (AR) as a tumor specific protein to selectively inhibit an essential protein involved in transcriptional regulation and provide in vivo efficacy coupled with a therapeutic index. Methods: RIPTACs therapeutics were assayed for their ability to form a ternary complex with AR and the EP using a novel TR-FRET based assay in VCaP prostate cancer cells that harbor AR amplification. Selective apoptosis in ARhigh cells was observed using a Caspase 3\/7 Glo assay (Promega). EP pharmacodynamic modulation was ascertained using qRT-PCR and western blotting in both in vitro and in vivo samples. RIPTACs were optimized for oral bioavailability, and tumor ternary complex formation in prostate cancer cell line-derived xenograft models.Results: RIPTAC therapeutics display nanomolar in vitro potency in AR:RIPTAC:EP ternary complex formation, which results in abrogation of the EP function and antiproliferative activity in prostate cancer cell lines, but not in AR-knockout control cells. The prostate cancer RIPTAC therapeutics are active in vitro against clinically relevant AR mutants. Lead molecules utilizing AR as a tumor specific protein are orally bioavailable in multiple preclinical species and induce ternary complex formation in VCaP tumor xenografts grown in mice. We present in vivo data where lead RIPTACs demonstrate significant tumor growth inhibition in several prostate cancer models and induce tumor regressions in VCaP xenografts grown in castrated male mice. Conclusions: Taken together, our in vitro mechanistic data and in vivo PD\/efficacy observations in multiple prostate cancer models support further investigation of prostate cancer RIPTAC therapeutics as a novel heterobifunctional therapeutic modality in mCRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Heterobifunctional molecules,RIPTAC,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xinheng Yu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kyle  J.

As heterogeneity is an important characteristic of cancer, precision medicine has become a core strategy in treating cancer patients. One approach for targeted therapeutics is the delivery of prodrugs designed to be activated by tumor-associated enzymes (TAEs). SULT1A1, a sulfotransferase enzyme, is overexpressed in about 5-15% of cancer patients including breast, prostate, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC); however, it is either not expressed or expressed at low levels in most normal tissue. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that SULT1A1 overexpression in tumors is correlated with worse patient prognosis. We have identified a new compound, FIS103, which is a small molecule anti-cancer prodrug that is activated by SULT1A1. This class of compounds, N-benzyl indole carbinols (N-BICs), cause rapid cell death by inducing widespread non-specific covalent alkylation of proteins in the cancer cell. Here, we show FIS103, an N-BIC analog, has potent antitumor activity in SULT1A1 high-expressing RCC cell lines (A498 and Caki-1) and has no effect in the SULT1A1 low-expressing cells (786-O and ACHN), indicating low toxicity in the absence of SULT1A1. <i>In silico<\/i> modeling validated the SULT1A1-FIS103 interaction. Furthermore, FIS103 demonstrates potent SULT1A1-dependent antitumor activity in NU\/J mouse xenografts injected with A498 (RCC) cells. Remarkably, the tumors in mice became non-detectable 14 days post-FIS103 treatment and remained absent through the study conclusion (41 days). Since only a subset of patients will express this enzyme, it is critical to identify those who are more likely to respond. Thus, a companion diagnostic to screen for patients whose tumors overexpress SULT1A1 is essential to the success of this approach. Collectively, targeted therapeutics aims to ultimately move patient care away from broadly toxic, non-specific chemotherapies, and towards more rationally designed treatments. By developing our drug and the companion diagnostic, we believe we can provide an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of cancers in a subset of patients who fail standard chemotherapy - either as a standalone therapy, or in rationale combination with other drug options. Therefore, the development of FIS103 has the potential to improve survival as well as quality of life of RCC patients and may have application in other SULT1A1 expressing cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prodrugs,Tumor targeting,Renal cell carcinoma,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ross Hamilton<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Leniher Castan<sup><\/sup>, Stephanie Vega<sup><\/sup>, Atul Varadhachary<sup><\/sup>, Dev Chatterjee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Fannin, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"574294f3-8e82-439b-aa27-5a7f24bf8d30","ControlNumber":"4922","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

About 75% to 80% of patients with GIST have mutations in the <i>KIT<\/i> gene, while 5% to 10% have mutations in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor &#945; (<i>PDGFRA<\/i>) gene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) offer patients an improved quality of life but increased pharmacological resistance to TKIs is often observed. BCL-2 is expressed in &#62;80% of GISTs, and amplification of BCL-2 and BCL-xL are common features associated with disease progression. One approach to enhance GIST eradication is to concurrently inhibit oncogenic KIT signaling while actively engaging apoptotic pathways. Olverembatinib (HQP1351) is a new, third-generation TKI that targets <i>BCR-ABL1<\/i>, <i>KIT<\/i> and <i>PDGFRA<\/i> and is currently in development for relapsed or refractory chronic myeloid leukemia and GIST. Lisaftoclax (APG-2575) is a selective BCL-2 inhibitor under development for hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether combining a BCL-2 inhibitor, lisaftoclax, with olverembatinib enhances treatment effect on imatinib-resistant GISTs. Compared to imatinib-sensitive GIST cell lines (GIST882 and GIST-T1), increased BCL-2 protein expression was observed in imatinib-resistant GIST cells, particularly in GIST430, GIST48, and GIST48B lines. Cell-based antiproliferation studies showed additive activity of olverembatinib and lisaftoclax in imatinib-resistant GIST cells. In vivo studies using imatinib-resistant GIST430 cell-derived xenograft models further revealed that coadministration of olverembatinib at 15 mg\/kg (every other day for 3 weeks) with lisaftoclax at 50 mg\/kg (daily for 3 weeks) resulted in enhanced antitumor effects compared to either agent alone. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rates for combined treatment with olverembatinib and lisaftoclax reached 76.8%, which was superior to the TGI rate of either agent alone: 57.6% and 31.2% for olverembatinib and lisaftoclax, respectively. Regarding putative mechanisms, olverembatinib treatment was shown to downregulate BCL-xL and MCL-1 protein expression, possibly via inhibition of KIT signal pathway and downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Lisaftoclax triggered apoptosis by disrupting the BCL-2:BIM complex. Therefore, selective inhibition of BCL-2, aided by TKI-mediated MCL-1 and BCL-XL inhibition, markedly augmented cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), thus triggering apoptosis and subsequently enhancing antitumor effects. Our results demonstrate that olverembatinib and BCL-2 inhibitor lisaftoclax have additive antitumor effects in imatinib-resistant GIST. This novel dual approach may have the potential for treating patients with GISTs whose disease has progressed after treatment with TKIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GIST,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ping Min<sup>1<\/sup>, Guangfeng Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Eric Liang<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Bingxing Wu<sup>3<\/sup>, Huidan Yu<sup>3<\/sup>, Dajun Yang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yifan Zhai<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ascentage Pharma Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Ascentage Pharma Group Inc., Rockville, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>Ascentage Pharma Co., Ltd., Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4f7e2fd3-aaff-4d5f-a8da-e11fbe66b83b","ControlNumber":"5506","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

Most UM cases have activating mutations in genes encoding G protein subunits alpha Q or 11, leading to activation of downstream effectors. These include protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK1\/3; also termed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2\/1 [ERK2&#8260;ERK1], respectively), and yes-associated protein, suggesting a rationale for therapeutically targeting these related pathways. Genetic analyses show that <i>TP53<\/i> is infrequently mutated in UM, but associated pathways may be functionally inactivated. Ubiquitination-mediated degradation of p53 activates MAPK signaling, such that, active p53 may promote suppression of MAPK signaling. Alrizomadlin (APG-115) is a small molecule targeting p53\/MDM2 that is in clinical development for solid and hematologic cancers. This study evaluated the antitumor effect of alrizomadlin, alone or combined with other targeted therapies, in preclinical models of UM. In cell-based antiproliferation assays of many UM cell lines, alrizomadlin exerted moderate growth inhibitory effects (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 0.151-1.857&#956;M). When combined with inhibitors against mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) [trametinib and selumetinib], mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [rapamycin], focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [defactinib and Ascentage&#8217;s APG-2449, which targets FAK\/ALK\/ROS1], and MEK\/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma [RAF] [VS-6766], alrizomadlin demonstrated enhanced antiproliferative activity. In a UM xenograft model (MP41), alrizomadlin showed dose-dependent antitumor activity when administered at 25, 50, and 100 mg\/kg, with tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rates of 24.8%, 38%, and 39.1%, respectively. In this model, synergistic antitumor effects were observed when alrizomadlin was combined with selumetinib or APG-2449, with TGI rates of 65.4% and 47.5%, respectively. Mechanistically, alrizomadlin likely increased p53, MDM2, and downstream p21 in MP41 cells. Importantly, alrizomadlin inhibited ERK phosphorylation and enhanced selumetinib inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Prior studies indicated that FAK can suppress p53 by enhancing MDM2-dependent p53 ubiquitination. In this study, APG-2449 showed dose-dependent inhibition of FAK phosphorylation and upregulation of p53. Alrizomadlin also inhibited phosphorylation of FAK and downstream ERK. Therefore, the combination of alrizomadlin and APG-2449 was synergistic. Combining MEK and FAK inhibitors also markedly augmented caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) cleavage (apoptosis hallmarks) and enhanced observed antitumor effects. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the potential utility of combining alrizomadlin with MAPK pathway inhibitors to treat patients with UM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Apoptosis,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),MDM2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Guangfeng Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Eric Liang<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Ping Min<sup>1<\/sup>, Dajun Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yifan Zhai<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ascentage Pharma Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Ascentage Pharma Group Inc., Rockville, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c9c34dde-d54c-41f8-8b99-7dcc37803474","ControlNumber":"5071","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

Suppression of &#946;-catenin\/TCF transcription has also been reported by inhibiting cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase (PDE) and the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Here we characterize a potent and selective non-COX inhibitory sulindac derivative, ADT-030, that inhibits cancer cell growth by blocking RAS and &#946;-catenin signaling.<br \/><b>METHODS AND RESULTS: <\/b>ADT-030 inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cells expressing the PDE10A isozyme, while normal airway cells lacking PDE10A displayed reduced sensitivity. ADT-030 inhibited recombinant PDE10 activity at concentrations that inhibit lung cancer cells proliferation. ADT-030 induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and morphological characteristics of autophagy blockage. A cellular thermal stability assay showed that ADT-030 binds both RAS and PDE10 in lysates from cancer cells with nanomolar affinity. Consistent with its PDE10 inhibitory activity, ADT-030 activated PKG and phosphorylated &#946;-catenin on amino acid residues known to induce proteasomal degradation, and reduced levels of the unphosphorylated (oncogenic stabilized) form of &#946;-catenin. Consistent with its ability to directly bind RAS, ADT-030 also inhibited EGF-stimulated MAPK\/AKT signaling. Oral administration of ADT-030 inhibited tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of lung cancer, providing a durable survival response with 25% tumor-free mice at dosages having no discernable toxicity. ADT-030 was also highly efficacious in two different chemical-induced mouse models of lung tumorigenesis suppressing the carcinogen-activation of RAS, as well as in multiple mouse subcutaneous tumor models, including highly aggressive models of metastasis.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS: <\/b>These results support further development of ADT-030, a novel inhibitor of RAS and &#946;-catenin signaling for the treatment of lung cancer and other RAS driven cancers, including those with co-occurring mutations in the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway.<br \/><b>Supported by NIH grants <\/b><b>R01 CA238514, <\/b><b>R01 CA197147, <\/b><b>R01 CA254197<\/b><b>.<\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,&#946;-catenin,Sulindac,Durable survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Veronica Ramirez-Alcantara<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xi Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Michele A.

In PDAC, the overactive KRAS-MEK-ERK pathway is critical to maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Important recent work has shown that when MEK or ERK are inhibited, PDAC upregulates and becomes increasingly dependent on autophagy. Autophagy, the recycling of cellular material through lysosomal degradation, has already been previously established to be upregulated in and crucial to PDAC in order survive in its harsh microenvironment and allows PDAC to evade the immune system. Unfortunately, chloroquine (CQ), the only clinical-grade autophagy inhibitor tested in PDAC failed to improve patient survival in combination with chemotherapies in phase II trials. Recently, our lab reported a novel phase I-cleared multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ESK981 which disrupted autophagy and had substantial single agent efficacy in prostate cancer models. Given the importance of autophagy in PDAC and the ongoing clinical trials testing autophagy inhibitor CQ in combination with MEK\/ERK inhibitors, this study aims to evaluate ESK981 as a therapeutic agent for PDAC, particularly its ability to potentiate MEK inhibitors&#8217; antiproliferative effects in PDAC.<br \/><b><u>Methods and Results <\/u><\/b>In mouse and human PDAC cell lines, we observed an accumulation of LC3A\/B as well as P62 when treated with ESK981, suggesting a disruption of autophagic flux. To confirm an inhibition of autophagy, we used the GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3&#916;G reporter system in Mia-Paca2 cells and saw that the GFP:RFP ratio was maintained near 1:1. To assess the effects of ESK981 on cell growth, we used Cell-Titer Glo assays which revealed that ESK981 suppresses proliferation of a panel of human and mouse PDAC cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. To further evaluate ESK981&#8217;s potential clinical applications, we evaluated ESK981&#8217;s ability to synergize with MEK inhibitor Trametinib. Using the GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3&#916;G reporter system we saw that Trametinib decreased the GFP:RFP ratio as expected. When cells were pre-treated with ESK981, the ratio was increased, showing that ESK981 was able to block Trametinib-induced autophagic flux. Finally, using Cell-Titer Glo, we determined that ESK981 and Trametinib had a strong synergistic effect on suppressing cell proliferation (BLISS Score &#62;20) on mouse KPC line 7940B. Taken together, ESK981 is a promising autophagy inhibitor that shows strong anti-proliferative effects on both human and mouse PDAC cell lines as a single agent as well as in combination with Trametinib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Pancreatic cancer,MEK inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Caleb Cheng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jasmine Wisniewski<sup>1<\/sup>, Bailey Jackson<sup>1<\/sup>, Yi Bao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuanyuan Qiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Costas  A.

This selectivity was further confirmed via testing OKI-1546 against an affinity-based kinase panel. OKI-1546 potently inhibited proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values that correlated with 50% inhibition of CTD pSer2.

Tumor cells can inactivate the STING pathway to avoid immune recognition, emphasizing its importance in generating tumor-specific immunity. Broad activation of STING in advanced cancers may be required to initiate CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell priming against unique antigenic repertoires among distinct metastases and to reverse an immune-suppressive TME. Due its ubiquitous expression, systemic delivery of untargeted STING agonists may not achieve a therapeutic index. In contrast, expression of the cytosolic DNAse 3&#8217; repair exonuclease (TREX1) is upregulated in tumor cells in response to genomic instability, inflammatory stimuli, and DNA replication, providing an opportunity for selective activation of the STING pathway. In addition to modulating cGAS\/STING signaling, interaction with DNA replication enzymes that generate immunogenic DNA waste highlight a facet of TREX1 biology that may inform clinical development of targeted inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: Using a structure-based drug design strategy, we designed and optimized small-molecule inhibitors of TREX1 with drug-like physicochemical properties that were profiled in biochemical and cell-based assays. X-ray crystallography studies, thermal shift, and biochemical assays were employed to determine mechanism of action. We evaluated the in vivo profile of select compounds.<br \/>Results: Inhibitors of TREX1 with &#60; 100 &#181;M potency were optimized into a series with nanomolar potency against purified, recombinant murine and human TREX1 protein in biochemical assays. Inhibitors had similar IC<sub>50<\/sub> values against TREX1 nuclease in an intact cell-based assay. Finally, TSA results demonstrated that compound interaction required magnesium. To our knowledge, we produced the first high-resolution co-crystal structures of inhibitor-bound human TREX1. We used this to dissect mouse- and human-specific interactions, confirming MOA predicted by earlier modeling efforts. Lead compounds demonstrated good bioavailability and achieved exposures necessary for target engagement in mouse models and resulted in tumor growth inhibition when combined with sub-therapeutic doses of doxorubicin.<br \/>Conclusions: We present the identification and characterization of a potential first-in-class TREX1 inhibitor with nanomolar potency against human and mouse TREX1. Treatment with TREX1 inhibitors conferred profound anti-tumor activity when combined with DNA-damaging agents. Here we demonstrate that targeting TREX1 can specifically and locally engage the STING pathway in the tumor microenvironment, enhance tumor-specific immunity, and provide therapeutic benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,TREX1,Innate immunity,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Valerie Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Brian Francica<sup><\/sup>, David Hsieh<sup><\/sup>, Dave Freund<sup><\/sup>, Anja Holtz<sup><\/sup>, Saheli Samanta<sup><\/sup>, Jamie Cope<sup><\/sup>, Ryan Clark<sup><\/sup>, Peppi Prasit<sup><\/sup>, Anne Moon<sup><\/sup>, Henry Johnson<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Dubensky<sup><\/sup>, Dara Burdette<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Tempest Therapeutics, Brisbane, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cdd349e5-003a-417f-9197-ce6bbe9308a5","ControlNumber":"5192","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;V.

Evaluation of IDE397 efficacy across a panel of 48 <i>MTAP<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> PDX models revealed consistent tumor growth inhibition (TGI&#62;60%) across diverse lineages, with distinct enrichment of tumor regressions in squamous lung cancers. To further enhance the efficacy of IDE397 within and among tumor lineages, we sought to identify rational combination partners. A three-pronged approach was employed that dovetailed molecular profiling of IDE397 drug effects <i>in vivo<\/i>, chemogenomic evaluation of selective drug sensitivities in <i>MTAP<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cell lines across the CCLE, and high-throughput <i>in vitro<\/i> drug combination screens. Unbiased pathway analysis of IDE397-dependent changes in <i>MTAP<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> PDX transcriptomes revealed perturbations in pre-mRNA splicing, DNA damage repair, and mitotic spindle assembly as commonly enriched across diverse models. Evaluation of altered pre-mRNA splicing patterns suggested that many of these changes may be a consequence of selective impairment of PRMT5-dependent support of spliceosome activity. Notably, sensitivities to drugs that inhibit the fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing, genome stability, and microtubule stability were enriched in <i>MTAP<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cell lines, suggesting that the biological processes selectively altered by IDE397 in tumors are already partially impaired by <i>MTAP<\/i> deletion. Finally, an IDE397 <i>in vitro<\/i> drug combination viability screen of over 400 drugs returned taxanes, platins, topoisomerase inhibitors, splicing inhibitors, and anti-folates as selectively synergistic with IDE397 in <i>MTAP<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> models.

Most early-stage PCa are dependent on overexpression of the androgen receptor (AR) and are therefore sensitive to androgen deprivation therapies. However, eventual resistance to standard medical castration and secondary chemotherapies including next&#8208;generation AR-targeting agents like abiraterone or enzalutamide and taxanes (Docetaxel or cabazitaxel) is nearly universal. Further, neuroendocrine PCa or NEPC, a poorly differentiated aggressive variant of PCa that lacks AR expression, and the presence of cancer stem-like cells with self-renewal and differentiation (epithelial to mesenchymal trans-differentiation or EMT) capacities significantly contribute to the development of clinically most aggressive and lethal variants of PCa. Endogenous Ras\/ERK\/MAPK signaling is known to drive prostate tumor formation, cancer progression, cell migration, and the acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype (EMT) in metastatic prostate cancers. Ras family members are responsible for modulating the function of most of the receptors upregulated in advanced PCa, including AR, so that AR can be functional even in the absence of physiologic levels of androgen. Previous studies have reported that the NSAID, sulindac, inhibits Ras-induced transformation and directly binds Ras. In this study, we show that a non-COX inhibitory sulindac derivative, ADT-007, is a potent drug candidate against lethal PCa. First, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing as a biomarker-based drug screen and showed that chemo-resistant, drug-tolerant, stem-cell-like PCa cell clusters had high expression of Ras genes, indicating that the Ras inhibitor, ADT-007, may be effective in targeting these aggressive subclones. Next, using several cell-based assays on a large panel of lethal PCa cell lines representing metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC), NEPC as well as African American ancestry, we showed that ADT-007 is highly effective as a single-agent and in combination with taxanes. Combination index values were &#60;0.7, and BLISS scores were &#62;10, indicating very high synergy. Finally, using pre-vs-post-treatment bulk RNAseq, we demonstrated that ADT-007 is indeed effective in downregulating KRas and NRas in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) predicted significant downregulation of cell cycle, DNA replication, CCND1, AR, and the lncRNA ELDR, and upregulation of autophagy and interferon pathway genes, and the microRNA miR-96. Finally, using PCa patient datasets, we showed that ADT-007 is potentially capable of reversing the expression of several genes associated with biochemical recurrence. Thus, our results show that ADT-007 is a novel drug candidate that circumvents subclonal aggressiveness, drug resistance, and stemness in lethal PCa through simultaneous inhibition of multiple oncogenic factors\/pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Single cell,Prostate cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Taraswi Mitra Ghosh<sup><\/sup>, Adam  B.

Oncogene addicted solid tumors are under high stress levels, both extrinsic as well as intrinsic, and are dependent on a well-balanced ISR pathway activity to cope with the high demand for accelerated growth. The ISR is well known to be a double edge sword of survival and cell death and depending on context, the activation of the ISR kinase, GCN2, and downstream pathway can have either cytoprotective or cytotoxic effects. Given the context-dependent nature of the ISR pathway, the inhibition or stimulation of GCN2 in solid tumors can be pharmacologically leveraged to induce anti-tumoral effects.<br \/>Methods: Modulation of ISR kinases was characterized using enzymatic assays. Kinome selectivity profiling was determined using enzymatic and cellular assays. Cellular modulation of the ISR pathway (phospho-GCN2, ATF4, CHOP) or the apoptosis pathway (PARP and Caspase3\/7) was assessed via Western blot or ELISA. <i>In vivo <\/i>upregulation of tumoral ATF4 was determined in a fibrosarcoma PK\/PD xenograft model. <i>In vivo<\/i> inhibition of tumor growth was determined in solid tumor xenografts.<br \/>Results: Selective and potent modulators of GCN2 kinase with favorable drug-like properties were designed. These compounds were found to upregulate components of the ISR pathway (phospho-GCN2, ATF4, CHOP). The mechanism by which GCN2 modulator DP-9149 treatment induced the ISR pathway was found to be through the direct binding and activation of GCN2. Upregulation of the ISR pathway downstream of GCN2 led to induction of a programmed cell death pathway in oncogene-driven solid tumor cell lines <i>in vitro. <\/i>DP-9149-mediated activation of the ISR pathway led to cell growth arrest both as a single agent and in combination with standard-of-care (SOC) agents. Furthermore, oral dosing of DP-9149 in RAS mutant and other oncogene-driven xenograft models <i>in vivo <\/i>induced ATF4, and significantly inhibited tumor growth as a single agent and in combination with SOC agents. Additionally, therapeutic agents targeting the tumor microenvironment, including anti-angiogenic agents, synergized with DP-9149 to induce tumor regressions <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: The ISR is a targetable vulnerability in oncogene addicted solid tumors. Upregulating the ISR by paradoxical activation of the ISR family member kinase, GCN2, by DP-9149 can be leveraged as a novel mechanism to cause anti-tumoral effects in solid tumors <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo, <\/i>likely through the induction of an unresolved stress response.

The ISR kinase family member PERK controls one of the three arms of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR is considered an Achilles&#8217; heel in B-cell cancers. Multiple myeloma (MM) and B-cell lymphomas are dependent on a well-balanced UPR pathway to cope with the high demand for protein folding and their secretory nature. Given the double-edge sword nature of the UPR, the activation of PERK and downstream pathway can have cytoprotective or cytotoxic effects. In B-cell cancers the UPR is at close to maximum cytoprotective capacity, such that further pharmacological stimulation of PERK can potentially be leveraged to cause a cancer cell cytotoxic response and induce antitumoral effects.<br \/>Methods: Modulation of ISR kinases was characterized using enzymatic assays. Kinome selectivity profiling was determined using enzymatic and cellular assays. Cellular assays of PERK activation assessed ATF4 by ELISA. Cellular assays of GCN2 modulation assessed phospho-GCN2 and ATF4 by Western blot or ELISA (under basal or low amino acid conditions). DP-9024-induced upregulation of components of the ISR\/UPR pathway (ATF4, CHOP) or the apoptosis pathway (PARP and Caspase 3\/7) was measured by Western blot or ELISA assays. Compound-mediated PERK activation was investigated mechanistically using a cellular nanoBRET dimerization assay. <i>In vivo <\/i>upregulation of tumoral ATF4 was determined in a MM PK\/PD xenograft model. <i>In vivo <\/i>inhibition of tumor growth was determined in MM and B-cell lymphoma xenografts.<br \/>Results: DP-9024 was designed as a selective and potent modulator of PERK and GCN2. DP-9024 was found to upregulate the ISR\/UPR pathway (ATF4, CHOP). The mechanism by which DP-9024 treatment induced the UPR pathway was found to be through the dimerization and activation of PERK. Upregulation of the UPR pathway downstream of PERK led to induction of apoptosis (PARP and Caspase 3\/7) in MM and B-cell lymphoma lines <i>in vitro. <\/i>DP-9024 mediated activation of the UPR pathway in cell lines with high basal level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress led to growth arrest in combination with FDA approved therapies. Oral dosing of DP-9024 in MM xenograft models induced ATF4, and combination efficacy was observed in MM and B-cell lymphoma xenografts in combination with FDA approved agents <i>in vivo. <\/i><br \/>Conclusions: The ISR\/UPR is a targetable vulnerability in cancers with high basal levels of ER stress. DP-9024 increases UPR signaling via activating PERK dimerization. This novel mechanism leads to antitumoral effects in B-cell cancers <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>likely through the induction of unresolved ER stress, which may potentially provide an alternative mechanism to current UPR targeting therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATF4,PERK,Integrated Stress Response,Unfolded Protein Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gada Al-Ani<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Qi Groer<sup><\/sup>, Aaron  J.
