[{"Abstract":"Hyaluronan, one of the major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), surrounds and protects neighboring cells from diverse stresses. Hyaluronan promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in various epithelial cancers. However, the mechanism by which the hyaluronan network built up by cancer cells regulates cancer progression and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment has not been elucidated in detail. In this study, ITIH2, a hyaluronan-binding protein that participates in building a hyaluronan network, was confirmed to be secreted from mesenchymal-like lung cancer cells when co-cultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts. ITIH2 was transcriptionally upregulated by ZEB1, an EMT-inducing transcription factor. Hyaluronic acid synthase-2 (HAS2) was also up-regulated by ZEB1, and the expression of HAS2 and ZEB1 showed a positive correlation in the TCGA database. In addition, ZEB1 controlled alternative splicing and isoform expression of CD44, a hyaluronan receptor. Interestingly, ITIH2 knockdown and 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a HAS inhibitor, reduced the formation of hyaluronan cables and inhibited the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Likewise, when lung cancer cells were treated with &#8220;Compound S,&#8221; an ITIH2 inhibitor predicted by a deep learning-based drug-target interaction algorithm, the formation of hyaluronan cables and cell migration were suppressed. In addition, the ITIH2 inhibitor prevented the growth of metastatic tumors in an orthotopic lung cancer mouse model. Collectively, the EMT signal controlled by ZEB1 establishes the pro-metastatic hyaluronan network in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a novel strategy for targeting the hyaluronan network to suppress lung cancer progression and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Hyaluronan,ZEB1,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sieun Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jihye Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Eun Ju Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Sungsoo Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonathan  M.

Evidence has shown over the past decade that cancer-associated&#8203; fibroblasts (CAFs) play essential roles in various types of cancers, including GC, such as tumorigenesis, therapy resistance, and immunosuppression, which contribute to the progress of tumors. Although GC tumors are known to be enriched with stroma, the molecular mechanisms of how GC tumors foster the fibrotic milieu is still largely unknown. Here we analyzed a large-scale genomic and transcriptomic dataset of GC to identify GC tumor cell-intrinsic factors for developing fibroblast-rich microenvironments&#8203;.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed GC patient samples with gene expression data and copy number variation profiles from the Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) (N = 271). The microenvironment cell populations-counter (MCP-counter) method was used for transcriptome deconvolution to estimate the population of fibroblasts and immune cells in GC tumors. Genes with q value &#60; 0.05 and fold change &#62; 1.5 were defined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identified using the Subio Platform. The copy number amplified genes found in more than 3% of the samples were selected as amplified genes. Pathway and process enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis were performed using Metascape.<br \/>Results: We analyzed MCP-counter outputs and observed a fibroblast-enriched population with few infiltrations of anti-tumor immune cells, such as CD8 T cells and cytotoxic T cells in GC patients, suggesting the immunosuppressive role of CAFs in the GC tumor. By analyzing 933 DEGs upregulated in fibroblast-high patients, we found 96 genes with frequent copy number amplification that were not listed on the curated stroma and extracellular matrix-related genes and thus potentially tumor cell-intrinsic genes correlated with the abundance of the stroma. Pathway and protein-interaction analyses revealed that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway was enriched in these genes, including <i>HTR2A<\/i>, <i>AGTR1<\/i>, <i>FZD1<\/i>, <i>CALCRL<\/i>, and <i>NBEA<\/i> with strong correlations between fibroblast score (Spearman's r &#62; 0.55), implying that these signaling in GC tumor cells contribute to promoting fibroblast-enriched microenvironment.<br \/>Conclusions: Bioinformatic analyses of a publicly available genomic and transcriptomic dataset revealed a fibroblast-rich and immune-excluded population in GC patients. Several GPCR signaling in tumor cells were strongly correlated with fibroblast abundance in tumors, and these signaling pathways have potential roles in promoting the stroma-rich GC microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Gastric cancer,Gene expression analysis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Takashi Semba<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yiling Tong<sup>1<\/sup>, Feng Wei<sup>1<\/sup>, Atsuko Yonemura<sup>1<\/sup>, Tadahito Yasuda<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomoyuki Uchihara<sup>1<\/sup>, Huaito Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hideo Baba<sup>2<\/sup>, Takatsugu Ishimoto<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gastrointestinal cancer biology, International Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d4080301-5136-4d5f-b2a5-b1fa0fa1ac5a","ControlNumber":"216","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

In human melanoma, ABCB5-positive CIC subpopulations have been shown to preferentially express the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and PD-L1, and tumor-intrinsic PD-1 receptor functions have been found to promote tumor growth, even in mice lacking adaptive immunity. In HCC, where ABCB5 mediates CIC chemoresistance, PD-1 expression has also recently been identified. However, whether ABCB5 regulates tumor-intrinsic PD-1 expression in HCC or other malignancies is currently unknown. Here, we employed RNA interference in Hep G2 HCC cells with high endogenous ABCB5 expression to study the potential role of ABCB5 in regulating PD-1 expression, utilizing the ABCB5 shRNA target sequence GCTGGAAAGATAGCAACTGAA for ABCB5 knockdown (KD) as described previously. Endogenous ABCB5 levels in ABCB5-KD cells were successfully reduced by 92.8% compared to controls. Investigation of the effects of ABCB5-KD on tumor-intrinsic immune checkpoint molecule expression and on expression of the HCC-CIC marker GRN revealed that ABCB5-KD significantly reduced PD-1 expression by 98.0%, and PD-L1 expression by 62.8% compared to controls. Expression of GRN was also significantly reduced in ABCB5-KD cells by 78.8% compared to controls, suggesting ABCB5 KD-dependent loss of CIC phenotype. Injection of ABCB5-KD cells in NSG mice showed 32.3% reduction in tumor size at endpoint (6 weeks) compared to controls (728.7 &#177; 199.3mm<sup>3<\/sup> vs 1076.0 &#177; 450.9 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mean &#177; SD; p&#60;0.005, repeated measures ANOVA) and 8.53% reduction in tumor weight at endpoint (0.47 &#177; 0.21g vs 0.51 &#177; 0.21g, mean &#177; SD). These results provide initial evidence in an HCC cell line model system that ABCB5 functionally regulates tumor-intrinsic PD-1 and PD-L1 expression. They therefore suggest that ABCB5 blockade represents a novel therapeutic strategy for targeted inhibition of pro-tumorigenic tumor-intrinsic PD-1\/PD-L1 expression, with important additional implications for immune checkpoint-targeted cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ABC transporters,PD-1,PD-L1,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chun Philip Yeung<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Brian  J.

GCs are primary produced from cholesterol in the adrenals via the <i>de novo<\/i> synthetic pathway. In some tissues, however, there is also a recycling pathway in which the enzyme 11&#946;-HSD1 generates GCs from the inactive metabolites dehydrocorticosterone (rodent) or cortisone (human). Here we find that multiple tumor types produce GCs via 11&#946;-HSD1 <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We used CRISPR\/Cas9 technology to knock out <i>Hsd11b1<\/i> in GC-producing tumor cell lines and found that lack of 11&#946;-HSD1 in B16 melanoma, Panc02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and MC38 colon carcinoma lines reduced their growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Reduced tumor growth corresponded with increased expression of the activation marker CD44 and production of the effector cytokines IFN&#947; and TNF&#945; by tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (TILs). Rather than directly suppressing effector cell function, recent findings have suggested that GCs instead act primarily by activating Treg cells, and that these Treg are responsible for inhibition of effector cell function. Consistent with this, we found that tumor-derived GCs upregulate Treg expression of miRNA-342, which downregulates the mTOR component Rictor and activates Treg activity<i>.<\/i> A role of tumor-derived GCs in enhancing Treg function was demonstrated by inoculating tumor cells into mice with Treg-specific glucocorticoid receptor deficiency (GR<sup>Foxp3Cre<\/sup> mice). Notably, growth of tumors was reduced in GR<sup>Foxp3Cre<\/sup> mice, along with increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TIL activation. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of 11&#946;-HSD1 reduced WT tumor growth to the same degree as knockout of 11&#946;-HSD1, and rendered immunotherapy-resistant tumors susceptible to inhibition with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Given that 11&#946;-HSD1 expression is upregulated in many human tumors, these data suggest that its inhibition, which has been accomplished in a number of phase 3 clinical trials for other indications and is well-tolerated, may be beneficial in their treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glucocorticoid receptor,Regulatory T cells,Tumor microenvironment,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shizuka Otsuka<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew  D.

Our understanding of the role of angiogenesis in immune regulation continues to improve, and combinations of anti-angiogenesis and immune checkpoint blockade demonstrate improved clinical efficacy, as well as mechanisms for improved immune cell trafficking. Tumor biopsies from a phase I study with 46 advanced melanoma patients treated with Ipilimumab and Bevacizumab combination (Ipi-Bev) therapy, revealed activated endothelium accompanied by lymphocyte infiltration. To discover possible targets involved in the observed clinical benefit, a serological screen was performed using human protein arrays with post-treatment plasma samples of long-term patients with clinical benefit to Ipi-Bev therapy (Wu et. al., 2017; Hodi et. al., 2014). EDIL3 (EGF Like Repeats and Discoidin Domains 3), a pro-angiogenic extracellular matrix protein, was identified. Humoral responses against EDIL3 were associated with favorable clinical outcomes including improved response rates <i>(p=0.003)<\/i> and overall survival <i>(p=0.03)<\/i> to Ipi-Bev therapy. The anti-EDIL3 response was also observed to be significantly <i>(p=0.03)<\/i> related to Ipi-Bev treatment when compared with patients treated with Ipilimumab alone, anti-PD1 therapy alone, or the combination of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in a combined analysis. Transcriptome analyses of TCGA SKCM (n=469) and BMS Checkmate 064 trial (n=90) related upregulated EDIL3 expression with enrichment of EMT, TGF&#946; signaling in fibroblasts, and angiogenesis signatures. Interestingly, TIDE analysis demonstrated a role for EDIL3 in T cell exclusion and immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as its source in the tumor microenvironment. EDIL3 was also predicted as a biomarker of non-response to immune checkpoint blockade treatment. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies confirmed the upregulation of EDIL3 expression and secretion by patient-derived CAFs along with its role in modulating TGF&#946;1 mediated EMT. Mechanistically, EDIL3 was found to interfere with leukocyte-endothelial interactions by disturbing LFA-1\/ICAM1 mediated adhesion and inhibited T cell transmigration in 2-D and microfluidic 3-D coculture studies with patient-derived tumor endothelial cells. Our findings suggest that the humoral response against EDIL3 may serve as one of the underlying mechanisms involved in effectuating an excluded to an inflamed phenotype observed in responders of checkpoint blockade treatment. This study develops EDIL3 as a potential target to enhance cytotoxic immune responses and improve the outcomes of combination immune therapy. Studies are ongoing for targeted inhibition of EDIL3 with implications for therapeutic application to promote anti-tumor immunity. <sup><\/sup>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune response,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Saba Tabasum<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dinesh Thapa<sup>1<\/sup>, Anita Giobbie-Hurder<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason L.

Amivantamab, a bispecific antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR<\/i>) and c-Met, has been demonstrated to induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and trogocytosis in tumor cells. We hypothesized that combination of amivantamab with pembrolizumab may synergistically enhance antitumor immunity. In this study, we present comprehensive immunomodulatory and synergistic antitumor efficacy of amivantamab and pembrolizumab in humanized HNSCC and LUSC mice models.<br \/>Methods: EGFR and MET-expressing tumors from a HNSCC and a LUSC patient were transplanted into Hu-CD34-NSG to establish humanized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Tumor-bearing PDXs were treated with vehicle, pembrolizumab (10mpk, Q5D, n=10), amivantamab (10mpk, BIW, n=10), or a combination of pembrolizumab and amivantamab (n=10). Analysis of immune modulatory responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME) using multiplexed IHC, flow cytometry, and single cell RNA sequencing was performed.<br \/>Results: Combination of amivantamab and pembrolizumab showed a significant reduction of tumor volume (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001) compared to vehicle or single treatment in both models. Additionally, significantly longer survival was observed for combination treated compared to the vehicle treated groups (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001). Multispectral imaging of tumor indicated that granzyme B-producing CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells were significantly increased within the tumor in the combination group (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01).

Contributing factors may include interactions between lymphoma cells (LCs) or leukemia cells and bone marrow microenvironment (BMM). Overexpression of CXCR4<sup>WT<\/sup> and its ligand CXCL12 promote LC-BMM interactions, contributing to disease severity in lymphomas or leukemia such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Mavorixafor is an investigational oral CXCR4 antagonist being evaluated in combination with the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with Waldenstr&#246;m&#8217;s macroglobulinemia (WM). In preclinical models of <i>MYD88<\/i><sup>L265P <\/sup><i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>WT <\/sup>WM, mavorixafor restored sensitivity of WM cells to B-cell-targeted therapies in coculture of WM cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs); however, the effects of mavorixafor on other lymphomas with <i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>have not been evaluated. We report the effects of mavorixafor alone or in combination with B-cell&#9472;targeted therapies on LCs in an <i>in vitro<\/i> preclinical model and assess the role of BMM in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas in an <i>in vitro<\/i> coculture model of LCs and BMSCs. Bioinformatic analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets GSE11318 and GSE32918 showed patients with DLBCL and <i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>hi<\/sup> have significantly inferior survival probability compared with those with <i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>low<\/sup> (<i>P<\/i>&#60;.001 and <i>P<\/i>&#60;.05, respectively). <i>I<\/i><i>n vitro<\/i> studies assessing effects of targeting CXCR4 with mavorixafor showed apoptosis of CXCR4<sup>+ <\/sup>LCs <i>OCILY19<\/i> (DLBCL), <i>MEC1<\/i> (CLL), <i>MINO<\/i> (MCL), and <i>DOHH2<\/i> (FL) cells increased by &#8776;10%&#9472;60%. The apoptosis of LCs was further enhanced by &#8776;5%&#9472;60% when treated with mavorixafor in combination with ibrutinib or venetoclax compared to ibrutinib or venetoclax alone. Coculture of LCs with BMSCs reduced the sensitivity of LCs to apoptosis-inducing effects of ibrutinib and venetoclax. Combining mavorixafor with ibrutinib or venetoclax restored sensitivity of LCs to apoptosis-inducing effects of the tested B-cell&#9472;targeted inhibitors. Mavorixafor also inhibited migration of LCs toward CXCL12, suggesting prevention of the homing of LCs to protective niche. Overall, our findings suggest the contribution of <i>CXCR4<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup> to pathogenicity of LCs. This is the first <i>in vitro <\/i>study to show that reduced sensitivity of LCs against B-cell-targeted therapies conferred by BMSCs can be overcome by inhibition of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis with mavorixafor. Our study provides supporting evidence for further exploration of mavorixafor alone or in combination with other B-cell-targeted therapies in the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias. Further studies using additional LC lines and\/or primary patient cells are warranted to support these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,Mavorixafor,BTK inhibitors,Venetoclax,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tom Kruitwagen<sup>1<\/sup>, Thalia Martins Rebelo<sup>1<\/sup>, Barbara Maierhofer<sup>2<\/sup>, Gerwin Heller<sup>3<\/sup>, Halenya Monticelli<sup>2<\/sup>, Arthur G.

Despite the standard of care consisting of surgery removal following radio- and chemo- therapy, the prognosis of GBM patients remain dismal. The interplay between GBM cells and its microenvironment contributes to maintaining the cancer stemness, developing resistance, and forming immunosuppression. GBM-associated macrophages (GAMs) are recruited to the GBM microenvironment by cytokines\/chemokines. Conversely, GAMs may promote GBM progression. Therefore, we hypothesized that GBM cells modulated immune microenvironment via macrophage activation. We integrated the bulk RNA sequencing (seq.) of the paired primary-recurrent GBM specimens, single-cell RNA seq., and <i>in vitro<\/i> validation to investigate the hypothesis. The bulk RNA seq. of the paired primary-recurrent GBM specimens indicated that recurrent GBM enhanced the neuroinflammation pathway. Among the components, we found that CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 was accumulated during GBM progression and up-regulated in temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant GBM cells. On the other hand, the newly CXCL12 receptor CXCR7 may act as a scavenger for CXCL12 during developing TMZ resistance in GBM. The bulk RNA sequencing seq. from primary-recurrent GBM specimens showed the decrement of CXCR7. Single-cell RNA seq. of GBM patients&#8217; specimens indicated CXCR7 dominantly expressed in GBM cells other than normal neural and immune cells. Developing TMZ resistance in GBM cell lines down-regulated CXCR7 expression. Furthermore, silencing CXCR7 attenuated TMZ cytotoxicity while combining CXCR7 agonists (Plerixafor, VUF11207, and TC14012) and TMZ enhanced TMZ cytotoxicity. Otherwise, the GBM-associated CXCL12 activated M0 macrophages into GAMs by facilitating macrophage proliferation and inducing pro-tumor factors, including interleukine (IL)-1&#946; and its receptors, IL-6, MMP9, and immune checkpoint PD-L1. Mechanistically, GBM-associated CXCL12 upregulated PD-L1 in GAMs via NF-&#954;B. Accordingly, by multimodal analysis, CXCL12 was identified with the additional role in regulating resistance in GBM cells and GBM microenvironment. Also, re-activating CXCR7 may overcome the resistance to TMZ and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Combination of CXCR7 activation with current therapy and immunotherapy may be an effective strategy for improving the prognosis of primary GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor associated macrophages,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chan-Chuan Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chia-Hung Chien<sup>2<\/sup>, Wen-Bin Yang<sup>3<\/sup>, Jian-Ying Chuang<sup>4<\/sup>, Kwang-Yu Chang<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan City, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>National Institute of Cancer Research; School of Medicine, National Health Research Institutes; I-Shou University, Tainan City, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>TMU Research Center of Neuroscience, Taipei Medical University, Taipei City, Taiwan,<sup>4<\/sup>TMU Research Center of Neuroscience, the Ph.D. Program for Neural Regenerative Medicine, College of, Taipei Medical University, Taipei City, Taiwan,<sup>5<\/sup>National Institute of Cancer Research; Department of Oncology, National Cheng Kung University Hospit, National Health Research Institutes; National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0b2e1fa0-0787-4b89-a770-6ddb2359973f","ControlNumber":"3397","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

To bridge this technological gap, we leverage a new platform that visualizes the spatial architecture of subclones and microenvironments. To study heterogeneous populations of cells and their clonal dynamics in vivo, we performed barcode lineage tracing with next-generation sequencing analysis. It allows a quantitative evaluation of the spatial distribution and temporal clonal dynamic in vivo with multiple pharmacological perturbations, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We found that treatment with a PD1 inhibitor, despite a limited effect on tumor volume, induced dramatic changes in tumor clonal architecture. Furthermore, we revealed that subclones from well-defined geographical domains in vivo share differential behavior upon immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). By visualizing 40 different markers with multiplexed staining technology, we further identified that the microenvironment also exhibits a high level of spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we coupled spatial barcode sequencing with high-content imaging and revealed the differential microenvironment feature of sensitive and resistant clones. We will further explore the mechanisms of immune evasion at the subclonal level. Through isolation and deep characterization of clonal lineages endowed with a distinct ability to engage the immune response, we hope to identify new vulnerabilities to overcome resistance to ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Tumor microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Er-Yen Yen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, I-Lin Ho<sup><\/sup>, Chieh-Yuan Li<sup><\/sup>, Charles Dyke<sup><\/sup>, Shan Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Francesca Citron<sup><\/sup>, Sergio Attanasio<sup><\/sup>, Rutvi Shah<sup><\/sup>, Ko-Chien Chen<sup><\/sup>, Giulio Draetta<sup><\/sup>, Andrea Viale<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ec6528d4-4923-41fd-a525-613bf26e728d","ControlNumber":"3722","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

The immune escape of cancer cells may be driven by B7\/CD28 family members and others on the tumor cells that form ligand-inhibitory receptor complexes with immune cells. Since the family members of B7\/CD28 can functionally compensate, the concomitant disruption of multiple B7\/CD28 family members in OSCC pathogenesis remains elusive. RNAseq performed on OSCC and paired oral mucosa retrieved the transcriptome of OSCC, and algorithms signified the general alterations of T cell population and the increase of macrophage population in tumors relative to controls. Upregulation of CD80, CD86, PD-L1, PD-L2, CD276 and CTLA4, and downregulation of L-ICOS in OSCC relative to normal mucosa was noted. In addition, there was a high concordance in the expression profile across the dysregulated regulators. The co-upregulation of CD276 and CTLA4 was associated with the decrease of T helper and NK cell population, and the increase of Treg and myeloid dendritic cell population. Interestingly, tumors harboring higher PD-L1 and\/or PD-L2 expression accompany with lower ICOS or PD1 expression exhibited worse prognosis. In combination with these immunity features in primary tumors, the survival of patients with lymph node metastasis was further worsened. In the isografic models of murine OSCC cell lines, the decrease of CD4+T population in the lymph node and increase of myeloid dendritic cell population in the spleen were induced in the host mice. Many miRNAs are involved in the modulation of immune escape for malignancies. With the treatment of inhibitors against oncogenic miRNAs which enabled the OSCC suppression, the inhibitors of miR-146a and miR-211 also resulted in the down-regulation in the protein expression of multiple B7\/CD28 members. This study concludes the eminent co-disruption of B7\/CD28 members in OSCC tumors, which would confound the patient survival. The efficacy of miRNA inhibitors in abrogating oncogenicity and B7\/CD28 members could be a therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Head and neck cancers,Bioinformatics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sih-Rou Chang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6bb0a53e-0722-4971-825a-883a58cea4d9","ControlNumber":"4036","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

The TCF-4J and K pair has been characterized based on the presence (K) or absence (J) of a conserved SxxSS motif at the head of exon 9. TCF-4J-overexpressing HCC cells (J cells) exhibited high tumorigenic potential in contrast to TCF-4K-overexpressing cells (K cells) (PLoS ONE 2012); however, resistance to anti-cancer agents was more prominent in K cells than J cells. Another analysis demonstrated that loss of exon 4 increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Liver Int 2013). EMT and the expression of programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is closely associated with each other, and our preliminary study revealed that EMT was regulated by TCF-4 variants, suggesting possible involvement of the variants in the regulation of PD-L1 expression. In general, PD-L1 is known to be upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) under hypoxic conditions. Therefore, if the TCF-4 variants regulate PD-L1 expression under normoxia, it would be a unique mechanism bridging the Wnt signaling pathway and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).<br \/>Aim: To assess whether or not the TCF-4 variants regulate the expression of PD-L1 in cancer cells under normoxia.<br \/>Methods: HAK-1A, a well-differentiated HCC cell line (Hepatology 1993), was used in this study. TCF-4K mutants (S269A, S272A, and S273A) were prepared with the conversion of serine (S) in the SxxSS motif to alanine (A) by site-directed mutagenesis. HAK-1A-derived stable clones overexpressing TCF-4J, K, and K-mutants (S269A, S272A, and S273A cells, respectively) were established. Empty vector-transfected mock cells (EV cells) were used as a control. Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR were employed to evaluate protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively.<br \/>Results: J cells and K cells expressed PD-L1 mRNA 2-fold and 4-fold of that in the EV cells, respectively. Of note, the PD-L1 expression mRNA was enhanced up to 11-fold in S269A cells, 11-fold in S272A cells, and 17-fold in S273A cells. The increased mRNA expressions were verified in protein levels.<br \/>Conclusion: PD-L1 expression was regulated by TCF-4 variants in liver cancer cells under normoxic conditions.

As such, many different types of immunotherapies have failed to show significant benefits for most glioma patients. Hence, a better understanding of drivers of the immune suppressive microenvironment in GBM and other immune cold tumors is urgently needed to guide future immunotherapy development and application. We recently analyzed 201,986 human glioma and immune cells from 44 tissue fragments from 18 human glioma patients, and present a comprehensive and high-resolution cellular, molecular, and spatial heterogeneity atlas of human glioma. We report an extensive spatial and molecular heterogeneity of glioma and immune cells within the same patient. In addition, we discovered that cell:cell communication between glioma:myeloid cells is considerably more robust than glioma:T-cells, indicating that myeloid cells form a communication hub <i>in vivo<\/i>. To gain a deeper understanding of these important immune cells, we analyzed 83,479 glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells and identified 9 molecularly distinct myeloid subtypes: 3 microglia subtypes, 3 bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) subtypes, MDSCs, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Notably, we found that five of these myeloid cell subtype gene signatures are significant predictors of glioma patient survival, independent of glioma cell mutational profiles or gene expression patterns. Leveraging our dataset, we also identified a novel immunotherapy target that is highly expressed in immune-suppressive macrophages and T cells but not in anti-tumor leukocytes: <i>S100A4<\/i>. We provide both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> evidence that <i>S100a4<\/i> deletion in stromal cells is sufficient to reprogram the immune microenvironment and significantly extend the survival of two independent glioma models. To broaden the potential impact of targeting S100A4 as a selective modulator of immune suppressive leukocytes, we compared the molecular signatures of glioma-associated myeloid cells to those from 12 other cancer types and peripheral blood myeloid cells. We found that <i>S100A4 <\/i>expression pattern is highly consistent among all tumor types, where its expression is highest in the monocytes and MDSCs and low in most DCs and tissue-resident macrophages. Our preliminary analysis also shows that myeloid cells in gliomas are molecularly distinct from corresponding cell types in other cancers, strongly indicating the role brain microenvironment in influencing the infiltrating BMDM maturation and polarization.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Glioblastoma,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nourhan Abdelfattah<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Parveen Kumar<sup>2<\/sup>, Caiyi Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jia-Shiun Leu<sup>1<\/sup>, David Baskin<sup>1<\/sup>, William Flynn<sup>2<\/sup>, Ruli Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Kumar Pichumani<sup>1<\/sup>, Omkar Ijare<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephanie Wood<sup>1<\/sup>, Suzanne Powell<sup>1<\/sup>, David Haviland<sup>1<\/sup>, Brittany Parker Kerrigan<sup>3<\/sup>, Frederick Lang<sup>3<\/sup>, Sujit Prabhu<sup>3<\/sup>, Kristin Huntoon<sup>3<\/sup>, Wen Jiang<sup>3<\/sup>, Betty Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Joshy George<sup>2<\/sup>, Kyuson Yun<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>The Jackson Laboratory, Farmington, CT,<sup>3<\/sup>MD Anderson, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"01b3fe1c-b595-432e-8e96-9b3b0b668e99","ControlNumber":"3948","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

This resistance is due to lactate-mediated immune suppression and competition for glucose between T cells and tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment. We have shown that CTLA-4 blockade is more effective in glycolysis-low tumors, or tumors lacking functional lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), primarily due to functional destabilization of regulatory T cell suppression. LDH inhibitors (LDHi) have been reported to inhibit tumor glucose uptake and slow tumor cell proliferation in pre-clinical models of cancer. However, their effect on immune cells has not been explored in depth. In addition, the optimal conditions for pharmacological inhibition of LDH in combination with immunotherapy to maximize anti-tumor immune and therapeutic responses require further investigation. At baseline, tumor cells express higher levels of <i>ldha<\/i> and consume more glucose than tumor-infiltrating T cells, creating a therapeutic window for tumor-specific targeting of the glycolysis pathway. In vivo, LDHi relies on the adaptive immune system and the overexpression of tumor LDH to delay B16F10 murine melanoma progression. We found that treatment with LDHi has two effects: 1) reduction of tumor cell glucose uptake and 2) increase in glucose uptake by tumor-infiltrating T cells. Thus, LDH inhibition is an effective, tumor-specific strategy to reduce tumor cell glucose uptake and increase glucose availability within the tumor microenvironment, consequently boosting tumor-infiltrating T cell glucose uptake. <i>In vitro, <\/i>increased glucose levels improve effector T cell killing of tumor cells while reducing regulatory T cell suppressive ability. Accordingly, inhibiting LDH in combination with CTLA-4 blockade is more effective in controlling tumor progression compared to CTLA-4 blockade alone, and that this combination promotes effector T cell infiltration and activation, while destabilizing regulatory T cell function. Additionally, we observe serum LDH and lactate levels correlate with primary tumor burden as well as tumor LDH levels. Therefore, serum LDH may serve as a biomarker for tumor burden and tumor LDH, as well as clinical response to LDHi. This study provides a comprehensive rationale for combining immune checkpoint blockade with inhibitors of glycolysis for patients with highly glycolytic cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Immune checkpoint blockade,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Svena Verma<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Inna Serganova<sup>1<\/sup>, Lauren Dong<sup>2<\/sup>, Sadna Budhu<sup>2<\/sup>, Levi Mangarin<sup>3<\/sup>, Roberta Zappasodi<sup>4<\/sup>, Taha Merghoub<sup>5<\/sup>, Jedd  D.

The presence of cytotoxic immune cells, specifically CD8+ T cells, in breast tumors is associated with better patient outcomes. Our goal is to understand mechanisms that regulate the infiltration of CD8+ T cells. This will in turn, improve the treatment and enhance patient overall survival. Utilizing a novel HSF1 activity gene signature, we observed that HSF1 activity was negatively associated with the presence of CD8+ T cells in breast cancer patients. Both CIBERSORT analysis of TCGA data as well as direct assessment of patient primary specimens demonstrated that patient tumors with high HSF1 activity had lower numbers of CD8+ T cells. To functionally test this relationship, HSF1 was knocked down in 4T1 breast cancer cells and grown orthotopically in BALB\/c mice. Tumors with HSF1 knockdown showed lower tumor volumes and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration. We subjected the control and knockdown tumors to single- cell RNA sequencing analysis and found increased immune cell presence specifically CD8+ T cell presence in knockdown tumors. We further tested the effect of CD8+ T cells on the growth of HSF1 knockdown tumors by depleting CD8+ T cells in BALB\/c mice. HSF1 knockdown tumors were significantly larger with CD8+ T cell depletion suggesting a functional role for HSF1 to inhibit CD8+ T cell infiltration and protect the tumor from immune-mediated killing. To investigate the mechanism by which HSF1 affects CD8+ T cells, we investigated whether HSF1 affects chemotactic cytokines. We found that loss of HSF1 significantly increased secretion of CCL5, a known chemoattractant for CD8+ T cells. Loss of HSF1 also increased mRNA levels of CCL5, suggesting a transcriptional effect on CCL5. To test the importance of CCL5 in the phenotype of HSF1 knockdown, a transwell migration assay was performed wherein T cells from BALB\/c mice were placed in the upper chamber of a transwell chamber and the lower chamber contained conditioned medium from 4T1 cells with knockdown of HSF1 with or without knockdown of CCL5. The lower chamber was subjected to flow cytometry for CD3\/CD8 to identify CD8+ T cells and we observed that loss of HSF1 increased migration of CD8+ T cells and this was ablated with additional loss of CCL5. These results suggest CCL5 is a significant mediator for the recruitment of CD8+ T cells when HSF1 is lost in cancer cells. We propose the model whereby high HSF1 activity in breast cancer cells suppresses expression and secretion of the chemo-attractant cytokine CCL5 that ultimately leads to a decrease in CD8+ T cells in breast tumors microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunosuppression,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Heat shock proteins,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Curteisha LeeAnn Jacobs<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sakhi Shah<sup><\/sup>, Wen-Cheng Lu<sup><\/sup>, Richard Carpenter<sup><\/sup>, Haimanti Ray<sup><\/sup>, Xin Lu<sup><\/sup>, Sha Cao<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Indiana University School of Medicine, Bloomington, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ef6be9d0-8d41-4db3-ab01-e84fd65ae249","ControlNumber":"4870","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

High expression of PD-1 leads to T-cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our published studies show that Rab37 small GTPase-mediated vesicular trafficking of cell surface proteins and cytokines is critical in immunosuppressive TME. Here, we identify novel mechanisms of intracellular trafficking and plasma membrane presentation of PD-1 mediated by Rab37. Confocal immunofluorescence (IF) and vesicles isolation data demonstrated that PD-1 colocalized with Rab37-specific vesicles in T cells in a GTP-dependent manner. Total internal reflection fluorescence imaging, membrane fractionation, and flow cytometric analyses confirmed the dynamic trafficking and membrane presentation of PD-1 by Rab37. In addition, sucrose density gradient centrifugation and IF revealed that the level of glycosylated wild-type PD-1 in membrane compartment was more than glycosylation mutant PD-1, suggesting that glycosylation mutant PD-1 delayed in recruitment to the Rab37 vesicles and thus stalled in membrane presentation. Furthermore, T cell proliferation and activity were downregulated in <i>Rab37<\/i> wild-type splenocytes co-cultured with cancer cells compared to those from <i>Rab37<\/i> knockout mice using various T cell functional assays. Clinically, the multiplex IF-immunohistochemical assay indicated that the tumor infiltrated Rab37<sup>+<\/sup>\/PD1<sup>+<\/sup>\/TIM-3<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>+<\/sup> exhaustion T cells were more in late staged lung cancer patients compared to those in early staged patients. Importantly, patients with Rab37<sup>+<\/sup>\/PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>\/TIM-3<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>+<\/sup> tumor infiltrated T cells expression profile correlated with poor overall survival.

Its incidence is increasing, and is closely related to advanced liver disease. Interactions in the HCC microenvironment between tumor cells and the associated stroma actively regulate tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapy response. In the present study, we used the OrganoPlate graft to establish a co-culture system consisting of dissociated HCC tumors (HCC 1-8) and cell lines, HCC derived fibroblasts and vasculature. Cultures were prepared and validated by assessing their response to Sorafenib and Lenvatinib (72 hours). Cultures had their viability (alamar blue assay), and chemokine\/cytokine levels in the supernatant (Luminex) determined. In addition, the organization of the vasculature in the tumor compartment was studied through immunostainings, confocal imaging, and subsequent morphological analyses. HCC models were characterized by a range of specific markers, tumor (albumin), endothelial (CD31 and VE-Cadherin) and stromal (aSMA) cells. CD31 immunostained cultures were imaged, and morphology changes quantified. Sorafenib and Lenvatinib induced changes in the tumor vasculature area and organization. Hereby, we present vascularized patient-derived HCC models that include relevant cellular players of the HCC microenvironment. These co-cultures are highly suitable for studying specific cell types as well as patient-specific responses. We envision that this patient derived model will evolve to become a platform for understanding the interplay between angiogenesis, stroma and immune infiltrate in HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Tumor microenvironment,Organ-on-a-Chip,Stroma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Orsola Mocellin<sup>1<\/sup>, Abbie Robinson<sup>1<\/sup>, Aleksandra Olczyk<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephane Treillard<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Olivier<sup>1<\/sup>, Chee Ng<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeroen Heijmans<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Désiréé Goubert<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arthur Stok<sup>1<\/sup>, Gilles van Tienderen<sup>4<\/sup>, Monique Verstegen<sup>4<\/sup>, Sebastian Trietsch<sup>1<\/sup>, Henriëtte Lanz<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Vulto<sup>1<\/sup>, Jos Joore<sup>1<\/sup>, Karla S.

To investigate how spatial organization of T cells might influence immunotherapy response, we developed a tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) platform to characterize preclinical genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of cancer. We optimized a 21-antibody panel delineating major myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets, that included key markers for characterizing T cell phenotypes and function. The panel was used to characterize the Kras\/p53-mutant GEMM of lung adenocarcinoma, treated with anti-PD-1\/anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy or a neoantigen-targeted long-peptide vaccine. Spatial profiling by t-CyCIF identified intratumoral lymphocyte networks (&#8220;lymphonets&#8221;) as a key feature associated with a productive immune response against lung tumors. Lymphonets were predominantly composed of B cells and conventional CD4 T cells, but harbored tumor-reactive CD8 T cell populations. TCF1+ PD1+ progenitor CD8 T cells, a subset previously correlated with patient response to ICB, were almost exclusively localized to lymphonets inside tumors. Lymphonets of similar composition harboring TCF1+ PD1+ cells were also found in early-stage human lung adenocarcinomas. In response to ICB and vaccine therapies in mice, cytotoxic CD8 T cells (Granzyme B+\/Perforin+) colocalized with TCF1+ PD1+ cells in lymphonets, likely having differentiated from this progenitor pool. Notably, vaccination further induced a highly proliferative (Ki67<sup>hi<\/sup>) and cytotoxic (GranzymeB<sup>hi<\/sup>Perforin<sup>hi<\/sup>) population of CD8 T cells localized outside of tumors that we posit enter tumors without passing through the intratumoral progenitor cell state. Upon becoming dysfunctional, marked by loss of Granzyme B\/Perforin expression and upregulation of inhibitory receptors, CD8 T cells were excluded from lymphonets and localized predominantly to the tumor margin. Altogether, these results shed light on the spatial dynamics associated with a productive response to immunotherapies and open avenues for exploration into the function of lymphonets in supporting cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses in tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Tumor microenvironment,Lung cancer,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Megan  L.

High SOAT1 expression with its mediated tumorigenesis has been shown in multiple cancers. Studies showed that SOAT1 inhibition by its inhibitors augmented the outcome of immunotherapies, in terms of the immune checkpoint blockades, cancer vaccines, and CAR-T cells, by boosting the function of T cells. However, in order to have a better understanding of the role played by SOAT1 in the tumor microenvironment of ovarian cancer (OC) and optimize strategies of combination immunotherapy, it&#8217;s necessary to detect the role of SOAT1 in OC cells on T cell-mediated immune response.<br \/>Methods: <i>SOAT1<\/i> knockdown was manipulated by siRNAs transfection. SOAT1 was inhibited by avasimibe and OC cells were treated in different doses of avasimibe. qPCR was performed to detect gene expressions in ovarian cancer cells.

Flow cytometry analysis was used to measure cytotoxic secretory molecules of human T cells, like IFN-r, TNF-a, and Granzyme B.<br \/>Results: The downregulation of intracellular cytotoxic cytokines was shown in the T cells cocultured with SOAT1-silenced and avasimibe-pretreated OC cells or treated by their TCM, thereby impairing the cytotoxic capacity of T cells, compared to the corresponding control group. qPCR results showed that several immunosuppressive cytokines, like IL-6, IL-8, TGF- were upregulated in the SOAT1-silenced or avasimibe-treated OC cells.<br \/>Conclusion:SOAT1 inhibition in ovarian tumor cells impairs CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell cytotoxic function, to some extent, via the upregulation of immunosuppressive-related cytokines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxic T cell,Immunosuppression,SOAT1 and Avasimibe,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jiangnan He<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michelle K.Y.

PEDD<sup>TM<\/sup> resulted in high drug levels in the liver (up to 2,340 ng\/ml at 8mg) with only transient exposure in the periphery (&#60;4 hours) with one Grade 2 cytokine related syndrome adverse event. Dose-dependent increases in canonical TLR9-associated cytokines (IL-18, IFN&#947;, IP-10, and soluble CD25) was observed across the 2mg, 4mg, and 8mg single-agent dose levels. Concordant with predicted mechanism of action, PEDD<sup>TM<\/sup> HAI administered SD-101 resulted in decreases in liver monocytic MDSCs in 4 of 4 patients with available multiplex immunofluorescence data. NanoString analysis from three patients revealed increases in ISG15, IL-9, IFN&#945;, and IL-2 transcripts and decreases in ARG1 and IDO transcripts, with increased scores for macrophages, activated CD8 T cells, Th1 cells, and Th1 activation. For patients who received 2mg SD-101 + ICI with available liquid biopsy data, 4 of 7 demonstrated decreases in circulating tumor cells and 3 of 5 showing ctDNA decreases after the first cycle.In this first-in-human experience, HAI of SD-101 via PEDD<sup>TM<\/sup> was well tolerated and associated with encouraging immunologic activity. Evidence of biologic activity with 2 mg of SD-101 with nivolumab is encouraging and patients are currently enrolling at higher SD-101 dose levels + ICI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,MDSC,Uveal melanoma,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sapna P.

DAV132 (DAV) is an orally administered colon-targeted ATB adsorbent capsules designed to prevent ATB-induced dysbiosis. We investigated whether DAV co-administered with ATB could prevent ATB-related dysbiosis and ICI response.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>72<b> <\/b>human healthy volunteers (HV) were randomized to receive either IV ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) or Piperacillin tazobactam (PTZ) alone or in combination with oral DAV. CZA and PTZ plasmatic and fecal pharmacodynamic levels were measured using HPLC-MS\/MS. Microbiome was profiled with metagenomics at different timepoints. FMT experiments in germ-free mice were performed using fecal samples from HV from the trial, before (D1) or after 6 days (D6) of CZA or PTZ+\/-DAV; subsequently mice were inoculated with MCA205 or B16 tumors and treated with anti-PD-1. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>DAV did not impact plasmatic CZA or PTZ concentrations, but significantly reduced ceftazidime and piperacillin concentrations in feces compared to ATB groups alone. DAV significantly prevented the reduction in microbiota alpha-diversity at D6 and was associated with a rapid return to baseline microbiota. 50 and 43 metagenomics species were preserved in the CZA+DAV <i>vs<\/i> CZA, or PTZ-DAV vs PTZ such as<i> Faecalibacterium praunistzii, Alistipes Spp and Blautia obeum<\/i>.<b> <\/b>FMT in germ-free mice using feces collected at D1 exhibited a significant anti-PD-1 activity. This anti-tumor response was inhibited in two tumors models in mice transplanted with D6 feces from patients in the CZA or PTZ alone groups.

However, the subcellular resolution information has not been fully leveraged yet, as most analyses have focused on cellular or compartment level features. Here, we have developed a robust computational approach integrating cellular spatial and molecular features in multiplexed images to quantify immune synapses. Our approach enables computational detection of subcellular enrichment of T cell co-receptors at immune synapses, which are key regulators of T cell functions in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We quantified immune synapse strength between T cells and various antigen-presenting cells in tumor regions in one melanoma whole tissue immunofluorescence dataset and two independent melanoma IMC datasets covering 99 patients. We observed that sub-localizations of immune synapse-related molecules are highly correlated, e.g. CD3 with CD8. These co-localizations are cell type-specific, with differential behaviors in CD4+ or CD8+ T subtypes. Intra-tumoral T-cell-myeloid synapses are associated with improved T cell proliferation (p = 2.8E-4). In addition, we also observed that cytotoxic T cell - melanoma synapses in immune rich regions are stronger in immune checkpoint inhibition therapy responders than in non-responding patients (p = 0.013). Our approach enables computational resolution of spatial inter-cellular interactions within the TME, is applicable across imaging modalities, and facilities assessment of biological and clinical significance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zichao Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Victor G.

Understanding of the biology of early lung cancer is necessary to intercept early steps of progression. Indeed, increased utility of low-dose CT guided lung cancer screens in populations at risk have begun to detect early premalignant disease; however, little is known about the underlying biology that drives progression of preinvasive lesions to invasive adenocarcinoma. Moreover, there exists a lack of reliable animal models to assess interception strategies to target disease progression. We have developed and characterized a lung cancer cell-of-origin-specific KRAS-driven mouse model which accurately mirrors progression of human precursor lesions to invasive disease. Transcriptional analysis of preinvasive and invasive stages identified cellular and molecular alternations observed in human lesions, including upregulation of cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and an increasingly complex immune microenvironment. Interrogation with immunofluorescence microscopy and Hyperion mass cytometry imaging showed marked reprogramming of the immune microenvironment including increased T cell infiltration and abundance of T regulatory cells (Tregs). Surprisingly, depletion of T cells impaired progression of preinvasive lesions, implicating the critical immunosuppressive roles of Tregs. Spatial transcriptomics (10X Genomics Visium) revealed unique spatial transcriptional changes in the progression from preinvasive to invasive stage disease, including specific ligand-receptor interactions highly expressed in Tregs. Genetic and pharmacological approaches using FoxP3-DTR-GFP mice and low dose cyclophosphamide have begun to define the functional role of Tregs in early premalignant disease.<br \/>This study demonstrates critical roles of immunosuppressive Tregs in driving progression of preinvasive to invasive lung cancer, and advocates for Treg targeting as a potent immunoprevention approach for patients at risk of developing lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-06 Inflammatory cells as regulators of tumor growth,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,Premalignancy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mitchell Martin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michael  J.

Single-cell sequencing analysis provides a systematic and quantitative approach to identify cell types and determine their composition in tissues. However, the spatial organization of cells and cell-cell interactions that are critical for tissue function are lost when cells are dissociated from tissue. This is especially important when working with the complex microenvironment of a tumour where such information is needed to fully understand patient prognosis. Complex diseases such as cancer can be better understood from the perspective of dysregulated pathways, rather than as a disease resulting from alterations of individual genes. Recently, spatially resolved, single-cell imaging platforms have provided a necessary solution to bridge the spatial information gap evident in previous transcriptomic methodologies. Vizgen&#8217;s MERSCOPE platform, built on multiplexed error robust in situ hybridisation (MERFISH) technology, enables the direct profiling of the spatial organisation of intact tissue with subcellular resolution. Here, we present a Pan-Cancer approach to characterise various cancers in human clinical samples with MERSCOPE. Using a 500-gene panel that includes the canonical signalling pathways of cancer, cancer type-specific genes, key immune genes, proto-oncogenes, and tumour-suppressor genes we demonstrate MERSCOPE&#8217;s ability to spatially profile gene expression across multiple tumour samples, including breast, colon, prostate, ovarian, lung, and skin cancer. To confirm the specificity and sensitivity of our pathway-focused gene panel, we assessed how tumour cell clusters in each dataset expressed different cancer type-specific markers. As expected, we found specific cancer types enriched in corresponding marker genes. To further evaluate how individual cell types in each tumour are dysregulated by cancer, we compared non-tumour cell clusters to similarly annotated clusters derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing data of normal tissue. Notably, the non-tumour cells in these datasets exhibit higher expression of stress and inflammation pathways, while immune cell clusters demonstrate higher immune activity and higher immune exhaustion compared to those in normal tissue. These results demonstrate the power of the MERSCOPE platform to generate individualised, accurate cell atlases from patient-derived tumours and to enable further insights into the relationship between genomic profiles, dysregulated pathways, and disease phenotype. Such network-centric approaches are critical for identifying genotypic causes of diseases, classifying disease subtypes, and identifying drug targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor heterogeneity,Signaling pathways,Single cell,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leiam Colbert<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Benjamin Patterson<sup><\/sup>, Cheng Yi Chen<sup><\/sup>, Nicolas Fernandez<sup><\/sup>, Jiang He<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>R&D, Vizgen, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e826b05c-435c-43fa-bb3c-f6585574d756","ControlNumber":"7410","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Utilizing <i>in vitro<\/i> co-culture models (n=6), we showed that IDO-mediated kynurenine production from CR cells suppressed natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) on natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells, but enhanced immunosuppressive regulatory T cell (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) populations.<b><i> <\/i><\/b>Utilizing syngeneic (n=7) and humanized (n=5) mouse models, mice with CR tumors exhibited a more highly immunosuppressive environment that blocked the antitumor immune response. Inhibition of IDO1 by the selective IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat (200 mg\/kg P.O. once a day for 15 days) attenuated tumor growth in these CR tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, we found an induction of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase-2 (TDO2) enzyme in epacadostat-treated mice. To overcome this compensatory effect induced by IDO1 inhibition, mice were treated with a novel IDO1\/TDO2 dual inhibitor (AT-0174; Antido Therapeutics Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) at 170 mg\/kg P.O. once a day for 15 days. Dual inhibitors suppressed tumor growth to a greater degree than IDO1 inhibitors in CR conditions, and significantly enhanced immune effector populations as well as suppressed immunosuppressive Tregs and MDSC population in CR tumors. In addition, increased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was observed in CR cells, we assessed the effects of combination treatment of AT-0174 + anti-PD1 antibody. This combined therapy produced a profound anti-tumor effect in CR tumors and extended survival in mice. Our data support an increase in the therapeutic efficacy of blocking both IDO1\/TDO2 in treating CR lung cancer by enhancing tumor immune surveillance. Thus, inhibiting the kynurenine pathway may be a more suitable therapeutic approach in a subgroup of lung cancer patients who failed platinum therapy and lead to improved outcomes in the treatment and management of NSCLC.

Extensive studies suggested that metformin, the most widely used first-line drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes, had a potential efficacy of enhancing anti-tumor immune response. However, the detail mechanisms underlying the efficacy are unknown. Here, we showed that metformin decreases AKT-mediated &#946;-catenin S552 phosphorylation and &#946;-catenin transactivation in an AMPK activation-dependent manner, resulting in reduced <i>CD274<\/i> transcription in cancer cells. In the cocultures of cancer cells with NK cells or T cells, cancer cells induced PD-1 protein stability and expression in the NK cells and T cells, these PD-1 upregulation was also observed in infiltrated NK cells and T cells <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse tumors. Metformin reduced the half-life and expression of PD-1 in an AMPK activation-dependent manner <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. These inhibitory roles of metformin in PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and in cancer cell-induced PD-1 expression in NK cells and T cells led to ameliorated the cancer cell-reduced cytotoxic activity of NK cells and T cells and inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> models. These findings suggest that metformin may act as both PD-L1 and PD-1 blockades within tumor microenvironment, providing a mechanistic insight for the efficacy of metformin to improve immunotherapy in human cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metformin,PD-1,PD-L1,AMPK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Su Hwan Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jong-Ho Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Dong-A University, Busan, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ff3624aa-c962-4974-9846-7de61a8e2b65","ControlNumber":"5728","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
