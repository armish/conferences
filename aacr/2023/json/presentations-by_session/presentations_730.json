[{"Abstract":"Purpose: Metastatic HR+ breast cancer initially responds to serial courses of endocrine therapy but ultimately becomes refractory Elacestrant, a new generation oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and antagonist, has demonstrated efficacy in a subset of women with advanced HR+ breast cancer (Bidard FC, et al <i>J Clin Oncol <\/i>2022;40:3246-3256), but there are few patient-derived models to characterize its effect in advanced cancers with diverse treatment histories and acquired mutations In this translational study, we tested the efficacy of elacestrant on ex vivo circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models with serial exposures to fulvestrant and conducted a reanalysis of the EMERALD trial to evaluate the efficacy of elacestrant vs standard endocrine therapy among patients who had received prior fulvestrant.<br \/>Methods: Using PDX models and cultured CTCs isolated from metastatic breast cancer patients, we analyzed sensitivity to elacestrant, compared with the currently approved SERD, fulvestrant We further analyzed clinical responses to elacestrant, compared with endocrine therapy, among women who had previously been treated with a fulvestrant-containing regimen from the recent phase 3 EMERALD Study (NCT03778931),<br \/>Results: In a patient-derived HR+ breast cancer PDX model, we demonstrate that elacestrant, at a clinically relevant dose, is highly effective in tumors extensively pretreated with fulvestrant In cultured CTCs isolated from HR+ breast cancer patients who had received multiple prior treatments, including fulvestrant, elacestrant is active, independent of mutations in the estrogen receptor (<i>ESR1<\/i>) or Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (<i>PIK3CA)<\/i> genes In these cells, elacestrant suppresses estrogen-receptor (ER) signaling at concentrations below those required for protein degradation Post-hoc analysis of the EMERALD clinical trial confirms that elacestrant is effective in patient populations previously treated with fulvestrant-containing regimens, irrespective of <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation status.<br \/>Conclusion: In the EMERALD study, elacestrant showed significantly prolonged PFS compared with SOC (including fulvestrant) Using a PDX model and CTCs isolated from patients with MBC from the EMERALD study, this translational investigation demonstrates that elacestrant retains efficacy in breast cancer cells that have acquired resistance to currently available ER-targeting therapies Elacestrant may be an option for patients with HR+\/HER2- breast cancer whose disease progressed while receiving fulvestrant in the metastatic setting","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,HER2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Taronish D.

At the prespecified interim analysis, this study met the primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) in all patients (pts) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.78; P&#60;0.001) and the pts with PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) &#8805;10 (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.48-0.85; P=0.002) (Lu, et al. BMJ 2022). Here we report the updated OS results with an extended follow-up time.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Eligible pts were randomized 1:1 to receive sintilimab\/placebo (3 mg\/kg in pts weighing &#60;60 kg or 200 mg in pts weighing &#8805;60 kg, IV Q3W) for up to 24 months plus chemo (paclitaxel 175 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> Q3W plus cisplatin 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> Q3W as TP regimen, or cisplatin 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> Q3W plus 5-FU 800 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on days 1-5 Q3W as CF regimen). Stratification factors were PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score &#60;10% or &#8805;10%), ECOG PS (0 vs 1), liver metastasis (presence vs absence), and chemo regimen (TP vs CF). The primary endpoints were OS in the pts with PD-L1 CPS &#8805;10 and all pts.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Overall, 690 pts (median age 63.0; 85.5% male; 93.3% Asian and 4.9% White; 24.3% liver metastasis; 90.7% TP regimen) were randomized and received Sin+Chemo (341 pts) or Chemo (349 pts). As of data cutoff date (Aug 28, 2022), the median follow-up was 32.2 months (interquartile range 28.0-35.8); 231 OS events were observed in Sin+Chemo group and 278 in Chemo group. Sin+Chemo continued to demonstrate an OS benefit vs Chemo in all pts (median OS 17.4 [95% CI 16.0-19.8] vs 12.8 [95% CI 11.3-14.5] months; HR 0.661 [95% CI: 0.554-0.788]; P&#60;0.0001), and the pts with PD-L1 CPS &#8805;10 (18.4 [95% CI 16.2-24.6] vs 14.5 [95% CI 11.7-16.4] months; HR 0.635 [95% CI 0.503-0.803]; P=0.0001).

TMB is a predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint blockade in multiple cancers, but its role in ESCC is unclear. Here, we retrospectively investigated the association between TMB and clinical outcomes in the phase 3 RATIONALE-302 study of anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab (TIS) vs investigator-chosen chemotherapy (ICC) as 2L treatment for advanced unresectable\/metastatic ESCC (NCT03430843).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Genomic profiling was assessed on tumor tissues collected at baseline using BurningRock OncoScreen Plus 520 NGS panel to determine TMB status. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Objective response rate (ORR) was calculated using the binomial exact method. Cox model was applied to assess the effect of TMB on survival outcomes. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for OS and PFS in TMB subgroups were estimated.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of 512 pts enrolled, 209 had evaluable tumor samples (TIS, n=105; ICC, n=104). Using the widely used cutoff of 10 mutations per megabase (mut\/Mb), numerically higher ORR and survival benefit with TIS over ICC were observed in the high TMB (TMB-H) vs the low TMB (TMB-L) subgroup (Table). The predictive effect of TMB on survival outcomes was not significant (interaction p-value = 0.0537 for PFS, 0.5374 for OS); however, the effect became significant using the increased cutoff of 12 mut\/Mb (TMB-H prevalence = 16.7%; interaction p-value = 0.0267 for PFS, 0.0175 for OS).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>TMB status may play a role in predicting clinical outcomes in pts with advanced ESCC treated with TIS versus ICC, especially when a higher TMB cutoff is chosen.

Sin+chemo previously showed a significant improvement in OS vs chemo in pts with PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) &#8805;5 (HR 0.660; 95% CI 0.505-0.864; P=0.0023) and in all pts (HR 0.766; 95% CI 0.626-0.936; P=0.0090), with a median follow-up of 18.8 months (m) at interim analysis (Xu, et al. Ann Oncol 2021). Here we report the results from the final analysis (NCT03745170).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This double-blind, phase III trial enrolled 650 pts &#8805;18 years of age with untreated, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic G\/GEJ adenocarcinoma, regardless of PD-L1 expression. Pts were randomized 1:1 to receive sin (3 mg\/kg in pts weighing &#60;60 kg or 200 mg in pts weighing &#8805;60 kg, IV Q3W) or placebo plus chemo (oxaliplatin 130 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV Q3W for up to 6 cycles, capecitabine 1000 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> PO Bid d1-14 Q3W) for 24 months. The primary endpoints were OS in pts with CPS &#8805;5 and all randomized pts. The data cutoff date for the final analysis was Sep 2, 2022.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>With a median follow-up of 33.9 m, sin+chemo continued to show OS benefit over chemo in all pts (15.2 vs 12.3 m; HR 0.681 [95% CI: 0.571, 0.812]; P&#60;0.0001); estimated OS rates at 24 and 36 m for sin+chemo vs chemo were 37.6% vs 20.6% and 26.0% vs 10.7%, respectively. OS benefits with sin+chemo vs chemo across subgroups were generally consistent with the previous report. The updated PFS was superior with sin+chemo vs chemo (HR 0.638, 95% CI 0.530-0.768; P&#60;0.0001). The updated confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 was 58.2% vs 48.8% in all pts with measurable disease at baseline, with a median DoR of 9.9 vs 7.0 m, respectively; 47.8% of responders in sin+chemo group and 25.9% of responders in chemo group had DoR &#8805;12 m. In pts with CPS &#8805;5, significant OS benefit (median OS 19.2 vs 12.9 m; HR 0.587 [95% CI: 0.467, 0.738]; P&#60;0.0001) and superior PFS (HR 0.621, 95% CI 0.490-0.787; P&#60;0.0001) with sin+chemo over chemo remained.

On the basis of these results, T+D+CT was approved by the FDA in November 2022 for use in this setting. Here we report outcomes in POSEIDON pt subgroups defined by a range of bTMB values, including a pre-specified cutoff of 20 mutations\/megabase (mut\/Mb).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pts were randomized 1:1:1 to 1L T+D+CT (platinum-based), D+CT or CT, with stratification by tumor cell (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC &#8805;50% vs &#60;50%; VENTANA PD-L1 [SP263] assay), disease stage (IVA vs IVB) and histology (squamous vs non-squamous). bTMB was assessed using the GuardantOMNI platform. OS, PFS and ORR with T+D+CT vs CT were determined for pts with bTMB &#8805; vs &#60;20 mut\/Mb. Outcomes across additional bTMB cutoffs (10, 12 and 16 mut\/Mb) were also explored.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Plasma samples were available for 958\/1013 pts from the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Of those with available plasma samples, 81.8% (784\/958) were evaluable for bTMB, including 277 in the T+D+CT arm and 241 in the CT arm. Similar demographic characteristics and OS were observed in the bTMB evaluable vs ITT populations. Consistent with previous reports, the proportion of never smokers was higher in the bTMB &#60;20 mut\/Mb subgroup than in the bTMB &#8805;20 mut\/Mb subgroup. Across all bTMB cutoffs analyzed, OS and PFS benefit for T+D+CT vs CT were generally consistent with the ITT population in both bTMB high and bTMB low subgroups. However, at each bTMB cutoff, OS and PFS benefit appeared more prominent among pts in the bTMB high subgroups. Median OS (mOS) was longer with T+D+CT vs CT in both the bTMB &#8805;20 mut\/Mb and &#60;20 mut\/Mb subgroups and HRs suggested more pronounced benefit in the bTMB high group. mOS was 13.5 months with T+D+CT vs 10.3 months with CT (unstratified HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.88) for pts with bTMB &#8805;20 mut\/Mb and 12.6 months vs 10.9 months (unstratified HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-0.99) for pts with bTMB &#60;20 mut\/Mb. PFS and ORR showed similar trends to OS (data will be presented).

The pCR rate (95% CI) was higher with NIVO + chemo (25.0% [13.2-40.3]) vs chemo (1.9% [0.0-10.1]); MPR and TTDM also favored NIVO + chemo (<b>table<\/b>). Overall, 36 (81.8%) and 41 (77.4%) pts in the NIVO + chemo and chemo arms, respectively, had definitive surgery. Grade 3-4 tx-related and surgery-related adverse events occurred in 18 (41.9%) and 5 (13.9%) pts in the NIVO + chemo arm, respectively, vs 22 (41.5%) and 9 (22.0%) in the chemo arm.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Consistent with results in the global population of CheckMate 816, neoadjuvant NIVO + chemo improved EFS and pCR vs chemo in Chinese pts. The addition of NIVO to neoadjuvant chemo maintained tx tolerability and did not impact the feasibility of surgery. These results support neoadjuvant NIVO + chemo as a tx option for Chinese pts with resectable NSCLC.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{5833C85A-1A08-4659-BF7D-5B5E3A9E45BF}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>&#8206;&#8194;NIVO + chemo<\/b><br><b>&#8195;<\/b><b>&#8195;<\/b><b>&#8206;(n = 44)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;&#8195; <b>Chemo<\/b><br><b>&#8195;<\/b><b>&#8195; (n = 53)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median EFS (95% CI), mo<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;NR (23.4–NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;13.9 (8.3–34.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;0.47 (0.25–0.88)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>3-year EFS rate (95% CI), %<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;58.7 (40.6–73.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;35.4 (21.8–49.2)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>pCR rate (95% CI), %<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;25.0 (13.2–40.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;1.9 (0.0–10.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;Difference<sup>a<\/sup> (95% CI), %<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;20.9 (7.7–34.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;Odds ratio (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;11.05 (1.41–86.49)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>MPR rate (95% CI), %<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;34.1 (20.5–49.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;7.5 (2.1–18.2)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;Difference<sup>a<\/sup> (95% CI), %<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;28.1 (11.9–44.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;Odds ratio (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;7.42 (1.92–28.65)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median TTDM (95% CI), mo<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;NR (NR–NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;28.8 (14.8–46.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8195;HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;0.27 (0.12–0.60)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><sup>a<\/sup>Calculated using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method.<br>NR, not reached.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nivolumab,Immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Changli Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ke-Neng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qixun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lin Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qun Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaofei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kejing Ying<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenxiang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lunxu Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junke Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunfang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jichun Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mark M.

We previously reported that C+R improved median progression-free survival (PFS) in the iNHL, follicular lymphoma (FL), and non-FL groups, with a statistically significant improvement in the PTEN-positive population (Shalini et al., <i>AACR<\/i> 2022). Here we conducted NGS analysis from pts treated with either C+R or P+R for possible impact on PFS outcomes. We also determined if there was an association between plasma cytokine levels at baseline with survival.<br \/>Methods: Adult pts with relapsed B-cell iNHL were randomly assigned 2:1 to either C+R or P+R; standard dosing on a 28-day cycle applied. Either fresh or archival tumor tissues were collected for central pathology review and biomarker analysis. NGS was conducted using the TSO500 platform for 476 genes. Analyses included <i>EZH2<\/i> and <i>BCL2<\/i> mutation status in FL subset, and other genes for FL subsets and overall iNHL, as prognostic and predictive markers. The effect of mutations on PFS and overall survival (OS) outcomes was assessed. Cytokines from baseline plasma were assessed using the multiplex MSD platform (71-plex). Association between cytokine levels and PFS and OS were explored.<br \/>Results: Baseline tumor samples were evaluable by NGS from 200 pts; 127 C+R and 73 P+R. Variant alleles with frequencies &#62;10% were analyzed. One quarter (25.7%) of FL pts were determined to have <i>EZH2<\/i> mutations. C+R treatment significantly improved PFS for FL pts with in mutant <i>EZH2<\/i> (p=0.0066) compared to P+R. FL pts with mutant <i>BCL2<\/i> had a statistically improved PFS compared to WT <i>BCL2<\/i> when receiving C+R treatment. Plasma samples were available for 71-plex assessment in 373 pts; 246 C+R and 127 P+R. Pts were assigned as high or low baseline cytokine groups based on the median values. For majority of cytokines, the low cytokine group correlated with better PFS for all pts, FL and Other iNHL pts in the C+R arm. For OS, there were too few events at the time of primary data cutoff to make any associations. However, with longer follow up (2 years from primary completion) there was a significant improvement in OS in iNHL pts with low IL2 values at baseline receiving C+R compared to pts receiving P+R; HR 0.495 (95%CI: 0.270,0.908), p=0.0230. This association was only seen for pts with low (or undetected) levels of IL2 at baseline.<br \/>Conclusions: Mutation status was associated with improvements in PFS in FL pts with mutant <i>BCL2<\/i> or mutant <i>EZH2<\/i> treated with C+R. iNHL pts with low plasma levels of IL2 levels treated with C+R showed a significant improvement in OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Kinase inhibitors,PI3K,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shalini Chaturvedi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anke Weispfenning<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Bauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rong Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tine Descamps<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Bellinvia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa Lunt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lidia Mongay Soler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barrett H.

We conducted a basket trial (NCT02034110) to assess efficacy and safety of oral BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (150 mg BD) plus MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg OD) in 206 patients (eight cohorts) with BRAFV600E-mutated advanced rare cancers. Patients with anaplastic carcinoma thyroid, biliary tract cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, adenocarcinoma of small intestine, low-grade (eight histologies)\/high-grade (seven histologies) glioma, hairy cell leukemia, and multiple myeloma were treated until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death. Overall, median duration of exposure to dabrafenib and trametinib was 12.5 (1&#8211;82) and 12.0 (1&#8211;84) months, respectively. Primary endpoint was tumor response; secondary endpoints were duration of response, progression free and overall survival, and safety (investigator-assessed). Overall response rate was 56% (38.1%, 72.1%), 53% (37.7%, 68.8%), 0%, 67% (9.4%, 99.2%), 54% (25.1%, 80.8%), 33% (20.0%, 49.0%), 89% (77.8%, 95.9%), and 50% (18.7%, 81.3%), respectively. Median (95% confidence interval) duration of response was 14.4 (7.4, not reached), 8.9 (5.6, 13.7), not reached, 7.7 (not reached, not reached), not reached (5.5, not reached), 31.2 (7.4, 44.2), not reached, and 11.1 (5.6, not reached) months, respectively. Durable and clinically meaningful responses were observed in solid and hematological malignancies (21 histologies). Safety profile was acceptable; most frequent (&#8805;20% patients) treatment-related adverse events were pyrexia (40.8%), fatigue (25.7%), chills (25.7%), nausea (23.8%), and rash (20.4%). The encouraging tumor-agnostic activity of dabrafenib plus trametinib is a promising approach in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated advanced rare cancers. These results supported the accelerated FDA approval for a tumor-agnostic BRAF+MEK inhibitor combination representing a precision medicine milestone.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{D90C5900-7DAD-4FF8-BE8E-70823C04CB0F}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"9\"><b>Median progression free and overall survival in BRAFV600E-mutated advanced rare cancer patients<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ATC(N=36)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>BTC(N=43)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>LGG(N=13)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>HGG(N=45)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ASI <\/b><b>(N=3)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>HCL(N=55)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>MM(N=10)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>PFS<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.7 (4.7, 13.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.0 (5.5, 9.4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NE<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.5 (1.8, 13.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NE<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.3 (2.3, 12.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>OS<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14.5 (6.8, 23.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.5 (10.4, 17.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.6 (9.5, 32.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NE<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.8 (3.4, NR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NE<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33.9 (2.9, 44.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"9\">Patient in the GIST cohort (n=1) did not attain a complete or partial response.

Control of local disease, beyond systemic therapy, is part of the treatment paradigm being investigated in this patient population. Double balloon mediated local delivery of intra-arterial gemcitabine (IAG) into the tumor has been demonstrated to be safe in this patient population<sup>2<\/sup>. TIGeR-PaC is an ongoing Phase III clinical trial comparing the efficacy of this approach compared to standard of care IV gemcitabine\/ nab-paclitaxel (GN) for patients with LAPC.<br \/>Methods: The trial is designed with an induction phase for all patients of upfront systemic chemotherapy and radiation prior to randomization to IAG or continuation of GN. ECOG 0-1 LAPC patients receive 3 cycles of GN and 1 cycle of radiation (SBRT, 33&#8201;Gy in 5 fractions). Following induction, patients with non-progressive disease are randomized to receive IAG (8 treatments bi-weekly for 16 weeks) or continuation of GN for 4 cycles over 16 weeks. After the 16 weeks of randomized therapy, patients with non-progressive disease receive continuation systemic therapy of GN or low-dose oral capecitabine, per investigator&#8217;s preference until disease progression and are followed for survival only. The primary endpoint is the overall survival (OS), and the study is powered at an 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6 between the two arms. It is assumed that the hazard functions are proportional only during the randomized treatment period, after which the two hazard functions become approximately identical during the continuing treatment period. The primary endpoint of OS for the two treatment arms will be compared using a 2-sided Wilcoxon test. The first interim analysis of the trial for the ITT population is performed after the 26<sup>th<\/sup> out of an expected 86 events have occurred in the trial (30%).<br \/>Clinical Endpoint Analysis: The first interim analysis of the primary endpoint of OS was conducted on Feb 2<sup>nd<\/sup>, 2023. This was based on a data lock on survival status of all patients after the sponsor became aware that the 26<sup>th<\/sup> event in the trial occurred on Dec. 21<sup>st<\/sup>, 2022. As of that date, 45 patients had been randomized in the trial and the survival status of all 45 subjects was used as of the date for analysis. Of the 45 patients randomized, 23 were randomized to IAG and 22 to continuation of IV GN. There were equal number of primary events, 13, in each arm. The median survival in the control arm is 10 months, versus 16 months in the IAG arm. The p-values based on Wilcoxson non-proportional hazard ratio is 0.051 between the 2 arms. The study continues to accrue patients with a second interim analysis (after 52 events) expected at end of 2024.<br \/>1. Hammel P, Huguet F, van Laethem JL, et al.

Standard of care (SOC) includes azacitidine (A), with complete and partial response (CR and PR) rates ranging between 10-17%. The pro-inflammatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays a central role in stimulating leukemic monocyte proliferation. Lenzilumab (LENZ) is a proprietary Humaneered&#174; first-in-class monoclonal antibody with best-in-class specificity and affinity that neutralizes GM-CSF to prevent signaling through its receptor. The PREcision Approach to CHronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (PREACH-M) trial assesses the efficacy of LENZ in CMML (ACTRN12621000223831p) to improve outcomes beyond those afforded by SOC.<br \/>Methods: PREACH-M is a Phase 2\/3 non-randomized, open-label precision medicine trial in 72 adults aged at least 18 years, newly diagnosed with WHO 2016 criteria for CMML; cytopenia (hemoglobin &#60; 100 g\/L, platelets &#60; 100 x 10<sup>9<\/sup>\/L or absolute neutrophil count &#60; 1.8 x 10<sup>9<\/sup>\/L): white blood cell count &#8805; 13 x10<sup>9<\/sup>\/L; as well as <i>TET2 <\/i>and\/or RAS pathway mutations (<i>NRAS<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>CBL<\/i>). Key exclusion criteria include prior treatment with investigational agents; radiotherapy within 28 days before treatment; treatment with G-CSF within 7 days of screening; GM-CSF within 28 days of screening; and uncontrolled medical conditions. Subjects exhibiting RAS pathway mutations, with or without <i>TET2<\/i> mutations, receive 24 cycles (28 days) of A (SC; 75 mg\/m<sup>2 <\/sup>for 7 days) and LENZ (IV; 552 mg; d1 &#38; d15 of cycle 1 and d1 only for all subsequent cycles); while those with non-RAS pathway mutations receive the same A regimen and sodium ascorbate (IV; 30 g for 7 days [15 g for 1st dose only, 30 g thereafter if no evidence of tumor lysis syndrome]; PO; 1.1g on all other days). Subjects who complete 24 cycles of treatment are followed every 6 months for 24 months for survival, disease status, and CMML-related therapy. The primary endpoint is the frequency of CR or PR at any time during the first 12 cycles according to Savona Criteria. Secondary endpoints include overall survival and progression-free survival at 2 years; proportion of subjects with clinical benefit at any point during the 24 cycles; impact on physical and functional capacity; social well-being according to Multidimensional Geriatric Assessment and quality of life; as well as hematological and non-hematologic safety.<br \/>Results: As of December 31, 2022, eight subjects were treated with A and LENZ (5 females, mean age of 67 years; 3 males, mean age of 69 years); among them 6 were evaluable based on at least 3 months of follow-up.

Aiming to improve therapeutic outcomes, we herein describe a neoantigen peptide vaccine against H3.3-K27M which effectively triggers both CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A neoantigen vaccine was designed to trigger T cell immunity against DIPGs harboring the H3.3-K27M mutation. ENACTING (NCT04749641) was then initiated as an open-label, single center, two-armed phase 1 trial to assess T cell immune responses and vaccine safety. The vaccine was administered intramuscularly with poly-ICLC adjuvant until tumor progression or untolerated toxicity. PBMCs before and after each vaccine treatment were collected for TCR repertoire analysis and immune response assessment.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of November 2022, 10 patients have been treated. No grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events have been observed, with fever (80%) and injection site pain (60%) being the most common AEs. On a per patient basis, vaccines induce a landscape change of TCR repertoire in patients&#8217; PBMC after 4-6 times of dosing, indicating multiple dosing is required to trigger extensive T cell responses. T cell responses against neoantigens were detected and H3.3-K27M mutation-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and two CD8<sup>+<\/sup> clones were validated. Among 9 efficacy-assessable patients, the one-year overall survival rate was 71.4%. The mPFS has reached 11.7 months and increasing. One patient reached complete response.

WEE1 plays a role in DNA repair and cell cycle control and is overexpressed in pediatric cancers. Adavosertib combinations resulted in enhanced antitumor activity compared to single agent in neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, medulloblastoma and high-grade glioma <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<sup> <\/sup>The efficacy and safety of the adavosertib-carboplatin combination has been established in adults with focus on <i>TP53<\/i> mutated ovarian cancer. Arm C of AcS&#233;-ESMART applied this regimen to children with advanced malignancies enriched for alterations in <i>TP53<\/i>, DNA repair\/replication stress and cell cycle control.<br \/>Methods: Adavosertib was administered orally, twice daily on Days 1 to 3 and carboplatin intravenously on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Dose finding used the continuous reassessment method starting at adavosertib 100 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/dose and carboplatin AUC 5. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and retrospective molecular bioinformatic analysis was performed.<br \/>Results: Twenty patients (median age: 14.0 years, range 3.4-23.5) were included, 18 received a total of 69 cycles. Seven dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed leading to two de-escalations to adavosertib 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/dose and carboplatin AUC 4. All patients with DLT had thrombocytopenia grade 3\/4 requiring transfusions for &#62;7 days and\/or neutropenia grade 4 for &#62;7 days. Main overall treatment-related toxicities were hematologic and gastrointestinal. Based on the identified DLT risk, no recommended Phase 2 dose was defined. PK analysis demonstrated equivalent adavosertib exposure in children to that in adults and both doses (75 and 100 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) achieved the cell kill target. Two patients with neuroblastoma achieved partial response (PR), one with medulloblastoma unconfirmed PR, and five had stable disease (SD) &#62;4 cycles. Patients with PR\/SD &#62;4 cycles were considered as clinical benefit (CB) for retrospective molecular analysis. There was no correlation between <i>TP53<\/i> genomic alteration alone and response. However, 7 of 8 patients with CB but none of the 10 patients without CB had 1 to 3 genomic alterations in the DNA repair (<i>BRCA2<\/i> mutation, <i>11q<\/i> loss containing <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>MRE11A<\/i>, <i>CHEK1<\/i>), cell cycle control\/replication stress (<i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification, <i>RB1<\/i> mutation\/loss, <i>SETD2<\/i> mutation\/loss) and <i>RAS<\/i> pathway (<i>KRAS<\/i> mutation and amplification, <i>NF1<\/i> loss, <i>PTPN11<\/i> mutation) in their tumor.<br \/>Conclusions: Adavosertib combined with carboplatin exhibited significant hematologic toxicity. Activity signals and identified potential molecular biomarkers suggest further combination studies with less hematotoxic DNA damaging therapy in molecularly enriched pediatric cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT09-01 Phase I, II, or III clinical trials in pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"WEE1,Carboplatin,TP53,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susanne A.

Arm D was evaluating the PARP inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib (ola) in combination with irinotecan (iri). In contrast to other PARPi\/chemotherapy combination studies, we opted for a prolonged course of PARPi and low dose irinotecan as sensitizer. The Phase I part previously established the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) (Gatz ASCO 2019). This is the report of the Phase II part of the trial assessing the activity in two separate expansion cohorts: cohort 1: homologous recombination repair defect (HRD) and cohort 2: Ewing sarcoma (ES).<br \/>Methods: Ola was administered orally twice daily at 90 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on Days 1 to 10 and iri intravenously at 20 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on Days 4 to 8 of a 21-day cycle. Activity assessment followed a Minimax Simon 2-stage design. Each cohort was to progress to the second stage (additional 9 patients) if 2 or more confirmed responses were observed in the first 16 patients. Patients treated in the Phase I part at the RP2D were counting towards the respective expansion cohorts.<br \/>Results: Seventy patients (median age: 14 years, range 5-23) were included in the whole study, 67 received treatment; 27 patients were treated in the dose escalation part, including 10 at the RP2D (8 in cohort 1 and 2 in cohort 2). Both cohorts passed the 1<sup>st<\/sup> stage and a total of 24 and 26 patients were recruited to cohort 1 and 2, respectively. Main diagnoses in cohort 1 were sarcoma (n=10), brain tumor (n=9), neuroblastoma (n=4). In cohort 1, 15 of 24 patients were considered enriched based on molecular alteration at relapse (<i>ATM<\/i> n=6; <i>BRCA1<\/i> n=2; DNA signature 3 n=3; <i>FANCD2<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>, <i>FANCA, ATRX<\/i> all n=1); all patients in cohort 2 had presence of a ES fusion (ESWR1::FLI1 n=22; EWSR1::ERG n=4). Median number of treatment cycles were 2, range 1;51 in cohort 1 and 1;32+ in cohort 2. In cohort 1, 3 patients had a partial response (PR) (pinealoblastoma, neuroblastoma, choroid plexus carcinoma; treated with 12, 51, 25 cycles), 1 patient an unconfirmed PR (rhabdomyosarcoma, 6 cycles) and 7 patients stable disease (SD) (2 prolonged with 6 and 8 cycles). In cohort 2, 1 patient had a complete response (10 cycles) and 1 a PR (32+ cycles), 7 patients had SD (3 prolonged with 6, 10, 16 cycles). Molecular enrichment did not predict response. Retrospective correlative analysis of the molecular profiling data and tumor tissue expression analysis are ongoing to identify predictive biomarkers for PARPi combination trials and data will be presented.<br \/>Conclusions: Encouraging clinical benefit was observed with the protracted ola-iri schedule in a subset of patients. Current molecular hypothesis is insufficient for patient selection and better biomarkers are needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT09-01 Phase I, II, or III clinical trials in pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP,Molecular profiling,Pediatric cancers,Ewing sarcoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susanne A.

Here we describe a study to determine the feasibility of leveraging genomic profiling results within a molecular tumor board (MTB) to make real&#8209;time treatment decisions for children with relapsed\/refractory solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: Subjects were divided to 3 strata: Strata 1: Relapsed\/refractory neuroblastoma, Strata 2: Relapsed\/refractory CNS tumors, and Strata 3: Relapsed\/refractory rare solid tumors. Samples were sent for tumor\/normal whole exome (WES) and tumor whole transcriptome sequencing, and the genomic data were used in a MTB to make real&#8209;time treatment decisions. The MTB recommended plan allowed for a combination of up to 4 agents. Feasibility was measured by time to completion of genomic sequencing, MTB review and initiation of treatment. Response was assessed after every 2 cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Patient benefit was calculated by the sum of the CR, PR, SD, and NED subjects divided by the sum of CR, PR, SD, NED, and PD subjects. Grade 3 and higher related and unexpected adverse events (AEs) were tabulated for safety evaluation.<br \/>Results: 144 eligible subjects were enrolled with 144 evaluable for safety and 124 evaluable for response. Tumor types included neuroblastoma (n=31), CNS tumors (n=41), and rare tumors (n=72). Sarcomas (n=40) were the most common tumor type in the rare tumor stratum. The average time from biopsy to completion of DNA\/RNA sequencing was 10 days (range 2-31 days); to completed analysis and drug prediction report, 17 days (8-41); 23 days (10-66) to MTB decisions; and 38 days (18-146) to initiation of the 4-drug combination agreed upon by the MTB. Treatments were selected on DNA and RNA findings in 19.5% of cases and in 80.5% on RNA alone. Patient benefit was exhibited in 70% of all subjects, 85% of neuroblastoma subjects, 73% of CNS tumor subjects, and 62% of rare tumor subjects. AEs occurred in &#60;1% of the subject cohort. Grade 3 leukopenia was the only unexpected hematologic AE. There were 7 occurrences of unexpected non&#8209;hematologic AEs: grade 4 elevated ALT (1), grade 3 elevated AST (1), grade 3 dehydration (1), grade 3 infection (2), grade 3 oral mucositis (1), and grade 3 pancreatitis (1).<br \/>Conclusions: It has been well-established that comprehensive genomic sequencing is the future of precision medicine. Here, we have demonstrated the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a comprehensive sequencing model to guide targeted therapy for patients with any relapsed\/refractory solid malignancies. Targeted therapy was well tolerated, and the response benefit rate of 70% in these heavily pretreated populations suggests that this treatment could be an effective option for relapsed and refractory pediatric cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT09-01 Phase I, II, or III clinical trials in pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Genomics,Targeted therapy,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Giselle L.

Aberrant Wnt signaling has been identified as a key mechanism of cancer biology, resulting in uncontrolled transcription of pro-oncogenic Wnt target genes. Pre-clinical in vivo studies of tegavivint demonstrated anti-tumor activity in a variety of pediatric solid tumors, including osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and lymphoma.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study of single agent tegavivint in children aged &#8805;12 months to &#8804;21 years with relapsed or refractory solid tumors including lymphoma and desmoid tumors. The dose escalation was conducted using a rolling six design starting with the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in adults, 5 mg\/kg, administered intravenously over four hours on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. A single de-escalation to 4 mg\/kg and escalations to 6.5 mg\/kg and 8 mg\/kg if pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters indicated were planned. Once the RP2D is defined a PK cohort and phase 2 cohorts including Ewing sarcoma, desmoid tumor, osteosarcoma, liver tumors, Wilms tumor and a disease agnostic cohort including cancers with Wnt alterations will be evaluated.<br \/>Results: A total of 15 patients were enrolled on the phase 1 part of the study. Two patients were not treated due to pre-therapy DEXA scan demonstrating grade 1 osteoporosis; therefore, 13 patients received treatment with tegavivint on 2 dose levels (5 mg\/kg and 6.5 mg\/kg). The median age of treated patients was 16 years (range 3-21). Patient diagnoses included desmoid tumor (5), Wilms tumor (3), and one each of Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, <i>CIC::DUX4<\/i> sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There were no dose limiting toxicities among 4 DLT-evaluable patients at DL1 and 6 at DL2. The maximum tolerated dose was not determined. Grade three or higher adverse events at least possibly related to treatment included anemia (2) and lymphopenia (2). A single patient had a grade 3 QT prolongation requiring cessation of tegavivint after cycle 3. At 5 mg\/kg, the mean AUC was 94,900 hr*ng\/mL (range 52,000-136,000), and at 6.5 mg\/kg was 91,200 hr*ng\/mL (range 28,400-144,000). The pediatric RP2D dose was determined to be 6.5 mg\/kg based on the pre-specified objective of achieving pharmacologically relevant plasma concentrations and less than 20% difference in mean AUC between the two tested dose levels.<br \/>Conclusions: Tegavivint is well tolerated in children with refractory solid tumors, the pediatric RP2D is 6.5 mg\/kg demonstrating pharmacologically relevant plasma concentrations. The study is currently enrolling patients to a pharmacokinetic expansion cohort and will then proceed to phase 2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT09-01 Phase I, II, or III clinical trials in pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt pathway,Pediatric cancers,Phase I,Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah B.
