A major driver of the evolutionary capacity of cancer populations is the dynamic interactions of spatial and temporal variations in environmental conditions with malignant cells that can access a vast number of phenotypic properties encoded in the human genome. The research paradigm in cancer treatment remains focused on finding &#8220;magic bullets&#8221; that can kill all cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed - <i>the<\/i> cure for cancer. Current standard of care principles for metastatic cancers applies one or more drugs <i>as though<\/i> they were the cure for cancer - continuously at Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) until unambiguous evidence of tumor progression. However, because of the phenotypic diversity in most large metastatic cancers, this approach is usually unsuccessful because continuous MTD therapy will eventually kill the population of drug-sensitive cells and leave behind a population of resistant cancer cells that can proliferate unopposed by competition with other populations. I will discuss integration of evolutionary dynamics into cancer therapy. Arguably, this is already widespread because the search for magic bullets and the MTD treatment strategy is built upon an implicit assumption that cancer cure requires a one-cause, one-event extinction similar to the KT impact that eradicated non-avian dinosaurs. However, investigations of recent actual (e.g., Passenger pigeons) and attempted (e.g., pest management) species extinctions in the Anthropocene era have demonstrate more complex dynamics. In fact, most species extinctions are caused by a <i>sequence<\/i> of perturbations none of which, by itself, could eradicate the population. These dynamics can be integrated into evolution-based treatment approaches to control and perhaps cure currently fatal metastatic cancers with currently available (i.e., non-magic bullet) drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL05-02 New study designs: Theory, methodology, and modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor evolution,Therapy resistance,Evolution-based cancer therapy,adaptive and extinction therapies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robert A.

The general goals of the chemotherapy control schemes are to delay the onset of chemo-resistance as long as possible with combination schedules that suppress the competitive release of resistant cell populations. I will describe how to design combined schedules that drive the system optimally to a desired balance of the relevant subpopulations, then lock the system into evolutionary cycles with adaptive chemo-schedules. I will also describe how to use the reinforcement learning paradigm as a control procedure to produce a new class of chemo-schedules in a stochastic model setting that are complicated, but instructive and interesting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Chemoresistance,Drug resistance,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul Newton<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
