[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Cancer tumorigenesis and progression are driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations, giving rise to transcriptional and pathway dysregulation. An approach considering the level of pathway disruption and underlying genomic drivers may provide a more comprehensive understanding of tumor biology than assessing either factor alone. Here, we developed a machine learning platform that integrates DNA alterations and RNA expression data to measure the activation states of oncogenic signaling pathways and characterize novel genetic alterations that may cause pathway dysregulation.<br \/>Methods: Using real-world de-identified patient records from the Tempus Database, the platform trains models on gene expression using arbitrarily complex combinations of somatic alterations and clinical phenotypes as positive and negative cohort labels. We applied this framework to model pathway activities (TCGA PanCan pathways: Cell Cycle, HIPPO, MYC, NRF2, NOTCH, PI3K, P53, RTK\/RAS, TGFB, WNT) among patients who received Tempus xT, a targeted DNA and whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing assay. For each pathway, the positive cohort comprised samples with at least 1 pathogenic short variant or CNV in a predefined pathway gene list, while the negative cohort comprised samples with no detected somatic alterations in any of the genes. Model performance was measured by AUC and evaluated for each individual cancer type using a hold-out dataset.<br \/>Results: We applied the platform to 15,217 samples across 22 cancer types to develop models of pathway dysregulation. Several pan-cancer models were strongly predictive of dysregulation in individual cancer types, including PI3K in prostatic (AUC=0.86) and pancreatic adenocarcinomas (0.85), and TGFB in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (AUC=0.94) and meningioma (0.90). To assess the platform&#8217;s ability to predict the effects of variants on pathway activity, the model was trained to predict RAS variant pathogenicity in colorectal cancer. Without knowledge of rare variant classifications, this model supported the established pathogenicity of several rare KRAS variants (e.g., K117N, A146T) and returned pathogenicity measures for several other variants that were highly consistent with published in vitro data. We applied the same approach to identify potential modifiers of HIPPO pathway disruption in high grade glioma, with results suggesting RB1 mutations as putative modulators of HIPPO dysregulation.<br \/>Conclusion: We developed a method for modeling oncogenic processes and applied it to a large real-world database. The method differentiated between oncogenic drivers and passenger alterations with high accuracy, and measured the relative levels of pathway activation states between and within cancer subtypes.

In particular, it is expected that metabolism-derived data somehow reflects unique features associated with a cancer patient&#8217;s prognosis. Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts metabolic drug targets by considering metabolites associated with poor prognosis. For inputs, the computational framework requires genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) and survival data that represent each of cancer patients with diverse prognoses. GEM is a computational model that allows predicting fluxes of entire metabolic reactions in a patient-specific manner. By using this computational framework, a risk score, which reflects the prognosis of cancer patients, was first established on the basis of metabolites significantly associated with survival. Finally, metabolic reaction targets were predicted that could reduce the risk score (i.e., improving the prognosis) upon their knockdown <i>in silico<\/i>. In this study, this framework was applied to bladder cancer patients as a proof-of-concept demonstration, and predicted 13 metabolic reaction targets. These metabolic reaction targets were expected to be also effective to bladder cancer patients with poor prognosis. The computational framework developed in this study is distinct from previous drug targeting methods because it also considers unique metabolic features associated with cancer patients with poor prognosis in order to identify drug targets that are effective to both low-risk and high-risk groups of cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Therapeutic target,Prognostic markers,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sang Mi Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, GaRyoung Lee<sup><\/sup>, Hyun Uk Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"95fdaddf-8080-410b-aa62-0e93a8fd431b","ControlNumber":"5568","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

In the past, our enrollment efforts involved manual mechanisms that began at the time that cancer patients were presented for care, most commonly at our chemotherapy clinics. We reasoned that computational review of pathology records may be far more efficient, allowing us to screen larger numbers of patients, and may allow us to intercept patients at the <i>time of diagnosis<\/i>, rather than<i> time of care<\/i>. We thus implemented a new workflow: (1) computational query of pathology database to filter candidates based on key eligibility criteria; (2) validation of the query using a clinical research coordinator, who can then (3) navigate the patient to the trial. As a proof of concept, starting in August of 2022, we selected two gastrointestinal oncology trials, the COBRA and PACES trial, based on trial eligibility that could be easily extracted using pathologic criteria, and because these trials had low enrollment. We designed computational queries to extract cohorts of potential patients whose surgery dates and pathology staging identified potential clinical trial candidates. A coordinator performed chart-review to validate these candidates. The trial coordinator then contacted the patient&#8217;s surgical oncologist, facilitated referral to a medical oncologist, and tracked the number of patients approached and consented. Whereas in a 12-month period preceding this new workflow, we had 0 and 1 patients approached for the PACES and COBRA trial, in the 3-month period following the new intervention, we had 8 and 2 patients approached. These data suggest computational cohort building and subsequent navigation have the potential to improve enrollment onto clinical trials and motivate extension of this work to additional trials. <u>Table(s)<\/u><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{7C91CD84-C89C-4BA3-9DAB-09DDC5E186D0}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Trial<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"># of patients approached pre-intervention<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Computational Criteria<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Meeting computational criteria<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Coordinator validation criteria<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"># of patients validated by coordinator<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"># of patients connected with medical oncologist<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"># of patients approached post-intervention<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PACES<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Colorectal cancer, stage T0-T3,N0-1 Date Aug 2021 &#8211; July 2022<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Facility location, No evidence of disease on colonoscopy performed 120 -456 days post-surgery, No chemotherapy, No other malignancy<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">COBRA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Colorectal cancer pT3N0resection date August 2022 &#8211; October 2022<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8805; 12 lymph nodes assessedPatient locationIf the subject appropriate for active surveillanceSurgery within 14-60 days of randomization<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Colon cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yonah Ziemba<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaitlin Parnahay<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul Ward<sup>2<\/sup>, Nalan Yurtsever<sup>1<\/sup>, Sharon Fox<sup>1<\/sup>, Cheryl Schleicher<sup>1<\/sup>, Priya Singh-Shiwsankar<sup>2<\/sup>, Vincent Vinciguerra<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph Herman<sup>2<\/sup>, James  M.

In particular, CAFs are known to have tumor-assisting functions, which may promote active growth and survival of the interacting cancer cells through their metabolic reprogramming despite being in a harsh environment (e.g., hypoxia or low pH). In this regard, CAF-derived metabolites are expect to have profound effects on metabolism of the cancer cells. To identify novel CAF-derived metabolites that may heavily influence the cancer cells, CAF-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) were reconstructed and simulated. GEM is a computational model that can predict a metabolic state in a cell-specific manner by integrating omics data (e.g., RNA-seq data). In this study, a total of six GEMs were reconstructed by integrating RNA-seq data from one normal fibroblast, originating from pancreas, and five CAFs associated with breast, colon, skin, lung, and pancreatic tumors. Simulation of the GEMs predicted 20 metabolites that appeared to be heavily used by all the five CAF GEMs in comparison with the one normal fibroblast GEM. Such metabolites were expected to be significantly associated with establishment of TME that is favorable for the cancer cells&#8217; growth. Some of these metabolites are associated with pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Upon experimental validation, the predicted metabolites are expected to help better understand CAFs and TME in terms of metabolites, and also provide clues for identifying effective drug targets for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Metabolism,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hae Deok Jung<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yoo Jin Sung<sup>1<\/sup>, Jae Yong Ryu<sup>2<\/sup>, Hyun Uk Kim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Biotechnology, Duksung Women's University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c778de65-ef2a-4761-800c-5e01faf7a4d0","ControlNumber":"5615","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

These damaged sites and mutations are known to not be randomly distributed; in fact, previous research suggests potential relationships between damaged\/mutated sites and transcription factors (TFs), proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to target sequences across the genome. To examine relationships between UV damages and TF binding sites on a genomic level, we integrated data from the Duke iMADS database of TF binding sites, CPD damage maps across the human genome, ATAC-seq accessibility data from the Cistrome database, and mutation data from Australian melanoma patients (from the ICGC consortium). We developed a computational workflow to measure the spatial distribution of damage\/mutations at TF binding sites. Our analysis showed a strong association between the positions of CPD damages and mutations within the binding sites of ETS1, but not E2F or c-Myc, with the peaks in damage\/mutations primarily residing at the central core of the ETS1 binding sites. The creation of such an analytic pipeline will enable the further quantitative genome-wide study of the relationships between the degrees of damages\/mutations within TF binding sites, chromatin accessibility, and other genomic contexts.

Relapsed AML remains a clinical challenge. Epigenetic heterogeneity may contribute to transcriptional dysregulation and disease progression in AML. However, what specific transcriptional programs and potential regulatory mechanisms contribute to disease relapse are not yet well understood. To characterize the global transcriptional landscapes in relapsed AML, we integrated genomics data from two cohorts of matched diagnosis and relapse patient specimens. We identified 5,416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between diagnosis and relapse in Cohort I. Unsupervised clustering yielded three distinct DEG groups: group A, B and C genes that were predominantly (88%) down-regulated, divergently regulated, or predominantly (65%) up-regulated, respectively, upon relapse. The expression pattern of all DEGs separated the patients into two clusters, most robustly by Group B genes. Interestingly, the majority of DEGs did not associate with changes in gene promoter methylation. Similar patterns were observed in Cohort II. We used Binding Analysis for Regulation of Transcription (BART) to identify transcriptional regulators (TRs) that potentially regulated the DEGs not associated with DNA methylation changes, and assessed the differential expression of identified TRs during disease progression. PU.1 was identified as a potential TR for Group A genes and was down-regulated upon relapse. GATA1 and TAL1 were identified as regulating Group B genes and were up-regulated in patient cluster1 and down-regulated in cluster2, consistent with the expression pattern of Group B genes. RBBP5 was a top predicted TR for Group C genes and was up-regulated upon relapse. We next validated the potential functionality of those predicted factors. In NSG mice transplanted with a human AML specimen, TAL1 and GATA1 were downregulated in AML cells collected four weeks after chemotherapy treatment, and were inferred as TRs for the down-regulated genes, similar to the patient data. PU.1 was inferred as regulating the up-regulated genes. Furthermore, we found that the level of differential expression of TAL1, GATA1, and PU.1 in each patient specimen associated with the correlation of DEG profiles between the patient specimen and TR perturbation in human-derived hematopoietic cell lines. Our results support the possibility that in some AML patients, TRs with roles in hematopoiesis and leukemia might contribute to disease relapse. Further mechanistic studies deciphering the molecular and phenotypic events facilitated by these TRs will yield significant insight into disease biology and possible therapeutic targeting approaches in relapsed AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Transcription factor,Transcriptional regulation,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Zhenjia Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yaseswini Neelamraju<sup>1<\/sup>, Cem Meydan<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicholas Dunham<sup>1<\/sup>, Jorge Gandara<sup>2<\/sup>, Tak Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Subhash Prajapati<sup>1<\/sup>, Franck Rapaport<sup>3<\/sup>, Caroline Sheridan<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul Zumbo<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Becker<sup>4<\/sup>, Lars Bullinger<sup>5<\/sup>, Martin Carroll<sup>6<\/sup>, Richard D’Andrea<sup>7<\/sup>, Richard Dillon<sup>8<\/sup>, Ross Levine<sup>3<\/sup>, Christopher  E.

Single-cell RNA-seq can provide valuable insights into the heterogeneity of cancer cells within and across tumor samples. We performed a meta-analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets containing primary tumor samples from patients with non-small-cell-lung cancer (NSCLC) to characterize modules of co-expressed genes and determine associations with histological, genetic, and immune features.<br \/>Methods: scRNA-seq data of 116,260 cells from 127 NSCLC samples including lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) and lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSCs) were collected and merged from 12 datasets. Cancer cells were identified by inferring copy number variations (CNVs). Celda was used to identify 163 gene co-expression modules across cancer cells. MAST was used to assess association of each module with histology, stage, and study. CaDrA was used to identify combinations of genomic features associated with gene modules projected into TCGA bulk RNA-seq.<br \/>Result: Broad biological category of modules included those related to lineage, cell cycle and proliferation, extracellular matrix production (ECM), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), antigen presentation, xenobiotic metabolism, stress response, chemokine signaling, interferon signaling, housekeeping, and other general cellular processes. The modules most strongly associated with study-specific effects were enriched in housekeeping and ribosomal genes. Several ECM and cell-cycling modules were induced in advanced LUADs while MHC class II modules were reduced in late stage disease. Several modules containing different surfactant proteins or secretoglobins were identified and displayed heterogeneity within and across early-stage LUADs. Three modules in LUSCs were enriched for detoxification enzymes and associated with somatic mutations in different members of the Nrf2 pathway. A module of genes involved in keratinization displayed intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity across LUSCs and was associated with neutrophil infiltration scores in samples from TCGA.<br \/>Conclusion: We employed a novel meta-analysis approach to study gene co-expression patterns that are active in lung cancer cells profiled with single-cell RNA-seq.

For example, ADRs such as encephalopathy, radiation recall dermatitis, acute cardiogenic shock and febrile neutropenia have been reported for 5-fluorouracil, an anticancer drug used to treat several cancer types. These ADRs may be caused by a single drug or by interactions with other drugs. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to predict potential ADRs a priori because the occurrence of ADR depends on the patient&#8217;s genetics and health condition as well as a combination of drugs taken together. To address this problem, we use electric health record (EHR) data of breast cancer patients as a proof-of-concept demonstration to develop a machine learning model that predicts ADRs. For this, administrations of breast cancer patients, diagnostic records, and additional personal information (e.g., age and gender) were used as input data. To deal with high sparsity of EHR data, which has categorical information, factorization machine was applied. Factorization machine can effectively capture key information in an sparse environment. The model classifies whether a patient shows one of pre-defined ADRs as an output. The machine learning model developed in this study can be useful for predicting potential ADRs of various drugs by taking into account a patient&#8217;s health condition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Adverse drug reaction,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kang Seongmo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Suehyun Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Hyunah Shin<sup>3<\/sup>, Hyun Uk Kim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>College of Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Healthcare Data Science Center, Konyang University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5b1ebd10-cdef-4f59-be2b-805391b51a4a","ControlNumber":"5650","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Fifty-four percent of the patients are expected to die of the disease in the United States alone. The five-year overall survival rate for these cancers is 22.9 percent. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for forty percent of all lung cancer cases in the United States. Genetic biomarker-based early detection and precision treatment of LUAD patients can play a critical role in the reduction of the mortality rate. The purpose of this investigation was to use an integrated bioinformatics approach to identify differentially expressed Hub genes in LUAD with <u>&#62;<\/u> 10 connections in the genetic interaction network(s). The higher number of genetic interactions potentially suggests their important role in patient survival. Out of 23,483 genes from seven published cancer studies and databases, we identified 107 significantly altered (up or down-regulated) genes that are common to all data sources. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) showed that many of the identified 107 genes were involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, ATP binding, and cancer pathways. A protein-protein interaction network was mapped with the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes\/Proteins (STRING). This analysis revealed 1116 protein-to-protein interactions (PPI) among the 107 genes. We selected 25 genes, which exhibited &#62;30 PPI interactions each which showed Cox coefficients for gene expression, where a positive coefficient corresponds to a worse survival rate with higher levels of gene expression, while a negative coefficient corresponds to a better prognosis with lower levels of gene expression; it also provided a False Discovery Rate (FDR) with a corrected p-value. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for genes that had an FDR of below 0.05 were graphed inside of the OncoLnc tool. Patients were subclassified into the low- and high-Hub gene expression level groups if the median expression was in the bottom 25 percentile or top 25 percentile. Hub genes isolated from Cytoscape were entered into OncoLnc to collect data on the relationship between LUAD patients (n=492) survival and gene expression, which resulted in the identification of three genes, Checkpoint Kinase 1, Cyclin E1, and Exonuclease 1. All three genes showed a significant correlation between increased differential expression in LUAD and worsened patient survival. These signature Hub genes (Checkpoint Kinase 1, Cyclin E1, and Exonuclease 1) and associated genetic networks can potentially be developed as early diagnostic markers or targets in precision gene therapies for improved prognosis of LUAD patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer markers,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Bioinformatics,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Prateek Gupta<sup>1<\/sup>, Leya Joykutty<sup>2<\/sup>, Diaaidden Alwadi<sup>3<\/sup>, Ana Ruas<sup>4<\/sup>, Deodutta Roy<sup>3<\/sup>, Quentin Felty<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Alok Deoraj<\/b><sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Miami, Miami, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>American Heritage School, Plantation, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>Florida International University, Miami, FL,<sup>4<\/sup>Florida International Univerrsity, Miami, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cad15d79-86da-4433-88c1-80636a7d0b9f","ControlNumber":"7781","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Although immunotherapy is standard-of-care for ESBC, the number of benefiting patients remains small, and the therapy itself can prompt severe immune-related adverse events. To date, efforts to identify biomarkers of IO response, such as those targeting the PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling axis, have failed to robustly demarcate predictive features that translate across cohorts. Here, we applied an integrative computational approach to develop the <i>IOScope<\/i> biomarker, which predicts IO response in ESBC. Our method overcomes many of the limitations of invasive, costly, and time-consuming IO response analyses derived from transcriptomics data, and advances beyond the inability of single-site biopsies to account for tumor heterogeneity.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed single-cell and whole-tissue RNA-seq data from non-IO treated ESBC patients in the I-SPY trials, as well as 23 manually-curated gene expression signatures representing the &#8220;hallmarks of cancer&#8221;, in order to associate PD-L1 levels with local tumor biology. We then correlated PD-L1 expression to biophysical features derived from patient DCE-MRIs to generate the <i>IOScope <\/i>biomarker. We quantified <i>IOScope<\/i> within patient tumors using integrative computational modeling and developed a corresponding <i>IOScope Score<\/i>. The <i>IOScope<\/i> biomarker and <i>Score<\/i> were then applied to data from IO-treated patients in the I-SPY2 clinical trial to assess their performance in predicting pCR in response to IO therapy. We additionally validated IOScope in a virtual clinical trial, comparing pCR rates to empirical data.<br \/>Results: We validated the <i>IOScope<\/i> biomarker and the <i>IOScope Score<\/i> in a small, independent cohort of IO-treated patients (n=17) and correctly predicted pCR response in 15\/17 individuals (88.2% accuracy, comprising 10\/12 in TNBC and 5\/5 in HR+\/HER2-). We further applied the <i>IOScope Score<\/i> in a virtual clinical trial (N = 292) simulating IO administration in IO-na&#239;ve cohort (Virtual Tumor Bank, SimBioSys, Inc.). Using this approach, we predicted an increase in pCR rates of 28.5% (TNBC) and 8.9% (HR+\/HER2-) with the addition of IO therapy to a standard chemotherapy background. These predicted increases in pCR rate compare favorably to published rates increases produced by IO in both cancer subtypes.<br \/>Conclusion: The<i> IOScope <\/i>biomarker and <i>IOScope Score <\/i>represent a next generation approach using integrative computational and biophysical analysis to assess cancer responsiveness to immunotherapy. This biomarker, predicated on MRI-derived tumor microenvironmental features, allows for immuno-oncology profiling of tumors in a rapid, non-invasive manner and may confer high clinical decision impact to further enable personalized oncologic care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Breast cancer,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel Cook<\/b><sup><\/sup>, John Pfeiffer<sup><\/sup>, Joseph Peterson<sup><\/sup>, Nicole Liadis<sup><\/sup>, Matthew Biancalana<sup><\/sup>, Dorys  A.

An IHC 3+ score is considered positive and 2+ (with a negative ISH), 1+, and zero scores are considered negative. Recently, HER2-low (1+, 2+) breast cancer has been proposed as a targetable disease distinct from TNBC. Indeed, use of an anti-HER2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in HER2-low metastatic patients resulted in improved progression free and overall survival (DESTINY-Breast04), and remarkably generated a response in HER2-zero cases. The potential to expand the current treatment for HER2-low and -zero patients, highlights the limitations of traditional HER2 assessment, including HER2 intra-tumoral heterogeneity, differential IHC pathology staining, and inter-reader variability. We therefore sought to address how to optimally identify HER2-low TNBC patients that may benefit from HER2 ADCs.<br \/>Methods: We developed a rapid, non-invasive test to determine HER2-low status in TNBC tumors. Our test uses radiological imaging (DCE-MRIs) coupled with the biophysical simulation platform TumorScope and is informed by single cell RNA-sequencing data to connect molecular regulation to the tumor microenvironment in individual patients. We leveraged these relationships to design a rapid, non-invasive test, HER2Scope, that captures the fraction of each TNBC tumor likely to express significant levels of HER2 (a &#8220;HER2 score&#8221;). We then characterized the HER2 score in a cohort of TNBC patients from our Virtual Tumor Bank, leading us to identify 3 distinct cohorts: HER2-negative, -low, and -moderate tumors.<br \/>Results: Using our platform, we identified that HER2 expression is associated with less proliferation and lower nutrient use. Interestingly, we found that there was significant overlap in HER2 expression between HER2+ and TNBC tumors. HER2Scope-identified HER2-low and- moderate tumors were associated with a lower likelihood of pCR in response to chemotherapy compared to HER2-zero tumors (25.3% in HER2-moderate vs. 40% in HER2-zero), suggesting a more aggressive and less drug-responsive phenotype in HER2-low and -moderate tumors. We then tested the expected rate of HER2-low and -moderate tumors within TNBC tumors using our Virtual Tumor Bank (n=264) and found a HER2-low and -moderate response rate of 56% (95% CI = 49-62%), which is strikingly similar to the TNBC response rate to trastuzumab deruxtecan (TDXd) reported in the DAISY trial (42%). HER2Scope may therefore be an effective test to identify TNBC patients for HER2 ADC therapies.<br \/>Conclusion: We present a novel test to identify HER2-nonzero TNBC patients rapidly and non-invasively. HER2Scope relies on radiological imaging, and therefore does not depend on an inherently variable score derived from biopsy-driven pathologic staining. Additionally, by evaluating the entire tumor, it addresses the challenge of HER2 intra-tumoral heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Systems biology,HER2,Breast cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel Cook<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Snehal Patel<sup><\/sup>, John Whitman<sup><\/sup>, Nicole Hobbs<sup><\/sup>, Dorys  A.

Through clinical association study (including tumor stage, lymph node invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis), a gene signature containing 6 biomarkers was established which can be validated by two independent cohorts. Gene knock down effects on cancer cell survival further revealed PPT2 and PRPF19 as potential targets for target-based therapy.

Our previous study revealed a novel functionality of ESRP1 in metabolic dysregulation by affecting lipid metabolism and oxidoreductase processes. To further understand how metabolic programming is affected by ESRP1 expression and identify novel therapeutic targets, we developed systems biology models to explore ER+ breast cancer metabolism. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a computational approach to predict steady-state fluxes through metabolic reactions by posing cellular &#8220;objectives&#8221; such as maximization of biomass, ATP, or minimization of reactive oxygen species that reflect selective pressures posed by the tumor microenvironment or therapeutic insults. Our custom FBA pipeline leverages transcriptomic data, mutation information, and thermodynamic constraints to generate personalized genome-scale metabolic models. In this study, 100 ESRP1-high and 100 ESRP1-low tumors from the TCGA Breast Cancer Invasive Carcinoma dataset were simulated and compared; in a secondary analysis, we simulated metabolic rerouting of tamoxifen-resistant LCC2 cells and fulvestrant-resistant LCC9 cells upon ESRP1 knockdown. The intersection of statistically significant (p &#60; 0.05) reactions that were altered in both the TCGA and cell line contexts suggested that changes in eicosanoid metabolism and androgen and estrogen synthesis pathways are highly involved in ESRP1's role in breast cancer prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapies. Eicosanoid-utilizing enzymes are consistently altered between the ESRP1-low and high conditions; Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS), prostaglandin I2 synthase (PTDIS), and thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1) are druggable. Furthermore, reactions associated with cytosolic and lysosomal 4-hydroxy-17beta-estradiol production, catalyzed by the enzymes myeloperoxidase, lactoperoxidase, and peroxiredoxin 6, also emerged as consistently altered across the groups. The findings from this methodology have suggested novel metabolic targets to overcome tamoxifen\/endocrine therapy resistance in ER+ breast cancer. Experimental validation of these targets is currently underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Systems biology,Cancer metabolism,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zachary  B.

Integrative analysis between the data facets has enabled new insights into pediatric cancer biology as demonstrated in the following two examples. First is the discovery of two potential subtypes of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. These were initially identified via expression analysis which revealed two distinct groups that were confirmed by examination of associated histology slide data which revealed delineation by brain invasion. Second is an analysis that links germline and somatic alterations in genes involved in DNA Damage Response with mutational signatures associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). This provided new insights on the applicability of therapies targeting HRD in the pediatric cancer population. These examples demonstrate the potential value of PeCan in advancing clinical diagnosis classifications of pediatric cancer and exploration of new therapeutic opportunities.

Given the variable patient outcomes, many studies have been conducted to identify prognostic biomarkers associated with ICI response. However, due to intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and the complexity of the immune system, those biomarkers have diverse efficacy for predicting outcomes in clinical trials. Here we propose a deep learning framework with unsupervised self-learning autoencoders that identifies predictive features from patient transcriptomics data. This approach allows us to determine the contribution of each gene to the response classifier and identifies potential gene signatures for predicting immunotherapy response by using the learned weights of trained autoencoders. We applied our framework to 20+ ICI clinical cohorts across different cancer types and compared the prediction performance of our method with other well-known immune response markers evaluated using a suite of machine learning algorithms (random forest, logistic regression, and XGboosting) with cross-validation. We found that in some cohorts, the learned features from autoencoders improve the predictive power of ICI response when evaluated with the area under the operating characteristic curve.

Specifically, multiple cancer types have been shown to exhibit heterogeneity in the transcriptional states of malignant cells even within the same tumor. Some of these specific transcriptional states of malignant cells have been linked to cancer relapse and resistance to treatment. However, today there is no universal and easy-to-use computational method to extract information about shared transcriptional states from single-cell RNA sequencing measurements (scRNA-seq).<br \/>To reliably identify shared transcriptional states of cancer cells, we propose a novel computational tool, CanSig. CanSig automatically preprocesses, integrates, and analyzes cancer scRNA-seq data from multiple patients to provide novel signatures of shared transcriptional states; it also associates these states to known and potentially targetable biological pathways. CanSig jointly analyzes cells from multiple cancer patients while correcting for batch effects and differences in gene expressions caused by genetic heterogeneity. For this, CanSig automatically infers copy number variations in malignant cells and trains a deep learning architecture based on conditional variational autoencoders integrating scRNA-seq measurements.<br \/>In our benchmarks, CanSig shows state-of-the-art performance in data integration and reliably re-discovers known transcriptional signatures on four previously published cancer scRNA-seq datasets. For instance, CanSig re-discovers four main cellular states of glioblastoma cells previously reported by Neftel et al., <i>Cell<\/i>, 2019.<br \/>We further illustrate CanSig&#8217;s investigative potential by uncovering signatures of novel transcriptional states in several cancer types; some of the novel signatures are linked to such cancer hallmarks as cell migration and proliferation and are enriched in more advanced tumors. We also uncover signatures associated with specific genomic aberrations such as gene copy number gains.<br \/>In conclusion, CanSig detects shared transcriptional states in tumors using as input scRNA-seq data for cells with different genetic backgrounds and possibly exhibiting strong batch effects. It can significantly facilitate the analysis of scRNA-seq cancer data and efficiently identify transcriptional signatures linked to known biological pathways.

We sought to identify patients on a timely basis by matching trial criteria to data present in both the Pathology and clinical information systems. In a separate abstract submitted to the AACR meeting, we described the enrollment outcomes of our effort for two clinical trials. In this companion abstract, we describe the query methods that we employed.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Method #1 involved querying structured data fields in the EMR, using dashboards or SQL queries of relational databases. Method #2 utilized natural language processing (NLP) queries of narrative text in pathology reports. We assessed the useability of each query approach, on a near-real-time basis, against eligibility criteria for open clinical trials at our institution.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We examined the first 25 open clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors listed publicly on our institutional website. For each trial, eligibility and query criteria were compiled by two reviewers (DC,YZ); discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer (NY). We found that of the 33 trials examined: 26 trials (79%) could be successfully analyzed by NLP in the pathology report. 2 trials (6%) required SQL query of discrete data fields in clinical databases. 2 trials (6%) required both methods to be used together. 3 trials (9%) required data elements outside the scope of either method. The data fields provided by NLP were: tumor morphology; tumor stage; specimen margin; and tumor receptor status. The data fields provided by SQL were: ICD 10 codes, CPT codes, Chemotherapy, and quantitative lab results. The data fields not accessible by either approach were: tumor resectability and risk calculation.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: There is no single method that is best for all trials, and availability of a broad set of tools is needed to craft a fitting query for each trial. However, 26 of 33 trials (79%) required NLP to parse eligibility criteria from narrative pathology reports. Cancer clinical trials enrollment may be substantially enhanced by NLP extraction of structured data from pathology reports as part of a near-real-time workflow for identifying eligible Human Subjects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nalan Yurtsever<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yonah Ziemba<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel  A.

High throughput technologies such as RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics have been widely used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG), on a transcript and on a peptide basis, respectively. However, both transcription and translation of genes provide information about gene expression. Thus, leveraging both RNA and protein expression data could potentially produce more accurate results. Various statistical tools have been developed to tackle the differential expression problem for a single platform, such as edgeR, DESeq2, etc. However, a tool that integrates both transcriptome and proteomics data for differential expression analysis has not yet been developed. Meta-analysis can potentially increase statistical power and generate a more consensus conclusion by combining multiple datasets. Here we present DE-Meta, a new tool developed using R, which performs combined meta-analysis of RNA-seq and MS-based proteomics on matched tumor specimens. To characterize the performance of our method using real world data, we utilized a published lung cancer dataset and set a truth standard of DEG between known two expression subtypes: terminal respiratory unit (TRU) and proximal proliferative (PP). Briefly, we restricted to 7,458 common genes detected by RNA-seq and MS-based proteomics. We then, randomly selected tumors as the truth sample set, n=20 TRU and n=20 PP tumors. With this truth sample set, DEGs were calculated separately by RNA or by protein, using DESeq2 and regression models. The union of these DEGs defined the truth DEG set. Using independent tumors (n=10 TRU and n=10 PP), we applied DE-meta to detect DEGs by RNA, by protein or joint RNA and protein data. Through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, we show that the DE-meta joint model performed better than the single platform models (joint AUC=0.651, RNA AUC=0.610, protein AUC=0.623). Focusing genes relevant to tumor biology, we found that the DE-meta joint model called an 169 cancer-relevant DEGs, such as <i>MSH2, CD4, WDR3, PIK3R1,<\/i> and<i> RPS6KA3<\/i>. which were not detected by the RNA or protein models, at the same false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure). In summary, our new DE-meta tool, by joint analysis of RNA-seq and MS-based proteomics datasets, yields more accurate and biologically-relevant results.<br \/>The views expressed in this abstract are solely of the authors and do not reflect the official policy of the Departments of Army\/Navy\/Air Force, Department of Defense, USUHS, HJF, or U.S. Government.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA-seq,Differential gene expression,Proteomic analysis,Meta Analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xijun Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Clifton L.

Progression of CTL to exhausted T lymphocytes (ETL) that overexpress inhibitory receptors can substantially decrease effector cytokines production and diminish cytolytic activity in tumor microenvironment (TME). However, while the activity levels of CTL and ETL are considered important determinants of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) response, it has been repeatedly observed that their predictive power is quite limited. Studying this conundrum on a large scale across the TCGA cohort, we find that ETL and CTL activity (estimated based on conventional gene signatures in the bulk tumor expression) is strongly positively correlated in most cancer types. We thus hypothesized that their limited predictive power may arise due to this high expression concordance, such that their opposing associations with response effectively cancel each other.<br \/>Methods and Results: Aiming to find conditions where the association between these CD8+ T cell states and ICIs response is enhanced, we analyzed TCGA melanoma bulk gene expression via an interaction linear regression model to identify a set of genes whose expression diminishes the CTL and ETL correlation as much as possible. We further tested this decoupling signature (DS) in several independent melanoma bulk expression ICIs cohorts, showing that in high-DS patients, the correlation between ETL and CTL activities is indeed markedly lower than in the low-DS patient groups. Second, this successful decoupling now increases the power of CTL activity in predicting ICIs response in high DS patients, making it superior to other state-of-art ICIs prediction transcriptomic signatures.<br \/>Significance: These results demonstrate the utility of a new decoupling score for boosting the power of CTL activity in predicting ICIs response in melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,T cell,Melanoma\/skin cancers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Binbin Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kun Wang<sup><\/sup>, Peng Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Eytan Ruppin<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>NIH-NCI, Bethesda, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4b38da56-c29a-4737-9239-eaced555c5dc","ControlNumber":"1887","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

While the use of multiple drugs is to improve the overall therapeutic efficacy, it can also lead to unintended adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from drug-drug interactions (DDIs). More than 30% of ADRs have been reported to be caused by DDIs. Because of the importance of DDIs and ADRs, many computational models have been developed to predict DDIs and\/or ADRs. However, these computational models mostly make predictions on the basis of molecular features of drugs without considering clinical factors, which consequently does not allow predictions in a person-specific manner. To address this problem, we present a machine learning model that predicts the signals of ADRs potentially caused by DDIs on the basis of medical data. Medical data used for model development come from MIMIC-IV, and include age, ethnicity, gender, patients&#8217; disease information (i.e., ICD-10) and information on drugs administered (e.g., molecular structure and dose). The medical data were subjected to extensive preprocessing based on a domain knowledge, and multiple machine learning methods were examined to predict the ADR signals using the preprocessed dataset. ADR signals are captured by classifying whether each of the selected laboratory measurements (e.g., hematocrit, creatinine, and hemoglobin) is normal. The best-performing model showed the average AUROC of more than 0.8. The machine learning model developed in this study can be useful for examining potential harms when considering multiple drugs, including anticancer drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Junhyeok Jeon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Eujin Hong<sup><\/sup>, Hyun Uk Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dd99190c-5c25-41e8-bd6d-ee80ae1023fd","ControlNumber":"5648","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Increased ploidy is thought to benefit cancer cells by conferring robustness against deleterious consequences of genomic instability. However, whether there are any potential costs associated with increased ploidy has not been sufficiently investigated. One hypothesis holds that high ploidy cells may exhibit increased sensitivity to limitations in resources, due to the extra energy required for the replication of a larger genome. To address this hypothesis, we developed an integrated <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in silico<\/i> system to investigate the response to glucose restriction in diploid and tetraploid cells.<br \/>Near diploid (2N) SUM159 breast cancer cells were fused to generate an isogenic tetraploid (4N) cell line. 2N or 4N cells were plated with varying initial concentrations of glucose. Cells grew for five days and media was not refreshed, so cells depleted the glucose in the media until they eventually died. Throughout the experiments, glucose concentration was measured at 24 hour intervals, and images were taken at 8 hour intervals allowing quantification of the number of alive or dead cells over time. These <i>in vitro<\/i> data were then used as inputs to the <i>in silico<\/i> portion of our system, which consists of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model of cancer cell growth. ODE model parameters were estimated using the measured outputs from the <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments. Parameters estimated from the ODE model gave insight into differences between the 2N and 4N cell lines.<br \/>We found that 4N cells outcompeted 2N cells at high glucose concentrations, due to their ability to divide more rapidly when glucose was abundant. However, 2N cells were able to outcompete 4N cells at lower glucose concentrations. The advantage of 2N cells at low glucose was not due to an increased proliferative capacity. Instead, 2N cells were more resistant to cell death when glucose was limited. Our next steps will be to expand our system to assess ploidy specific sensitivity to other resources, such as phosphate or oxygen. The ODE model we have developed allows us to identify resource conditions that will select for tumor cells based on ploidy. In future this knowledge can be used to suggest therapeutics that can modulate resource availability within tumors, in order to steer tumor evolution towards less aggressive phenotypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,polyploidy,ordinary differential equations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Richard  J.

However, therapeutic response cannot be predicted or explained by genetic abnormalities alone. The integration of multiple omics, consisting of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic measurements, offers a holistic view to resolve the underlying pathophysiology of AML that influences response to therapy. In this work, we pair multi-omic characterization together with <i>ex vivo<\/i> drug sensitivity assays accrued with 145 small molecule inhibitors for 210 AML patient samples (Bottomly et al., Cancer Cell 2022). We showcase how the integration of these data can guide drug sensitivity exploration and prediction. We first expanded the dataset by generating matching comprehensive proteomics and phosphoproteomics data for the Beat AML samples and integrated these data using non-negative matrix factorization. This analysis identified four distinct proteogenomic subtypes of AML, each representing distinct clinical and biological features including differences in survival and biological pathway activation. We then sought distinct patterns of drug sensitivity across the subtypes of the patient cohort and found one pair of drugs, venetoclax and panobinostat, to be sensitive in complementary sets of patients, suggesting that they could be more effective in combination. Lastly, we further enhanced the proteogenomic subtypes by a building machine learning based model of distinct drug response that we then evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i>. Our results show that the four proteogenomic subtypes are independent yet complementary to existing mutational profiles, and can be used to improve drug treatment stratification. We tested the combination of panobinostat and venetoclax in patient samples and show that they are more effective in combination than as single agents. We then tested drug-specific machine learning models to predict drug response on AML cell lines that were in varying stages of resistance to the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib. The models predicted a change across the proteogenomic landscape as quizartinib resistance evolves, resulting in a shift in drug sensitivities that we experimentally validated. This work represents a seminal effort in the integration of proteogenomic and <i>ex vivo<\/i> drug sensitivity datasets. In summary, we show how multi-omic characterization of AML maps a proteogenomic landscape that enables improved exploration of patient drug response and ultimately patient treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Systems biology,Combination therapy,Precision medicine,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  C.

DNA replication initiates from ~50,000 sites in each cell cycle. Genome-wide profiles of replication origins can be generated using various sequencing-based methods following different molecular capture strategies. No previous study has integrated the results from these different experiments to characterize the most reproducible origins or their association with the replication initiation factor, Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), known to be important for origin-specification. We conducted an integrative analysis of 98 human origin profiling datasets from four different techniques including NS-seq, Repli-seq, Rerep-seq and Bubble-seq, and identified a total of 1,460,610 origins in the human genome. Of these, only 0.12% (1,746) were high-confidence &#8220;shared origins&#8221; that were detected by all four techniques. Compared with all origins, the shared origins have higher GC content and overlap more with gene promoters, CTCF binding sites, transcription factor (TF) binding hotspots, G-quadruplex sites and activating histone marks. Only ~20% of the shared origins (343) overlap with known ORC binding sites. Despite the low overlap between shared origins and ORC binding sites, permutation tests suggest that the overlap between shared origins, ORC binding sites, R-loops and promoters are all significantly higher than random expectation. The variability in origin identification by different techniques and by same techniques in different groups suggests that replication origins are specified by highly variable stochastic events influenced by epigenetic variability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA replication,Genome,Human,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mengxue Tian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zhenjia Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Chongzhi Zang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhangli Su<sup>2<\/sup>, Etsuko Shibata<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoshiyuki Shibata<sup>2<\/sup>, Anindya Dutta<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UVA Health Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Genetics, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8f9030d7-8daf-412e-905a-a42e67025352","ControlNumber":"7968","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

The genomic characteristics and underlying molecular mechanisms driving tumorigenesis associated with HCC in Hispanic patients remain unknown. Here, we used 31 paired tumor and adjacent non-tumor liver samples from Hispanic patients in South Texas to perform integrated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses. Similar to HCC in other ethnic groups, <i>CTNNB1<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> were found to have the most frequent somatic mutations in the Hispanic HCC. On the other hand, <i>AXIN2<\/i> and to a lesser degree <i>MTOR<\/i> appear more frequently mutated in the Hispanics compared to the various ethnic groups included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study. Somatic mutations in the Hispanic HCC showed signatures of tobacco chewing and aflatoxin exposure, which are different from the signatures found frequently in the liver cancer patients in the TCGA study. The WNT, TP53, &#38; cell cycle were the most frequently altered oncogenic pathways in our cohort. Unsupervised clustering of patients, based on the enrichment scores from single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) using our tumor and nontumor paired RNA-Seq and proteomic data, revealed two clusters with striking differences in various signaling pathways and cellular functions. A similar clustering pattern with a significant difference in overall survival was seen in the patients from the TCGA study. Irrespective of ethnicity, immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and liver function-related pathways were significantly different between patients in these clusters. Integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses identified significant negative enrichments in gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, and glutamate metabolism in Hispanic HCC. These results suggest the existence of molecular mechanisms either unique in Hispanics or similar to non-Hispanic HCC, especially from the TCGA study. Our findings might provide insights to developing predictive biomarkers for the early diagnosis and novel therapeutics for the management of HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Hispanic,Multiomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Debodipta Das<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaojing Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Yu-Chiao Chiu<sup>2<\/sup>, Hakim Bouamar<sup>1<\/sup>, Yidong Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Siyuan Zheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Francisco  G.

Tumor cells, as the center of the tumor microenvironment, employ sophisticated signaling networks to alter the cell fate decisions between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. A complex network of interactions is the source of this intercellular communication, resulting in tumor growth and progression, drug resistance, and ineffective treatment response. Recent experimental developments in colorectal cancer (CRC) have shown that understanding various underlying mechanisms of tumor growth and progression requires an in-depth understanding of the complex interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment. Here, we analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data in CRC and construct gene regulatory networks to define interactions and identify cell states within the TME. The gene regulatory networks are incorporated as a multi-cellular ecosystem representing an experiment-based computational model of phenotypic crosstalk within the TME of CRC. The model simulates and predicts the multi-cellular responses to colorectal cancer to probe and identify mechanisms of cell state evolution and decisions resulting from chemo-agents, used to target TME components. This research will further our understanding of the multi-cellular crosstalk underlying the mechanisms within the TME and facilitate the development and optimization of cancer therapies that inhibit tumor growth in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Computational Modeling,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Geena Ildefonso<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Stacey Finley<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>USC - University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a62e103b-0f64-4953-ad6d-0a9ea63ff009","ControlNumber":"5327","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

We aim to construct an analytic deep learning (DL) pipeline toward the discovery of pathways and multi-omics signatures with high confidence from histopathological whole slide images (WSIs) for lung cancer.<br \/>Methods: A total of 458 and 442 diagnostic WSIs from TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC cohorts, respectively, were preprocessed via steps including patch generation, color normalization, blurry removal, K-means clustering, and pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based feature extraction. The attention-based model was trained on the CNN-extracted features that provided the importance score for each cluster which was utilized for the final prediction of (1) pathway activities, (2) gene expression, and (3) protein expression. The model was first used to predict 1387 pathway activity scores using PARADIGM as the ground truth. The thresholds for Spearman&#8217;s correlation R &#62;= 0.5 and R &#62;= 0.45at p-value &#60;0.05 were set for LUAD and LUSC, respectively, for selecting the well-predicted pathways. Later, multiple models were trained to predict the expression value of the genes and proteins involved in these well-predicted pathways. Moreover, leveraging the attention mechanism, heat maps were generated to visualize the high and low-activated areas on the WSIs thus providing a better interpretation of the predictions.<br \/>Results: The models demonstrated good performance in predicting pathway scores, genes, and proteins&#8217; expression using the hold-out testing sets. For LUAD, the model successfully predicted important pathways such as interleukin-, uPAR-, and Sema4D-related and PIP3-activated AKT signaling pathways, which have been proven to be associated with LUAD. At the gene- and protein expression level, the model predicted <i>IRF4<\/i>, <i>EREG<\/i>, <i>CCNA2<\/i>, <i>IL2RB<\/i>, <i>GRB2<\/i>, <i>CCNB1<\/i>, <i>STAT5A<\/i> genes, and <i>AKT<\/i> protein, respectively, with high and significant correlation. Similarly, for LUSC, the model predicted highly correlated pathways such as the regulation of telomerase and inflammasomes as well as important genes including <i>AIM2<\/i>, <i>SIN3A<\/i>, <i>EGFR<\/i>, and <i>ATM <\/i>with significant correlation. Furthermore, the highly activated hot spots from the heat map could assist in decoding the model prediction for crucial tissue locations, eventually contributing to a better interpretation of the final output.<br \/>Conclusion: The proposed attention-based DL pipeline not only provides high-resolution results at the pathways, and multi-omics levels, but offers a cost-effective approach that enables high throughput screening for &#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;potential targets rapidly and robustly via a single WSI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Signaling pathways,Histopathology images,Multiomics expression,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Han-Ru Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nam Nhut Phan<sup>2<\/sup>, Tzu-Pin Lu<sup>3<\/sup>, Liang-Chuan Lai<sup>4<\/sup>, Mong-Hsun Tsai<sup>5<\/sup>, Amrita Chattopadhyay<sup>6<\/sup>, Eric Y.
