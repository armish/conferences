[{"Abstract":"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and its incidence is increasing globally. Treatment consists of surgical resection followed by adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy (neoTx) has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with locally advanced and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. NeoTX has been shown to reverse the immunosuppression exerted by malignant cells and selectively deplete regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the peritumoral niche. In addition, neoTx mediates a significant decrease in the severity of neural invasion and stroma activation. However, the effect of neoTx on the topographical interactions between the different populations of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, the degree of intratumoral immune infiltration and distance to tumor cells as well as their spatial interactions with other key features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remained unknown. In this study, we employed a multiplex immunofluorescence approach on the COMET&#8482; platform from Lunaphore. COMET&#8482; performs full-automated sequential immunofluorescence (seqIF&#8482;) assays, which consist of cycles of staining, imaging, and elution. We developed a customized 12-plex panel on COMET&#8482; to characterize the TME of paraffin-embedded sections of pancreatic cancer samples. COMET&#8482; outputs are OME.TIFF files that were analyzed and quantified with QuPath and CellProfiler for cell segmentation and cell phenotyping respectively. The optimized panel was used to analyze the immune architecture of neoadjuvant-treated pancreatic cancer patients compared to primary resected ones who underwent surgical resection with curative intention. We detected the following immune phenotypes: cytotoxic T cells (CD8+, CD3+), helper T cells (CD4+, CD3+), B cells (CD20+, CD3-), regulatory T cells (FoxP3+, CD4+), macrophages (CD68+), neutrophils (CD163+, CD11b+), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD163, CD11b+, CD66b+). We also quantified the presence of both immune checkpoints (PD1+) cells and their apoptotic rate (Caspase-3), and how those correlate with the immunotopography after neoadjuvant therapy.<b> <\/b>Our optimized 12-plex panel was successfully transferred to an initial cohort of 10 patients. Our preliminary analysis shows interesting results on the effect of neoTx treatment on the immune microenvironment, such as decreased immune cell density, induction of apoptosis in lymphoid cells, and increased PD1 expression in T-killer cells compared to samples from primary resected patients. Our approach demonstrates the importance of a deep topographic characterization to understand the TME composition of pancreatic cancers, with or without neoTx treatment. Our preliminary findings highlight new differential cell identities in neoTx-treated patients, confirming their suitability for application in future clinical immunotherapy trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Neoadjuvant,Multiplex,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Carmen Mota Reyes<sup>1<\/sup>, Maximilian Kiessler<sup>1<\/sup>, Pino Bordignon<sup>2<\/sup>, Samuel Aubert<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Pamela Pulimeno<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Helmut Friess<sup>1<\/sup>, Rouzanna Istvanffy<sup>1<\/sup>, Ihsan  Ekin Demir<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Lunaphore Technologies, Tolochenaz, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1ea228b1-b065-42e4-844a-74367fccfaa5","ControlNumber":"4295","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

Thus, simultaneous inhibition of Axl, Mer and CSF1R may be an effective strategy for TME modification. Q702 is a novel Axl\/Mer\/CSF1R kinase inhibitor that affects the immune components (modulating TAM and MDSC populations, inducing CD8+ T cell infiltration and increasing IFN-&#611; in CD8+ T cell) as well as changes in malignant cells such as increasing MHC I on the tumor cells of syngeneic mouse models. These nonclinical results suggest that Q702 monotherapy or Q702 combination with conventional therapies may have considerable potential as a novel treatment strategy for patients with advanced solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This is a Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-Escalation, Safety, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacokinetic Study of Q702 with a Cohort Expansion at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors (NCT04648254). Q702 was administered orally for seven days every other week. Peripheral blood samples were obtained on days 1,8,15, and 21. Axl, Mer and CSF1R target engagement is assessed by the quantifications of soluble Axl, Mer and M-CSF in plasma by Luminex xMAP<sup>&#174;<\/sup> technology or ELISA.

Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated dose proportional increase in C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC<sub>last<\/sub> of Q702 and its two active metabolites which have activity against Axl and\/or CSF1R. Axl and CSF1R target engagement by Q702 treatment is observed in a dose dependent manner.

More recently we have identified antitumor effector TDLN B cells which demonstrated significant tumor reactivity <i>in vitro<\/i> and therapeutic efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i> upon adoptive transfer which can be enhanced by anti-PD-L1 administration. It is unknown whether tumor cells, particularly cancer stem cells (CSCs) could suppress the antitumor effector B cells. We found that depletion of B cells with anti-CD20 mAb prior to anti-PD-L1 administration resulted in more aggressive tumor growth, and the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 was significantly reduced in both 4T1 and CT26 murine tumor-bearing hosts, suggesting the involvement of host B cells in the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-L1. In addition, administration of anti-PD-L1 partially recovered the humoral immune response, confirming the PD-L1\/PD-1 pathway involvement in B cell suppression. We detected elevated expression of PD-1 on activated B cells, and higher PD-L1 expression on ALDH<sup>high <\/sup>CSCs than on ALDH<sup>low<\/sup> non-CSCs. Co-culturing ALDH<sup>high<\/sup> CSCs with purified B cells significantly reduced IgG secretion, and such CSC-mediated B cell suppression was rescued by adding anti-PD-L1 mAb in a dose-dependent manner to the CSC-B cell co-culture. These experiments thus indicate that CSCs suppress the IgG production by B cells<i> via<\/i> the PD-L1\/PD-1 axis. Tumor cells were recently recognized to suppress T cell function <i>via<\/i> secretion of exosomes that express PD-L1. To investigate if exosomal PD-L1 contributes to B cell immunosuppression, we generated Rab27a<sup>ko<\/sup> D5 cells to delete exosomes as well as PD-L1<sup>ko<\/sup> D5 cells by CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing. D5-derived exosomes suppressed B cell proliferation and IgG production <i>in vitro<\/i>, and administration of these exosomes promoted tumor growth and reduced animal survival, revealing the role of tumor-derived exosomes in B cell immunosuppression. Tumor-derived exosomes expressed PD-L1, but PD-L1 was absent in the exosomes isolated from the PD-L1<sup>ko<\/sup> tumor cells as evident by western blot and flow cytometry. Deletion of Rab27a or PD-L1 did not affect the proliferation of the tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. However, Rab27a<sup>ko<\/sup> or PD-L1<sup>ko<\/sup> resulted in significantly enhanced host anti-tumor immunity evident by reduced 4T1 tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> compared with the WT tumor. Importantly, anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly reduced Rab27a<sup>ko<\/sup> or PD-L1<sup>ko<\/sup> 4T1 tumor growth and prolonged animal survival <i>vs.<\/i> the WT tumor control. We conclude that PD-L1-expresing CSCs and PD-L1-expresing exosomes suppress antitumor effector B cells <i>via <\/i>the PD-L1\/PD-1 axis. To characterize the suppression of CSC-derived exosomes on host B cells as well as T cells, isolation of Rab27a<sup>ko<\/sup> ALDH<sup>high<\/sup> CSCs warranties further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Exosomes,PD-L1,B cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ying Xin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jiayu Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, You Qin<sup>2<\/sup>, Kexing Lyu<sup>2<\/sup>, Sifei Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Ming Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, Max Wicha<sup>3<\/sup>, Alfred  E.

RNAseq was performed on FFPE lymphoma samples (N=17). Patients were divided into 3 groups: non-responders, relapsed within 1 year from CAR T infusion, and long-term responders. A total of 405,775 cells passed quality check, capturing 73 cellular populations.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Long-term responders presented a distinct T cell landscape with increased CD8 T cells and CD8\/CD4 ratios prior to CAR T therapy, compared to the other groups, with similar trends observed across time points. They also presented an increased abundance of 3 distinct CD8 T cell populations: (a) cells expressing cytotoxic and NK cell markers, (b) CD8 T effector memory cells characterized by CXCR4, TGFB1, and BCL3, and (c) proinflammatory CD8 T cells. In contrast, patients with early relapse showed increased levels of regulatory T cells pre-\/post-CAR T infusion and lower abundance of CD4 cytotoxic T cells.Comparisons of the TCR repertoire pre-\/post-CAR T demonstrated a greater clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cell populations in the long-term responders, with high similarity of expanded clones post CAR T. Shared PB T cell clones and tumor antigen sequences derived from the RNAseq samples suggest an antigen-specific response driven by common epitopes. In contrast to the lack of expansion of T reg clones in responders, relapsed patients demonstrated high T reg-clonal expansion 6 months post treatment.Monocyte and NK cells were less prevalent in responders before treatment, driven by differences in phagocytic monocyte and inhibitory NK cell abundance. Modeling the interaction between monocyte and effector cell populations based on ligand receptor expression was suggestive of negative immunoregulatory impact on the T cell populations.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The application of single-cell immunoprofiling on longitudinal samples from ZUMA-1 patients demonstrated distinct cellular and clonal profiles among long-term responders.

Inhibition of amino acid uptake or tRNA synthase which mediates amino acid incorporation into protein, mimics starvation. The cancer cell responds to starvation by upregulating proteases to mobilize fatty acids and cellular surface molecules to scavenge exogenous molecules. EPRS (Glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the aminoacylation of glutamic acid and proline to cognate tRNAs. Apart from that, the overexpression of EPRS1 gene is related to tumor angiogenesis, but the mechanism is not clear. Research showed that inhibition of EPRS is effective for the inhibition of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and colon cancer. Camptothecin (CPT) is a kind of chemotherapy drug that causes DNA damage by binding topoisomerase enzyme and DNA complex and arrest cells cycle in the S and G2 phases resulting in apoptosis. The knockdown (KD) of EPRS in TNBCs and the use of CPT for the treatment of colon cancer are both likely to have an impact on the accumulation of self epitopes, PTMs, and the creation of neoepitopes within tumors as a result. In this study, we examined the effects of EPRS and CPT treatment on the stimulation of MHC 1 in TNBC and colon cancer cells, as well as the diversity of peptide repertoires in EPRS KD breast cancer cells and CPT treated colon cancer cells. We conducted flow cytometer to detect the HLA specific antibodies on CPT treated RKO and SW620 colon cancer as well as EPRS KD MDA MB 231 triple negative breast cancer cells in our laboratory. In addition, we also performed immunopeptidomes on these cell lines to gain a deeper understanding of the biochemistry and immune pathway. Furthermore, we conducted cell cycle assays in both CRISPR and lentiviral mediated EPRS KD MDA MB 231 cells after CPT treatment. The human MHC class 1 expression were higher in both CPT treated RKO and SW620 colon cancer and EPRS KD MDA MB 231 TNBC cells as compared to the control in both our laboratory and Cayman Immunopeptidome analysis tests. In addition, the cell cycle result showed increment in S phase and reduction in G1 phase in some of the CPT treated EPRS KD ShRNA samples as compared to the control. These results showed that CPT as well as EPRS may play some role in the MHC Class 1 presentation in cancer cells. There were no significant changes observed in the total peptide content of TNBC cells after EPRS knockdown and colon cancer cells after CPT treatment. However, the knockdown of EPRS gene and the CPT treatment resulted in a novel peptide repertoire presented by the cells, which could have relevant to antigen presentation. Further studies are needed for detailed understanding of the biochemistry and immune pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,CPT,EPRS,Immunopeptidome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Reshma Gurung<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alehegne Yirsaw<sup>2<\/sup>, Mohammad Hassan<sup>3<\/sup>, Temesgen Samuel<sup>3<\/sup>, Clayton Yates<sup>4<\/sup>, Deepa Bedi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Integrative Biosciences, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biomedical Sciences, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathobiology, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pathology, John Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e8e0c7fe-fa72-4e11-9c83-91f04c6ca682","ControlNumber":"7897","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

These immune responses can drive efficacy in specific patient populations and\/or in combination with other oncology drugs. BOLD-100, currently in a multinational Phase 2 trial, is a first-in-class metallotherapeutic that (1) alters the unfolded protein response (UPR) through selective GRP78 inhibition, and (2) induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these pathways result in cell death in both sensitive and resistant cancers, giving BOLD-100 the potential to significantly improve outcomes in a wide range of both solid and liquid tumors in combination with other anticancer therapies. BOLD-100 can also alter immune responses, including through induction of immunogenic cell death, but these responses have not been investigated in a clinical population. A recently completed Phase 1b trial investigating BOLD-100 in combination with FOLFOX demonstrated a 3X improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in 3rd line or later metastatic colorectal cancer patients compared to existing therapies, with a favorable safety profile. In this Phase 1b study, BOLD-100 was administered via IV infusion for 60-90 minutes immediately prior to FOLFOX on a 2-week cycle. To investigate the pharmacodynamics of immune markers, plasma samples were collected at baseline and 1, 6, 24, and 48 hours after initiation of BOLD-100 plus FOLFOX treatment for each of the first 4 cycles, and then at baseline for all subsequent cycles. In 326 samples collected from 15 patients, 48 cytokines were measured via multiplex. Multiple cytokines showed short-term (1 to 48 hours) transient increases in plasma concentration levels, including IL-10, IL-27, G-CSF, MIP-1&#946;, IP-10, IL-2, IL-18 and TNF&#945;. IL-10, a cytokine previously investigated as an anticancer therapeutic, increased significantly by 1 hour (6.7X increase) and by 6 hours (84.5X increase) after treatment, before reverting to baseline levels by 48 hours. Despite large acute increases in specific cytokines, no changes to baseline levels over multiple treatment cycles were observed. Correlation analysis showed that baseline MCP-1 and MIP-1&#945; levels were negatively correlated with overall survival; and the maximum change in concentration over the first dosage cycle of RANTES, IL-17F, Eotaxin, TGF&#945; and MDC were positively correlated with overall survival. These results show that BOLD-100 in combination with FOLFOX can induce immune responses, and that these immune responses may predict clinical outcome. Analysis of additional patient samples from the Phase 2 trial is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Translation,Cytokines,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mark Bazett<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Brian Park<sup><\/sup>,  E.

We have shown that on-treatment specimens from patients responding to anti-PD-1 are characterized histologically by exuberant proliferative fibrosis, neovascularization, and robust inflammation including diverse immune cell types. Understanding how the stroma participates in the process of tumor regression may open therapeutic opportunities by redirecting stromal remodeling in treatment-refractory tumors.<br \/>Methods: To evaluate stromal changes in neoadjuvant treated MCC, 13 on-treatment FFPE tumor specimens from patients with resectable MCC who received anti-PD-1 for ~4 weeks before surgery (NCT02488759) were subjected to laser capture microdissection to collect stromal tissue and isolate RNA. We conducted multiplex qRT-PCR targeting 125 unique mRNAs representing TME-relevant immune cell subsets, immune checkpoint pathways, and immune-modulating transcription factors and cytokines, followed by whole transcriptome RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression was considered significant if the magnitude of the signed fold-change was &#8805;2 and the p-value was &#8804;0.1 (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted for RNAseq). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed with R Topper. Pathologic response was scored on H&#38;E staining as pathologic complete response (pCR, n=6), major pathologic response (MPR, &#8804;10% residual viable tumor [RVT]; n=4), or non-MPR\/pCR (&#62;10% RVT; n=3).<br \/>Results: Stratifying by response status (6 pCR vs 3 non-MPR\/pCR) demonstrated that pCR stroma in MCC is distinguished by upregulation of molecules associated with neovascularization (VEGFA, EGR2) and M1 and M2 macrophages (IL1A, ARG1) via qRT-PCR, and mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts, myocytes, adipocytes) and extracellular matrix formation via RNAseq. GSEA demonstrated a strong association of pCR with both myocyte and fibroblast differentiation and functional pathways, suggesting a role for myofibroblasts in tissue remodeling during anti-PD-1-mediated tumor regression. In contrast, the stroma of non-MPR\/pCR tumors showed evidence for ongoing IFNg-mediated inflammation, as evidenced by upregulation of IFNg, IL-27, STAT1, CXCL10 and LAG-3 via qRT-PCR; these findings were supported by RNAseq, which also showed upregulation of genes associated with inflammation (e.g., PLXNC1, TRPV2, LYZ, LAIR1, HLA-A, B2M, CD4). Similar results were obtained when MPRs were grouped with pCRs (n=10) vs non-MPR\/pCR (n=3).<br \/>Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that improved response to anti-PD-1 therapy is associated with a shift in the tumor stroma from an inflammatory to a proliferative myofibroblastic phenotype, recapitulating the stages of normal wound healing. This suggests a potential functional role for myofibroblasts in that critical transition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Biomarkers,Merkel cell carcinoma,Stroma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joel  C.

Particularly, TT with BRAFi or BRAFi\/MEKi leads to prompt but not durable responses in most patients due to the development of resistance within 1 year. Tumors refractory to TT derive little benefit from subsequent immunotherapy. Here we aim to elucidate how previous treatments with TT shape tumor-immune landscape and how it could be overcome therapeutically. Firstly, we analyzed the gene expression profile of a single-cell RNA-Seq dataset of 48 biopsies (16,291 cells) from melanoma patients before and during treatment with anti-PD1\/anti-CTLA4. Our single-cell data analysis showed that macrophages and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells of non-responders to immunotherapy upregulate a specific glycosylation-related signature unraveling a novel potential mechanism of resistance. Interestingly, we found a new subset of macrophages associated with resistance that arises during treatment. Macrophages of non-responders express high levels of galectin-1 (Gal-1), an immunosuppressive lectin implicated in tumor progression and immune escape, and display an M2-like phenotype regulated by the activation of specific transcription factors and signaling pathways including TGF-b, hypoxia, and VEGF. This observation was validated on bulk RNA-Seq datasets, where we observed that melanoma patients refractory to immunotherapy have a higher M2-macrophage infiltrate at baseline by MIXTURE (p-value&#60;0.05). To study cross-resistance, we first analyzed by MIXTURE the immune microenvironment of melanoma patients treated with BRAFi or BRAFi\/MEKi using 6 published transcriptomic datasets. We identified the prevalence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment significantly enriched in M2-macrophages in relapsed biopsies (p-value &#60; 0.05) accompanied by low levels of T cells activation markers and dysregulation of the TGF-b\/Gal-1 axis. Interestingly, we observed that the expression of Gal-1 is increased in human and mouse melanoma cell lines resistant to TT (p-value&#60;0.05). To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect and identify potential therapeutic targets, we developed an immunocompetent mouse model of resistance to BRAFi\/MEKi in BRAFmut melanoma which mimics the M2 macrophage-centered immune profile observed in melanoma patients and the low response rates to immunotherapy at progression in TT-refractory tumors. Our preliminary findings suggest that Gal-1-glycan interactions could promote an immune evasive microenvironment in BRAFi\/MEKi-resistant tumors, preventing subsequent response to immunotherapy. Hence, the Gal1-glycan axis arises as a potential actionable target for the development of combination therapies in non-responding melanoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Macrophages,Immune checkpoint blockade,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Florencia Veigas<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yamil Damian Mahmoud<sup><\/sup>, Joaquin  P.

There is a critical need to identify novel biomarkers that guide the use of ICI or strategies to improve outcomes for GC patients. We aim to gain a deeper understanding of the GC tumor microenvironment (TME) to refine the use of ICI using spatial transcriptomes from ICI-treated gastric tumors.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We collected 12 pre-ICI treatment gastric tumor samples from five responders and seven nonresponders and performed spatial profiling to investigate spatial heterogeneity, functions, and phenotypes of tumor and neighboring stromal and immune cells to identify features associated with ICI response. We used pan-cytokeratin (pan-CK) to mark epithelial cells, CD45 for immune cells, and smooth muscle actin (SMA) for fibroblasts. We generated gene expression profiles of each cell type within regions of interest (ROI) with a NanoString GeoMx Cancer Transcriptome Atlas panel, comprised of 1,800 genes. A total of 58 ROIs were analyzed from responders and 62 ROIs from nonresponders.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We measured the spatial heterogeneity of each cell type in ROIs within and across tumors. We found the tumor, immune, and fibroblasts from nonresponders are transcriptionally more heterogeneous, compared to those from responders. This might indicate a higher degree of intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity is linked to ICI resistance. We found that nonresponse was associated with higher expression of VEGFA and VEGFB in tumor cells and higher ACTA2 in fibroblasts, not in other cell types. These findings are intriguing when considering our other finding that increased endothelial cell and fibroblast proportions in the TME are associated with ICI nonresponse. We also found that the TME of nonresponders had fewer M1 and more M2 macrophages, and there were more T cells that overexpressed gene programs consistent with dysfunction and exhaustion. These findings indicate that ICI-resistant TMEs are densely surrounded by immune-suppressive cellular components which might reduce ICI efficacy and result in ICI resistance. Finally, we performed cell-cell interaction and identified ligand-receptor interactions that are stronger in nonresponders, including CXCL12-CXCR4, CD74-MIF, and LGALS9-LRP1 ligand-receptor interactions. The predicted ligand-receptor interactions are present in cell-type-specific manners, indicating the functional role of each cell type in facilitating ICI response.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: We investigated how tumor and neighboring stromal and immune cells interact within GC TME to mediate ICI response, which demonstrate that spatial analysis could be used to identify novel biomarkers that predict response to ICI, and new therapies to enhance ICI efficacy in GC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response,Tumor microenvironment,spatial transcriptomes ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sunho Park<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Changjing Hong<sup>1<\/sup>, Jae-Ho Cheong<sup>2<\/sup>, Sam C.

It is the second leading cause of death from skin cancer, after melanoma, despite accounting for less than 1% of malignant skin tumors. Due to the characteristic histopathological neuroendocrine features of the neoplasm, cases of MCC are often misdiagnosed as undifferentiated skin cancers or other tumors with small blue cell types. Clinical examination fails to establish the diagnosis in 99% of cases and pathological assessment by biopsy with immunohistochemistry is essential to confirm MCC diagnosis. Historically, cytotoxic chemotherapy combinations with platinum-based agents (Carboplatin or Cisplatin) plus Etoposide or Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin, and Vincristine (CAV) agents were the primary systemic treatment for advanced cases. Despite available evidence sensitivity of MCC to chemotherapy, responses are not durable, and the literature is not supportive of combination chemotherapy (NCCN guidelines). The introduction of immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) particularly PD-1\/PD-L1 blockers increased overall survival and achieved durable tumor regression in clinical trials leading to FDA approval in locally advanced and metastatic disease. Permbrluzimab and Avelumab are the only two FDA-approved ICIs as first-line standard-of-care treatments for MCC patients. What we are missing is data or trials examining the efficacy of other ICI such as Durvalumab, (anti-PD-L1) in MCC. We hereby report an unprecedented case of an 84-year-old female MCC patient with extensive axillary nodal involvement achieving complete remission after treatment with Durvalumab combined with Carboplatin and Etoposide.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Merkel cell carcinoma,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Immunotherapy,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Saad Sabbagh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Barbara Dominguez<sup>1<\/sup>, Houssein Abdul Sater<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cleveland Clinic, Weston, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Cleveland Clinic, PSL, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9cd63a24-4ffa-4229-8c7a-ac30289e8c11","ControlNumber":"3766","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

In this study, after excluding NSCLC patients harboring driven oncogenes as EGFR, ALK and ROS1 mutation, twenty NSCLC patents with higher Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (PD-L1 &#8807; 50%, immunohistochemical stained by SP263 or 22C3) were administered with Pembrolizumab alone as first-line immunotherapy.

Recent clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) combined with chemotherapy delivered only very modest benefit. Here, we identified that ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR), the primary activator of the replication stress response, is highly enriched in SCLC and inhibition of ATR induced DNA damage and apoptosis in multiple SCLC models.<br \/>Methods: In this study, we performed genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ATR in a panel of human and murine SCLC models. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of ATR inhibition either alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade either as a first-line or a second-line treatment in multiple immunocompetent mouse models of SCLC. The downstream effects of ATR inhibition was assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing, multicolor flow cytometry, western blot analysis, IHC, and genomic analysis.<br \/>Results: In multiple immunocompetent SCLC mouse models, ATR inhibition (ATRi) remarkably enhanced the anti-tumor effect of PD-L1 blockade both as first- and second-line treatment regimen. Targeting ATR activated the cGAS\/STING pathway, induced the expression of Type I and II interferon pathways, and caused significant infiltration of cytotoxic and memory\/effector T-cells into tumors. Interestingly, ATRi also led to significant induction of MHC class I in SCLC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Analysis of pre- and post-treatment clinical samples from a proof-of-concept study of a first-in-class ATR inhibitor, M6620 (VX970, berzosertib), and TOP1 inhibitor topotecan, in patients with relapsed SCLCs validated the induction of MHC class I and interferon pathway genes, for the first time in this disease.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings highlight ATRi as a potentially transformative vulnerability of SCLC, paving the way for combination clinical trials with anti-PD-L1. Given the increasing importance of immunotherapy for the management of SCLC and that ATR inhibitors are already in clinical trials, combining an ATR inhibitor with PD-L1 blockade may offer a particularly attractive strategy for the treatment of SCLC and contribute to the rapid translation of this combination into the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,DNA damage response,Innate immunity,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Triparna Sen<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"50be39f8-aa97-41c7-9f7d-ba4f195d91be","ControlNumber":"594","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

It has been reported that many neutrophils also infiltrate in various tumor tissues as tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) which produce considerable amounts of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). However, the crosstalk between TAN and TIL and its impact on tumor behavior have not been fully examined.<br \/>Methods: Neutrophils and mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from the blood of healthy donor. Neutrophils were stimulated with PMA or LPS for 15 min, washed extensively, and incubated for another 4 hours to produce NETs. PBMC were cultured on anti-CD3 mAb-coated plate with recombinant-IL-2 for 7-14days. The migration of activated T cells through 3&#956;m pore to CXCL-11 was examined in vitro. The localization and densities of TAN and TIL were immunohistochemically evaluated in 38 human serous ovarian cancer tissue. NETs were quantified with the density of CD66b(+) and Citrullinated Histon H3(+) cells.<br \/>Results: Chemotactic migration of T cells to CXCL-11 was inhibited by 99%&#177;1.6% (p&#60;0.001) in the presence of PMA-activated neutrophils in lower chamber. The inhibition was similarly detected when NET components were removed by ultracentrifugation. Timelapse analysis also showed the NETs-depleted supernatant inhibited random migration, which was totally canceled by the pretreatment with catalase. When neutrophils were activated by LPS, T cell migration was also inhibited by 49%&#177;19.9% (p&#60;0.01), but not by NETs-depleted supernatant. In western blotting, CXCL11 was totally degraded by LPS-stimulated neutrophils, which was greatly reduced by the depletion of NET component and restored by DNase I as well as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) or Neutrophil elastase inhibitor (NEI). The reduced migration induced by LPS-stimulated neutrophils was also restored with these reagents. In ovarian cancer tissues, density of TIL was greater in tumors with diameter &#8805;10cm than that of tumors &#60;10cm (p=0.04). However, the densities of TIL and NETs were irrelevant with age, tumor stage and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood. Multicolor immunohistochemistry showed that TAN and TIL tended to be reciprocally distributed in tumor stroma in most of the ovarian cancer tissues. Cit-H3 was positively detected in 2.1%~75% of CD66b(+) TANs, and the proportion of NET in TAN greatly varied among tumors. In all cases, the densities of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells inversely correlated with that of NETs (r = -0.5182, p = 0.0012; r = -0.5684, p = 0.0003, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: Activated neutrophils negatively regulate T cell migration partially through NET formation. TAN may suppress T cell traffic into tumor tissue, which may attenuate cell-mediated immunity in tumor microenvironment and promote tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,neutrophil extracellular traps,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kohei Tamura<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hideyo Miyato<sup><\/sup>, Misaki Matsumiya<sup><\/sup>, Rei Takahashi<sup><\/sup>, Yuki Kaneko<sup><\/sup>, Yurie Futoh<sup><\/sup>, Kazuya Takahashi<sup><\/sup>, Yuki Kimura<sup><\/sup>, Akira Saito<sup><\/sup>, Hideyuki Ohzawa<sup><\/sup>, Yasushi Saga<sup><\/sup>, Yuji Takei<sup><\/sup>, Hiroyuki Fujiwara<sup><\/sup>, Joji Kitayama<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"440ab732-b0f2-43cb-91bc-d81f5bf55fce","ControlNumber":"4320","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Targeting KRAS G12C mutations has shown some promise in clinical studies, though acquired resistance mutations pose a challenge for small molecule-based monotherapies. Vaccines targeting KRAS mutations remain highly desirable for durable tumor control and clinical benefit to patients with solid tumors. While cytotoxic CD8 T cells are critical to tumor control and clearance, CD4 T cell activation is a key component of a durable anti-tumor response. Cancer neoepitopes with homology to infectious diseases antigens (mimotopes) were associated with long-term clinical benefit following CTLA-4 blockade. In this study, we screened healthy donor PBMC samples via <i>ex vivo <\/i>interferon-gamma (IFN&#947;) ELISpot and identified KRAS G12C-specific T cell responses associated with cross-reactive TCRs recognizing a bacterial lipoprotein peptide sequence with homology to KRAS G12C. Healthy donors with T cell responses to both KRAS G12C and mimotope peptides shared common HLA-DR alleles, and KRAS G12C-specific T cell responses were CD4 dependent via depletion assays. KRAS G12C-reactive CD4 healthy donor T cells were polyfunctional as assessed by intracellular cytokine staining, and killing of class II target cells presenting G12C peptides assessed by Incucyte assay was CD4-dependent. We further identified vaccine-induced KRAS G12C specific CD4 T cell responses in a patient with KRAS G12C-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving a shared neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccine consisting of Chimpanzee adenovirus prime and self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA) boost vaccinations in combination with nivolumab 480 mg IV (NCT03953235). This patient had previously progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy and showed signs of clinical benefit with molecular response (e.g., ctDNA reduction) and tumor shrinkage following vaccination. Patient PBMCs were analyzed by <i>ex vivo<\/i> IFN&#947; ELISpot, and G12C-specific T cell responses were detectable at baseline and increased following vaccination. T cell receptor (TCR) and transcriptome single cell sequencing analyses showed a large clonal population of CD4 effector memory cells in the post-vaccination samples. Functional analyses of patient-derived TCR clonotypes from post-vaccination samples via recombinant TCR screening assays identified two functional clonotypes recognizing KRAS G12C epitopes in the context of HLA-DR on target cells. Studies to further elucidate KRAS G12C vaccine-induced TCR functionality in primary cells and transgenic mouse models are ongoing. This study provides important insight into both naturally occurring bacterial mimotope-based and vaccine-induced T cell responses against KRAS G12C neoepitopes that informs future therapeutic approaches targeting KRAS G12C tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Neoantigens,T cell,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christine D.

Unfortunately, severe inflammatory toxicities affect up to 60% of patients, often leading to treatment discontinuation in settings where few alternative therapies are available to control disease. Checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis is a common toxicity for which the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined.<br \/>Methods: To better understand the changing colon-specific and peripheral immune environments over the course of disease progression and treatment, we collected blood and colon tissue from a Merkel Cell carcinoma patient who developed colitis after treatment with pembrolizumab. We performed 10X Genomics single cell RNA sequencing on samples collected before, during and after checkpoint inhibition and various interventions to mitigate toxicity.<br \/>Results: We identified both shared and colon-exclusive clonal expansion of T cells defined by distinct transcriptional programs, including cytotoxicity, memory, and proliferation markers, at various stages of the disease process. These clones decreased dramatically in the colon after infliximab and vedolizumab therapies.<br \/>Conclusions: We identified several distinct T cell subsets as potential drivers of colitis in the colon. T cell clones that potentially recognize colonic tissue with a high degree of specificity can be harnessed for therapeutic intervention. Our findings emphasize the need for a more detailed understanding of the immune environment in the colon and suggest the potential for peripheral blood as a readout for immune activity during CPI treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Toxicity,Colon,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jacqueline  E.

Data from the first-in-human clinical Phase I\/II study (MATINS; NCT03733990) demonstrate that single agent bexmarilimab is able to ignite an interferon response with survival benefit in 30% of patients with advanced gastric cancer, cutaneous melanoma and cholangiocarcinoma (ASCO 2022). Since Clever-1 knockout mice have been reported to have enhanced T-cell antibody production and bexmarilimab increases peripheral B-cell populations, we investigated B-cell phenotype, clonality and autoantibody formation in bexmarilimab treatmented MATINS patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We first performed comprehensive phenotyping of peripheral B-cells from a colorectal carcinoma patient showing partial response (per RECIST v1.1). Autoantibody reactivities were measured in 80 serum samples of bexmarilimab treated patients (37 pre-treatment and 43 post-treatment samples from cycles 3 and 4) and compared to serums from 53 healthy individuals using Oncimmune's SeroTag multiplex technology with an immune-oncology (IO) specific protein array comprised of 1162 antigens.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Single-cell sequencing together with BCR sequencing of the responder&#8217;s B-cells during cycle 4 revealed an induced and activated B-cell population consisting of four transcriptionally similar clusters expressing <i>IGHM<\/i>, <i>IGHD<\/i>, <i>CD23<\/i> but not <i>CD43<\/i> and one cluster expressing <i>CD79B<\/i>, <i>PLD4<\/i> and <i>MZB1<\/i>, which was distant from the na&#239;ve CCR7 expressing B-cells and <i>IGHA1<\/i> and <i>IGHG1<\/i> expressing plasma blasts. The expansion of B-cells was not due to clonal expansion as no overlapping BCR clones were identified between B-cells at pre-dose and cycle 4. Autoantibody profiling revealed great inter-individual heterogeneity in the number and targets of induced antibodies among patients treated with bexmarilimab reflecting individual patterns in self- and tumor antigens. However, shared autoantibody changes against targets such as cancer testis antigens (GAGE2), typical autoimmune disease antigens (SNRPC, TPO, TOP1) and antigens related to the induction of innate immunity and interferon responses, e.g. TRIM21 were observed. Importantly, we identified a set of pre-treatment autoantibodies that were associated with longer time to disease progression and were predictive of clinical response (disease control rate [DCR], consisting of CR, PR, SD) and progression-free survival (PFS) on bexmarilimab therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data implies that bexmarilimab can induce activation and secondary Ig rearrangements in mature B-cells, which has been reported to occur in germinal centres during T-cell dependent antibody responses to increase B-cell diversity and affinity of antigen receptors. B cell diversity and activation was reflected in patient autoantibody production and may enhance cancer immune recognition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Macrophages,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elisa  M.

Prior studies have demonstrated the utility of targeting the chemokine signaling axis CXCR4-CXCL12 (SDF-1), a highlighted feature in PDACs, to overcome the CXCL12-driven immobilization of T cells and thus facilitate their antitumor role within the tumor. Based on these findings, we have conducted a phase 2 trial evaluating the effects of plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, and cemiplimab, a PD1 inhibitor antibody, in patients with metastatic PDAC who have progressed after one line of systemic chemotherapy (NCT04177810). To determine the immunological responses to therapy, blood samples and tissue biopsies were obtained at baseline and during treatment. Hematological assessment confirmed the activity of CXCR4 antagonist in mobilizing hematopoietic precursors (CD34+), immature myeloid cells, and lymphoid cells, as well as monocytic and granulocytic cell populations. Suspension mass cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that mobilized monocytic subpopulations had high expressions of chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR2. Histopathologic evaluation of the serial tissue biopsies from the liver metastatic PDAC revealed increased levels of inflammation upon treatment. To further characterize the cellular constituents of the observed inflammation, multiplexed immunohistochemistry by imaging mass cytometry was performed, demonstrating strong trends toward increased infiltration of not only effector T cells but also macrophages and granulocytic cells into the tumor microenvironment. Taken together, these findings suggest that mobilization of myeloid cells by CXCR4 antagonism results in the recruitment of additional myeloid cells from circulation and that alternative chemokine signaling pathways are sufficient for doing so. This implicates a potential mode of resistance against CXCR4-targeted therapies. Furthermore, these observations reinforce the value of ongoing research efforts in the field to subvert the recruitment or immunosuppressive function of myeloid cells, which would be particularly relevant in the setting of CXCR4 antagonism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Chemokine receptor,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah  M.

Increasing evidence have suggested that conventional chemotherapy can exert anti-cancer activity through various immune-based mechanisms. T cell receptor (TCR) diversity is crucial for immune responses and TCR repertoire has been reported acting as predictive and prognostic markers for cancer outcome. Here, we reported the TCR repertoire profiling in breast cancer and its association with chemotherapy and treatment response in breast cancer patients.<br \/>Experimental design: This study is part of VGH-TAYLOR study, a comprehensive precision medicine study protocol on the heterogeneity of Taiwanese breast cancer patients (NCT04626440). A total of 856 female patients with luminal A, luminal B1, luminal B2, HER2-enriched, or triple-negative breast cancers were recruited. The enrolled subjects contains patients who receive surgery as the first-line treatment followed by adjuvant therapy and who receive neoadjuvant therapy as the first-line treatment followed by surgery. The blood samples from patients during chemotherapy were collected for TCR sequencing. The Oncomine TCR Beta-LR Assay was applied to determine the dynamic change in TCR repertoire. We examined TCR repertoire in terms of clonality, TCR richness\/evenness and convergence.<br \/>Results: Higher TCR clonality in breast cancer patients was associated with lower clonal richness. TCR clonality was positively correlated with age and stage but not tumor size. Patients with recurrence had higher TCR clonality and lower Shannon diversity. Patients with luminal B2 breast cancer showed lower TCR diversity compared to luminal A and triple-negative breast cancer. However, there were no significant differences in CDR3 length and the usage of variable and joining genes among breast cancer subtypes. Notably, both of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapies increased convergence and clonality while decreased Shannon diversity of TCR. In neoadjuvant settings, lower post-treatment blood TCR richness was associated with complete pathologic response.<br \/>Conclusion: These data suggested that TCR repertoire is associated with clinicopathological characteristics including stage and recurrence. TCR clonal richness might provide prognostic value for patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,T cell receptor repertoire ,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chun-Yu Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chi-Cheng Huang<sup><\/sup>, Ji-Lin Chen<sup><\/sup>, Yi-Fang Tsai<sup><\/sup>, Ta-Chung Chao<sup><\/sup>, Pei-Ju Lien<sup><\/sup>, Yen-Shu Lin<sup><\/sup>, Chin-Jung Feng<sup><\/sup>, Yen-Jen Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jiun-I Lai<sup><\/sup>, Jen-Hwey Chiu<sup><\/sup>, Chih-Yi Hsu<sup><\/sup>, Ling-Ming Tseng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"503da4b2-e06a-46ff-afae-eb99bd226e89","ControlNumber":"477","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Approximately 50% of patients with HER2+ metastatic BC were still alive and progression-free at 24 months (DESTINY-Breast03). We proved that mucin 4 (MUC4) expression is an independent predictor of poor response to trastuzumab in HER2+ BC patients. In JIMT-1 tumors we proved that soluble TNF&#945; (sTNF&#945;) upregulates MUC4, conferring trastuzumab resistance by hiding its epitope on the HER2 molecule and reducing its binding. Here, we study whether sTNF&#945; blockade with INB03 (DN) plays a role in regulation of innate immunity to enhance T-DXd antitumor effects in a multiple HER2-targeted therapy-resistant model. Nude mice bearing HER2+MUC4+ JIMT-1 tumor, primary resistant to trastuzumab, pertuzumab and lapatinib, were treated with IgG 5 mg\/kg, T-DXd 5 mg\/kg (T-DXd 5), 2.5 mg\/kg (T-DXd 2.5) or 1.25 mg\/kg (T-DXd 1.25), DN 10 mg\/kg or the combined therapies. T-DXd and IgG were administered i.v. on days 0, 7 and 14. DN was administered i.p. twice a week for 3 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored. Mitotic index was analyzed in H&#38;E tumor sections. The tumor-infiltrating innate cells, macrophages, NK cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), were studied by flow cytometry. T-DXd dose-response curves exhibited tumor growth inhibitions of 83% (T-DXd 5), 61% (T-DXd 2.5) and 37% (T-DXd 1.25) vs IgG-treated tumors. DN alone had no antitumor effect. T-DXd+DN reinforced the antitumor effect, as tumor growth inhibition escalated to 98% (T-DXd 5+DN), 81% (T-DXd 2.5+DN) and 73% (T-DXd 1.25+DN). A reduced number of mitotic figures were observed in T-DXd 5, T-DXd 1.25+DN and T-DXd 5+DN. Combining DN with T-DXd 1.25 and 5 enhanced the infiltration of resident macrophages and promoted polarization to the M1-like phenotype The tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) were similar among treatments. However, the combination T-DXd 1.25+DN showed an increase in M1-like tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and a decrease in M2-like TAMs vs T-DXd 1.25 alone. T-DXd 1.25+DN treatment mimics the increase of infiltrating NK cells observed in the T-DXd 2.5 and 5 doses Finally, adding DN to T-DXd 2.5 and 5 diminishes MDSCs infiltration. Combination therapies were well tolerated without evidence of toxicity. Our results suggest that sTNF&#945; blockade enhances T-DXd effect in a multiple HER2-targeted therapy resistant model. Adding DN allows to lower T-DXd doses to induce a reinforced antitumor innate immune response, reduced tumor cell mitosis and achieve similar tumor inhibition. Since sTNF&#945; and MUC4 expression proved to be important variables in the response to T-DXd, neutralizing this cytokine may open new therapeutic strategies to treat patients with MUC4 expressing tumors or have progression on T-DXd therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,TNF-&#945;,Tumor microenvironment,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sofia Bruni<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Florencia  L.

MVP-S is comprised of 5 HLA class I peptides from the tumor antigen, survivin, along with the A16L T helper peptide, and the innate immune activator, polydIdC. Analysis of PBMCs collected from advanced recurrent ovarian cancer patients treated with MVP-S based therapy in the DeCidE<sup>1<\/sup> trial (NCT02785250) showed robust survivin-specific T cell induction that persisted in some patients up to 420 days. Herein, we analyzed the T cell repertoires of pre- and on-treatment (on-Tx) tumor biopsies from these patients to further investigate the fate of T cells elicited by the MVP-S based therapy. Analysis of the T cell receptor beta (TCR&#946;) sequences revealed that MVP-S treatment actively promotes the infiltration of a new, diverse T cell repertoire with 51.6% to 94.9% new clones recruited to the on-Tx tumors. These novel clones cumulatively comprise 29.8% to 90.5% of the total intra-tumoral T cell population. Profiling of patients achieving partial response (by RECISTv1.1) versus those achieving only progressive disease indicated an increase in clonal diversity, with reduction in clonal domination, in the on-Tx tumors, suggestive of epitope spreading in these responsive patients. To evaluate frequency of survivin-specific T cells within the tumor tissue, a library of survivin-specific T cell clonotypes was prepared using in vitro expanded and sorted PBMCs. Across 33 patients of various clinical outcomes and timepoints, 309 unique, survivin-specific clones were identified. Clonotypes were found to be strongly subject-specific with very limited overlap across subjects. TCR&#946; sequences of circulating survivin-specific T cells were compared with TC&#946; repertoire in the tumor biopsies to determine clonal sequence overlap. Sixty-four of the identified survivin-specific clones (20.7%) were found in tumor samples (pre- and on-treatment); of these, 71.9% (46\/64)<b> <\/b>were detected in on-treatment samples only, compared to 12.5% (8\/64)<b> <\/b>in pre-treatment samples only. Importantly, survivin-specific clones were recurrently found within the top 1-10% of the most frequent clones in the on-treatment tumoral T cell population, suggesting that MVP-S therapy promoted strong enrichment and expansion of survivin-specific T cells within tumour tissue. These data indicate that treatment of advanced recurrent ovarian cancer patients with MVP-S based therapy induced robust, persistent survivin-specific T cells that were detected in circulation up to 420 days. These <i>de novo<\/i> elicited T cells were demonstrated to migrate into tumor tissues, where MVP-S therapy promoted reinvigoration of the total T cell population with new highly diverse clones including strong expansion of survivin-specific T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,Immuno-oncology,TCRb sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kelcey Patterson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Barry Kennedy<sup><\/sup>, Walead Ebrahimizadeh<sup><\/sup>, Aurelio Lobo<sup><\/sup>, Heather Hirsch<sup><\/sup>, Heather Torrey<sup><\/sup>, Valarmathy Kaliaperumal<sup><\/sup>, Lisa MacDonald<sup><\/sup>, Jeremy Graff<sup><\/sup>, Stephan Fiset<sup><\/sup>, Olga Hrytsenko<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>IMV Inc., Dartmouth, NS, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5ba3f585-796e-4337-a8e7-fd5aae3daf3e","ControlNumber":"7047","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

However, the differing mechanisms of action often make the evaluation of biologic drug efficacy more complex, requiring the support and\/or recapitulation of functional immune components. Biologics also have different limitations that can govern their efficacy such as their large size potentially impeding sufficient penetration to target sites and in the case of live biotherapeutic products, the need to maintain sustained function, or persistence, by resisting immunosuppression by the tumor microenvironment. Preclinical testing of biologics is often confined to cell lines which lack an immune system and mouse models which are expensive, time consuming, and poor proxies for the human immune system. To address these issues, we have developed <i>ex vivo<\/i> 3D spheroid platforms to measure the efficacy of three types of biologics: antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells. Primary cells from cancer patients or from patient-derived xenografts were evaluated for the expression of the biologic target molecule then cultured to form 3D spheroids. Spheroid models were validated for the evaluation of antibody-based therapies by determining sufficient diffusion of antibodies to target sites. For ADC testing, cell death was measured in a plate-based read-out following treatment with the ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan, and the cytotoxic efficacy of the ADC was compared to trastuzumab alone or free exatecan. Differences in killing kinetics and the maximum efficacy of the ADC were determined compared to the other tested agents. HER2 inhibition was evaluated through changes in constitutive downstream signaling. Two biologics with the same molecular target, a bispecific antibody targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on tumor cells and CD3 on T-cells, as well as a CAR T-cell product targeting CEA were also evaluated. Following treatment with the bispecific, tumor cell viability was detected using flow cytometry and changes in T-cell activation were measured via cytokine secretion using primary colorectal cancer models. Importantly, bispecific antibody efficacy was dependent upon the presence of T-cells. Finally, CAR T-cell mediated tumor cell killing was detected using a fluorescent image-based approach. Collectively, this work establishes a model for testing multiple classes of drugs in a 3D <i>ex vivo<\/i> model that can be used to advance preclinical drug development and evaluate mechanisms of action of diverse drug classes in a physiologically relevant model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Bispecific antibody,CAR T cells,Ex vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Katy  A.

Despite durable responses exhibited by a subgroup of patients, most of patients do not respond to ICB therapies and the vast majority (60%-90%) of patients experience disease progression within five years. Molecular mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to ICB are still widely unknown, which warrants further mechanistic investigation. Towards that goal, we used a holistic approach driven by integrated genomic tools to molecularly profile 35 longitudinal tumor specimens at pre-, on-, and post-treatment time points which were derived from seven patients with metastatic melanoma who progressed on sequential ICB therapies, including three responders and four non-responders. We integrated analyses of data generated from RNA sequencing, Whole-exome Sequencing (WES), NanoString nCounter vantage 3D, Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CyCIF), NanoString Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) and Multiplex Immunohistochemistry (mIHC) platforms to elucidate evolutionary trajectories that occurred in both the tumor and the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) that may have orchestrated response and resistance to ICB therapies. Simultaneous analyses conducted on genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels identified the re-activation of the MAPK pathway as a potential mechanism of resistance to ICB therapies. Spatially-resolved, image-based immune monitoring analysis at single cell resolution revealed that response to ICB is associated with infiltration of immune cells accompanied by induced activities of myeloid, T cells and macrophages in the TiME. In summary, integrated analyses allow us not only to reveal the dynamic co-revolution of both tumor and immune cells in TiME following sequential ICB therapies but also to provide a comprehensive perspective to molecular mechanisms of response and resistance to ICB therapies. A deeper understanding and elucidation of the evolution of mechanisms of response and resistance to ICB therapies will point us to generate hypothesis-driven, potential salvage therapies to overcome resistance to ICB therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Resistance,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Shiyou Wei<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinho Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Marilyne Labrie<sup>2<\/sup>, Courtney Betts<sup>2<\/sup>, Lunxu Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Lisa Coussens<sup>2<\/sup>, Meenhard Herlyn<sup>3<\/sup>, Genevieve Boland<sup>4<\/sup>, Gordon Mills<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Gao Zhang<\/b><sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, OR,<sup>3<\/sup>The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>4<\/sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ef4a8cc6-0635-4428-ae24-3e90c929555d","ControlNumber":"5401","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Current treatment consists of tumor resection followed by chemoradiotherapy which yields a 5-year survival rate of only 6.8%. The average survival for newly diagnosed patients is only 14-15 months, highlighting the need for improved therapies. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM is highly immunosuppressive, preventing successful treatment by immunotherapies like immune checkpoint blockade. Our lab is interested in identifying potential targets in GBM that would allow for increased immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, thus enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a central role in innate pathogen sensing and has been implicated in cancer as a potential immunostimulatory therapeutic target. Our previous work demonstrated the functionality of the STING pathway in GBM mouse models and patient samples. We have also shown increased infiltration of innate immune cells in the TME and significant survival benefits after treatment with the STING agonist ADU-S-100 in GL261 and CT-2A mouse models. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies in cultured GBM cell lines and normal cells found in the GBM TME such as human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) in the presence of ADU-S100 showed a robust type I IFN response in endothelial cells but not in tumor cells. Western blotting showed the presence of all the major STING signaling pathway components in GBM cells, raising the question of how the STING pathway is regulated in tumor cells. To investigate this further we have performed cytokine profiling of GBM cells and HCMECs upon treatment with ADU-S100. This confirmed a strong Type I interferon response in HCMECs, and a distinct response in GBM cells, showing that tumor cells respond to STING activity via alterations in cytokine secretion, but in a different way from TME cells. Finally, manganese has been highlighted as a possible potentiator of STING agonist activity in other cancer types. Combination of manganese with ADU-S100 showed enhanced protein expression of downstream STING pathway components in HCMECs as well as in GBM cells through Western blot. Furthermore, manganese alters the cytokine profile in combination with ADU-S100 relative to untreated or ADU-S100 alone suggesting enhancement of immune signaling. Taken together, these results suggest potentiation of ADU-S100 by manganese in GBM. In conclusion, STING agonists are promising agents for local immunostimulation in GBM, and their activity may be enhanced by combination with manganese. Ongoing experiments are aimed at elucidating mechanistic insights into these concepts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrea Schmidt<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Caroline Sweeney<sup><\/sup>, William  M.

Tumor was macrodissected from 2-5 FFPE slides guided by an H&#38;E stained section of tumor. RNA extraction was done using Qiagen Rneasy FFPE kit. 100ng of RNA was used for transcriptomic analysis using the 770-gene Nanostring PanCancer IO 360 panel. Data normalization and analysis was carried out using nSolver 4.0.<br \/>Results: Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, when comparing molecular signatures of pts with CR vs PD respectively, we saw upregulation of exhausted CD8 (log fold change (FC) = 0.7287, p= 0.03289) and IFN downstream (logFC = 0.5929, p = 0.04986). Notably, the molecular signatures upregulated between SD vs PD respectively were IFN Gamma (logFC = 1.503, p = 0.0044), PD-L1 (logFC = 1.136, p = 0.0123), Antigen-presenting machinery (APM) (logFC = 1.103, p = 0.0006), Immunoproteasome (logFC = 0.984, p = 0.00096) and Tumor inflammatory score (logFC = 0.947, p = 0.032). Furthermore, molecular signatures were not differently upregulated between pts with PR vs PD. In our cohort, the proportion of pts who were alive at 35.9 months (median follow-up) was 62.5% for CR (5 of 8), 28.5% for PR (4 of 14), 22.2% for SD (2 of 9) and 6.2% for PD (2 of 30) even though the median overall survival was not significantly different between the groups.<br \/>Conclusion: In our cohort of ICI-treated mUC pts, we found an association between existing T-cell effector function, particularly IFN-gamma responses, and response to ICI. Signatures associated with T cell exhaustion were also upregulated among pts with CR indicating ongoing anti-tumor activity. These findings need to be further validated in prospective trials. Ongoing genomic and immunologic correlative studies in our cohort will further help understand comprehensive biomarkers of response and resistance to ICI in pts with mUC are currently underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Bladder cancer,Immune checkpoint,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nikhil Pramod<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Paul Pavicic<sup><\/sup>, Scott Dawsey<sup><\/sup>, Alan Shen<sup><\/sup>, Roshan Lodha<sup><\/sup>, Moshe Ornstein<sup><\/sup>, Omar Mian<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Gilligan<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Wee<sup><\/sup>, Amanda Nizam<sup><\/sup>, Jane Nguyen<sup><\/sup>, C.

KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC. The mutation results in continuous activation of KRAS, triggering multiple kinase signaling pathways. The oncogenic features of KRAS mutations are in line with clinical observations that NSCLC patients with KRAS mutations have a worse prognosis with less benefit from chemotherapies. Although the targeted inhibition of KRAS G12C mutation in NSCLC has achieved remarkable success, the inhibition of KRAS G12D has not yet been successful. It has been reported that KRAS mutations can facilitate the development of immunosuppressive properties of the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, KRAS mutations can up-regulate regulatory T cell (Treg) population. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a cancer therapy based on noninvasive delivery of electric fields. Our current <i>in vitro<\/i> study was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a transgenic mouse lung cancer model with a KRAS G12D mutation. Our data showed that TTFields treatment decreased CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells intensity prepared from PBMC compared to untreated cells by flow cytometric determination. In addition, CD4+ T cells prepared from TTFields treated PBMC have enhanced IFN-&#947; expression levels compared to untreated PBMC. These results suggest TTFields treatment appear to correct the immunosuppressive properties created by KRAS mutations. Therefore, <i>in vivo<\/i> treatment for the inducible lung cancer with KRAS activating mutations is needed to confirm the <i>in vitro<\/i> results. In conclusion, TTFields are a potential therapeutic tool for NSCLC with KRAS G12D mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Suhe Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, James  R.

These cells work with the tumor cells to suppress host development of anti-tumor immune responses, regulate tumor metastasis, and drive cancer drug resistance to virtually all types of therapy. Therefore, methods to disrupt tumor-associated myeloid cell function are actively being sought to find a cure.<br \/>Goals: Our team has recently developed a plant-derived carbohydrate molecule, BG34-200, that modulates tumor-associated myeloid cells by targeting the cell surface receptor CD11b. In this study, we investigated the immune activation induced by BG34-200-CD11b engagement in the context of advanced melanoma and use the knowledge to develop BG34-200-based combination immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: Wild type B57Bl6\/J mice were injected with 1.5million B16F10 cells and treated intravenously with BG34-200. Tumor volume and animals survival were monitored, and whole blood was drawn for FACS analysis.<br \/>Results: We found that BG34-200 IV administration could significantly inhibit tumor growth and improve survival in B16F10 mice with advanced melanoma. Our data supported a model that the entry of BG34-200 into circulating melanoma tumor-associated inflammatory monocytes (TAIMs) could trigger a sequential immune activation: the BG34-200<sup>+<\/sup> TAIM subsets migrated to tumor and differentiated into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs); then, the BG34-200<sup>+<\/sup> mo-DCs migrated to tumor draining lymph nodes where they triggered the generation of tumor antigen specific T cells. Based upon these results, we combined BG34-200 treatment with adoptive transfer of TdLN-derived T-cell to treat advanced melanoma, which significantly improved animal survival and helped tumor-free survivors be resistant to a second tumor cell challenge.<br \/>Conclusions: The scientific findings from this study will allow us to develop new technology to apply BG34-200-based immunotherapy to patients with advanced melanoma who have not responded to current standard of care therapies with and without immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immuno-oncology,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Veronique  P.

At baseline, a higher ratio between active (4-1BB<sup>+<\/sup>) and inactive regulatory CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was associated with response to therapy.

However, most patients are either unresponsive or develop acquired resistance. Understanding patient-specific temporal T cell repertoires in the context of immune interventions will contribute to a better understanding of potential improvement strategies for better T cell anti-tumor immunity. Current methods to understand the T cell repertoire changes over time are limited due to the limited amount of material and prohibitive cost. In this study, we designed and performed longitudinal TCR sequencing in mice treated with multiple therapies.<br \/>Methods: C57BL\/6 mice were used in each treatment group, with blood drawn overtime before, during and after treatment. Mice were treated with a combination of immunotherapeutic agents and OVA peptide immunization, 100&#181;l blood was drawn at multiple pre-, on- and post-treatment time points followed subsequently by TCR sequencing. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is known to cause lymphodepletion followed by homeostatic proliferation. Thus, we also treated B16-F10 tumor bearing mice with CTX, and performed TCR sequencing on blood draws pre-, on-, and post-treatment to track TCR clone diversity and clonality over time.<br \/>Results: We find that our method is sensitive enough to detect effects of immunotherapies on TCR diversity in small sample quantities. Using our method, we discovered that certain immunotherapeutic agents, most evidently CD40, have a significant but transient effect on the diversity of the T cell repertoire. We observed an initial increase in repertoire clonality, seven days post CD40 treatment followed by contraction. We show how we can identify antigen specific T cells and follow reacting T cell clones. In addition, we find that CTX treatment is associated with increased clonality in tumor bearing mice particularly in the week following treatment reflecting changes in the TCR repertoire.<br \/>Conclusion: We have developed a method by which we can follow the TCR repertoire in mice treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy. This enabled us to isolate and study the effects of different immune modulatory drugs of the endogenous T cell repertoire overtime.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,T cell,Mouse models,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuval Elhanati<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mariam  M.

This has led to the approval of multiple antibodies for metastatic melanoma and other malignancies. A large proportion of the patients do not benefit from CTLA-4 or PD-1 antagonistic antibodies. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy is thus critical to improve its effectiveness. Previously we identified and validated a novel population of cells characterized by phenotype CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup>CD127<sup>-<\/sup>GARP<sup>-<\/sup>CD38<sup>+<\/sup>CD39<sup>+<\/sup> that was associated with non-responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in metastatic melanoma patients (Woods <i>et al<\/i>, 2020). CD38 and CD39 are ectonucleotidases, that convert intracellular ATP or NADPH to extracellular adenosine which has suppressive effect on T cell functions.<br \/>We used high-dimension flow cytometry and bulk RNA seq to characterize the phenotype of these cells and evaluated the functions by T cell suppression assays. All characterizations and functional experiments were performed on peripheral blood samples from metastatic melanoma patients undergoing anti-PD1 therapy.<br \/>The characterization of this population by flow cytomtery shows an enhanced expression of activation markers (4-1BB, HLA-DR, OX-40, GITR), inhibitory receptors (Tim3, CTLA-4, PD-1) and ligands (PD-L1, CD244) and an exhausted phenotype (TOXhiTCF1low). Further functional studies performed on these cells showed a suppressive phenotype, as observed by a significant decrease in the proliferation of target autologous CD4 (p=0.001) and CD8 (p=0.0012) T cells when in co-culture with these cells, compared to the controls. The transcriptomic features of these cells showed an upregulation of genes associated with proliferation (e.g. CDC20, TK1, DHFR, MYL6B), as well as exhaustion (e.g. upregulated TOX), consistent with the flow cytometry data. We also evaluated the presence of these cells and their correlation with the outcome in other melanoma datasets. By performing gene set variation analysis (GSVA) on existing single-cell RNA seq datasets of tumor derived immune cells in melanoma, we have found that an intra-tumoral CD3+CD4+CD127-GARP-CD38+CD39+ signature is associated with resistance to immunotherapy (p= 0.000003).<br \/>We identified a novel population of ectonucleotidase expressing T cells in peripheral blood and tumor to be associated with immunotherapy resistance in metastatic melanoma patients.
