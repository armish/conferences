[{"Abstract":"Background: Assessment of comorbid diseases is essential to clinical research and may risk-stratify patients for adverse events and death. Total number of prescription medications and drug classes could be an easy-to-use tool for estimating patient risk independent of established methods such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) that is created from administrative data. Additionally, clinicians have access to prescription medication lists, facilitating assessment of comorbidities in clinical settings.<br \/>Methods: Retrospective observational study of US Veterans treated for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer in the Veterans Health Administration who received treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide between May 2011-June 2, 2017. We determined number of unique drugs and anatomic therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug classes prescribed in the year prior up to 14 days before initiation of treatment. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to assess the association between number of drugs with all-cause 90-day mortality and overall survival (OS) while accounting for important covariates including age, CCI, body-mass index, prostate specific antigen, race, prior docetaxel, hemoglobin, albumin, bilirubin, and creatinine.<br \/>Results: Among 11,021 Veterans, a median (IQR) of 11 (6,18) unique medications and 10 (5,15) unique ATC medication classes were filled in the year prior to treatment. The median age was 75 years with median CCI of 3 and 2,550 were black (23.1%). Increasing age was associated with increased CCI across age strata with mean CCI of 3.7 in age &#60;70, 4.2 in age 70-79, and 4.3 in age 80+ (p&#60;0.001). Increased age was associated with decreased number of unique medicines with mean 14.7 in age &#60;70, 12.7 in age 70-79, and 11.2 in age 80+ (p&#60;0.001). Black race was associated with increased mean number of medications compared to white race (15.5 vs. 12.0, p&#60;0.001). After adjusting for relevant patient, tumor, and treatment factors, the number of medications and drug classes were each independently associated with increased 90-day mortality with adjusted OR (95% CI) of 1.021 (1.011,1.030) and 1.024 (1.012,1.036) respectively. Both number of medications and number of classes were also associated with decreased OS with adjusted Hazard Ratio of 1.015 (1.013,1.018) and 1.018 (1.014,1.021) respectively. Within subgroups of patients with comparable CCI, increased number of medications was associated with increased risk of death.<br \/>Conclusion: The number of prescription medications and drug classes are independently associated with short- and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing treatment for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, even after accounting for important covariates including age and CCI. Assessment of patient medications may provide a simple, yet reliable tool to assess comorbidities, risk of adverse events, and death.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Comorbidity,Prostate cancer,Mortality,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Martin W.

However, there is limited data on the biological predisposition to site of metastasis in patients with NSCLC based on their molecular profiling. We sought to identify any association between metastatic site and molecular profile in NSCLC patients.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>This is a retrospective analysis conducted at UTHealth Houston\/Memorial Hermann Cancer Center from January 2014 to June 2022. Clinical characteristics, pathology, NGS panel reports, and imaging were retrieved and reviewed. The &#967;<sup>2<\/sup> test was used for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier test.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>After excluding patients who did not have complete clinical data, a total of 143 patients were included, and their NGS panels analyzed. Median age was 65 years, with an equal number of men (n=71) and women (n=72). The most common histology was adenocarcinoma (81.8%), followed by squamous cell cancer (11.9%) and large cell carcinoma (3.5%). At least one genetic mutation was discovered in 100 patients. Mutations with a targetable drug were found in 86 patients, and many patients had &#62;1 genetic mutation. The most common mutations were TP53 (25.2%), EGFR (24.5%), KRAS\/NRAS (20.3%), and CDKN2A\/2B (7.7%). Patients with any mutation were significantly more likely to have metastatic disease to the brain (57% vs 37%, p=0.03), but there was no difference in metastatic disease to bone (34% vs 26%, p=0.32). Patients without a discoverable mutation were significantly more likely to have metastatic disease to other sites (e.g., adrenal gland, liver; 91% vs 66%, p=0.002). There was no difference in PFS or OS between those with versus without mutations. Median PFS was significantly longer in patients with EGFR mutation than those with KRAS\/NRAS or TP53 mutations (36 vs 16.2 vs 11.9 months, p=0.03). Median OS for patients with EGFR mutation was not reached and was significantly longer than in patients with TP53 (28.7 months) or KRAS\/NRAS (26 months) mutations (p=0.003).Patients with PDL-1 &#62;1% or TP53 were significantly more likely to have metastatic disease to organs other than bone or brain (p=0.047 and p=0.023, respectively). There was also no difference between rates of brain and bone metastasis with regards to mutational profile.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Metastatic lung cancer patients with discoverable mutations on NGS are more likely to have metastatic disease to the brain. PDL-1 expression and TP53 mutation tend to lead to disease metastatic to organs other than brain or bone. Patients with EGFR mutations, despite having a great propensity to brain metastasis, have significantly better PFS and OS than patients with KRAS\/NRAS and TP53 mutations, likely due to targeted therapy options.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene profiling,Metastasis,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Outcome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kok Hoe Chan<sup><\/sup>, <b>Ji Lin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Arthi Sridhar<sup><\/sup>, Syed  H.

Based on current national guidelines, these patients are offered treatment for metastatic disease as definitive therapy is no longer feasible. Immunotherapy +\/- chemotherapy is typically initiated if a driver-oncogene is absent. The addition of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab to chemo has resulted in improved progression-free survival (PFS) (8.8 vs 4.9 mos) and overall survival (OS) (69.2% vs 49.4% 12-mos OS) compared to chemotherapy alone. Although this treatment strategy has been incorporated for R\/R NSCLC, there remains a paucity of data regarding its efficacy within this population. Here we present clinical outcomes data with pembrolizumab-based regimens for R\/R NSCLC following definitive CRT and durvalumab.<br \/>Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of pts treated between January 2016 to November 2022 at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Cleveland, OH. Eligibility criteria included pts age &#8805; 18 years with unresectable NSCLC who had received definitive CRT and durvalumab consolidation followed by pembrolizumab for R\/R disease. The primary objective was to estimate OS and PFS in this distinct cohort and to compare these findings to historical outcomes. Secondary objective was to compare OS and PFS between specific groups including age, sex, smoking history, combined chemo, histology, <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutation, and PD-L1 expression. OS and PFS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank test.<br \/>Results: 62 pts were identified, of whom 50 met full eligibility criteria and were included for data analysis. Median follow-up time was 11.3 months (0.7 - 38.2 mos). Median OS was 10.6 months (95% CI; 7.9 mos - NA) with a 1-year OS rate of 48% (95% CI; 35 - 67%). Median PFS was 6.1 months (95% CI; 4.8 - 9.9 mos) with a 1-year PFS rate of 26% (95% CI; 16-45%). Current smokers had significantly better median OS and PFS rates as compared to former smokers (NA vs 10.5 and 9.9 vs 6.0 mos, respectively; P = 0.036 and 0.028). An OS benefit in pts who received chemo with pembrolizumab (median OS 12.9 vs 6.0 mos) was noted but was not statistically significant. No other statistically significant difference was detected.<br \/>Conclusion: Patients with R\/R NSCLC after definitive CRT and durvalumab consolidation represent a distinct cohort with apparent inferior outcomes as compared to those with <i>de novo<\/i> stage IV disease when treated with pembrolizumab-based therapies. Although improved survival was observed with the addition of chemo to pembrolizumab, further investigation is warranted to optimize treatment strategies for this patient population. Given the limited sample size of our analysis, larger studies with matched real-world treatment cohorts are planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Pembrolizumab,Durvalumab,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lukas Delasos<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Wei Wei<sup><\/sup>, Khaled A.

While not major drivers in early breast cancers, activating MAPK pathway alterations have been invoked as potential resistance mechanisms in advanced hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer. While MAPK pathway mutations are believed to be relatively rare in breast cancer, the accessibility of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis allows for evaluation of their prevalence, co-occurring mutations, and associated clinical outcomes. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of MAPK pathway alterations and impact on clinical outcomes among patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Plasma was collected in patients with HR+ MBC at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Washington University in St. Louis, and cfDNA was analyzed via the Guardant 360 assay, a 74-gene next generation sequencing panel. The impact of MAPK pathway alterations on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed using multivariable Cox regression analysis, adjusting for age, number of prior therapies, visceral metastases, de novo metastases, and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> alterations.

An area of current research interest is the relationship between etiology of chronic liver disease in HCC patients and the response to specific treatment modalities. The purpose of this study is to identify prognostic indicators and compare survival outcomes among HCC patients within an Appalachian patient population.<br \/>Methods: A single-institution, retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients diagnosed with HCC between August 2009 and March 2017 at West Virginia University Hospital. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, laboratory data and treatment information were obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR). Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression analysis.<br \/>Results: The study sample (n=100) had a mean age of 62 years and was comprised of 82% males and 18% females. Nonviral etiologies of chronic liver disease were predominant (55%) over chronic viral hepatitis (45%). Significant adverse prognostic indicators of overall survival (OS) were Child-Pugh class C and tumor size &#62;5 cm at diagnosis (p&#60;0.0001, log-rank test). Patients who received liver-directed therapy (LDT) or liver resection had greater OS compared to those not treated with either modality (15.5 vs. 2.0 months, p&#60;0.0001). Liver ablation or resection as initial modes of treatment had greater OS compared to those who initially received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial radioembolization (TARE) (17.2 vs 14.9 months, p&#60;0.05). Patients who received TACE or TARE (n=60) as initial treatment had characteristics of advanced disease, with 45% having a tumor greater than 5 cm in size and 77% having multifocal unilobar or bilobar tumors. Among all patients who received LDT or resection, post-treatment albumin-bilirubin grade (ALBI) of 1 or 2 correlated with greater OS than grade 3 (22.5 vs 6.2 months, p&#60;0.0001). In the multivariate Cox analysis, tumor size, Child-Pugh class and mode of initial treatment (resection\/ablation vs. TACE\/TARE) were independent predictors of OS (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: Treatment with LDT or liver resection correlated with greater overall survival in this predominantly nonviral cohort of HCC patients. Post-treatment ALBI grade correlated with overall survival and may have prognostic value in guiding clinical management. Mode of initial treatment was a predictor of overall survival, but further studies are needed to compare tumor characteristics between groups.

Facility types used were assigned by the Commission on Cancer Accreditation program. Categorical Academic and Non-Academic variables were created. Data was analyzed using SPSS with a statistical significance of &#945; = 0.05.<br \/>Results: Of the 7950 patients included in this study, 3122 were treated at Academic facilities with a median survival of 77.6 months compared to 61.0 months for patients treated at a Non-Academic facility, which was statistically significant on long-rank testing (p&#60;0.001). Compared to patients treated at Non-Academic facilities, patients at Academic facilities experienced delay in the average surgical initiation time (p&#60;0.001), however, they were more likely to have surgery (88.1% vs. 74.1%; p&#60;0.001), have no residual tumor margins on resection, (63.4% vs. 53.3%; p&#60;0.001) and receive adjuvant chemotherapy (15.2% vs. 12.4%; p&#60;0.001). Academic facility patients also had a younger mean age and were more likely to come from highest median income quartile (36.9% vs. 33.2; p&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: Patients with leiomyosarcoma treated at Academic facilities experienced improved survival compared with patients with the same disease treated at Non-Academic facilities. These patients experienced higher rates of surgery, adjuvant therapy and wider excisional margins. It is possible that treatment discrepancies and\/or differences in surgical technique vary by facility type and contribute to the observed differences in survival.<br \/>Citations-1.

The following dichotomous variables were identified as impactful prognostic factors in this cohort: the absence of constitutional symptoms (5 vs. 18 months), cavitary effusion disease (6 vs. 66 months), peritoneal cavity disease (3.5 vs. 11 months), transplant context (4 vs. 7 months), male sex (6 vs. 40 months), and detectable HHV8 viremia (7 vs. 66 months). A prognostic model was devised using these variables to identify different levels of risk. Each variable was assigned a score of 1 when present, except for peritoneal cavity disease and transplant context, which were assigned 2 points as they had the highest hazard ratio of all the other variables. In this exploratory cohort, low risk was assigned a score of 0-1, intermediate risk a score of 2-3, and high risk a score of 4-8. This prognostic score system led to our cohort's most optimal risk discriminatory model, where low, intermediate, and high risk had a median OS of 66, 28, and 4 months, respectively (p&#60;0.0001).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> This PPS is a promising new tool for risk-stratifying patients with PEL.

These nonspecific s\/sx may cause pts to undergo unnecessary diagnostic evaluation while the possibility of cancer and search for its origin is explored, causing delayed treatment and poor outcomes. Additionally, pts who do not have cancer are often subjected to various undirected\/misdirected procedures due to initial cancer suspicion. Our objective was to examine pt characteristics, diagnostic journey, and cancer incidence of pts with nonspecific s\/sx within The US Oncology Network.<br \/>This retrospective observational cohort study included pts aged &#8805;40 with &#8805;1 of the following nonspecific s\/sx in their problem list at their first visit within The US Oncology Network (index date) during the identification period from 1\/1\/2016 to 12\/31\/2020: anemia, venous thromboembolism, general malaise, weight loss, nonspecific abdominal symptoms, new and unexplained breathlessness, unexplained worsening pain, and abnormal lab test results. Pts were excluded if diagnosed with any cancer (except basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer) within 3 years prior to or on index date. Pts were followed longitudinally with data from electronic health records for initial cancer diagnosis (dx), death, end of study observation period, or 12 months, whichever occurred first. Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed descriptively.<br \/>103,984 pts were identified. The median age was 65.7, 64% were female, 65% were White, 41% were obese, 47% were never smokers, and 48% were from a southern practice region. 6,774\/103,984 pts (7%) were diagnosed with cancer and 6,537\/6,774 (97%) with 1 primary cancer: 3,825\/6,537 (59%) were diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy and 2,712\/6,537 (41%) with a solid tumor cancer. Among pts diagnosed with primary solid tumors, 31% had gastrointestinal, 15% genitourinary, 15% respiratory, 13% breast, and 11% gynecologic cancer. Among pts diagnosed with cancer, median time to cancer dx after being referred to secondary care within The US Oncology Network with nonspecific s\/sx was &#62;5 wks (solid: &#62;7 wks; hematologic: &#62;4 wks); by 17 and 34 wks, 75% and 90% of pts received a cancer dx, respectively.<br \/>Within this population of pts most frequently presenting with nonspecific hematologic s\/sx and subsequent cancer dx, 40% were diagnosed with solid tumor cancers within 1 year. This speaks to the unmet need for more tools such as a multi-cancer detection test that could aid in detection of multiple<br \/>cancers and faster diagnostic resolution of nonspecific s\/sx. Given the impact of delayed cancer dx and timely treatment on outcomes, such a test could potentially substantially improve cancer care and diagnostic evaluations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Diagnosis,Cancer progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher Benton<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ding He<sup>2<\/sup>, Karen Todoroff<sup>2<\/sup>, Marie  V.

However, relatively little is known about cryptococcal infection in people with hematological disorders.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We developed a retrospective cohort study that includes hematological patients who had cryptococcosis infection seen in the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas between 2007 and 2017.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> During the 11-year study period, a total of 21 cases of cryptococcosis ( incidence rate of 13,4 per 1000 hematological malignancies). The time of diagnosis of cryptococcosis since hematologic malignancy diagnosis was 42 (18-161) days. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was the most frequent malignancy (47.6%), followed by leukemias (23.8%), multiple myeloma in (19.1%), and HL (9.5%). Three cases of adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma associated with HTLV-1 infection were identified in the NHL. Cryptococcemia was the most frequent diagnosis (85.7%) followed by pulmonary (52.4%) and CNS (38.1%) involvement. Regarding clinical presentation, f ever was the most common symptom in meningeal cryptococcosis (76.2%) and dyspnea in pulmonary cryptococcosis (61.9%). The use of immunosuppressant chemotherapy within a month before the diagnosis of cryptococcosis was the most common risk factor.

The study objectives were to describe patient characteristics and treatment patterns in this context and assess corresponding clinical outcomes in the US real-world setting.<br \/>Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of data sourced from Flatiron&#8217;s de-identified database, which included electronic health records and curated cancer data from approximately 280 US cancer clinics (~800 US sites of care). The index line of therapy (LOT) was defined as initiation of a new treatment regimen after osimertinib and PBC. Adults were eligible for inclusion if they: 1) were diagnosed with a\/mNSCLC on or after January 1, 2011; 2) had evidence of an activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 or L858R); 3) initiated a new LOT between November 13, 2015, and June 30, 2021, after treatment with osimertinib and PBC. Treatment regimens in the index LOT were summarized, and real-world overall survival (rwOS, defined as the time from initiation of index LOT to death) and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS, defined as the time from initiation of index LOT to disease progression or death) were assessed.<br \/>Results: Among 273 study patients included, the majority were &#8805;65 years (57%), female (67%), Caucasian (65%; Asian, 17%; Black or African American, 6%), with no history of smoking (58%), performance status 0-1 (82%), and &#62;2 prior LOT (64%). Median follow-up duration was 7.3 months. Index treatment regimens were classified as tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) monotherapy (15%) or TKI in combination with non-immuno-oncologic agents (12%), non-platinum-based chemotherapy (23%), immuno-oncologic monotherapy (17%) or combination therapy (15%), PBC (12%), a regimen containing a clinical study drug (4%), or other NSCLC therapy (1%). Deaths occurred in 203 patients (74%) during follow-up; median rwOS was 8.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.4-9.8). Real-world progression occurred in 235 patients (86%); median rwPFS was 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.8-4.4).<br \/>Conclusions: For patients with EGFRm a\/mNSCLC, third-generation EGFR TKIs such as osimertinib can provide disease control, however progression is common. After disease progression, chemotherapy is often the next treatment of choice. Results of this real-world study show that treatment patterns after EGFR TKI and PBC are highly variable and suggest poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the need for more efficacious treatments among patients with previously treated a\/mNSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jyoti  D.

At the median follow-up of 4.5 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) from second-line ramucirumab plus paclitaxel commencement was 2.7 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-3.7); 6.9 months (95% CI, not calculated) in the first nivolumab plus chemotherapy responders(n=7), and 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6-3.0) in non-responders(n=15) (p=0.232). At the time of data cutoff, 6 patients continued to receive ramucirumab plus paclitaxel and the median OS was 6.3 months (95% CI, 4.9-7.7).<br \/>Conclusions: This analysis showed that ramucirumab plus paclitaxel as 2nd line therapy was not sufficient in AGC patients after the failure for nivolumab plus chemotherapy. The new innovative 2nd line therapy might be needed in AGC patients after nivolumab plus chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor,Paclitaxel,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Youngkyung Jeon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sun Young Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Jaeyeon Jang<sup><\/sup>, Ye Ji Jung<sup><\/sup>, Daeho Choi<sup><\/sup>, Joohyun Hong<sup><\/sup>, Seung Tae Kim<sup><\/sup>, Won ki Kang<sup><\/sup>, Jeeyun Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4ed6fb38-e370-45f4-9dc6-f1ccc17b940d","ControlNumber":"2802","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, predictive factors for early relapse during durvalumab maintenance were not identified.<br \/>Patients and Methods: The present study used the lung cancer cohort of the Catholic Medical Centers at the Catholic University of Korea from 2018 to 2021. In all, 51 NSCLC patients that were treated with durvalumab consolidation therapy after definitive CCRT. Early relapse was considered if it occurred within 6 months of starting initial durvalumab therapy.<br \/>Results: During study period, 15 (29.4%) relapsed among 51 included patients. Median time from initial therapy of durvalumab to progression was 107.73 &#177; 47.69 days in early relapse group. In mutivariate analysis, younger age (HR 0.713, 95% CI 0.572-0.888, <i>P<\/i>=0.003), higher pack years (HR 1.311, 95% CI 1.109-1.549, <i>P<\/i>=0.001), non-COPD (HR 0.030, 95% CI 0.001-0.677, <i>P<\/i>=0.027), anemia (HR 23.30, 95% CI 2.030-267.48, <i>P<\/i>=0.011) and stage IIIC (vs. stage IIIA) (HR 17.890, 95% CI 1.997-160.243, <i>P<\/i>=0.010) were independent predictive factors for early relapse during durvalumab consolidation therapy.<br \/>Conclusion: Younger age, higher pack years, non-COPD, anemia and stage IIIC were independent predictive factors for early relapse during durvalumab consolidation therapy in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC after definitive CCRT.
