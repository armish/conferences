[{"Abstract":"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor. Based on tumor stage and histological features, 50% of NBs are classified as high-risk diseases, a subtype characterized by a quite unsatisfactory long-term survival even with the striking advances in NB management that have been achieved in the past decades. Cyclooxygenase-2\/prostaglandin E2 (COX-2\/PGE<sub>2<\/sub>) cascade has been reported to foster a proinflammatory tumor-nourishing microenvironment in NB. However, the specific downstream PGE2 receptor (EP) subtype which directly mediates this tumor promoting effect remains elusive. Therefore, in our research, we aim to 1) elucidate the culprit EP receptor that is directly involved in NB development; 2) evaluate the feasibility of inhibiting the PGE<sub>2<\/sub> receptor subtype as a novel treatment strategy for high-risk NB. To start with, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of the COX2\/PGE<sub>2<\/sub>\/EP pathway from four major NB datasets (Versteeg, Kocak, SEQC, and NRC) on R2 platform. It indicates that the COX-2\/PGE<sub>2<\/sub>\/EP2 signaling axis is highly associated with the expression of high-risk NB markers, as well as an abysmal overall survival rate. Moreover, a time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) method was adopted to reveal that EP2 receptor is the key G&#945;s-coupled receptor that mediates PGE2-initiated cAMP signaling in high-risk NB cell lines. Genetic interference of EP2 receptor expression by CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated genome editing and doxycycline induced conditional knockdown significantly inhibited high-risk NB development and progression both in neuro-sphere formation assay and in nude mice xenograft models. Finally, we tested the anti-NB efficacy of our recently developed selective and bioavailable small-molecule EP2 antagonists. With a consecutive treatment of three weeks, decreased tumor size and weight have been observed in both high-risk NB xenograft model and immunocompetent allograft model, simultaneously with decreased inflammation, angiogenesis, and enhanced apoptosis. Collectively, our results suggest that the PGE2\/EP2 pathway contributes to the growth and malignant potential of high-risk NB; pharmacological inhibition on EP2 receptor by our drug-like compounds might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for this deadly pediatric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Inflammation,Antagonist,PGE2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ruida Hou<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ying Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Jun Yang<sup>3<\/sup>, Jianxiong Jiang<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN,<sup>2<\/sup>Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN,<sup>3<\/sup>Surgery, St. Jude Children`s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7795d1c3-d1dc-436d-9267-5e012ac99243","ControlNumber":"150","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

There is an urgent need for improved medical therapies. The topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan has been investigated and used in the treatment of GBM for over 20 years. Clinical trials investigating irinotecan as monotherapy and in combination with temozolomide and bevacizumab have failed to show an overall survival benefit for newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM. Consequently, irinotecan is not commonly recommended for GBM treatment. However, these trials were conducted prior to the advent of molecularly-guided GBM subtyping, which is now a cornerstone of glioma diagnostics according to the updated WHO 2021 classification. To understand the extent to which molecularly-defined glioma subgroups differentially respond to clinically relevant therapies, we investigated the sensitivity of GBM patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) against a panel of chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide, bevacizumab, and irinotecan. All GBM PDXs (n=9) were responsive to irinotecan when grown as subcutaneous tumors. Two PDX lines exhibited hypersensitivity to irinotecan, which was marked by treatment-induced regression of subcutaneous tumors and increased median survival of 61 and 90+ days. Molecular analyses revealed that these hypersensitive lines were both ATRX-deficient tumors that displayed the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype, while the less sensitive lines were all ATRX-intact and demonstrated <i>TERT<\/i> activation. One of the hypersensitive lines was IDH1<sup>R132H\/WT<\/sup> while the other was IDH1<sup>R132H\/-<\/sup> (historically termed secondary GBM; grade 4 astrocytoma per 2021 WHO classification). Cell-based studies showed that irinotecan sensitivity did not correlate with D-2HG producing capacity of the cells and was not impacted by inhibition of the mutant IDH1 enzyme. Irinotecan treatment significantly prolonged survival of orthotopic ALT+ PDXs relative to a vehicle control (64 days versus 41.5 days median survival). These results suggest that ALT+ gliomas may be particularly sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitor therapy. Our study highlights the need to interpret glioma clinical trial results in light of key molecular biomarkers, including indicators of ALT activity (e.g. ATRX deficiency, ultrabright telomeric foci, and C-circles). In addition, our results suggest that ALT-related biomarkers may be useful for identifying glioma patients who may benefit from topoisomerase inhibitor therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-09 Topoisomerases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Biomarkers,Telomeres,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Stephen  T.

Recent studies estimate that over 1.4 million males are diagnosed with prostate cancer on an annual basis, with approximately 375 000 succumbing to the disease annually. With current treatments continuing to show severe side effects, there is a need for new treatments. In this study we looked at the effect of <i>cannabis sativa <\/i>extract, cannabidiol and cisplatin on prostate cancer cells, PC3.<br \/>Methods: In addressing the above questions, we employed the MTT assay to measure the antiproliferative effect on PC3 cells following treatment with varying concentrations of <i>Cannabis sativa <\/i>extract, cisplatin and cannabidiol. xCELLigence was also used to confirm the IC50 activity in which cells were grown in a 16 well plate coated with gold and monitor cell attachment. Caspase 3\/7 activity was also measured using 96 well-plate following treatment. Western-blot and qRT-PCR was also used to measure the gene expression of tumor suppressor genes, p53, Bax and Bcl2. Animal studies were employed to measure the growth of PC3-mouse derived cancer to evaluate the effect of compounds <i>in vivo <\/i>.<br \/>Results: From the treatment with varying concentrations of <i>Cannabis sativa <\/i>extract, cannabidiol and cisplatin, we have observed that the three compounds induced antiproliferation of PC3 cancer cell lines through the activation of caspase 3\/7 activity. We also observed induction of apoptosis in these cells following silencing of retinoblastoma binding protein 6 (RBBP6), with upregulation of p53 and bax mRNA expression, and a reduction in Bcl2 gene expression. The growth of tumors in the mouse models were reduced following treatment with cisplatin and cannabidiol.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrated that cannabidiol is a viable therapy to treat prostate cancer cells, in combination with silencing of RBBP6. This suggests that cannabidiol rather <i>Cannabis sativa <\/i>extract may play an important role in reducing cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,cannabidiol,THC,silencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lesetja Raymond Motadi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zodwa  E.

Mutations (mut) in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha<i> <\/i>(<i>PIK3CA<\/i>) gene encoding PI3K&#945; have been reported in 12%-39% of HER2+ BCs and associated with worse prognoses and lower pathological complete response to anti-HER2 tx in the neoadjuvant setting. Alpelisib (ALP) is an oral, &#945;-specific PI3K inhibitor approved at 300 mg per day (QD) in combination with fulvestrant in hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2&#8722;, <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mut ABC following progression on\/after endocrine therapy. EPIK-B2 is a 2-part Phase 3 study to evaluate ALP plus T+P as 1L maintenance tx in pts with HER2+, <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mut ABC, without progressive disease at study entry. Here, we report results of Part 1, the safety run-in of EPIK-B2.<br \/>Methods: Part 1 of EPIK-B2 was open label and assessed safety of ALP plus T+P in pts with HER2+ ABC and confirmed the recommended Phase 3 dose of ALP for the randomized Part 2. Pts with HER2+ ABC, with or without a <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mut, who had completed induction taxane chemotherapy plus T+P were eligible for Part 1. Part 2, currently enrolling, allows only <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mut pts. Pts in Part 1 received 300 mg (Cohort A) or 250 mg (Cohort B) ALP QD plus 6 mg\/kg T and 420 mg P, on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint of Part 1 was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first 6 wk of tx; secondary endpoints included safety\/tolerability and ALP exposure by dose level. Preliminary confirmed overall response rate (ORR; best overall response [BOR] of CR\/PR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR; BOR of CR\/PR\/SD lasting &#8805;24 wk) were evaluated per RECIST v1.1 during the on-treatment period.<br \/>Results: Three pts in Cohort A and 12 in Cohort B received 300 mg and 250 mg ALP, respectively. DLTs, 1 event each of hyperglycemia and dermatitis acneiform, were seen in Cohort A, none were reported in Cohort B pts given 250 mg ALP; however, Part 2 of EPIK-B2 will be initiated with 200 mg ALP with the option of intrapatient dose escalation to 250 mg QD, the maximum tolerated dose, per FDA feedback to consider a lower toxicity threshold in 1L maintenance setting. No unexpected AEs were reported; most common AEs were diarrhea, decreased appetite, and hyperglycemia. Six of 15 pts (40%; 2 in Cohort A, 4 in Cohort B) had <i>PIK3CA-<\/i>mut disease. Among these, ORR was 50% (n\/N=3\/6) and CBR was 100% (n\/N=6\/6). Tumor response was maintained in 5 of 6 pts with <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations (83%) after &#8805;21 cycles of tx (range, 21-31).<br \/>Conclusions: ALP plus T+P combination is safe; reported AEs align with those in previous ALP studies.

Secondary MAPK activation is a known resistance mechanism to approved BRAF inhibitors in BRAFV600 melanoma. While BRAF inhibitors are approved for Class I BRAFV600 melanomas, patients with dimer-driven BRAF Class II\/III and RAF1-dependent NRAS activated melanomas lack approved targeted therapy. Development of next-gen pan-RAF inhibitors targeting all RAF proteins and mutant dimers remains a priority. Emerging clinical data from pan-RAF inhibitors combined with MEK inhibitors suggests increased benefit for MAPK-altered melanoma patients. Exarafenib (KIN-2787) is a clinical stage, novel, highly selective pan-RAF inhibitor designed to be effective in RAF-dependent cancers.Methods: KIN-2787 was evaluated using enzyme assays across the human kinome and activity against oncogenic RAF alterations were validated in BaF3 cells. MAPK pathway suppression and cell growth inhibition were assessed across a panel of human tumor cell lines. Combination dose matrices were performed with KIN-2787 and binimetinib (bini) to evaluate synergistic cell growth inhibition. Extended cell growth studies were performed by Incucyte. In vivo KIN-2787 efficacy was evaluated in cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human BRAF and NRAS mutant cancer.Results: Exarafenib demonstrated exceptional kinome selectivity with minimal off-target kinases significantly inhibited relative to BRAF. Exarafenib potently inhibited a broad panel of oncogenic BRAF mutations in biochemical and BaF3 cell assays. Functional MAPK signaling and viability studies in human tumor cell lines highlighted exarafenib activity in BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma with minimal activity in normal (BRAF WT) cells. Synergy with the MEK inhibitor bini was determined and the exarafenib + bini combination durably inhibited growth in NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines. In line with cellular studies, treatment with exarafenib demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition at 30 mg\/kg BID in CDX and PDX models of human NRAS mutant melanoma. 10 mg\/kg BID exarafenib combined with a clinically relevant dose of bini resulted in combination benefit and durable suppression of the MAPK pathway, relative to either agent alone.Conclusions: The superior kinome selectivity of exarafenib and its activity across multiple RAF-dependent melanoma models position it as a potentially class-leading pan-RAF inhibitor. In addition to efficacy in BRAF mutant tumors, these data support use of exarafenib in combination therapy with MEK inhibitors in NRAS mutant melanoma. A Ph I dose escalation clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of exarafenib in monotherapy and in combination with binimetinib is ongoing (NCT04913285).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RAF kinase,Melanoma\/skin cancers,BRAF,Ras,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tim  S.

Loss of PTEN function and PIK3CA activating mutations are especially frequent in endometrial cancer (EC). Targeting the PAM pathway, in combination with other cooperative oncogenic pathways (e.g., the estrogen pathway), is a promising EC treatment strategy. Currently, everolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor, in combination with letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, is one of the available hormonal therapy options for patients with advanced endometrioid EC. Most PAM inhibitors (PAM-i) selectively spare (or weakly inhibit) one or more key PAM pathway components, which can lead to drug resistance. To minimize drug resistance, a more comprehensive inhibition of the PI3K isoforms and downstream mTOR complexes may be required. We hypothesized that gedatolisib, which potently inhibits all Class I PI3K isoforms, mTORC1, and mTORC2, can potentially be an effective and well tolerated therapy for patients with EC.<br \/>Methods: A panel of endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer cell lines with different PI3K pathway mutational status were assayed for their sensitivity to gedatolisib and other PAM inhibitors (PI3K-&#945;: alpelisib, pan-PI3K: copanlisib; AKT: capivasertib; mTORC1: everolimus; pan-PI3K\/mTOR: gedatolisib). Cell viability, cell proliferation, and flow cytometry analytical assays were conducted. Xenograft studies evaluating gedatolisib in EC cell lines were also performed.<br \/>Results: Gedatolisib strongly inhibited PAM pathway activation, and reduced cell cycle progression and cell viability in the endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer cell lines. Compared to the other PAM-i, Gedatolisib exhibited superior anti-proliferative potency and efficacy in almost all the cell lines tested, regardless of the PI3K pathway mutational status or cancer type. In EC xenografts, gedatolisib substantively inhibited tumor growth irrespective of the cell line models&#8217; PI3K pathway mutational status.<br \/>Conclusions: We demonstrated that, gedatolisib induces superior anti-proliferative activity compared to the other PAM pathway inhibitors, regardless of the PI3K pathway mutational status of the cancer cell lines evaluated. Gedatolisib as a single agent and in combination with other therapies has previously reported promising preliminary clinical efficacy and safety in various solid tumor types, including EC. In summary, nonclinical and preliminary clinical data supports the development of gedatolisib in combination with hormonal therapy for treatment of patients with EC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,PI3K,mTOR,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stefano Rossetti<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aaron Broege<sup><\/sup>, Ian MacNeil<sup><\/sup>, Ben Rich<sup><\/sup>, Jhomary Molden<sup><\/sup>, Brian Sullivan<sup><\/sup>, Lance Laing<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Celcuity, Minneapolis, MN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d1770698-9168-49d9-8a6b-810a25beda86","ControlNumber":"2314","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

ICX-101 is a novel potent, selective small molecule that directly inhibits the binding of MYC\/MAX dimers to the DNA binding sequence E-box. Here, we show that ICX-101 shows antitumor activity in patient-derived cells (PDC) of advanced lung cancer and that the drug responses are correlated with the MYC expression levels.<br \/>Methods: PDCs of lung cancer were treated with ICX-101, and the area under the dose-response curve (AUC) was measured as the readout for antitumor efficacy. MYC expression level of each PDC was measured with the fold expression of mRNA compared to the normal lung tissue. The patient&#8217;s clinical data and survival outcomes were analyzed to correlate with the drug responses of PDCs.<br \/>Results: We collected 100 PDCs from 82 lung cancer patients. The histologic types included adenocarcinoma (N = 82), squamous cell carcinoma (N = 10), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not otherwise specified (NOS) (N = 4), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC, N = 4). PDCs derived from SCLC showed higher MYC expression levels than NSCLC (P = 0.004). MYC was a prognostic factor, as the patient groups with the top and bottom 25 percentiles of MYC mRNA expression had an overall survival of 932.5 and 256 days, respectively (P = 0.029). However, MYC expression was predictive for the response to ICX-101, as the PDCs with the top 25 percentiles of MYC levels showed markedly lower AUC values than those with the bottom 25 percentile (P &#60; 0.001). Additionally, the MYC mRNA levels and AUC values were inversely correlated with statistical significance (R = -0.46, P &#60; 0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: ICX-101 is a potent MYC inhibitor that shows antitumor activity in lung cancer PDCs. Our results suggest the potential of ICX-101 as a possible therapeutic option in advanced lung cancer with high MYC expressions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Myc,Small molecule drugs,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wonyoung Choi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kyung-Chae Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Seog-Yun Park<sup><\/sup>, Sunshin Kim<sup><\/sup>, Eun Hye Kang<sup><\/sup>, Mihwa Hwang<sup><\/sup>, Ji-Youn Han<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"93e52ca6-0c7d-4d52-ad1c-b56624014e12","ControlNumber":"2578","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

There are also examples of proteins with structural and\/or charge distribution analogies with respect to the DNA double helix which allow them to interfere with other DNA-binding proteins and modulate the biological processes in which they are involved. We previously characterized a new class of DNA-surface mimic molecules constituted by repetitions of dimeric units of 8-amino-2-quinolinecarboxylic acid (Q) and 8-aminomethyl-2-quinolinecarboxylic acid (mQ). The helical folding of these entities can mimic a B-DNA molecule, displaying a minor and a major groove that can be modulated depending on the dimers and of the nature of their side chains. In vitro, these DNA mimics could inhibit, in a relative selective manner, the catalytic activity of DNA topoisomerase I (Top1), whereas they had no effect on the activity of DNA polymerases or DNAses. Inhibition of Top1-mediated relaxation of supercoiled DNA plasmid increased with the length of the DNA mimics. Here, we further characterized the mechanism of Top1 inhibition by these DNA mimics. We found that, conversely to camptothecin (CPT) and its derivatives that poison Top1 via the inhibition or the re-ligation step of the reaction, DNA mimics inhibited Top1-mediated DNA cleavage <i>in vitro<\/i> by preventing the binding of the enzyme to its substrate, a mechanism of Top1 competitive inhibition that was formerly referred to as catalytic inhibition. We also found that co-incubation of DNA mimics with CPT had an additive effect on the inhibition of Top1-mediated relaxation of supercoiled DNA, further suggesting a mechanism that is different from CPT. Because transfection of DNA mimics could inhibit the growth of various cancer cell lines, we further investigated whether Top1 could play a role in this cytotoxicity. We found that Top1 knock-down in OVCAR4 ovarian cancer cells resulted in decreased sensitivity to the (mQQ4)8 DNA mimic as compared to OVCAR4 control cells, suggesting that Top1 is a target of DNA mimics in cells and is involved in their cytotoxic effects. Conversely to CPT, transfection of HCT116 cells with the (mQQ4)8 DNA mimic was not associated with an increase in &#947;H2AX, suggesting that DNA mimics do not induce DNA breakage. We are currently analyzing whether the (mQQ4)8 can have an impact on CPT-induced Top1-DNA complexes formation. Interestingly, we also showed that several SN38-resistant HCT116 cell clones characterized by specific Top1 mutations were still sensitive to the (mQQ4)8 DNA mimic. Together our results demonstrate that DNA mimics can be considered as a new class of competitive inhibitors of Top1. Further studies are ongoing to identify the structural features that are essential for Top1 inhibition in order to generate more potent derivatives that could be used to counteract resistance to CPT derivatives used in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-09 Topoisomerases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Topoisomerase I,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,DNA mimics,foldamers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Aurélie Garcin<sup>1<\/sup>, Valentina Corvaglia<sup>2<\/sup>, Madeleine Bossaert<sup>3<\/sup>, Marie-Jeanne Pillaire<sup>3<\/sup>, Ivan Huc<sup>2<\/sup>, Sébastien Britton<sup>3<\/sup>, Vincent Parissi<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Philippe Pourquier<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>INSERM U1194 - IRCM (Montpellier), Montpellier, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pharmacy and Center for Integrated Protein Science, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Institut de Pharmacologie et Biologie Structurale, IPBS - CNRS, Toulouse, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Laboratoire de Microbiologie Fondamentale et Pathogénicité (MFP) UMR 5234 CNRS, Bordeaux, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0677e2a8-10f4-45b4-a396-49c3d480fe0e","ControlNumber":"3042","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

To clear this, we have aimed to identify putative receptor(s) to the extracellularly secreted REIC protein, and have fortunately succeeded to identify five candidates.

Late diagnosis may result in metastasis. When metastasis occurs, cancer can no longer be removed with surgery and therefore, requires treatment with FDA approved chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy and they often fail to treat the disease. KB-S is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue which is broadly used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In this work, we explored the therapeutic potential of KB-S as an anticancer drug, with focused against pancreatic cancer. Our aim is to establish a connection between cellular kinase of KB-S and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) to decipher signaling pathways. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ASPC-1 cell line was used for the study. Hemocytometer was used for cell counting for the dose response curve after treating with KB-S. Immunoprecipitation study was conducted using anti-PKC-iota beads. Western blot assay was performed using primary antibody PKC-zeta and a secondary antibody. Our results showed that KB-S decreases cell proliferation significantly on AsPC-1 cells over increasing the concentrations. KB-S decreased the proliferation by 20% for 0.5 &#181;M (P&#8804; 0.09), 37% for 5 &#181;M (P&#8804; 0.02), 44% for 10 &#181;M (P&#8804; 0.01), 48% for 20 &#181;M (P&#8804; 0.002) and 54% for 50 &#181;M (P&#8804; 0.001) in AsPC-1 cells. We used the lowest concentration of 10 &#181;M with significant inhibition for further experiments. We immunoprecipitated for PKC-&#953; and immunoblotted for PKC-&#950; and the immunoblots showed that there is no association between PKC-&#953; and PKC-&#950; in pancreatic cancer cell line (AsPC-1). But when we performed reverse immunoprecipitation, we found that there is an association between PKC-&#953; and PKC-&#950;. Again, we immunoprecipitated for thymidine kinase and immunoblotted for PKC-&#953; and immunoblots showed that there is an association between thymidine kinase and PKC-&#953;. But when we did the reverse immunoprecipitation, we did not find any association between thymidine kinase and PKC-&#953; in pancreatic cancer cell line. Based on our preliminary studies, we report the anti-cancer effect of KB-S in treating a pancreatic cancer cell line leading to further future investigations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of therapeutic efficacy of KB-S against a cancer. Given that, KB-S is already approved by FDA for the treatment of HIV, it carries the potential to be repurposed for difficult to cure cancerous diseases such as pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sadia Noosrat Boshra<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kirpal Bisht<sup><\/sup>, Mildred Acevedo-Duncan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d5c69ccd-5a45-4e74-bfb9-9b6a5a946648","ControlNumber":"3213","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Duvelisib potently inhibits PI3K-&#948; and PI3K-&#947;, thereby offering a novel therapeutic approach. Here we aimed to understand how duvelisib targets CLL cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) and hence how it affects CLL, even with BTK-resistant disease.<br \/>We first assessed the distinct contributions of PI3K-&#948; and PI3K-&#947; on CLL cell survival, proliferation, and migration<i> in vitro<\/i> by using PI3K-&#948; (PI3K-&#948;i) or PI3K-&#947; (PI3K-&#947;i) specific inhibitors in addition to duvelisib. We found a significant reduction in viable CLL cells after exposure to PI3K-&#948;i and duvelisib. By measuring Ki67 and p-AKT levels, we found duvelisib and PI3K-&#948;i more potently block CLL cell proliferation than PI3K-&#947;i. PI3K-&#948;i and duvelisib also significantly reduced the migration of CLL B cells into the spleen relative to control. In contrast, PI3K-&#947;i inhibited T cell not B cell homing in vitro and in vivo.<br \/>We then investigated the impact of single versus dual inhibitory agents on myeloid cells. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of the &#8220;M2 phenotype&#8221; contribute to a pro-tumor TME by preventing the induction of T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity. We expanded murine bone marrow derived monocytes and then polarized them to M2 macrophages, in the absence or presence of PI3Ki. At 100nM, PI3K-&#947;i, but not PI3K-&#948;i, significantly inhibited M2 polarization. Duvelisib significantly reduced<i> Arg1<\/i> expression at doses equal to or above 10nM. While co-culturing leukemic B cells with M2-polarized murine macrophages increased CLL-cell survival, addition of duvelisib to such co-cultures significantly reduced CLL cell survival. Altogether, duvelisib sensitizes primary CLL cells to apoptosis and abrogates M2 cell-mediated CLL-cell survival.<br \/>Finally, in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model (PDX), we demonstrated the essential roles of PI3K-&#948; and PI3K-&#947; in the CLL TME. Specifically, we found a more efficacious inhibition in CLL cell burden by dual inhibition of PI3K-&#948;,&#947;. Also, samples from patients whose disease progressed on ibrutinib were responsive to duvelisib therapy in PDX, irrespective of<i> BTK<\/i> mutations. In support of this, we identified an ibrutinib resistant CLL patient, with a clone exhibiting<i> BTK<\/i> and<i> PLC&#947;2<\/i> mutations who responded immediately to single agent duvelisib with redistribution lymphocytosis followed by a partial clinical remission associated with subsequent modulation of T and myeloid cells.<br \/>In conclusion, our data define the mechanism of action whereby dual inhibition of PI3K-&#948;,&#947; affects CLL B cell numbers and T and myeloid cell pro-leukemia functions, supporting the use of duvelisib as a potentially valuable therapeutic intervention, including for patients refractory to BTKi.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,PI3K,Tumor microenvironment,Ibrutinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shih-Shih Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jacqueline C.

Shasqi&#8217;s Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC<sup>TM<\/sup>) platform is pioneering the therapeutic application of click chemistry reactions in humans. The 1<sup>st<\/sup> gen CAPAC technology enables activation of potent anti-cancer agents at the tumor site while reducing systemic exposure and is comprised of a tetrazine-modified biopolymer (tumor targeting agent) injected intratumorally and a systemically administered trans-cyclooctene-modified payload, named a protodrug. Our lead clinical candidate SQ3370 (SQL70 biopolymer + SQP33, doxorubicin protodrug), is being evaluated in a Phase 2a study in solid tumors (NCT04106492). CAPAC platform is highly modular and can be applied to multiple cancer drugs especially those with narrow therapeutic index(s) due to toxicity. Because the tumor targeting agent (i.e., biopolymer) is separate from the protodrug, it enables the flexibility of interchanging different protodrugs with different mechanism of actions such as tubulin inhibitors (e.g., paclitaxel), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., exatecan), immune activators (e.g., TLR agonists), and others. This benefit can be translated in the clinic with tailored combinations for individual patients. Here we will present data on protodrugs of paclitaxel, exatecan, and TLR7\/8a agonist. These therapeutics have shown considerable safety concerns either alone or in combination with other therapies in the clinic and may benefit from the precise activation at the tumor site that can be achieved by the CAPAC platform. <i>In vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity assays showed &#8805;20 fold-attenuation of both paclitaxel and exatecan protodrugs in various cancer lines. In a proliferation assay using mouse splenocytes we observed &#8805;100-fold attenuation of a TLR7\/8a protodrug. These results suggest that the protodrugs may exhibit higher therapeutic indeces with enhanced safety profile. We tested the anti-tumor efficacy of paclitaxel protodrug in combination with SQL70 biopolymer in NCI-N87 gastric cancer xenograft tumor model. The doses of paclitaxel protodrug were 4x or 10x molar equivalent to the MTD of conventional paclitaxel. We observed significant reduction of tumor growth compared to vehicle (p&#60;0.0001) and minimal body weight loss suggesting enhanced safety profile. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies to determine the safety and efficacy of these protodrugs are ongoing and will be presented. The data presented illustrates how the CAPAC platform is modular and expands the therapeutic window of different cancer therapies to achieve greater effect. This modularity enables the rapid access of therapeutic combinations. Moreover, as the click chemistry activation is independent of biological characteristics of tumors, CAPAC payloads are highly translatable across species and accelerate the path to the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 Platinum complexes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Paclitaxel,TLR7,Prodrugs,Click Chemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>George Coricor<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jesse M.

(marijuana plant). Purified or as a part of cannabis products, the compounds are frequently used by cancer patients to attenuate chemotherapy-induced side effects such as pain, nausea, and vomiting. The presence of cannabis products on the public market expands each year while the illegality status weakens in an increasing number of countries. U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several cannabis-based drugs for seizures induced by Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex, also for the lost appetite of AIDS patients, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oncological patients are further and strongly motivated to take the drugs in combination with chemotherapy by numerous reports demonstrating the anticancer effects of cannabinoids. Nevertheless, here we present unsettling data that cannabis extract together with CBD negatively interferes with worldwide approved platinum-based drugs cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. The phenomenon is proven across three cellular models including primary cells. Even low concentrations of cannabidiol or cannabis extract reduced the toxicity of platinum-based drugs using long-term colony forming assay and\/or short-term crystal violet assay. Increased resistance of cells was also accompanied by decreased cellular stress as evaluated by quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. Most importantly, concomitant cannabidiol and cisplatin exposure results in the decreased presence of cisplatin-modified DNA. Following the information, we determined platinum content in cells by ICP-MS. The experiment uncovered significantly decreased intracellular platinum content indicating an effect on cellular transport. Furthermore, the mechanism is translational independent as shown by the experiment with cycloheximide. This study offers crucial information that patients and physicians should take into account regarding possible interactions between platinum-based drugs and cannabis-based products. Furthermore, the study on the contradictory effects of cannabis products in cancer treatment may be motivated by this project.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 Platinum complexes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cisplatin resistance,DNA damage response,Platinum drugs,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tereza Buchtová<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lucie Beresova<sup><\/sup>, Katarina Chroma<sup><\/sup>, Martin Mistrik<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"31ba74a9-3655-4634-b9a9-b35abb7702ab","ControlNumber":"4262","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

We investigated its antitumor activity in three SCCHN cell lines.<br \/>Methods: Cells: We studied two human tongue cell lines (CAL27; SCC-25) and one pharynx line (FaDu); all HPV-negative and p53-mutant. MTT assays: We utilized MTT assays to evaluate cytotoxicity of CF, cisplatin, and their combination. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> of CF and Combination Index (CI) of varying concentrations of combined CF and cisplatin were calculated. Clonogenic assays: Cells were seeded at low density and after 24 hours, cells were treated with varying concentrations of CF. Plates were incubated for 10 days. The cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet dye and colonies counted. Wound Healing assays: After cells reached 100% confluence, a scratch was created using a 200 &#181;L micropipette. Cells were treated with CF and images were acquired at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-scratch.<br \/>Results: MTT assays: IC<sub>50<\/sub> values as a function of exposure lengths are shown in Table 1. CAL27 was the most sensitive while SCC-25 was the most resistant. In all cell lines, the results of combined CF and cisplatin were complex: at lower doses there was evidence of antagonism, while at higher doses there was synergy. Clonogenic assays: CF significantly inhibited clonogenicity compared to DMSO control (P&#8804; 0.05). The surviving fraction for CF 2.5, 5, and 10 nM were 0.411. 0.151, 0.051, and 0.5, 0.339, 0.102 in CAL27 and SCC-25 cell lines, respectively. Wound Healing assays: Wound closure % after treatment with CF5 was significantly different from DMSO control (P&#8804;0.05). Wound closure % for CF5 were 30.97, 56.75, and 28.03% compared to 94.65, 75.88, and 42.05% for control in CAL27, FaDu, and SCC-25 cell lines, respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: CF exhibits antitumor effects in SCCHN in vitro.

This translocation also sensitizes cells to proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib, which are approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Clinical activity of bortezomib in combination with standard chemotherapy has been documented in several clinical trials of ALL patients, and a case of a single-agent activity against relapsed leukemia driven by the MLL-AF4 translocation has been described. However, toxicities of bortezomib and carfilzomib may be unacceptable to pediatric patients. We found that the overwhelming majority of proteasomes in this subtype of ALL are lymphoid tissue specific immunoproteasomes. Cells with MLL-AF4 translocations were sensitive to pharmacologically relevant concentrations of specific immunoproteasome inhibitors ONX-0914 and M3258. Furthermore, both compounds dramatically delayed growth of orthotopic xenograft tumors in mice. Thus, immunoproteasomes are therapeutic targets in ALL and replacing bortezomib and carfilzomib with immunoproteasome inhibitors in ALL should reduce toxicities associated with inhibition of the proteasomes in non-lymphoid tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-08 Proteasome inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome inhibitors,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Pediatric cancers,Translocation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexei F.

Oncogene addicted tumors are under high levels of stress, both extrinsic as well as intrinsic, and are dependent on a well-balanced ISR to cope with the high metabolic demands for accelerated growth. The ISR is a double edge sword of survival and cell death, and depending on context, activation of the ISR kinase GCN2 can have either cytoprotective or cytotoxic effects. Activation of GCN2 was identified as a resistance mechanism to asparaginase (ASNase) in asparagine synthetase (ASNS)-low leukemic cells and MAPK-driven solid tumors.<sup>1-3<\/sup> The inhibition of GCN2 in the context of ASNase-resistant leukemic cells can be pharmacologically leveraged to induce anti-tumoral effects.<br \/>Methods: Modulation of ISR kinases was characterized using enzymatic assays. Kinome selectivity profiling was determined using enzymatic and cellular assays. ISR pathway modulation was assessed using cellular assays of phospho-GCN2 and ATF4 by Western blot or ELISA under basal, ASNase-treated, or amino acid starvation conditions. Re-sensitization of leukemic cells to ASNase was tested in cell proliferation assays <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo <\/i>compound-mediated<i> <\/i>reversal of ASNase-induced upregulation of tumoral ATF4 was determined in a leukemia PK\/PD xenograft model. Inhibition of tumor growth was determined in leukemia xenograft models <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: DP-9024 was designed as a selective and potent modulator of PERK and GCN2. DP-9024 was found to reverse ASNase-mediated upregulation of ISR readouts (phospho-GCN2 and ATF4) in leukemic cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Additionally, DP-9024-mediated inhibition of GCN2 was found to re-sensitize leukemic cells to ASNase <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i> asparagine depletion by Leunase (L-asparaginase) led to upregulation of ATF4 in leukemia tumors in a PK\/PD xenograft model and oral dosing of DP-9024 reversed Leunase-mediated upregulation of tumoral ATF4 down to basal levels. Importantly, we found that DP-9024-mediated inhibition of GCN2 strongly synergized with ASNase <i>in vivo<\/i>, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth in leukemic xenografts and causing a reversal of ASNase resistance in leukemic tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: The ISR kinase GCN2 was identified as a resistance mechanism to ASNase in ASNS-low leukemic cells. Inhibition of the ISR pathway through the potent and selective small molecule modulator of GCN2, DP-9024, synergized with ASNase and re-sensitized leukemic cells to amino acid withdrawal <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as in leukemic xenograft models <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>References:<br \/>Nakamura et al. 2018.

Despite recent advances in therapies, treatment outcome remains variable and largely defined by genomic abnormalities such as gene fusions, copy number alterations and point mutations. Mutations in epigenic modifiers, nucleophosmin (NPM1c), signaling and kinase pathway such as KMT2A-re-arrangements (KMT2A-r), internal tandem duplication (ITD) insertions in FLT3, and NRAS mutations are amongst the highest alterations in AML patients with a propensity towards poor response to treatment and overall disease outcome. Such limitations impact the ability to achieve long-lasting response to treatment and result in therapy-induced resistance eventually leading to relapse. Combinatorial strategies are required to combat resistance and maximize duration of antitumor activity.<br \/>BCL2 and MEK blockade in combination with menin and\/or FLT3 inhibitors potentiates an improved therapeutic strategy to achieve increased antitumor activity and overcome AML resistance. Here we explored the use of our clinical-stage covalent menin inhibitor, BMF-219, and BMF-500, a covalent FLT3 inhibitor, in combination with each other and in combination with BCL2 and MEK inhibitors in MV-4-11 and MOLM-13 cell lines for 4-days, then viability was measured using CellTiter Glo.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><br \/>BMF-219 and BMF-500 as single agents induce effective antitumor activity on MOLM-13 and MV-4-11 cells lines. When dosed in combination, BMF-219 and BMF-500 show beneficial effects affording higher cell killing at lower concentrations. Repeated experiments revealed patterns of increased cell killing is achieved when trametinib, MEK inhibitor, and venetoclax, BCL2 inhibitor, are combined with BMF-219 treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b><br \/>Collectively, our studies demonstrate the utility of combination strategies to achieve higher antileukemic cell killing with reduced concentrations of menin and FLT3 covalent inhibitors. Additionally, we show benefit of combinatorial approaches of menin and FLT3 covalent inhibitors with MEK and BCL2 blockade. These data provide initial pre-clinical evidence for combining pathway specific inhibitors as a promising therapeutic strategy for further investigation in acute leukemia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"FLT3,Acute myeloid leukemia,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Brian Law<sup><\/sup>, <b>Daniel Lu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mini Balakrishnan<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Butler<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biomea Fusion, Inc., Redwood City, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b5d969df-8be9-44a8-b262-9917413e8823","ControlNumber":"5700","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

The standard treatment for OSCC generally consists of surgery combined with radiotherapy or chemotherapy; however, the overall survival rates have not improved, and only ~50% of patients survive the disease. Therefore, identifying and validating new drug targets can provide new therapeutic options for improved treatment and better prognosis for OSCC patients. The present study aimed to develop an organoid model from patient-isolated primary tumour cells and determine their drug sensitivity profile coupled with mutational analysis. New combinations of targeted drugs with synergistic activity in oral cancer cells were identified through high-throughput screening followed by validation of their activity in oral cancer cells in 2D monolayer and 3D organoid cultures. Results indicate a synergistic activity of proteasome (PR-171) and survivin (YM155) inhibitors in all tested patient-derived tumour cells and four oral cancer cell lines. Moreover, chitosan-based nanocapsules harboring these drugs showed therapeutic efficacy comparable to free drug combinations, indicating a potential for efficient and targeted delivery. Next-generation sequencing data identified missense mutations in eleven cancer-related genes that encode BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, MEK1, PIK3CA, PTEN, NOTCH1, TP53 and TERT. The ongoing research aims to correlate the drug sensitivity data with the mutational profile of patient-derived tumour cells to find novel targets.

Our goal is to develop a small molecule inhibitor targeting RPN13 protein in the 19S proteasome complex as a new drug for GBM. RPN13 is a proteasome ubiquitin receptor that recognizes ubiquitin-conjugated proteins that are thus tagged for degradation via the 20S proteasome enzymatic complex. GBM is highly sensitive to proteasome inhibition due to its aggressive growth and accumulation of misfolded polyubiquitinated proteins that is insufficiently managed despite increased proteasome levels and enhanced proteasome activity (i.e. proteotoxic stress). Up Therapeutics judiciously designed drug-like RPN13 inhibitors to overcome limitations in the prototype RPN13 inhibitor RA190 identified at Johns Hopkins University. We selected Up284 as lead compound based upon our preliminary studies showing drug-like characteristics, specificity (binding to Cys88 of RPN13), and proteasome inhibition that produces a cytotoxic accumulation of polyUb proteins, ER stress, and reactive oxygen species. Up284 treatment selectively triggers apoptosis in solid tumor types including GBM cell lines and oncospheres. A suitable Up284 formulation was selected by measuring aqueous solubility, stability and on-target activity in mice imaged using a proteasome-dependent in vivo reporter. Up284 can be administered i.v. or orally, and it penetrates through the BBB. As a proof of concept for treatment of GBM, Up284 demonstrated on-target activity in intracranial syngeneic GL261 tumor model by inhibiting proteasome function in tumor tissues. Up284 also well tolerated and regressed tumors in syngeneic, xenograft and spontaneous models of ovarian and breast cancers with acceptable safety profile. Up284 also synergize with current frontline chemotherapeutics and can be used as a single agent or in combination for the treatment of wide range of cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-08 Proteasome inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yung-Nien Chang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ravi  K.

There are three subtypes of breast cancer based on receptor profiles, with the third subtype being triple-negative breast cancer. TNBC accounts for about 10-15% of all breast cancers. The TNBC subtype lacks estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors; it is associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. This type of cancer has poor prognosis, tends to be more aggressive, and has limited treatment options compared to the other two subtypes. Heme is an essential molecule in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS generation causes oxidative stress and induces DNA damage in breast cancer. Therefore, targeting its activity potentially suppresses TNBC tumors. Heme-sequestering protein 2 (HeSP2) binds and sequesters heme. It has been shown that HeSP2 treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation. Moreover, HeSP2 suppresses tumor growth in subcutaneously implanted TNBC MDA-MB-231 xenografts in NOD\/SCID mice. Furthermore, in vitro studies using murine TNBC cell models 4T1-fluc Neo and EMT6-fluc Puro cells have also shown that cell proliferation and colony formation were inhibited after HeSP2 treatments of increasing concentrations. Thus, these results encourage the potential use of HeSP2 for breast tumor suppression. To further explore the effects of heme targeting and sequestration, we will determine heme flux in TNBC cell models by measuring the levels of heme uptake, export, synthesis, and degradation. Moreover, we will examine mitochondrial markers for OXPHOS complexes in HeSP2 treated TNBC xenografts using immunohistochemical analysis. Further studies are still underway to understand the role of heme in breast cancer, with preliminary results indicating that heme targeting, and sequestration effectively suppress triple-negative breast cancer and its progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Mitochondria,Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eranda Berisha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Maria del Carmen Chacon Castro<sup><\/sup>, Adnin Ashrafi<sup><\/sup>, Narges Salamat<sup><\/sup>, Parinaz Sadat Alemi<sup><\/sup>, Li Zhang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT Dallas, Richardson, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"41c27e53-6937-43dd-9d37-7a754b565bde","ControlNumber":"6799","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

Inhibition of tubulin polymerization, a popular mechanism of action for anti-cancer activities, will be activated once the inhibitor interacts with the colchicine binding site. We have previously developed and reported a potent tubulin inhibitor (SB-216). One of its derivatives, the compound SP-1-39, a pyrimidine dihydroquinoxalinone derivative, has been recently designed to further improve the potency and therapeutic properties. Here, we examined the impact of SP-1-39 on preclinical prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo. EBI competition assay confirmed that SP-1-39 binds to colchicine-binding site and inhibits the formation of EBI:&#946;-tubulin adduct. The anti-proliferation abilities of SP-1-39 was tested against melanoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines by MTS assay, and defined IC50 values of 0.2-4 nmol\/L. Other in vitro results showed SP-1-39 disrupted microtubule network, induced cell cycle arrest at G2\/M phase, and caused apoptosis in paclitaxel-resistant human prostate cancer cells (PC-3\/TxR). For in vivo study, 2.5mg\/kg SP-1-39 significantly attenuated tumor growth in PC-3\/TxR xenograft mouse model, inhibited angiogenesis, and overcame taxane resistance. Our findings demonstrate the preclinical therapeutic efficacy and safety of SP-1-39, and provide support for further exploration of novel tubulin inhibitors as anti-cancer agent for cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Chemotherapy,Prostate cancer,Antitumor activity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rui Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kelli  L.

As such, cancers are fully reliant on increased polyamine pools maintained through dysregulation of polyamine metabolism. Pharmaceutical modulation of polyamine metabolism is a promising avenue in cancer therapeutics and has been attempted with enzyme inhibitors, including DFMO (difluoromethylornithine), and polyamine analogues. Ivospemin is a spermine analogue that has shown efficacy in slowing pancreatic and ovarian tumor progression both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>and demonstrated encouraging results in pancreatic cancer clinical trials. We have shown that ivospemin decreases polyamine content through depression of the activity of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in a variety of cancer cell lines. Treatment of the VDID8<sup>+<\/sup> murine ovarian cancer model with ivospemin resulted in a marked increase in survival. Here we examine the potential of combining ivospemin and chemotherapeutic agents that are used to treat cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer. Treatment with gemcitabine, topotecan, and doxorubicin increased the <i>in vitro<\/i> toxicity of ivospemin, while paclitaxel and docetaxel did not have any added benefit over ivospemin alone. Using the VDID8<sup>+<\/sup> model, we further evaluated the efficacy of ivospemin in combination with gemcitabine, topotecan, and doxorubicin <i>in vivo<\/i>. Ascites fluid was used as a marker of tumor burden and evaluated for polyamine content. Addition of ivospemin improved the survival of mice treated with any of the three chemotherapeutics. The ivospemin and doxorubicin combination mice had the greatest median survival time; this combination is being further evaluated in mechanistic studies and additional murine studies. Ovarian cancers have extremely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) and metabolic reprogramming of the TME to reduce immunosuppressive phenotypes is a promising approach for treatment. Sustained elevation of polyamine levels supports an immunosuppressive TME, and evidence suggests that pharmacologic depletion of polyamines may reduce immunosuppressive phenotypes. DFMO treatment in the immunosuppressive VDID8<sup>+<\/sup> model influences the immune cells of the TME, and we therefore are investigating the combination of ivospemin and DFMO in ovarian cancer. In addition to the cooperativity of ivospemin and chemotherapeutic agents, we have observed a cooperative antiproliferative response in ovarian cancer cells following DFMO and ivospemin cotreatment. Together, these studies suggest the potential of polyamine modulation by ivospemin and DFMO in combination with standard of care chemotherapy. Future studies will determine influences on the immune microenvironment and will evaluate cooperativity between ivospemin, DFMO, and chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polyamines,DFMO,Ovarian cancer,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cassandra  E.

However, current inhibitors have had little efficacy in the clinic due to their inability to achieve maximal PI3K&#945; target engagement in a highly specific and durable manner. Contributing to this is that most PI3K&#945; mutant cancer cells are prone to robust pathway feedback and re-activation of remaining wild type PI3K&#945; signaling upon initial inhibition. We have analyzed pathway feedback in a variety of PI3K&#945; mutant cancer cell lines across multiple diverse indications and found this to be a common trait among PI3K&#945; mutant cancer cells. Additionally, when the mutant PI3K&#945; protein alone is targeted in these cells using mutant-specific inhibitors, we observed robust pathway re-activation and tumor cell proliferation. In contrast, TOS-358, a highly selective first-in-class covalent PI3K&#945; inhibitor, achieved complete inhibition of both PI3K&#945; mutant and wild type signaling and this correlated with the induction of cell cycle arrest and cell death across a wide variety of PI3K&#945; mutant tumor types. Furthermore, stimulation of PI3K&#945; signaling with serum rapidly re-activated the PI3K-AKT pathway in the presence of reversible and mutant specific inhibitors. Covalent molecules (namely TOS-358) achieved complete inhibition of pathway signaling in this format. Overall, this reveals the need to achieve sustained inhibition of both PI3K&#945; mutant and wild type signaling to achieve durable efficacy in PI3K&#945; mutant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,Kinases,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>John R.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and is responsible for more than 12,000 deaths per year in the US. In addition to primary tumors, the liver is a common site for metastases of many types of cancer, including colorectal, and pancreatic cancer. The life expectancy and outlook for people with liver metastases are typically poor.Annamycin (ANN) is a novel anthracycline of our design that is clinically evaluated as a liposome formulated drug product, L-ANN. ANN and L-ANN display unique organotropism that differs from doxorubicin (DOX). In addition, ANN was shown to have increased potency against multidrug resistant cancer cell lines, and, importantly, L-ANN appeared to be non-cardiotoxic. Objective. The objective of this study was to analyze the pharmacokinetics of two formulations of ANN in the liver in comparison with DOX and to determine its tumoricidal potential in an HCC model in situ and in an experimental model of liver metastasis. Methods. The pharmacokinetics and tissue-organ distribution studies of L-ANN, free ANN, or DOX were performed in mice and rats. The levels of ANN and DOX in plasma and tissue homogenates were assessed using LC\/MS. The antitumor efficacy of L-ANN was studied using HEPA 1-6 hepatocellular carcinoma models (subcutaneous, orthotopic, and experimental liver metastatic models) and compared with CT26 colon cancer liver metastasis experiments.Results. ANN exhibited dramatically higher accumulation in the liver parenchyma when compared to DOX (6-fold higher AUC values). We found that the increased liver uptake of the drug had a direct effect on activity of the drug in vivo. First, we observed clear, dose-dependent inhibition of the subcutaneous tumor growth after systemic (IV) administration of L-ANN. Next, remarkable activity of L-ANN was observed in orthotopic models. For instance, significant inhibition of the tumor growth and extension of the survival of L-ANN treated mice vs. vehicle-receiving animals was observed in HEPA 1-6 models (median survival 29.5 vs 50 days (p&#60;0.0001) and 28 vs 59 days (p&#60;0.0001), respectively). The significant delay in tumor progression was similar to that recorded in the CT26 experimental metastatic models, and L-ANN treatment strongly correlated with survival in this model as well (median survival 32 vs 53 days in L-ANN and vehicle groups, respectively, p&#60;0.0001).Conclusions. Annamycin is a potent, non-cardiotoxic anthracycline with proven in vivo activity against different types of tumors. It showed increased penetration and accumulation in the liver, which correlated with high antitumor activity in HEPA 1-6 hepatocellular carcinoma and CT26 colon cancer liver metastasis models. Expanded studies to assess L-ANN activity in different tumor liver metastasis models as well as HCC models are being planned. It should be noted that L-ANN is currently undergoing clinical trials in patients with pulmonary metastasis soft tissue sarcoma and acute myeloid leukemia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-09 Topoisomerases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor effect,Topoisomerase II inhibitor,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Annamycin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rafal J.

Inhibition of major extracellular thiol isomerases, which include the enzymes PDI, ERp57, ERp72 and ERp5 in both cancer and thrombosis, have strong therapeutic potential to treat cancer while also inhibiting cancer-induced thrombosis. In this study, we explored the effects of two thiol isomerase inhibitors, isoquercetin (IsoQ) and zafirlukast (Zafi) against OVCAR8 ovarian cancer cells and a xenograft mouse model created from those cells. To explore the potential of these drugs to inhibit tumor growth and cancer-induced thrombosis, multiple <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments were performed. Alterations of cellular OVCAR8 thiol isomerase activity were measured using a DI-E-GSSG assay where, after drug treatment separately with both drugs, DTT and the PDI specific fluorescent probe were added to OVCAR8 cells and then monitored kinetically at 520<sub>nm<\/sub>\/550<sub>nm<\/sub>. Further, the ability of the drugs to inhibit the coagulative potential of OVCAR8 cells was measured by monitoring Factor Xa generation as a marker for tissue factor release. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 100,000 cells, then monitored for Factor Xa generation after addition of a fluorescent probe that is a Factor Xa substrate, Factor VIIa, calcium and Factor X. To explore the effects of IsoQ and Zafi <i>in vivo,<\/i> an OVCAR8 xenograft mouse model was created. Tumors were allowed to grow to an average of 30mm<sup>2<\/sup> and mice were then treated with 10 mg\/kg IsoQ, 30 mg\/kg IsoQ or 30 mg\/kg Zafi for 46 days via oral gavage. Blood was collected on Day 46, plasma was isolated and examined for alterations in p-selectin expression via ELISA and alterations in thiol isomerase activity by the DI-E-GSSG assay. Cell surface thiol isomerase activity on OVCAR8 cells was inhibited by 32% after with Zafi and by 35% after treatment with IsoQ. OVCAR8 cell induced Factor Xa generation was significantly reduced by 79% after Zafi treatment and by 35% after IsoQ treatment. In the xenografts, 10mg\/kg of IsoQ, 30 mg\/kg of IsoQ, and 30 mg\/kg of Zafi were all separately able to suppress tumor growth by approximately 85% compared to controls. P-selectin expression decreased by approximately 50% and thiol isomerase activity was decreased by approximately 40% under all 3 treatment conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of thiol isomerase inhibitors to not only treat cancer-induced thrombosis but also the cancer itself, as cancer induced thrombosis markers and tumor size were both significantly reduced in these experiments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor growth,Thiol Isomerases,Thrombosis,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Justine A.

Some 4-25% of gastric cancers (GC) display activating <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutations including 80% of the EBV-associated GC subset. Small molecules including pan-PI3K, dual PI3K\/mTOR, and pan-AKT inhibitors have shown only moderate clinical success, primarily due to high toxicity and off target effects. Even isoform specific PI3K inhibitors, such as PI3K&#945; inhibitors, have displayed similar clinical problems. Importantly, PI3K&#945; mutation-selective inhibitors are on the horizon and will be key for treatment of <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutant tumors. However, single agent drug resistance is still an anticipated clinical problem and both intrinsic and acquired resistance will affect success of new drugs. There has been a concerted effort to define mechanisms of resistance as well as identify synergistic drug combinations. In this study we aimed to identify mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to the PI3K&#945;-specific inhibitor, BYL719, in <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutant gastric cancers by using a CRISPR\/Cas9-based screening approach. We found that loss of either NEDD9 or BCL-XL was synergistic with BYL719 and led to increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively. In addition to identifying these sensitizer genes, the screening approach allowed us to model intrinsic resistance, and we discovered that knockout of the translation and transcription factor, CBFB, conferred resistance to BYL719. To model acquired resistance, we cultured cells in increasing concentrations of BYL719 over three months and generated clones that were resistant when compared to parental cells. We found that in the clones with acquired resistance, CBFB was significantly down-regulated at the protein and RNA level suggesting a conserved mechanism of drug resistance. We found that CBFB loss led to up-regulation of the serine\/threonine protein kinase PIM1, which can phosphorylate and activate several of the same downstream substrates as AKT thereby maintaining pathway activity in the presence of PI3K&#945; inhibition. Furthermore, a pan-PIM inhibitor re-sensitized both <i>CBFB <\/i>knockout and acquired resistant cells to BYL719. In the TCGA clinical dataset, we found that CBFB is over-expressed in gastric tumors, specifically in the EBV-associated subset, compared to normal tissue and is significantly over-expressed in <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutant compared to wild type tumors. Consistently, we found that PIM1 expression displays the inverse phenotype. These data suggest that while <i>CBFB <\/i>loss is a key step in the development of PI3K&#945; inhibitor resistance, <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutant gastric tumors may be good candidates for clinical success with BYL719 alone and resistance could be prevented with combination with a PIM kinase inhibitor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,PIK3CA,CRISPR\/Cas9,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lyla Stanland<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hazel Ang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacob Hoj<sup>3<\/sup>, Yunqiang Chu<sup>4<\/sup>, Patrick Tan<sup>4<\/sup>, Kris Wood<sup>3<\/sup>, Micah Luftig<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC,<sup>3<\/sup>Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC,<sup>4<\/sup>Duke National University Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d75b97b3-a954-42a9-98ec-c10d050a6ac2","ControlNumber":"7545","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Unlike other cancer types, the frequency of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations is relatively low (&#60; 20%) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, promoting apoptosis by activation of p53 pathway has been a promising strategy for treatment of AML with wild-type (WT) <i>TP53<\/i>. However, preclinical activities of p53 activators have not been fully translated into clinic, partly due to their on-target hematological toxicities. We hypothesized that inhibition of CK1&#945; can be an alternative strategy. To develop a small molecule targeting CK1&#945;, we identified a novel CK1&#945;-selective molecular glue degrader (MGD), PIN-A1 through screening of compounds hijacking cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase. Here, we report its robust pharmacological activities in various preclinical AML models as a single agent or in combination with other targeted therapies along with its superior safety profile to MDM2 inhibitors. First, we demonstrated PIN-A1 can form a ternary complex with CK1&#945; and CRBN using TR-FRET assay. Selective degradation of CK1&#945; by PIN-A1 was also confirmed by global proteomics analysis. PIN-A1 induced rapid degradation of CK1&#945; in human AML MV-4-11 cells harboring WT <i>TP53<\/i>, followed by increasing the level of p53 protein and its downstream target genes, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death. Consistent with these results, preferential sensitivity of AML cells with WT <i>TP53<\/i> to the CK1&#945; degrader was demonstrated in screening assay of broad panel of liquid cancer cell lines. When combined with other targeted therapies agents used for AML, PIN-A1 displayed strong synergistic effects in cell killing. To evaluate its pharmacological activity <i>in vivo<\/i>, PIN-A1 was tested in a xenograft model engrafted with MV-4-11 and a dissemination model of MOLM-14, respectively. Systemic administration of PIN-A1 alone resulted in robust antitumor activity consistent with &#62; 90% CK1&#945; degradation in tumor tissues, comparably achieved at a much lower dose in combo treatments. Importantly, animals remained tumor-free (5\/8) in the MV-4-11 model or prolonged survival in the disseminated model even after they were no longer on the combination treatment of PIN-A1 with a targeted agent X. Lastly, while PIN-A1 had negligible effects on the viability of human PBMC with minimal activation of the p53 pathway at an efficacious dose range for MV-4-11 (Therapeutic index= 8,333), agent X induced p53 pathway and enhanced anti-leukemic activity to a similar extent in two cell types (Therapeutic index=4). Also, we found that the combination treatment of PIN-A1 with agent X had a substantial effect on several solid tumors driven by enhancing the stability and activity of p53. In summary, these results suggest that a CK1&#945; MGD with its favorable safety profile has a potential to become an effective treatment option for advanced AML and solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,CK1&#945; Molecular Glue Degrader,Solid tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jinuk Kong<sup>1<\/sup>, Jisu Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Heekyu Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Hyunseok Kang<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Deokjae Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyunsun Jo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pin Therapeutics, South San Francisco, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Hematology and Oncology, UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3142ee7b-e93f-4a82-95b8-ce82c469b2a4","ControlNumber":"7816","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
