Additionally, EAA is associated with germline genetics, cancer treatments, unfavorable health behaviors, and chronic health conditions. However, our previous studies were limited to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). We aimed to investigate and compare the EAA between non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) and NHW, and evaluate the contribution of social determinants of health (SDOH) to potential racial disparity in EAA. Methylation profiling was generated using Infinium EPIC BeadChips on blood derived DNA from 460 NHB and 2,052 NHW from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. EAA was estimated as the residual from the fit of a simple linear regression of epigenetic age (EA, using Levine&#8217;s clock) on chronological age (CA, i.e., age at DNA sampling). Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and region-specific radiation exposures were abstracted from medical records. Educational attainment was categorized into 3 levels (&#60; high school, high school, &#8805; college). Personal income was categorized into 3 levels (none, &#60; $40,000 and &#8805; $40,000). For socioeconomic area deprivation index (ADI), we considered &#62;75th percentile, 40th to 75th percentile, and &#60;40th percentile as high, moderate, and low deprivation, respectively. Multivariable linear regression evaluated associations of EAA with race and SDOH adjusting for sex and cancer treatments. Mediation analysis treated SDOH as mediators, EAA as an outcome, and race as an exposure. The Pearson r between EA and CA was 0.85 and 0.58, and the age slope of EA (i.e., annual change rate of EA) was 1.21 and 0.91, for NHW and NHB, respectively. EAA was much higher in NHB (mean, 5.31; sd, 7.21) than NHW (mean, -1.19; sd, 12.48) with significance in a multivariable regression model adjusting for sex and cancer treatment (NHB vs. NHW: &#946; = 1.90, <i>P <\/i>= 9.24&#215;10<sup>-5<\/sup>). EAA was also associated with educational attainment (high school vs. &#60;high school: &#946; = -2.84, <i>P <\/i>= 3.22&#215;10<sup>-5<\/sup>; college vs. &#60;high school: &#946; = -3.75, <i>P <\/i>= 2.03&#215;10<sup>-7<\/sup>) and ADI (moderate vs. low: &#946;= 1.07, <i>P <\/i>= 0.026; high vs. low: &#946; = 1.58, <i>P <\/i>= 2.26&#215;10<sup>-3<\/sup>), but not personal income. Notably, after adjusting for SDOH, the association between EAA and race was moderately attenuated (&#946; = 1.50, <i>P <\/i>= 8.37&#215;10<sup>-3<\/sup>). Both educational attainment (15.5%) and ADI (21.4%) mediated the association between race and EAA. We found racial disparity in EAA, with both personal and geographic SDOH as mediators of the association between race and EAA. These data indicate that changes in the social support system at both a personal and community level are needed to reduce socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., lower education and poor living conditions) and hence the biological aging trajectory. In addition, moderate correlation between EA and CA among NHB suggests that further refined measurement of EA for NHB survivors is needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Race,African American,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Noel-Marie Plonski<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cheng Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Qian Dong<sup>1<\/sup>, Na Qin<sup>2<\/sup>, Nan Song<sup>3<\/sup>, John Easton<sup>4<\/sup>, Heather Mulder<sup>4<\/sup>, Emily Walker<sup>5<\/sup>, Geoffrey Neale<sup>5<\/sup>, Jinghui Zhang<sup>4<\/sup>, Kevin Krull<sup>1<\/sup>, Kirsten  K.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), accounting for over 90% of pancreatic malignancies, has the highest incidence rate, mortality rate, and shortest survival times in non-Hispanic black (defined here as African and\/or African American ancestry) patients compared to other races. Due to the racial health disparities of PDAC, this study seeks to quantify the proteomic signatures associated with tumor racial origin to identify the underlying molecular pathways that could contribute to these disparities. Using mass spectrometry on primary PDAC tumor samples collected from 30 Caucasian&nbsp;and 12 African American&nbsp;patients, 183 proteins were differentially expressed between these groups. The most over-expressed protein in African American tumors was&nbsp;Ring Finger Protein 2 (RNF2) with a log2 fold-change greater than six. RNF2 had previously been found to regulate GATA Binding Protein 6 (GATA6) in embryonic stem cells. Additionally, GATA6 is also an important determinant in PDAC subtyping with higher GATA6 expression leading to greater chemosensitivity. To expand upon these findings, chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed on MIA-PaCa2&nbsp;to identify binding sites for RNF2 in PDAC cells. Peaks were called with MACS2 (<i>q&nbsp;<\/i>&#60;0.01)<i>&nbsp;<\/i>and a final peak list with an irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) of less than 0.05 across two replicates was generated. From the 1,142 replicated peaks identified, RNF2 peaks were localized over the transcription start site of 644 unique transcripts, including&nbsp;<i>GATA6<\/i>. Modulating RNF2 levels by exogenous expression or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown confirms that&nbsp;<i>GATA6<\/i>&nbsp;is a target of RNF2 repression in PDAC. To further identify its downstream targets in PDAC, RNF2 knock down in MIA-PaCa2&nbsp;was analyzed by RNA-seq. Differential gene expression analysis revealed RNF2 knockdown decreased expression&nbsp;of genes&nbsp;related to&nbsp;innate immunity, which we have previously identified as a marker of the aggressive Inflammatory PDAC subtype using proteomics. Of the 4,763 differentially expressed genes (<i>P<\/i>-adj &#60; 0.05), 226 had RNF2 binding sites, demonstrating the scope of RNF2 regulation in MIA-PaCa2. Our work identifies differences in the underlying proteome of PDAC tumors as a function of racial origin, with overexpression of RNF2 in African American&nbsp;tumors potentially contributing to inflammation and subtype delineation. Because PDAC subtypes are predictive of therapeutic response, additional research is necessary to determine whether targeting RNF2 can mitigate oncogenic phenotypes that contribute to racial health disparities.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Epigenomics,Proteomics,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anthony  E.

Cancer disparities are usually measured in incidence, mortality, survival, etc. Genomic-based cancer disparity analyses have been less common. In the past decade, mutational signatures were proposed as characteristic footprints of endogenous or exogenous carcinogens, which remarkably propelled the progress of genomic cancer research. The disparities caused by uneven exposure to environmental pollutants may be recorded in mutational signatures.<br \/>Method: The Cancer Genome Altas is one of the richest genomic cancer datasets, empowering hundreds of secondary and tertiary cancer studies. One aspect of TCGA data that is seldomly utilized is geospatial information. Based on the contribution hospital location, we estimated the patients&#8217; approximate location. Furthermore, utilizing data on 450 pollutants released by the Environmental Protection Agency from 2007-2017, we were able to establish associations between mutational signatures and certain pollutants. To remove the noise introduced by approximating the location and average pollution level, stringent statistical procedures were applied.<br \/>Results: First, we showed that mutation frequencies varied substantially between different races. For example, <i>TP53<\/i> was mutated in 46% of Black breast cancer patients, compared to 31% in Whites. Such differences in single genes translated to the level of mutational signatures. Liver cancer has aflatoxin as an affirmed carcinogen, and we compared the quantities of aflatoxin signature across races. It was found that aflatoxin contributed significantly higher (FDR = 0.002) to mutations in Asian than in Caucasians. In-depth analyses revealed that aflatoxin had a strong effect on hepatitis C virus infection in addition to the previously reported effect on hepatitis B virus infection. Similarly, as a known critical player in head and neck tumors, APOBEC signature was found at a significantly higher level (FDR = 0.01) in patients with positive infection of human papillomavirus. Furthermore, analyses from the geospatial perspective revealed several potential associations between pollutants and mutational signatures. For example, the pollutant carbofuran is positively associated with mutational signature SBS10a with the etiology of Polymerase epsilon exonuclease domain mutations (FDR = 0.02).<br \/>Summary: We conducted a thorough mutational signature-based cancer disparity analysis. Our results reinforced previously known facts and expectations of oncogene mutations. The novel results demonstrated representative links between various forms of cancer disparity and genomic mutation footprints. Most importantly, such disparities can be interrogated at the mutational signature level and correlated to environmental pollutants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Environmental pollution,Race,Mutations,Carcinogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yan Guo<sup><\/sup>, <b>Judy Bai<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Katherine Ma<sup><\/sup>, Shangyang Xia<sup><\/sup>, Shuguang Leng<sup><\/sup>, Hui Yu<sup><\/sup>, Xi Gong<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3c41a700-0f4a-401f-94d4-d1d643d67085","ControlNumber":"4012","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Mutational signatures reflect endogenous and exogenous exposures, which may differ by race and ethnicity. This study aims to characterize mutational signatures and their associated etiologies among Black high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) cases, and to compare the occurrence and distribution of signatures with White TCGA cases. Mutational profiling with whole exome sequencing in matched blood and tumor formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens was performed in 271 HGSC cases identifying as Black or African American and participating in the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) or the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCOCS). After filtering, we identified 28,601 high-confidence coding mutations in 256 samples that passed quality control assessments. The median number of mutations per sample was 67, similar to that in TCGA at 66. Mutation frequencies of the major genes identified in TCGA were nearly identical in Black AACES\/NCOCS cases; mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> were present in 96% and 89%, respectively, and mutation frequencies in <i>BRCA1\/2, CSMD3, NF1, CDK12, FAT3, GABRA6, <\/i>and<i> RB1<\/i> differed by only 0-2%. We performed mutational signature analysis using SigProfiler and refitting to the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) previously published single base-pair substitution (SBS) signatures reflecting mutational processes resulting from known endogenous and exogenous exposures. SBS signatures are defined by 96 mutation features including the single nucleotide variant class (e.g., C&#62;A, C&#62;G, C&#62;T, T&#62;A, T&#62;C, and T&#62;G) and the identity of the 5&#8217;\/3&#8217; flanking bases. We observed much higher frequencies of the mismatch repair deficiency, homologous recombination deficiency, ultraviolet light, and treatment exposure signatures in Black AACES\/NCOCS cases (26%, 22%, 9%, and 8%, respectively) than in White TCGA cases (3%, 10%, 3%, and 2%, respectively). The frequencies of the remaining signatures with known etiologies (clock-like, reactive oxygen species, base excision repair, mutagen exposure, DNA polymerase epsilon, and tobacco signatures) differed by less than 5% between Black and White cases. Many mismatch repair deficiency signatures identified in Black AACES\/NCOCS cases are dominated by C&#62;T or T&#62;C mutations and may represent an artifact from formalin fixation. While we observed that the somatic mutation frequencies in major genes associated with HGSC were similar in Black and White cases, the frequencies of some known mutational signatures were considerably higher in Black HGSC. In particular, despite similar frequencies of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> mutations, the homologous recombination deficiency signature was considerably more common in Black than White HGSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Somatic mutations,Cancer genomics,Whole exome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katherine A.

This group of acquired mutations include megabase-scale mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs). These large mutations have mainly been surveyed using SNP array data from individuals of European (EA) or Japanese genetic ancestry. To gain a better understanding of mCA rates and associated risk factors in genetically diverse populations, we surveyed whole genome sequencing data from 67,390 individuals, including 20,132 individuals of African ancestry (AA), and 7,608 of Hispanic ancestry (HA) with deep (30X) whole genome sequencing data from the NHLBI Trans Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. We adapted an existing mCA calling algorithm for application to WGS data, and observed higher sensitivity with WGS data, compared with array-based data, in uncovering mCAs at low mutant cell fractions. As in previous reports, we observed a strong association with age and a non-uniform distribution of mCAs across the genome. The presence of autosomal (but not chromosome X) mCAs was associated with an increased risk of both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. After adjusting for age, we found that individuals of European ancestry have the highest rates of autosomal mCAs, mirroring the higher rate of leukemia in this group. Our analysis also uncovered higher rates of chromosome X mCAs in AA and HA compared to EA, again after adjusting for age. Germline variants in ATM and MPL showed strong associations with mCAs in cis, including ancestry specific variants. And rare variant gene-burden analysis confirmed the association of putatively protein altering variants in ATM and MPL with mCAs in cis. Individual rare variants in DCPS, ADM17, PPP1R16B, and TET2 were all associated with autosomal mCAs and rare variants in OR4C16 were associated with chromosome X mCAs in females. There was significant enrichment of co-occurrence of CHIP mutations and mCAs both altering cancer associated genes TET2, DNMT3A, JAK2, CUX1, and TP53. Overall, our study demonstrates that rates of mCAs differ across populations and that rare inherited germline variants are strongly associated with mCAs across genetically diverse populations. These results strongly motivate further studies of mCAs in under-represented populations to better understand the causes and consequences of this class of somatic variation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Somatic mutations,Aging,Copy number alterations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yasminka A.

We previously reported weak evidence of an association between CHIP and prostate cancer risk in men of European ancestry. However, little is known for African ancestry populations. We investigated the association of age-related CHIP with overall and aggressive prostate cancer risk in a large whole-exome sequencing study of 12,049 African ancestry men, including 7,176 prostate cancer cases (of which 3,283 had aggressive disease and 1,074 had metastatic disease) and 4,873 controls&#173;&#173;. Somatic variant calling was carried out using GATK Mutect2, and only variants with minor allele frequencies (MAF) &#60;0.1% and a variant allelic fraction (VAF) &#62;5% were included. Variants with a MAF &#8805;0.1% in gnomAD were excluded. CHIP variants were identified from a list of pre-specified mutations in 74 genes. Associations were tested using regression models adjusting for age, sub-study, and top 10 principal components, with statistical significance tested by the likelihood ratio test and applying a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing. In total, 998 variants in 57 CHIP genes were identified. Consistent with previous results, we observed a strong association between CHIP and age at blood draw. CHIP genes in aggregate were not statistically significantly associated with risks of total (OR=1.12, 95% CI=0.97-1.28), aggressive (OR=1.14, 95% CI=0.92-1.43) or metastatic (OR=1.17, 95% CI=0.91-1.49) prostate cancer. We observed that carriers of variants in <i>DNMT3A<\/i>, which is the gene that harbors the most CHIP driver mutations, had a nominally elevated risk of prostate cancer compared to non-carriers (OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.08-1.68, p=0.007). Additionally, carriers of variants in <i>EZH2<\/i>, which is implicated in cancer progression, showed a suggestive association with aggressive prostate cancer (OR=7.33, 95% CI=1.01-53.21, p=0.029). After adjusting for age at blood draw, CHIP genes in aggregate were not associated with age at prostate cancer diagnosis. However, we found that <i>EZH2<\/i> variants carriers were diagnosed 12.9 years earlier on average than non-carriers (95% CI=6.1-19.7, adjusted p=0.01). A prostate cancer polygenic risk score (PRS) constructed using 269 risk variants was not associated with CHIP carrier status in aggregate (OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.92-1.06, p=0.70) or with any individual gene (all adjusted p&#62;0.05). In summary, overall CHIP is not likely to be a risk factor of prostate cancer or aggressive disease in men of African ancestry. However, our results do confirm the association of CHIP in <i>DNMT3A<\/i> with prostate cancer risk as reported in previous studies in men of European ancestry. Future work will be needed to evaluate the biological causality of <i>DNMT3A- <\/i>and<i> EZH2- <\/i>related CHIP on prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-01 Aging as a risk factor,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,clonal hematopoiesis,Exome sequencing,Somatic mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anqi Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yili Xu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xin Sheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Raymond Hughley<sup>2<\/sup>, Ben Adusei<sup>3<\/sup>, Mohamed Jalloh<sup>4<\/sup>, Serigne Magueye Gueye<sup>4<\/sup>, Andrew A Adjei<sup>5<\/sup>, James Mensah<sup>6<\/sup>, Pedro  W.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) stage, grade, and increased mortality. Since AA men are more likely to be vitamin D deficient compared to EA men, elucidating the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D may provide additional drug targets to mitigate disparate outcomes for AA men with PCa. Total RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed on an AA prostate cell line, RC-77N\/E, derived from non-malignant epithelial tissue obtained from a PCa patient. We compared untreated RC-77N\/E cells with RC-77N\/E cells treated with 10 nM of vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> metabolite, 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> at 24h. Bioinformatic analysis, public cohort data mining, and RT-qPCR was performed to filter and validate selected statistically significant differentially expressed genes from RNAseq analysis. Our comparison of 1&#945;,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> treated versus untreated control RC-77N\/E cell replicates revealed, 1601 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR p &#60; 0.05). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used to conduct pathway enrichment analysis, which predicted repression of signaling pathways involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, epithelial-mesenchymal transitioning, adherens junction pathway, and RhoA pathway signaling with high enrichment z-score and statistically significant p-value. We additionally report predicted repression of PCa cell viability, invasion, cell proliferation and organismal death, for disease and function. We prioritized differentially expressed genes by identifying genes with 1) vitamin D response elements (VDREs) and 2) predicted poor prognosis, by performing overall survival analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD) Cohort. We identified <i>ANLN<\/i> (Anillin) and <i>ECT2<\/i> (Epithelial Cell Transforming 2), which were further validated using an AA tumor\/benign contralateral matched clinical cohort, and a public cohort study using a non-malignant European prostate cell line, RWPE1.
