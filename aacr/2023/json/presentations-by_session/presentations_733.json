[{"Abstract":"A Phase I clinical trial is currently underway to test Nelmastobart (hSTC810), an antibody targeting butyrophilin 1A1 (BTN1A1), a novel immune checkpoint protein. This Phase I clinical trial is using a standard 3 + 3 escalation design to (i) explore safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities, and pharmacokinetics, (ii) define a recommended Phase II dose, and (iii) evaluate preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors. The current dose range for the clinical trial is 0.3 mg\/kg to 15 mg\/kg. Currently, all the dose levels have been completed without any dose-limiting toxicity having been observed. Here, we provide an update on the clinical trial data shown previously. First, we provide the results of the pharmacokinetics study of these patients for the selected doses and dosing intervals, including the peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max<\/sub>), the time to reach C<sub>max<\/sub> (t<sub>max<\/sub>), and the average plasma concentration of hSTC810 over the dosing interval in steady state (C<sub>avg<\/sub>). The change in cytokine expression and immune cell concentrations in patient blood samples were also analyzed. Specifically, a panel of cytokines was measured including IFN- &#947;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, MCP-1, and TGF- &#946;, while flow cytometry was used to detect a panel of immunological marker proteins including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD14, CD16, CD56, CD25, CD45. For pharmacokinetic studies, the concentrations of hSTC810 and anti-hSTC810 antibodies were quantified. Immunohistochemistry was performed on patient tumor biopsies that were stained for PD-L1, CD3, CD4, CD8, and BTN1A1 expression. The resultant slides were analyzed for PD-L1 tumor proportional score (TPS), PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS), BTN1A1 scoring, the percentage of CD3+ lymphocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, CD8+ lymphocytes, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and necrosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phase I,Immune checkpoint blockade,Solid tumors,Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Stephen Sunghan Yoo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soohyeon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sangjoon Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunjin Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David S.

PGRN\/GP88 tissue expression is an independent prognostic factor of recurrence in breast, lung cancers while elevated serum PGRN\/GP88 level in metastatic breast, lung, ovarian and prostate cancer patients. Elevated PGRN\/GP88 levels are associated with poor outcomes such as progression and shortened survival. An anti-human PGRN\/GP88 monoclonal antibody able to inhibit PGRN\/GP88 action in vitro and in vivo has been developed, chimerized and expressed in CHO cells.

Macrophages can be redirected by CAR expression to phagocytose cancer cells in an antigen-specific manner. CAR-M can reprogram the sTME and present neoantigens to T cells, leading to epitope spreading and anti-tumor immunity. CT-0508 is comprised of autologous monocyte-derived proinflammatory macrophages expressing an anti-HER2 CAR. Pre-clinical studies showed that CT-0508 induced targeted cancer cell phagocytosis while sparing normal cells, decreased tumor burden, prolonged survival, and was safe and effective. Notably, anti-HER2 CAR-M treatment led to activation of the sTME, with infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and increased activated CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In a pre-clinical model of advanced solid tumor resistant to PD1 blockade, mice treated with anti-HER2 CAR-M combined with a PD1 blocking antibody demonstrated improved tumor control, overall survival, and TME activation compared to either treatment alone, indicating synergy and capacity for CAR-M to sensitize solid tumors to checkpoint blockade.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This Phase 1, FIH study is evaluating safety, tolerability, cell manufacturing feasibility, trafficking, TME activation, and preliminary evidence of efficacy of investigational product CT-0508 in 18 pt with locally advanced (unresectable) \/metastatic solid tumors overexpressing HER2. Pt previously treated with anti-HER2 therapies are eligible. Filgrastim mobilized autologous CD14+ monocytes are collected by apheresis, followed by manufacturing and cryopreservation.

While several oral Janus Kinase (JAK)-1\/2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib (RUX) have demonstrated improvements in symptom burden and spleen volume reduction compared to physician choice of best available therapy leading to their approval by the US FDA, responses to these agents are generally time-limited. Additionally, these agents are not considered to be disease-modifying and survival in pts after RUX discontinuation is poor with a median survival of 11-14 months. Thus, novel mechanism-based therapies for pts with suboptimal response or progression on RUX are needed.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Preclinical Rationale: <\/b><i>JAK2 <\/i>V617F mutations promote transition from G1 to S-phase of the cell cycle via increased expression of CDC25A in preclinical models and CDC25A expression is upregulated in primary MPN patient samples. Additional cell cycle regulators such as CDK6 and Cyclin D also play a role in MF pathogenesis and drive myeloproliferation. Finally, combination of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor ribociclib and RUX demonstrated reduction in spleen and liver size when compared to RUX alone in murine models, suggesting synergy (Rampal et al., CCR 2021).<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>This multicenter, phase I dose-escalation trial evaluates the safety of RUX + the CDK4\/6 inhibitor abemaciclib in pts with primary or secondary MF with intermediate-1\/2 or high-risk disease by DIPSS who require treatment and had an inadequate response to RUX. An inadequate response will be defined by (I) palpable splenomegaly &#8805;5 cm below the left costal margin at study entry AND\/OR (II) active MPN symptoms [presence of 1 symptom score &#8805;5 or 2 symptom scores &#8805;3 using the screening MPN-SAF TSS. This study follows a conventional &#8220;3+3&#8221; dose-escalation design, in which pts on a stable dose of RUX (10mg or 15mg BID) with sufficient baseline platelet and absolute neutrophil count will be treated with increasing doses of abemaciclib. Abemaciclib was chosen due to less myelosuppression compared with other CDK4\/6 inhibitors. The pre-study dose of ruxolitinib will be maintained to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of RUX+ abemaciclib. The primary endpoint is to determine the safety and tolerability, and to identify the recommended phase II dose of abemaciclib in MF pts on a stable dose of RUX. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, progression-free and overall survival, and duration of response per the modified International Working Group - Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) and the European Leukemia Net (ELN) 2013 consensus definitions. Correlative studies are planned to identify biomarkers predictive of response to RUX + abemaciclib, mechanisms of resistance (e.g., MAP kinase pathway activation), and any disease-modifying effects of combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,JAK2,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jan P.

Further, anemia is associated with poor prognosis in MF. Activation of activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-2 (also known as ACVR1) may contribute to MF-associated anemia via up-regulated levels of hepcidin. Zilurgisertib (INCB000928) is a potent and selective ALK2 inhibitor that has demonstrated dose-dependent improvement in hemoglobin levels in a cancer-induced anemia mouse model, in which maximum hemoglobin increase was observed when zilurgisertib trough concentration covered pSMAD IC<sub>50<\/sub> for at least half of the dosing interval. Zilurgisertib is being evaluated as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in a phase 1\/2 dose-escalation and -expansion study in patients with anemia due to MF (NCT04455841). The objective of the current study is to use modeling and simulation, which integrate both preclinical and clinical data, to inform dose finding for the ongoing phase 1\/2 trial in MF patients. Population (Pop) PK analyses were conducted using a total of 3089 zilurgisertib plasma concentrations from 161 healthy subjects in 3 completed phase 1 studies: a single ascending dose study (64 subjects, 10-500 mg), a multiple ascending dose study (59 subjects, 50-400 mg QD and 300 mg BID), and a drug-drug interaction study (38 subjects, 100 mg single dose of zilurgisertib alone). A nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach in Monolix software was used for the analyses. Zilurgisertib PK were well-characterized by a 3-compartment model with nonlinear clearance and inter-occasion variability on absorption rate constant and bioavailability. The diagnostic plots and visual predictive check demonstrated that the model appropriately characterized the zilurgisertib plasma concentrations. Because zilurgisertib PK are similar between MF patients and healthy subjects, as suggested by available PK data in MF patients receiving doses up to 200 mg, the pop PK model developed with data from healthy subjects was used to simulate steady-state exposures in MF patients receiving 200 to 600 mg daily dose. Simulation results showed that daily doses of &#8805;600 mg would result in &#62;90% of patients achieving exposure similar to the observed exposure associated with maximum efficacy in the mouse model. The conclusions from this clinical trial simulation support the decision to continue dose escalation in MF patients receiving zilurgisertib monotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Modeling,Pharmacokinetics,Anemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yan-ou Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Betty Lamothe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Stubbs<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amanda McBride<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francis Seguy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Rockich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jay Getsy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phillip Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeff Jackson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ekaterine Asatiani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuejun Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

PRO1184 consists of a human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds FR&#945;, a novel cleavable hydrophilic linker, and a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload, exatecan. Previous studies demonstrated that the hydrophilic linker confers excellent physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles across a range of payload mechanisms and is superior to conventional linkers on these critical parameters for ADCs. In addition, exatecan is broadly active in many tumor types, is membrane permeable, and is not a substrate of multidrug resistance efflux pumps. It may thus lend a robust bystander effect and induce deeper or more durable responses in refractory tumors. Preclinical studies further established that PRO1184 exerts potent antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models with high, moderate, and low FR&#945; expression, consistent with the inherent potency and expected bystander activity of the exatecan payload. PRO1184 is stable in plasma and retains the excellent PK properties and bioactivity of the unconjugated parent antibody. The preliminary safety profile of PRO1184 was more favorable than a benchmarking deruxtecan-based ADC in cynomolgus monkeys. PRO1184 is thus a promising development candidate with a potentially large therapeutic index to benefit a broad population of patients with FR&#945;-expressing solid tumors.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> PRO1184-001 is an ongoing, phase 1\/2, open-label dose escalation and expansion study. Eligible patients are adults with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, non-small cell lung, breast cancer, or mesothelioma. Patients must have measurable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, or mRECIST 1.1 for pleural mesothelioma. Patients must also have previously received therapies known to confer clinical benefit unless considered ineligible, refused by the patient, or not available in the region. PRO1184 is given by intravenous infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle and treatment may continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for discontinuation. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRO1184 and to identify the maximum tolerated dose, if reached, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part A of the study consists of a dose escalation phase and Part B consists of 4 FR&#945;-expressing tumor-specific expansion cohorts treated at the RP2D. PK, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity will also be evaluated.

IL-12 is a promising cancer treatment due to its activation of T and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes to produce interferon (IFN)-&#947;, yet dosing strategies have failed to provide adequate therapeutic benefit in humans. To address these issues, we developed a novel platform that delivers either mono- or bifunctional immunomodulator(s) linked to a <u>F<\/u>ully-<u>H<\/u>uman, <u>A<\/u>lbumin <u>B<\/u>inding scFv domain (F<sub>H<\/sub>AB&#174;), which provides enhanced tumor targeting and retention through albumin binding to over-expressed FcRn, GP60, and SPARC, an improved PK profile, a dose-sparing effect that decreases the toxicity risk, and a broader therapeutic index. Excellent tumor growth inhibition was seen using a &#8220;cold&#8221; immunosuppressive B16F10 melanoma model for comparing the efficacy of IL12-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB with rIL-12, resulting in significant increases in activated NK, NKT, Th1, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells.<br \/>We are conducting a first-in-human, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SON&#8209;1010 (IL12-F<sub>H<\/sub>AB) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study has a traditional 3+3 design, modified to take advantage of the known tachyphylaxis of IL-12 with the introduction of a desensitizing first dose to allow administration of higher maintenance doses. No dose-limiting toxicities have been encountered in the first 3 dose cohorts and the MTD is at least 300 ng\/kg. While adverse events seen in other studies of IL&#8209;12 have occurred, they have been transient and tolerable, allowing further dose escalation. Increases in IFN-&#947; were dose-related, controlled, and prolonged. The levels peaked at 24 to 48 hours and returned to baseline after 2 to 4 weeks. Low levels of IL-10 were induced in a dose-dependent manner. No drug-related increase was seen with IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8, or TNF-&#945; and there was no evidence of cytokine release syndrome at these doses. The preliminary geomean elimination half-life (T<sub>&#189;<\/sub>) was 122 hrs with first-order kinetics, compared with 12 hrs for SC rhIL-12. The accumulation estimates are within the margin of error and are not likely to be physiologically significant with subcutaneous dosing of SON-1010 every 3 weeks. Eight of 11 patients had stable disease at the first follow-up CT, 4 of whom were progressing at study entry. Two patients were stable at 4 months and 2 had unconfirmed progressive disease; 1 patient remains stable after 8 months on SON-1010 with evidence of tumor regression.<br \/>SON-1010 may have a positive synergistic effect with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), particularly with &#8216;cold&#8217; tumors that over-express SPARC. The next stage of development will be to explore the MTD of SON-1010 in combination with an ICI, then to compare that approach with the standard of care in Phase 2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Targeted therapy,Pharmacokinetics,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Sant P.

Early clinical data from several not-&#945; IL-2R&#946;&#947; agonists suggest better tolerability but lower objective response rates compared to historical HD IL-2 data.<sup>1-2<\/sup> In patients, these not-&#945; IL-2s demonstrate a profound NK cell bias, while retaining activity on Tregs, and exhibiting limited CD8+ T cell expansion.<sup>3-5<\/sup>AB248 is a CD8+ selective IL-2 that demonstrates more than 500-fold selectivity for CD8+ T cells over other immune cell types. AB248 has demonstrated a highly differentiated preclinical profile, with compelling anti-tumor activity and less toxicity when given alone and in combination with anti-PD1 in multiple murine tumor models. These data suggest that AB248 may have an improved therapeutic index compared to broad-acting IL-2R&#946;&#947; agonists by increasing CD8+ T cell expansion and activation, avoiding NK cell-driven toxicity and avoiding Treg-mediated immunosuppression.

Secondary objectives include assessing the PK, PD changes, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity. Exploratory objectives include evaluating the potential response-predictive and\/or associated changes in immune cells, blood, and tissue biomarkers.

CBL-B controls T-cell\/NK cell activation and co-stimulatory pathways, including the signaling threshold for T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. CBL-B inhibition uncouples TCR stimulation from the requirement for CD28 co-stimulation while reducing T-cell susceptibility to immunosuppression mediated by PD1, immunosuppressive cytokines, and T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells. Accordingly, targeting CBL-B may enable immune activation even in tumors with low antigen levels, low intratumoral inflammation, inadequate co-stimulation and\/or active immunosuppression associated with poor response\/resistance to existing ICIs. HST-1011 is a novel, potent, selective, orally bioavailable allosteric small molecule CBL-B inhibitor that has been shown to robustly increase anti-tumor immunity <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, including in model systems where other ICIs have minimal effect.<br \/>Methods: SOLAR1 (NCT05662397) is a first-in-human, multicenter Ph1\/2 trial investigating safety and tolerability <u>(primary endpoint)<\/u>, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy (<u>secondary endpoints)<\/u> of HST-1011 monotherapy and an HST-1011\/PD1 inhibitor combination.

BT7480 is a trimeric first-in-class <i>Bicycle<\/i> tumor-targeted immune cell agonist (<i>Bicycle<\/i> TICA) comprised of two unique bicyclic peptides: one that binds to Nectin-4 and two identical <i>Bicycles<\/i> that bind and agonize CD137. The resulting multi-specific molecule stimulates an immune response in the presence of both Nectin-4-expressing tumor cells as well as CD137-expressing immune cells. Nectin-4, a cell adhesion molecule overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells and CD137, a costimulatory receptor expressed on immune cells, are co-expressed in a variety of solid tumors including lung, head and neck, breast, ovarian, and bladder. Co-ligation of Nectin-4 and CD137 by BT7480 is hypothesized to induce oligomerization and activation of CD137, resulting in a tumor-localized costimulatory signal. A favorable preclinical profile supported the initiation of this first-in-human study to investigate the safety and efficacy of BT7480 in patients with solid tumors associated with Nectin-4 expression (NCT05163041).<br \/>Methods: This is a phase 1\/2, open-label, multicenter study to assess safety, clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BT7480. Patients must have an advanced malignancy associated with Nectin-4 expression that is not eligible for standard therapy. Additional key criteria include &#8805;18 years of age, ECOG of 0 or 1, adequate organ function, and no prior therapy with a CD137-targeted agent. Patients are treated at one of the escalating doses (3+3 design) by weekly IV infusion in a 4-week cycle. Primary objectives are to assess safety (phase 1) and clinical activity per RECIST v1.1 (phase 2). Secondary objectives include assessment of PK parameters, measurement of anti-drug antibodies, and evaluation of CD137 target engagement in blood. Key exploratory objectives include evaluating pharmacogenomics, ctDNA, and biomarkers in blood and tumors associated with pharmacological activity, including signals of immune activations and target expression. PK and PD analyses will be performed to support dose escalation decisions and to further the understanding of safety and clinical activity signals as a result of treatment with BT7480.

Though recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) causes tumor regression with antitumor immune memory formation in a range of immunocompetent mouse models, clinical development of rIL-12 was limited by serious toxicities resulting in several patient deaths. WTX-330 is an engineered cytokine prodrug composed of a wild-type IL-12 heterodimer fused via proprietary cleavable linkers to an inactivation domain and to a half-life extension domain. In the circulation and in normal tissues, WTX-330 is designed to remain inactive and not bind to high-affinity IL-12 receptors. In contrast, proteolytic activation of WTX-330 in the tumor microenvironment is expected to liberate the IL-12 cytokine to stimulate antitumor immunity. Preclinical data show that WTX-330 is activated by a range of dissociated human tumors <i>in vitro<\/i> but not by normal human cells or by patient serum. Moreover, a WTX-330 murine surrogate molecule has potent antitumor activity as a monotherapy in multiple syngeneic mouse models, including in those resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy. In the MC38 model, the WTX-330 surrogate has a large therapeutic window of 49-fold compared to 5-fold for recombinant chimeric IL-12.<br \/>Methods: This first-in-human, open-label phase 1 trial is investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of WTX-330 administered as a monotherapy to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NCT05678998). All patients must have &#8805; 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 and be refractory to all standard of care therapies for their indication. Dose escalation utilizes a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control with WTX-330 administered intravenously every two weeks in 28-day cycles. Dose expansion is anticipated to include two arms (A, B) of 20 patients each. Patients eligible for Arm A will have tumor types for which immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are indicated but demonstrate either primary or secondary resistance to this therapy. Primary resistance is defined as disease progression or SD &#60; 6 months as the best response after at least 6 weeks of exposure to PD-(L)1 inhibitors. Secondary resistance is defined as disease progression &#8805; 6 months after initiation of PD-(L)1 inhibitors in patients who received clinical benefit (i.e., CR, PR, or SD &#62; 6 months). Patients eligible for Arm B will have any solid tumor for which ICI therapy is not indicated, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies, archival tumor tissue, and blood samples will be assayed for a range of exploratory biomarkers. As of January 12, 2023, the trial is opening sites and recruiting patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Immunotherapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ildefonso Ismael Rodriguez-Rivera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin C.

ELU001 consists of ~13 folic acid targeting moieties and a payload of ~22 molecules of the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, exatecan. Folic acid and exatecan are covalently bound by non-cleavable and cathepsin-B cleavable linkers, respectively, to short polyethylene glycol chains which surround the C&#8217;Dot&#8217;s silica core. CDCs are very small (~6 nm), allowing greater ability to penetrate more efficiently into solid tumors compared to ADCs. CDCs are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys, which is expected to lead to less toxicity than ADCs that have a longer half-life in circulation. ELU001&#8217;s high avidity is designed to promote binding to FR&#945; on the surface on FR&#945; overexpressing cancer cells with a wide range of antigen expression including high, moderate and low expressing tumor cells. Following antigen binding, ELU001 internalizes into the tumor cell, and traffics to the lysosome where enzymatic cleavage releases the exatecan payload. The first-in-human trial, ELU-FR&#945;-1, is currently recruiting patients that have advanced, recurrent or refractory tumors associated with indications that are known to potentially overexpress FR&#945; and have been shown to be topoisomerase 1 inhibitor-sensitive, and, in the opinion of the Investigator, have no satisfactory therapeutic options available.<br \/>Methods: This is a Phase 1 \/ 2 multicenter, open label clinical trial with two parts: Part 1 Dose Escalation and Part 2 Tumor Group Expansion Cohort(s). Part 1 is a basket trial enrolling patients with cancer types with a high likelihood of having FR&#945; overexpressing tumors, (specifically, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, gastric, gastroesophageal junction, triple negative breast, or non-small cell lung cancers, or cholangiocarcinoma). Patients are receiving ELU001 weekly (QW) (once a week for 3 weeks, 1 week rest), every other week (Q2W, with no rest between cycles), or every three weeks (Q3W). Analysis of FR&#945; expression will be retrospectively determined. Part 2 will use Simon&#8217;s Two-Stage design to evaluate 4-6 Expansion Cohorts, comprised of tumor histologies anticipated to have greatest activity to ELU001 treatment. FR&#945; will be prospectively determined. The primary objective for Part 1 is to identify the MTD\/RP2D. The primary objective for Part 2 is to determine the ORR. Secondary objectives include DOR, PFS, TFST, PFS2, OS, frequency, severity and tolerability of adverse events, PK, ADA, and FR&#945; expression assessments. Part 1 Dose Escalation will recruit about 25 patients per dose regimen (QW; Q2W; Q3W). The first stage of Part 2 (Dose Expansion) will recruit about 15 patients per tumor group expansion cohort. The study is actively enrolling in the US and currently recruiting in Q2W Cohort 201 and Q3W Cohort A. QW Cohorts 1-3 and Q2W Cohort 101 are complete.

High levels of calcium within autophagosomes activates peptidylarginine deaminase enzymes which convert arginine residues within polypeptides to citrulline and alters proteolytic cleavage. In the presence of inflammation, the MHC-II pathway presents these new citrullinated peptides to CD4 T cells. Modi-1 vaccine comprising three citrullinated, adjuvanted peptides induces and expands a population of activated CD4 T cells. On reaching the tumor site the CD4 T cells release proinflammatory cytokines including, INF&#947;, which upregulates MHC class II and the same, but endogenous, modified peptides are presented on the tumor cell surface. This likely causes a positive feed-forward loop with killing of tumor cells. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, cellular immune and tumor response to 2 citrullinated vimentin and one citrullinated enolase peptide each conjugated to the toll-like receptor 1\/2 adjuvant Amplivant&#174; ModiFY is an open-label, prospective, multicohort, multicenter, phase I\/II basket trial. Eligible patients have unresectable disease in one of the following tumor types: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Renal Cell Carcinoma and High Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma. Depending on the status of the disease and eligibility for standard of care (SOC) checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) monotherapy, patients will be treated either with Modi-1 alone or Modi-1 +SOC CPI. A randomized neoadjuvant sub-study in patients with SCCHN scheduled to have tumor resection surgery is included in the protocol. These patients are randomized 1:1 to receive either Modi-1 alone or Modi-1+ pembrolizumab. The primary endpoints are the adverse event rate as measured by CTCAE v5.0 in the initial dose escalation cohorts and the strength of the cellular immune response IFN&#947; enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) assay in the dose expansion cohorts. Secondary endpoints (RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST), are objective response rate duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. In the SCCHN neoadjuvant cohort, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in resected tumor tissue will be profiled using scRNAseq and immunohistochemistry. The study is an adaptive trial, comprising 3+3 dose escalation cohorts followed by a Simon 2-stage design in the dose expansion cohorts. The Modi-1 only dose expansion cohort will recruit 16 patients of each of the target tumor types, whilst the Modi-1+CPI will recruit a total of 21 patients. A total of 21\/138 patients have been treated to date.

They may promote antitumor activity by increasing function of immune cells such as T cells and dendritic cells, inducing cytokine production, increasing antigen presentation, and amplifying interferon gamma-mediated tumor growth arrest. ABBV-CLS-484 and ABBV-CLS-579 are potent, orally bioavailable, first-in-class PTPN2\/1 inhibitors that showed promising antitumor activity and were well tolerated in preclinical models. Preclinical data also indicated that PTPN2\/1 inhibitors have improved efficacy when combined with PD-1-targeting agents (eg, pembrolizumab) or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in multiple tumor models. Here, we describe 2 first-in-human trials of ABBV-CLS-484 or ABBV-CLS-579 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab or VEGFR TKI in patients with locally advanced\/metastatic tumors.<br \/>Methods: These phase 1, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized trials (ABBV-CLS-484: NCT04777994; ABBV-CLS-579: NCT04417465) comprise dose-escalation (ESC) and dose-expansion (EXP) phases. ESC is guided by a Bayesian optimal interval design based on dose-limiting toxicities. ESC data are used to inform evaluation of EXP cohorts in select tumor types including relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, R\/R non-small cell lung cancer, advanced renal cell carcinoma, and microsatellite instability-high tumors. In both ESC and EXP phases, the study drug (ABBV-CLS-484 or ABBV-CLS-579) is administered orally either alone or in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks) and is slated to also be administered in combination with a VEGFR TKI. Eligible patients have locally advanced\/metastatic tumors for which no effective standard therapy exists (or has failed), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &#8804;2. Patients (&#8805;18 years) must have received &#8805;1 prior systemic anticancer therapy for the indication being considered, have relapsed or be refractory to &#8805;1 prior anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 therapy (EXP monotherapy and pembrolizumab combination), or have relapsed after &#8804;1 (ABBV-CLS-484) or &#8805;1 (ABBV-CLS-579) prior VEGFR TKI therapy (EXP VEGFR TKI combination). Primary objectives are to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and to determine the recommended expansion dose and\/or maximum tolerated dose of ABBV-CLS-484 or ABBV-CLS-579, both as monotherapy and in combination. Evaluation of objective response rate (RECIST v1.1) is a primary objective in EXP phase and a secondary objective in ESC phase. Both studies are active, and as of 30 Nov 2022, 30 (ABBV-CLS-484) and 45 (ABBV-CLS-579) patients had been enrolled in ESC phase.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Antitumor agents,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Patricia M.

CTLA-4 is highly expressed on most regulatory T cells (Tregs) but only upregulated in effector T cells following activation. Emerging evidence suggests anti-tumor activity of antibodies targeting CTLA-4 may be modulated by the local presence of NK cells. Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a pleiotropic cytokine important in both innate and adaptive immunity. The IL-15\/IL-15R&#945; complex can stimulate adjacent cells through the IL-2R&#946;\/&#947; complex. This receptor complex is present on many hematopoietic cells; however, IL-2R&#946; expression is highest on NK cells and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Trans-presentation of IL-15 is believed to be the optimal mode of action for IL-15-induced proliferation and activation of NK cells and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, two essential mediators of anti-tumor responses. JK08 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of two functional elements - a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against CTLA-4 and a protein complex consisting of human IL-15 and the Sushi domain of human IL-15R&#945;. JK08 is intended to widen the therapeutic window for IL-15 cytokine-mediated cancer therapy and CTLA-4-targeted antibody-mediated cancer therapy. This widening of the therapeutic window can be achieved by local activation and expansion of NK cells at sites of Tregs, and by IL-15 enhancement of the activity and potency of the proximal CTLA-4 antibody, mirroring the endogenous trans-presentation orientation. Preclinical studies demonstrate JK08 can elicit ADCC-mediated killing of CTLA-4-expressing cells and interact with IL-2R&#946; to promote robust T cell proliferation independent of IL-15R&#945; expression, suggesting that JK08 could effectively activate IL-2R&#946;\/&#947;C-expressing cells preferentially at sites of Tregs, and achieve enhanced anti-tumor responses including through ADCC-mediated depletion of T regulatory cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies show JK08 induces robust NK and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell expansion in cynomolgus monkeys and anti-tumor activity in syngeneic murine models. In summary, JK08 treatment may lead to clinical activity in multiple cancer indications by counteracting the contribution of Tregs to cancer progression.<br \/>Methods: The Phase 1\/2 study of JK08 will enroll patients with advanced relapsed\/refractory solid tumors. The study will employ an accelerated 3+3 escalation design to explore the safety, PK, immuno-regulatory activity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of JK08. Patients will receive treatment with JK08 subcutaneously once weekly until confirmed disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Four tumor specific expansion cohorts will be initiated once dose and schedule are established from dose escalation and include melanoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and a basket of advanced solid tumors. Response will be assessed every 9 weeks per RECIST v1.1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CTLA-4,Cytokines,Immunotherapy,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Nuria Kotecki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvie Rottey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Garralda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria de De Miguel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omar Saavedra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Boni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judit W.
