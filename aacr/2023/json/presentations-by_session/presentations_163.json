Because of the irreversible and complex nature of late-stage metastatic disease, an understanding of the early determinants of skeletal metastasis is likely to result in higher treatment efficacy and to eventually increase the survival of these patients. Because of challenges in detecting and studying small numbers of metastatic cells within the skeleton and the lack of good preclinical models of early bone metastasis, we searched for conditions that favor skeletal metastasis or tumor recurrence in patients with metastatic cancers. Chronic stress and depression are prevalent in patients diagnosed with cancers, are associated with higher cancer recurrence and reduced survival, and both activate sympathetic nerves that release catecholamines in the circulation and target tissues. The fact that all organs, including the skeleton, are innervated led us to investigate if and how activation of sympathetic nerves, or stimulation of post-synaptic adrenergic receptors in bone stromal cells or cancer cells, affects the efficiency of metastatic breast cancer cells to engraft into the skeleton. These studies provided preclinical evidence for a significant contribution of the sympathetic nervous systems to priming the bone microenvironment for breast cancer metastasis, and suggested that interventions aimed at reducing sympathetic activation, &#946;AR signaling, or RANKL expression or signaling could limit breast cancer cell metastatic engraftment in the &#8220;safe heaven&#8221; of the skeleton and improve the prognosis of women treated for early breast cancer, which is supported by several clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Florent Elefteriou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
