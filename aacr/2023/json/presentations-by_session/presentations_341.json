[{"Abstract":"Background: Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, but they are often associated with severe immune related adverse events (irAEs). These severe irAEs are more often seen in patients with obesity or concomitantly treated with cytotoxic therapies.<br \/>Methods: We aimed to understand the mechanisms of ICB-induced irAEs, in the context of obesity and ICB\/chemotherapy combinations. We developed a mouse model of cardiac irAEs, which is the most fatal type of irAE in ICB-treated cancer patients, with clinically relevant features: (i) an ICB-resistant cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or PDAC), (ii) obesity induced with high-fat diets, and (iii) a combination treatment of ICB (&#945;-PD1 + &#945;-CTLA4) and chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX).<br \/>Results: Our FDA and single institution retrospective analyses indicate that patients treated with ICB had greater relative risk of developing myocarditis as compared to other anti-cancer therapies. Mice with orthotopic PDAC and obesity developed irAEs after treatment with ICB and chemotherapy as compared to chow diet. These irAEs recapitulated those observed in patients with cancer and obesity, including cardiac dysfunction consistent with myocarditis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased circulating levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b). IL-1&#946; blockade prevented myocarditis and reduced cardiac fibrosis after immunotherapy. Importantly, IL-1&#946; blockade also enhanced the anti-tumor effects of ICB + FOLFIRINOX combination therapy, and increased mouse survival.<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a translationally relevant 'triple hit' mouse model and discovered that IL-1&#946; mediates ICB-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, we found that IL-1&#946; blockers, which are already used in the clinic for cardiology indications, both reduce adverse events and simultaneously enhance the antitumor effects triggered by immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,Toxicity,Interleukin-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nilesh P.

The resulting condition of T cell exhaustion represents an important mechanism of clinical resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. The transcription factor NR4A1 is known to be upregulated in tumor-specific T-cells and is a mediator of T cell dysfunction including driving exhaustion during chronic antigen stimulation of T-cells. Pro-oncogenic activities of NR4A1 have been observed in various solid tumors, including colorectal and breast cancers, and co-expression of NR4A1 with known immune checkpoint markers such as PD-L1 and B7 family members has also been observed in various cancer cell lines. These findings have identified NR4A1 as an important target for overcoming resistance to cancer immunotherapy. We hypothesize that targeted silencing of the NR4A1 and other immunomodulatory genes can reverse T-cell exhaustion and expand the clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade in solid tumors resistant to immune therapy. To reverse T-cell exhaustion with a targeted approach, we developed T cell targeting SeekRs<sup>TM<\/sup>, which are chimeric RNA therapeutics containing dual-flanking aptamer binders connected by a double-stranded bridge containing siRNA silencers that can target multiple immunomodulatory genes. First-generation aptamer-siRNA chimeras designed with a CTLA-4 targeting aptamer containing a STAT3 siRNA demonstrated effectiveness in silencing its target. Modifications to the structure included the addition of chemically modified nucleotides to improve serum stability. Additionally, dimerization of the structure to form a SeekR dimer molecule greatly improved internalization and target silencing compared to the monomeric chimera. Newly developed SeekRs targeting T cells and designed to silence NR4A1 have effectively downregulated NR4A1 in model cell lines and activated T cells. These results demonstrate that dual targeting SeekRs can be used to specifically deliver siRNA to T cells for targeted silencing that can reverse exhaustion and potentially overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Aptamer,siRNA,CTLA-4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Marvin O'Ketch<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey  A.

Several studies have suggested that IFN-&#947; pathway is critical for GVL sensitivity or resistance in leukemia cells. In mouse model, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generated in IFN-&#947; receptor-deficient mice acquired resistance to GVL (Matte-Martone, Shlomchik WD, J Clin Invest. 2017). Other groups have reported that IFN-&#947; restores HLA expression on myeloid blasts from patients who relapsed AMLs after alloSCT. These data support the clinical application of IFN-&#947; to augment GVL in subjects with post-transplant relapse. However, AML is molecularly heterogeneous, and the IFN-&#947; responsiveness may vary by AML subtypes. We analyzed IFN-&#947; responsiveness of primary AML cells and investigated the role of IFN-&#947; on cell death and T-cell recognition of AML cell lines.<br \/>Methods: Primary AML cells collected at diagnosis (n=60), at relapse after chemotherapy (n=4), and at post-transplant relapse (n=8) were stimulated with IFN-&#947; at 1 ng\/ml or 50 ng\/mL <i>in vitro<\/i>, and IFN-&#947; responsiveness was analyzed by measuring phosphorylation of STAT1 (pSTAT) after 15 minutes and upregulation of HLA-DR after 48 hours by flow cytometry. U937 and THP-1 cell lines were used to investigate IFN-&#947; induced cell death and the impact of IFN-&#947; priming of leukemia cells on the activation of alloreactive T cells. For this, Jurkat cells transduced with anti-HA1 T cell receptor (&#945;HA1-TCR-T) were used, and the activation was analyzed through CD69 upregulation by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: IFN-&#947; responsiveness was heterogeneous in both pSTAT1 and HLA-DR upregulation of primary AML blasts. IFN-&#947; responsiveness also varied within the subpopulation of leukemic blasts within the sample at diagnosis and relapse, implying clonal evolution. Compared to THP-1, U937 cells fail to upregulate HLA-DR with IFN-&#947; despite appropriate pSTAT1 response to IFN-&#947;, suggesting silencing of downstream IFN-&#947; activation site (GAS) and transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN-&#947; directly induced cell death in THP-1 <i>in vitro<\/i>, while U937 was resistant to IFN-&#947; induced cell death. Priming of THP-1 with IFN-&#947; significantly improved the affinity of &#945;HA1-TCR-T to peptide-stimulated THP-1.<br \/>Conclusion: IFN-&#947; responsiveness of AML blasts was heterogeneous, and cell line data suggest an impact of IFN-&#947; sensitivity on IFN-&#947; mediated cell death and alloreactive T cell recognition. Future studies aim to understand the mechanisms underlying IFN-&#947; sensitivity or resistance in AML, which would help to design clinical trials by selecting the patients who would obtain maximal benefit from IFN-&#947; therapy in post-transplant relapse (NCT04628338).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Interferons,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kedwin Ventura<sup><\/sup>, Iuliia Kovalenko<sup><\/sup>, Jui-En Ray Lee<sup><\/sup>, Biswas Neupane<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Stapor<sup><\/sup>, <b>Sawa Ito<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"030a6c3b-b745-4c0e-ba86-244a8a9b2b44","ControlNumber":"3934","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

To overcome the challenges of rising treatment resistance, new strategies are being developed pointing towards enhancing and sustaining T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, exploiting NK, monocytes and &#947;&#948;T cell killing capacity, and combinatorial therapies, among others.<br \/>Examples of such strategies are the bispecific antibodies, which are mainly T-cell (BiTE) engagers, but also NK-cell engagers. In addition to the FDA approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies against tumor antigens are being developed to enhance the cytotoxic response of NK and macrophages\/monocytes through antibody-induced cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)<br \/>To facilitate the efficacy analysis of BiTEs, we developed a 384-well format assay system based on luciferase-labeled tumor cells (advantages: high-throughput capability, non-radioactive, non-toxic, relatively low cost, and easily adaptable to automation). As only the tumor cells are labeled, the specific detection of luciferase exclusively correlates to the number of viable tumor cells, allowing for co-cultures with high excess of effector cells without the effector cells causing interference. Due to high sensitivity, few tumor cells are required for a sufficient signal\/noise ratio, keeping the overall need for primary effector cells to a minimum, even at high effector\/target cell ratios. This is of great advantage when working with rare cytotoxic subpopulations (e.g. NK cells), precious samples from patients, or simply saves resources when performing large exploratory studies. In addition, combination of low 384-well format volumes with nanodrop agent dispensing technology minimizes the amounts of expensive antibodies and other agents.<br \/>Applying this technology, we evaluated the combinatorial effects of Blinatumomab with other clinically relevant agents on the luciferase-labeled GCB-like DLBCL cell line OCI-LY1. Depending on compound combination, we observe synergistic (e.g. Lenalidomide) but also antagonistic effects (e.g. MEK-inhibitor, Selumetinib, and MCL-1-inhibitor, S63845). We also developed CD3-stimulated T cell killer assays either using target cells grown in monolayer or spheroids, with the intent to study checkpoint inhibitors or other T cell activation modulators. In contrast to target cells grown in monolayers, immune cytotoxicity of spheroids by anti-CD3 stimulated T cells was incomplete, showing the additional challenge for effector cells when using 3D cultures as targets. Moreover, we show an ADCC example using NK as cytotoxic cells. Our data supports the outstanding usefulness of this methodological approach for the exploration of the overall efficiency of a therapy to enhance tumor cell killing by immune effector cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BiTE antibody,ADCC,Immunoassay,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carla Castro<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Philipp Metzger<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Feger<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Ulrich<sup><\/sup>, Oliver Siedentopf<sup><\/sup>, Jan  E.

Crosstalk between MDSCs and the tumor microenvironment can promote tumor immune evasion and thus there is growing interest in developing therapeutic approaches to intervene in the MDSC suppressive function. Both monocytic-MDSC (M-MDSC) and granulocytic-MDSC (G-MDSC) subpopulations express the cell surface CD33 myeloid marker. For well-defined cell surface markers like CD33, there is considerable interest in the use of radionuclides as therapeutic payloads, particularly &#945;-particle emitters such as actinium-225 (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac) since they deliver substantially higher decay energies over a much shorter distance than &#946;-emitters, rendering them more suitable for precise, potent, and efficient target cell killing while minimizing toxicity to surrounding bystander cells. Actimab A, the anti-CD33 antibody lintuzumab armed with the <sup>225<\/sup>Ac radioisotope (CD33 ARC), is currently being evaluated in R\/R AML and has demonstrated significant anti-leukemic activity in Phase 1\/2 clinical trials. We therefore hypothesized that MDSCs can be directly targeted by the CD33 ARC. Hence, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the CD33 ARC to deplete MDSCs through preclinical studies in vitro and in vivo with humanized mouse model.<br \/>Methods: CD33 ARC was generated by conjugating lintuzumab with <i>p<\/i>-SCN-Bn-DOTA and subsequently radiolabeled with <sup>225<\/sup>Ac. Primary MDSCs were isolated from cancer patient peripheral blood or healthy donor PBMCs. The specific binding of CD33 ARC to CD33 positive MDSCs and the decreased viability of MDSCs in response to treatment in vitro was characterized by immunophenotyping using flow cytometry. The therapeutic efficacy of CD33 ARC to deplete MDSC in vivo was evaluated in human CD34 reconstituted humanized NOG-EXL mice.<br \/>Results: CD33 positive MDSCs (M-MDSCs and G-MDSCs) were identified in human cancer peripheral blood samples, including colorectal and lung. Significantly more MDSCs were found in the peripheral blood of cancer patients in comparison to healthy donors. CD33 ARC treatment of human cancer MDSCs induced a potent dose-dependent reduction in MDSC viability leading to increased depletion of MDSCs. Furthermore, in the humanized NOG-EXL mouse model, CD33 ARC therapy demonstrated in vivo activity of CD33 ARC to deplete human MDSCs.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrate CD33 ARC alpha targeted radiotherapy depletes human CD33 positive immune suppressing MDSCs present in multiple cancer types, to enhance antitumor immunity.

This phase 1 trial (NCT04739527) evaluates the use of a cell-based relapse vaccine, DCP-001, to prevent disease recurrence after primary treatment. Previous data in acute myeloid leukemia, has shown that DCP-001 induces an immune responses to tumor associated antigens, like WT1 and PRAME, frequently upregulated in HGSOC. In NCT04739527, DCP-001 is given four times biweekly (week 0, 2, 4 and 6) at a dose of 25 million cells\/vaccination (vc), followed by 2 monthly boosters (week 14 and 18) of 10 million cells\/vc, after primary debulking and chemotherapy. IFN&#947; ELISpot is performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells after restimulation with WT1, PRAME, MAGEA3\/4 and NY-ESO1. Vaccine induced T-cell response (VIR) at any point after week 0 are calculated as at least a 2-fold increase of the mock-corrected baseline response. Sustained VIR are counted if a VIR to the same antigen is observed in at least 2 timepoints after start of DCP-001. Flow cytometry is performed using a 40-marker panel to evaluate the immune profiles of innate and adaptive immune system, as well as activation and exhaustion markers and memory profiles. At present, a total of 7 patients have been included and 6 have completed the full vaccination schedule (week 22). DCP-001 is well-tolerated, with only mild to moderate adverse events, mainly related to local injection side reactions, or systemic discomfort with fatigue, diarrhea, temperature elevation and headache. Immune responses have been evaluated in 5 patients by IFNy ELISPOT. VIR were detected in a range of 0-8, and all but 1 patient had at least one sustained VIR to either of the 4 antigens. One patient had no VIR, however this patient had already high baseline responses to all 4 antigens. Flow cytometry showed changes during the vaccination in the immune profiles of these patients, with in general an activation of the innate and adaptive immune system. Detailed analysis is currently ongoing. Finally, at the week 22 visit, 2 patients had progressed during the treatment and 4 had no clinical signs of progressive disease. Taken together, initial data from the phase I trial demonstrate that DCP-001 is safe and well-tolerated and induces durable T-cell responses to tumor associated antigens in OC patients. The study will continue to enroll new patients, follow-up for progression and overall survival and will further analyze the immune responses induced by DCP-001.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,DCP-001,cell-based relapse vaccine,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marco De Bruyn<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Annegé Vledder<sup>1<\/sup>, Rob ten Pas<sup>2<\/sup>, Anneke Eerkens<sup>1<\/sup>, Koen Brummel<sup>1<\/sup>, Hester van Zeeburg<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeroen Rovers<sup>2<\/sup>, Hans Nijman<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands,<sup>2<\/sup>Mendus, Leiden, Netherlands","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cd94c791-4e72-486e-87aa-46419561915b","ControlNumber":"4368","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

We have previously shown that XMT-2056 delivers its STING agonist payload into tumor cells and Fc&#947;RI (CD64)-expressing myeloid cells, activating STING signaling in both cell types, leading to type I interferon (IFN) and anti-tumor innate immune responses. Here, we demonstrate that XMT-2056 exhibits ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) function, which synergizes with STING pathway activation and induces potent cancer cell-killing activity in co-cultures of HER2-expressing cancer cells and Fc&#947;RIII<sup>+<\/sup> (CD16<sup>+<\/sup>) immune cells. We show that both XMT-2056 and HT-19 (the unconjugated parental antibody) retain significant cancer cell-killing activity in an Fc-dependent manner in PBMC co-cultures depleted of Fc&#947;RI-expressing myeloid cells. This activity is abrogated by co-depletion of Fc&#947;RIII<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells, illustrating the ADCC function of XMT-2056. In this setting, XMT-2056 cancer cell-killing activity was significantly increased compared to HT-19, suggesting that the STING payload contributes to the differential activity observed with XMT-2056 treatment. Indeed, co-treatment of cancer cell and immune cell co-cultures with HT-19 and free STING agonist payload enhanced the anti-tumor responses, although to a lesser extent than XMT-2056, suggesting a synergy between the ADCC function and STING pathway activation. Consistently, XMT-2056 treatment of HER2-expressing cancer cells co-cultured with unstimulated CD56<sup>+<\/sup>\/Fc&#947;RIII<sup>+<\/sup> NK cells induced granzyme b and IFN-&#947; cytokine production, expression of NK cell activation markers, and cancer cell-killing activity. The ADCC activity of HT-19 was comparable to that of trastuzumab in NK cell co-cultures. Finally, we found that depletion of Fc&#947;RI<sup>+<\/sup> cells inhibited the cancer cell-killing activity of XMT-2056 in cancer cell and PBMC co-cultures more substantially compared to depletion of Fc&#947;RIII<sup>+<\/sup> cells or CD56<sup>+<\/sup> NK cells, indicating a greater contribution of myeloid cells to the XMT-2056 mechanism of action in this setting. Notably, XMT-2056 was capable of engaging both Fc&#947;RI<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid cells and Fc&#947;RIII<sup>+<\/sup> NK cells, activating both STING-mediated innate immune responses and ADCC function in triple cultures with HER2-expressing cancer cells. Collectively, our data reveal a synergy between ADCC function and STING pathway induction both mediated by XMT-2056, which enhances the cancer cell-killing activity of Fc&#947;RIII<sup>+<\/sup> cells. This additional mechanism of action of XMT-2056 can potentially impact the overall anti-tumor immune responses in tumors infiltrated by Fc&#947;RIII<sup>+<\/sup> cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ADCC,Innate immunity,STING,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jahna Soomer-James<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Marc Damelin<sup><\/sup>, Naniye Malli<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Mersana Therapeutics, Inc., Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b7935f80-9b0c-41b5-ac46-5db410c5049d","ControlNumber":"3027","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

However, most patients experience little clinical benefit due to immunosuppressive barriers in the tumor microenvironment. Our goal to identify immunomodulatory agents that may overcome these barriers, led to the finding that low dose stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in combination with ICI resulted in marked tumor regression and improved survival by generating durable anti-tumor immunity (Ban et al., Nature Cancer, 2021). Unexpectedly, we uncovered that the immune-modulating functions of SBRT was acutely dependent on the secretory function of lung resident <i>Scgb1a1<\/i><sup>+ <\/sup>club cells that protect the bronchioles from xenobiotic agents. Blocking club cell secretome <i>in vivo<\/i> blunted the efficacy of the combination treatment and altered myeloid cell phenotypes. These findings led to the hypothesis that radiation-induced club cell factors may synergize with ICI to attenuate immunosuppressive barriers by reducing myeloid suppressive cells.<br \/><b>Methods and Data.<\/b> Expression of 8 highest expressed club cells secretory factors (CC10, SP-A, SP-B, SP-D, Hp, Secretoglobin 3A1, 3A 2, and 1C 1) in combination with PD-1 blockade elicited significant tumor control and improved survival of NSCLC mice. Mechanistically, the 8 club cell factors inhibit myeloid suppressor cell phenotypes as determined by reduced pSTAT3, pERK and concomitant inhibition of immunosuppressive mediators Arg1, iNOS, etc. Further screening of individual club cell factors showed that CC10 alone effectively blunted myeloid suppression activity as determined by flow cytometry for Arg1 and iNOS. Hence, CC10 can functionally alter the immunosuppressive nature of myeloid suppressor cells. The ability of CC10 in improving the efficacy of ICI in impairing tumor growth and improving survival is currently being examined.<br \/><b>Conclusions.<\/b> Myeloid suppressor cells inhibit immune cells like T cells or NK cells leading to poor prognosis in cancer treatment. Increase in their numbers has been linked to tumor aggressiveness and low efficacy of immunotherapy. Hence, there is an unmet clinical need to specifically target these cells. Agents targeting myeloid suppressor cell accumulation and differentiation (e.g., ATRA, Vitamin D, Sunitinib, Gemcitabine, Bevacizumab, Tadalafil), are being tested in human clinical trials. However, these agents lack specificity and selectivity for myeloid suppressor cells <i>in vivo<\/i>.

Past use of systemic administration of TNF-&#945; to treat solid tumors resulted in unacceptable toxicities. Immunicom&#8217;s LW-02 Column contains a bead matrix covalently bonded to a single-chain, TNF-&#945; capture ligand (scTNF) with high affinity and selectivity to remove sTNF-Rs from plasma. Three clinical trials (NCT04004910, NCT04142931, NCT04690686) have been conducted in patients with various advanced-stage breast cancers (BC), melanoma (M), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Patients were assigned to receive LW-02 Column Immunopheresis&#174; monotherapy or combined with various chemo- or immunotherapies. Immunopheresis&#174; was administered 3x\/week for each trial&#8217;s 12 or 16-week Primary Treatment period with each procedure processing 2 plasma volumes (2PV). Patients with (at least) clinical stability and\/or tumor responses could receive additional treatment. Compared to healthy persons, patients in all 3 trials were noted as having significantly elevated baseline blood concentrations of sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2. For instance, sTNF-R1 plasma levels were 3.5 ng\/mL, 3.5 ng\/mL, 2.2 ng\/mL and 2.1 ng\/mL for BC, M, RCC and NSCLC, respectively, which were 5-8-fold higher than normal values. Likewise, sTNF-R2 plasma concentrations (which can be 4-fold, or more, greater than sTNF-R1) were 4-9-fold higher for BC (16.5 ng\/mL), M (19.1), RCC (22.7) or NSCLC (11.1 ng\/mL) than normal values. Through the data cutoff, &#62;1,600 LW-02 Column Immunopheresis&#174; procedures were performed. On average, 95% of sTNF-R1 and 80% of sTNF-R2 are removed from plasma at the 30-minute procedure timepoint. At the 2PV timepoint, overall mean reductions of sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2 in whole blood were 51 and 52%. Further, minimal leaching (mean of 113 ng per procedure), of the scTNF capture ligand was detected, a quantity that is insufficient to cause any meaningful clinical effects. <i>In vitro<\/i> testing determined that the LW-02 Column has no discernable evidence of unintended or &#8220;off-target&#8221; removal of other cytokines or blood constituents or any non-specific binding. Moreover, the trial results demonstrate Immunopheresis&#174; is safe with minimal side effects determined to be related to treatment with the column.

However, it showed only a marginal response in pancreatic and liver cancers. Thus, novel strategies are highly desirable to take full advantage of immunotherapy in the treatment of these cancers. One of the critical factors that influence the efficacy of immunotherapy is the increased infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) into tumors that alter the immune landscape and serve as facilitators of tumor proliferation, metastatic growth, and immunotherapy resistance. Thus, we believe that selecting a potent molecule that has the ability to suppress the function or revert the phenotypes of TAM and MDSCs will have a more significant impact in enhancing tumor immunotherapy response. Cucurbitacin B (Cuc B) is a potent inhibitor of Stat3, CSF-1R, and PI3K&#947; and has shown its chemopreventive and therapeutic effects against various cancers but is limitedly explored for its application in modulating tumor immune response. In this study, we investigated the molecular effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of Cuc B on TAM and MDSCs. Cuc B significantly (P&#60;0.01) decreased the expression of M2 markers (Arginase I, YM1 FIZZ1, PPAR&#947; and TGF&#946; in M2 polarized BMDMs<b> <\/b>and increased M1 markers (NOS2, IL-6, and CD11C) compared to IL-4 alone treatment group<b>.<\/b> It has been demonstrated that TAMs secrete PDL-1 which neutralizes the function of T-cells. Cuc B treatment significantly (P&#60;0.001) decreased PDL-1 expression in IL-4-treated RAW264.7 cells. Surprisingly, we observed that Cuc B treatment abolished the protein levels of PI3K&#947; in IL-4 treated macrophages as determined by confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis. Cuc B treatment of bone marrow-derived MDSCs significantly (P&#60;0.01) decreased the expression of Arginase-1, IL-10, PDL-1, and Stat3. We observed that IL-4-treated BMDMs inhibited phagocytic capacity which was significantly restored upon Cuc B treatment. We observed that Cuc B is a more potent molecule than a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K&#947; (IPI-549) in suppressing key signaling components of TAM and MDSCs. We are performing <i>in vivo<\/i> study to investigate Cuc B potential to enhance checkpoint blockade immunotherapy response in clinically relevant mouse models of cancer. These results suggest that Cuc B is a novel therapeutic agent which has the potential to suppress or revert TAMs and MDSCs phenotypes. Cuc B may be used as an adjuvant drug molecule in combination with PD1 or CTLA-4 antibodies for improving immunotherapy response against less responsive tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Tumor associated macrophages,MDSC,Cucurbitacin B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emmanuel  B.

ISG15 can either exist in the conjugated form, where it is covalently bound to proteins in a process termed ISGylation or can be released extracellularly in the cytokine-like &#8220;free&#8221; form. Although conjugated ISG15 often indicates poor prognosis in cancers, &#8216;free&#8217; ISG15 is suggested to have immunostimulatory properties, owing to its ability to stimulate the production of IFN-gamma from lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. While the immunomodulatory properties of free ISG15 are known, its ability to improve the antigen-specific T-cell response mediated by tumor immunotherapies has not been fully elucidated. The need for CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cell-based immunoadjuvant in cancer immunotherapy is underscored by the current failure in the generation of optimum CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell response by the multitude of cancer vaccines in clinical trials. In this study, we demonstrated that ISG15 is vital for the generation of antigen-specific adaptive immunity; we showed that ISG15 deficient (ISG15-\/- ) mice do not develop effective systemic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell response after ovalbumin protein vaccination in non-tumor bearing mice. Upon tumor challenge of ISG15-\/- mice and wild type C57\/BL6 mice with B16-OVA melanoma tumors, effective OVA-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity was not elicited, and the tumors progressed at a faster rate in the ISG15-\/- mice. We then utilized a clinically relevant model to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of &#8216;free&#8217; ISG15. We used a synergistic therapeutic approach that involved the concomitant administration of a DNA-construct encoding &#8216;free&#8217; ISG15(mutISG15) and a <i>Listeria-monocytogenes<\/i>(Lm)-based cancer vaccine directed against the tumor vasculature (Lm-LLO-CD105A) to intervene in murine models of renal cell carcinoma (Renca) and breast cancer (4T1-Luc). The combination of Lm-LLO-CD105A and mutISG15 led to a significant reduction in tumor burden in both syngeneic models. This tumor control was mediated by the expansion of a population of highly polyfunctional CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the combinatorial therapy group. These CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells were characterized by the robust production of multiple cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF-alpha.Moreover, we confirmed that mutISG15 significantly increased the antigen (CD105)-specific anti-tumor response generated by Lm-LLO-CD105A. Not surprisingly, <i>in-vitro<\/i> studies demonstrated that mutISG15 probably potentiates the induction of maturation, activation, and antigen-presentation of dendritic cells to facilitate the activation and effective functionality of tumor-specific T cells. Conclusively, our results positions &#8216;free&#8217; ISG15 as a powerful T-cell stimulant that may provide a suitable therapeutic option for improving the effectiveness of therapeutic cancer vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunostimulation,Breast cancer,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mariam Oladejo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Laurence Wood<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Immunotherapeutics and Biotechnology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Abilene, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6a6523d4-7f33-4f3c-9497-714dddab8804","ControlNumber":"414","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Overexpression of Trop2 is associated with aggressive disease progression and poor prognosis. Recently, Trop2 targeting antibody-drug conjugate such as sacituzumab-govitecan (Trodelvy&#174;) was approved for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer (UC) patients. Interferon-beta (IFN-beta), a pleiotropic cytokine, can induce direct\/in-direct tumor killing and activate anti-tumor immune response in tumor microenvironments. However, it is challenging to develop IFN-beta as an anti-cancer agent due to its low biophysical properties, short half-life, and the systemic toxicity. Previously, we developed IFN-beta mutein (ABN102), which showed improved stability and biophysical properties compared to wild-type IFN-beta. We hypothesis to reduce any toxicity of ABN102 by fusing with tumor targeting antibody. In this study, we generated antibody cytokine fusion protein (ABN202), anti Trop2-interferon-beta mutein, and evaluated the efficacy of ABN202 against Trop2-positive UC cell line models.<br \/>Method &#38; Result : We aimed to determine the direct anti-cancer efficacy of ABN202 using Trop2-positive UC cell lines and the indirect immune cell mediated effect of ABN202 using Trop2-positive UC cell lines co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). The in vivo efficacy of ABN202 was further confirmed in Trop2 positive tumor mouse model. Our results revealed that ABN202 directly inhibited proliferation and activates the apoptosis-related signaling mechanisms via Type 1 IFN signaling, showing better efficacy than either anti Trop2 antibody (sacituzumab) or ABN102 alone. ABN202 induces the activation of PBMC subsets and enhanced immune cell-mediated cancer cell killing when UC cell lines were co-cultured with PBMC. The anti-cancer efficacy of ABN202 were confirmed in Trop2-positive tumor mouse model.<br \/>Conclusion : We evaluated the direct and indirect anti-cancer efficacy of ABN202 (anti Trop2-interferon-beta mutein) in Trop2-positive urothelial cancer. Our results support that ABN202 is a potent drug candidate in Trop2-positive urothelial cancer by directly inhibiting tumor growth and activating anti-cancer immune responses through type 1 IFN signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Trop-2,Interferons,Immunocytokines,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jiyang Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Myeung-Ryun Seo<sup>1<\/sup>, Heegeon Park<sup>2<\/sup>, YeongMun Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Saehyung Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Na Young Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Chan Gyu Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, Hae Min Jeong<sup>3<\/sup>, Jun Young Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Young kee Shin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>ABION INC., Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Genopharm Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4ea70de8-961b-41d8-97a7-7827a46a9db5","ControlNumber":"5821","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

However, adenosine generated within the tumor microenvironment by the action of ectonucleotides hinders the immune reaction towards cancer cells by signaling through adenosine receptors such as high affinity A2AR expressed on immune cells. Tumors evade the immune response by usurping pathways that negatively regulate normal immune responses. Resistance to inhibition of immune checkpoint targets arises because of an upregulation in the expression of the CD39-CD73 axis and the resulting increase in production of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of either adenosine generation or signaling by inhibition of A2AR along with other immune activation strategies have been shown to be effective therapeutic approaches.<br \/>In view of this, we sought to discover and develop novel small molecule inhibitors that dually target A2AR and an immuno-suppressive ligand expressed in the tumor microenvironment. Aurigene&#8217;s dual inhibitors exhibit potent inhibition of both A2AR and an immuno-suppressive target of relevance in respective biochemical assays. Potent biochemical activity translated into rescue of chemokines and IL-2 in human PBMCs. Lead compounds exhibited desirable drug-like properties and excellent pharmacokinetic exposure in rodents. In a syngeneic tumor model, lead compounds demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition. Anti-tumor efficacy correlated well with tumor drug levels and modulation of pharmacodynamic markers. In summary, we have identified first-in-class dual inhibitors with good drug like properties, which showed significant antitumor efficacy. Evaluation of these lead compounds in additional tumor models and in vivo toxicity studies will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Adenosine,Immunosuppression,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chandregowda Venkateshappa<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kishore Narayanan<sup><\/sup>, Rashmi Nair<sup><\/sup>, Aravind AB<sup><\/sup>, Ramakishore VP Putta<sup><\/sup>, Jwala Nagaraj<sup><\/sup>, Megha Goyal<sup><\/sup>, Vijay Kamal Ahuja<sup><\/sup>, Amith A Dhudashiya<sup><\/sup>, Samiulla DS<sup><\/sup>, Girish Daginakatte<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Antony<sup><\/sup>, Kavitha Nellore<sup><\/sup>, Susanta Samajdar<sup><\/sup>, Murali Ramachandra<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited, Bangalore, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3bbcaccb-4cdc-4fcf-a907-93668a77aea7","ControlNumber":"3405","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

CD47 is one of the major players in conveying the &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal upon binding its receptor SIRP&#945; on myeloid cells which evade innate immune responses. Previously clinical studies on the blockade of CD47 alone resulted in limited clinical benefits suggesting that other target(s) must be inhibited simultaneously with CD47 for gaining advantage. Here, we found that CD47 was highly expressed on peritoneal malignant cells and its overexpression was a poor prognosticator. Additionally, we observed that Galectin-3 (Gal-3) was highly enriched in tumor cluster and was positively correlated with CD47 expression in short survival of patients revealed by scRNA-seq and metastatic GAC samples. Moreover, we found double positive of Gal-3 and CD47 significantly associated with diffuse type, poor differentiation, and tumor relapse. Mechanistically, Depletion of Gal-3 in mouse tumor and human tumor cells reduced the levels of CD47 through inhibition c-Myc expression and its binding to the promoter of CD47. Additionally, tumor-derived Gal-3 were found critical for tumor progression accompanied with protected GAC cells from phagocytosis by macrophages. Gal-3 deficiency resulted in a marked reduction in M2 macrophages and elevated T cell effector activity. Dual blockade of Gal-3 and CD47 significantly decreased tumor growth by promoted phagocytosis, repolarization of macrophage and boosted T cell immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.

A new generation of IL-2 therapies with decreased binding to IL-2 receptor &#945;-chain (IL-2R&#945;)<b> <\/b>is being developed to reduce toxicity and Tregs expansion yet with limited clinical success so far. Here, we show that the ability to engage IL-2R&#945; is critical for maximal anti-tumor activity of a systemic IL-2 therapy, and an alternative approach to circumvent systemic toxicity is to deliver IL-2 specifically to tumor-reactive T cells. We developed REGN10597, a PD-1-targeted, receptor-masked IL-2 immunocytokine with attenuated systemic IL-2 activity but maintained capacity to engage endogenous IL-2R&#945; on PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Compared to WT IL-2, receptor masked IL-2 shows improved PK and diminished systemic toxicity in mice. REGN10597 shows PD1-targeting-dependent IL-2 activity in vitro and drives selective expansion of tumor-infiltrating PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cells with vigorous effector functions in vivo. In preclinical syngeneic tumor models in PD-1 humanized mice, REGN10597 demonstrates robust anti-tumor efficacy both as a single agent and in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibodies. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of REGN10597 as a novel targeted and receptor masked WT IL-2 therapy, supporting its clinical development for the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,Immunocytokines,PD-1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jiaxi Wu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nicolin Bloch<sup><\/sup>, Aaron Chang<sup><\/sup>, Ramandeep Bhavsar<sup><\/sup>, Supriya Patel<sup><\/sup>, Qingqing Wang<sup><\/sup>, Hassan Shakil Ahmed<sup><\/sup>, Vidur Garg<sup><\/sup>, Michael Amatulli<sup><\/sup>, Yuetian Yan<sup><\/sup>, Shunhai Wang<sup><\/sup>, Drew Dudgeon<sup><\/sup>, Willy Ramos<sup><\/sup>, Pamela Krueger<sup><\/sup>, Ashique Rafique<sup><\/sup>, Tammy Huang<sup><\/sup>, Erica Ullman<sup><\/sup>, Aynur Hermann<sup><\/sup>, William Olson<sup><\/sup>, John Lin<sup><\/sup>, Eric Smith<sup><\/sup>, Tong Zhang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d9ce5acc-7fde-44e8-9f0a-ade64f8dd40c","ControlNumber":"6460","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

However, linking lifestyle variables to specific microbial populations and the host immune response to cancer therapies is challenging due to their complexity. We established an experimental system to examine such complexity by linking a human dietary intervention and fecal biospecimens to mouse models to test the response to immunotherapy. Longitudinal human microbiome samples collected before and after a specific dietary or other intervention allow us to test the hypothesis that an intervention alters the response to immunotherapy via impact on the host microbiome. <b> <\/b> One set of samples was taken from the BEWELL study, which examined the impact of 2 x 80 mL black raspberry (BRB) drink boxes per day for 4 weeks in people at high risk for lung cancer. Participant samples were chosen based on enrichment of specific taxa. Pre- and post-BRB intervention samples were gavaged into mice. Mouse mc38 cells were injected subcutaneously and treated with anti-PD1 Ab or isotype control. Tumor size was monitored, and at the end of the study, tumor immune cell composition data were collected. Tumor growth over time was modeled using a linear mixed-effects model with tumor volume as the outcome variable and the predictor variables of time and treatment (PD1 vs. IgG) interacting with gavage and quadratic time to accommodate non-linear tumor growth and including random effects by mouse. For sample 68, enriched for <i>Roseburia <\/i>CAG 309, the interaction between time, gavage post-BRB, and Anti-PD1 treatment significantly affected tumor volume (p &#60; 0.05) relative control. The same significant effect (p &#60; 0.05) was also seen for sample 79, enriched for <i>Lachnospira pectinoschiza<\/i>, and samples 84 and 85, enriched for <i>Blautia obeum<\/i>. To determine the mechanism by which this might occur, we analyzed the tumor's immune cell composition. Post-BRB mice treated with Anti-PD1 showed a significant increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ immune cells relative control, as compared to mice gavaged with pre-BRB stool. Modeling results showed samples whose response was improved slightly after the BRB dietary intervention. These samples were associated with the enrichment of the taxon <i>Roseburia<\/i> CAG 309. A black-raspberry dietary intervention in humans modified the microbiomes of several participants in a way that is hypothesized to improve response to PD1 treatment. Future directions include supplementing individual microbes into pre-intervention gavages to confirm which taxa improve response. These results suggest that this modeling platform is an effective system for testing microbiome modification on tumor growth and assessing mechanisms by which this might occur and is extendable to other lifestyle-based interventions where pre- and post-intervention specimens are collected.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Microbiome,Diet,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aaditya Pallerla<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bailey Conrad<sup>2<\/sup>, Amna Bibi<sup>2<\/sup>, Nyelia Williams<sup>2<\/sup>, Caroline Wheeler<sup>2<\/sup>, Rebecca Hoyd<sup>2<\/sup>, Shankar Suman<sup>2<\/sup>, Joseph Amann<sup>2<\/sup>, Yangyang Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Marisa Bittoni<sup>2<\/sup>, Shiqi Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Madison Grogan<sup>2<\/sup>, Alvin Anand<sup>2<\/sup>, Najma Afrah<sup>2<\/sup>, Carolyn Presley<sup>2<\/sup>, Fred  K.

The goals of T cell-targeting therapies have been to restore the effector function of tumor-specific T cells that are either dysfunctional due to the immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, the lack of co-stimulatory signals, or negative regulation by expression of checkpoint molecules such as PD-1. E3 ligase Casitas B-Lineage Lymphoma Proto-Oncogene B (CBL-B) has recently gained attention as a master regulator of multiple immune-activation mechanisms. Inhibition of CBL-B enables the activation of antigen-specific T cells, and has been shown in syngeneic mouse tumor models to be efficacious as a cancer immunotherapy agent. CBL-B inhibition has also been shown to enhance and prolong the effects of anti-PD-1 antibody (Ab) therapy. However, genetic knockout of CBL-B in mice led to spontaneous autoimmunity characterized by auto-antibody production and infiltration of activated T cells and B cells into multiple organs that could result in tissue damage. In order to mitigate safety issues that could result from systemic CBL-B inhibition, we developed novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that target CBL-B inhibitors (CBL-Bi) to T cells via binding to PD-1. Using PD-1-expressing Jurkat NFAT reporter cells and mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, we demonstrated that our TPS<sup>2<\/sup> approach enhanced the activation of T cells <i>in vitro<\/i> compared to treatment with anti-PD-1 Ab alone. Evaluation of pathways downstream of TCR activation in primary exhausted T cells showed increased Notch1, phospho-PLC&#947;2, and ZAP-70 accumulation following anti-PD-1\/CBL-Bi treatment and is correlated with IFN&#947; induction. When autologous mature dendritic cells were co-cultured with dissociated tumor cells from melanoma patients, the highest magnitude of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte activation was observed using delivery of CBL-Bi by anti-PD-1 ADC, compared to CBL-Bi alone, anti-PD-1 Ab alone, or combination treatment. The potential of anti-PD-1\/CBL-Bi ADC for activation effector T cell function is also evident by increased intratumoral transcript levels of Granzyme B and Perforin following treatment in a humanized mouse model. In conclusion, we validated that the biological activity of CBL-Bi is retained after conjugation with an anti-PD-1 antibody. The use of anti-PD-1 Ab for developing the ADC not only targets the CBL-Bi payload to exhausted T cells but also blocks negative regulation of T cells via PD-1. Together, anti-PD-1\/CBL-Bi ADC enhanced T cell activation <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as <i>in vivo<\/i>. Evaluation of safety and efficacy in animal tumor models is ongoing, to support further development of the TPS<sup>2<\/sup> approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Cbl-b,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joanne Lim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Skaletskaya<sup>1<\/sup>, Uttapol Permpoon<sup>2<\/sup>, Yeonjoon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Shikha Saini<sup>1<\/sup>, Khuloud Takrouri<sup>1<\/sup>, Zinaida Ribkovskaia<sup>1<\/sup>, Palash Bhar<sup>1<\/sup>, Nathan Fishkin<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong-Ki Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Ji Hyun Park<sup>2<\/sup>, James Palacino<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter  U.

Clinical results have demonstrated that ICIs led to significant clinical benefits and durable responses in patients that previously had no or limited therapeutic options. Clinical results also demonstrated that combining ICIs or ICI with cytotoxic \/ targeted agents improved response rate and duration of response. BXQ-350 is a novel biologic simultaneously leading to cancer cells death and rebalancing the tumor microenvironment by targeting sphingolipid metabolism that is dysregulated in cancer cells. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling metabolite known to promote cancer cell survival and proliferation and to favor an immunosuppressor environment; ceramide is a metabolite known to induce cancer cell apoptosis, mitophagy or necrosis and to favor an immunoeffector environment.<br \/>Methods: BXQ-350 was investigated preclinically in different <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models and clinically in a first-in-human Phase 1 safety and dose escalation study in cancer patients with recurrent advanced solid tumors.<br \/>Results: Preclinical results demonstrated that BXQ-350 targets sphingolipid metabolism, decreases S1P levels while it simultaneously increases ceramide levels, leading to cancer cells death across multiple cancer cell lines. By impacting S1P and ceramide, BXQ-350 is additive or synergistic with different classes of antineoplastic agents. In addition, <i>ex vivo<\/i> experiments demonstrated BXQ-350 modulates many of immune-effector \/ suppressor cells as it repolarizes macrophages towards the antitumoral M1 phenotype, inhibits differentiation and activity of immunosuppressor of MDSCs, and promotes the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells as well as their activity. Clinical results revealed that BXQ-350 was well tolerated in cancer patients and showed signs of single agent activity. Analyses of biomarker samples showed that in patients experiencing a clinical benefit, systemic S1P plasma levels decreased significantly, and ceramide levels increased. Analysis of circulating cytokines revealed that BXQ-350 seemed to induce an increase of antitumoral cytokines (IFNg, TNFa, IL-2) and a decrease in protumoral ones (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10).<br \/>Conclusions: Preclinical and clinical results demonstrated that BXQ-350 modulates sphingolipid metabolism leading to cancer cell death and stimulating the tumor microenvironment.

Promising preliminary findings with integrin inhibition as an adjuvant to chemotherapy have not translated to clinical success. However, the effect of integrin inhibition on tumor-immune cell interactions remains largely unexplored. Further investigation could shed light on a connection between integrin signaling and immune checkpoint expression, opening the path for using integrin inhibitors to sensitize otherwise resistant tumors to immunotherapy. Fluorescently labeled wild-type HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells and TALL-104 T-cells were co-cultured and treated with GLPG0187, a small molecule integrin inhibitor, at various doses. Co-cultures were observed at different time points using fluorescence microscopy and cell counts were quantified using ImageJ software. The co-culture included the cell viability marker ethidium homodimer so the number of viable cells of each type could be determined using colocalization. This assay revealed synergistic cancer cell killing, indicating that integrin inhibition may be sensitizing cancer cells to immune cells. The hypothesized mechanism involves TGF-beta-mediated PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. GLPG0187 has been shown to inhibit the &#593;v&#946;6 integrin receptor, which is responsible for the activation of latent-TGF&#946; into the active form. By blocking this receptor, there would potentially be a reduction of TGF&#946; signaling and therefore a reduced expression of PD-L1 leading to an enhanced immune response. To investigate this mechanism, both WT and p53-\/- HCT-116 cells were pre-treated with GLPG0187 and subsequently with latent-TGF&#946;. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the addition of latent-TGF&#946; increased the expression of PD-L1 in cancer cells. Additionally, a low dose of integrin inhibitor rescued these effects, returning PD-L1 expression back to control levels. However, the higher dose of the drug did not reduce PD-L1 expression. This could potentially be due to off-target effects conflicting with the proposed pathway, however, these findings are still under active investigation.

Given the widespread use of GABA-A receptor agonists as palliative care in clinical practice, we examined here the impact of GABA on response to immunotherapy in preclinical tumor models and the association of GABA-A receptor agonist usage with outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy.We show that important genes controlling the GABA pathway are enriched in human tumors versus normal tissue across indications, and tumor cells themselves are able to produce GABA. We found that several key genes of the GABA pathway are upregulated in non-responders to atezolizumab and we derived a 5-gene signature associated with poor outcomes in 2L urothelial cancer patients receiving atezolizumab. Preclinical models further indicated that GABA at the tumor site promotes tumor growth and dampens adaptive immunity preventing response to immunotherapy. Finally, we noted that 45% of urothelial cancer patients received concomitant GABA-A positive allosteric modulators, given as palliative therapy in atezolizumab trials IMvigor-210 and -211. This group exhibited significantly lower OS and PFS as compared to atezolizumab treated patients who did not receive GABA-A positive modulators. A similar negative impact was seen in patients receiving standard of care anti-PD(L)1 immunotherapy in 2L NSCLC using EHR derived deidentified Flatiron Health - Komodo Health claims linked data.

A control group (A) of 6 mice had PBS injected IP without tumor and an untreated control (E) of 15 mice were injected with 2.5 million cancer cells. Groups B, C, and D were injected with GEN-1 IP weekly, every 2 weeks, and every 3 weeks respectively. Six animals from each group B, C, and D were harvested for translational research (TR) after 5 weekly, 3 every 2-week and 2 every 3-week treatments respectively.

Previously, we reported a novel heterodimeric bifunctional fusion molecule, HCW9218, designed using soluble tissue factor (TF)-based scaffold technology comprising extracellular domains of the human transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) receptor II and a human interleukin (IL)-15\/IL-15 receptor &#945; complex which exhibited both immune cell stimulatory and TGF-&#946; neutralizing properties. Herein, we showed in two different syngeneic murine tumor models (B16F10, 4T1) that subcutaneous treatment with HCW9218 induces a proliferative burst of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and NK cells in blood and a subsequent infiltration of these cells into established tumors. In vivo imaging of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice after treatment showed that HCW9218 was present both in lymph nodes and established tumors up to 24hr following treatment. Comprehensive analysis of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) showed that HCW9218 mediated antitumor activity by expanding TCF<sup>+<\/sup>TIM3<sup>-<\/sup> &#8216;progenitor exhausted&#8217; (Tpex) CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in tumors. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor blockade resulted in decreased tumor infiltration of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> Tpex in B16F10 and 4T1 tumor-bearing mice indicating that these cells originate from tumor draining lymph nodes (TdLN). Increased &#8216;terminally exhausted&#8216; TCF-1<sup>-<\/sup>TIM3<sup>+<\/sup> (Tex) CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs were also observed in tumors of HCW9218-treated mice indicating increased antitumor activity. Tumor transplantation experiments further confirmed the mechanism of HCW9218 antitumor activity by increasing influx of CD45.1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells into transplanted tumors from CD45.2<sup>+<\/sup> mice. Additionally, HCW9218 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 treatment by increasing the infiltration of activated\/memory CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells into B16F10 tumors in mice leading to significant reduction in tumor volume. Collectively, the results of this study<br \/>demonstrated that HCW9218 treatment of mice bearing solid tumors resulted in modulating the TdLN immune landscape and invigorating T cells for enhanced checkpoint blockade therapy. HCW9218 are currently in two clinical trials (clinicaltrials.org: NCT05322408, NCT05304936) against chemo-resistant\/refractory solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Solid tumors,Immune checkpoint blockade,Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Varghese George<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Pallavi Chaturvedi<sup><\/sup>, Niraj Shrestha<sup><\/sup>, Leah Kanakraj<sup><\/sup>, Crystal Gilkes<sup><\/sup>, Nicole Encalada<sup><\/sup>, Meng Wang<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoyun Zhu<sup><\/sup>, Bai Liu<sup><\/sup>, Peter Rhode<sup><\/sup>, Hing  C.

Despite advances in treatment modalities, GBM remains largely incurable and new treatment approaches are desperately needed. An innovative strategy for cancer therapy is to combine the inhibition of cancer cell-intrinsic oncogenic signaling with cancer cell-extrinsic immunological activation of the tumor microenvironment (TME). MALT1 represents a candidate target whose inhibition may provide this dual benefit. Originally identified as a proto-oncoprotein in lymphoma, MALT1 has recently also been implicated in multiple solid tumors, including GBM, and significant effort has been made to develop MALT1 protease inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. Interestingly, blockade of MALT1 protease has also been shown to selectively reprogram tumor infiltrating Treg cells into antitumor effector cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that in GBM, MALT1 acts both within tumor cells and within cells of the TME to promote tumorigenesis and MALT1 inhibitor treatment could thus have dual benefit.<br \/><b>Methods\/Results<\/b>: We assembled a panel of mouse and human GBM cell lines and performed western-blot analysis to show that these cells demonstrate constitutive MALT1 expression and proteolytic activity. MALT1 blockade in GBM cells, using siRNA or MALT1 protease inhibitors, reduces viability and clonogenic potential, suggesting that inhibition of MALT1 could impair tumor cell survival. Single-cell RNAseq data from public datasets demonstrated that myeloid cells have the highest MALT1 expression in the GBM TME. Our data indicate that co-culture of macrophages with GBM cells induces MALT1-NF-&#954;B activation within the macrophages and this is associated with polarization towards an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype. Additionally, treating primary human or mouse macrophages with MALT1-protease inhibitor prevents GBM-induced M2-polarization, increases M1-polarization and enhances GBM cell killing. In a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model, GBM tumor growth is impaired, and survival is extended when tumor cells are implanted into MALT1-protease dead (PD) host mice (mice which harbor a point mutation in the MALT1-protease catalytic cysteine) as compared to when implanted into wild-type host mice. MALT1-PD mice demonstrate a less immunosuppressive GBM TME with increased M1-macrophages and decreased M2-macrophages, MDSCs and Tregs. Taken together, our findings suggest that inhibiting MALT1 protease in TME cells promotes anti-tumor immunity against brain tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Our studies suggest MALT1 protease as a new therapeutic target in GBM whose inhibition could have dual benefit via both direct effect on tumor cells and by reversing the immunosuppressive TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Juliana Hofstatter Azambuja<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Saigopalakrishna  S.

To maximize the clinical benefit of PI3Ki-based immune oncology (IO) combination, we characterized the role of PI3K isoforms in tumor and T cells and determined the immunological impacts of PI3Ki alone or in combination with ICB. Inhibitions of PI3K were achieved by either genetic knockdown (KD) or the bioactive compound in PTEN-present (B16\/MC38), PTEN-absent (BP\/D4M) tumor cell lines, and CD8+ T cells (Pmel-1). Following PI3Ki, we determined the activation status of the PI3K pathway (p-AKT level), transcriptional profile, and cellular function of these cells. We found both <i>in vitro<\/i> KD and pharmacological inhibition of either PI3K&#945; or PI3K&#946; displayed a dramatic reduction of the PI3K pathway in tumor cells but moderate or no reduction in T cells, whereas the PI3K pathway significantly decreased in T cells with PI3K&#947; or PI3K&#948; inhibition. KD of PI3K&#945; or &#946; isoforms drastically sensitized both D4M and MC38 tumors to &#945;PD1 <i>in vivo<\/i>. We also observed that only PI3K&#947; or PI3K&#948; inhibition profoundly suppressed cytokine production and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cell, suggesting that PI3K&#945; or PI3K&#946; isoform inhibition can achieve tumor specific PI3Ki with limited impacts on T cell function. Furthermore, we used multiple syngeneic melanoma models to determine whether PI3K isoform inhibition can synergize the antitumor activity of ICB <i>in vivo<\/i>. In PTEN-present tumors, BYL719 (BYL, a PI3K&#945; inhibitor) synergized with &#945;PD1 to delay tumor growth and extend survival (median survival of MC38-bearing mice in control (Ctrl), BYL, &#945;PD1, and combination (Comb) groups: 30, 36, 33, and &#62;45 respectively; p&#60;0.05: Ctrl\/BYL\/&#945;PD1 vs Comb). However, a limited combinatorial effect between GSK2636771(a PI3K&#946; inhibitor) and &#945;PD1 was observed in PTEN-present tumor models. Moreover, the combination of BYL and &#945;PD1 exhibits superior antitumor activity in a spontaneous Braf-mutant, PTEN-loss melanoma model when compared with either reagent. Mechanistically, the combination of BYL and &#945;PD1 improved CD8+ T cells tumor infiltration (14 days treatment, mean CD8+ number\/mg of the tumor, Ctrl:1392.9, BYL:2073.9, &#945;PD1:1545.2, Comb:4691.8; p&#60;0.01: Ctrl\/BYL\/&#945;PD1 vs Comb) and reduced MDSCs in MC38 tumors (p&#60;0.05: Ctrl vs Comb). Multi-omics profiling of tumor cells with <i>in vitro<\/i> and in <i>vivo<\/i> PI3K isoform inhibition is ongoing. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PI3K&#945; inhibitor can potentiate T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses regardless of PTEN status, providing a strong rationale for the clinical development of the BYL-based IO combination. In collaboration with Novartis, MD Anderson Cancer Center will launch a Phase I\/II trial of the FDA-approved BYL in combination with &#945;PD1 in advanced melanoma and breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ritu Bohat<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaofang Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Chunyu Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yitao Tang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jiakai Hou<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicholas  A.
