[{"Abstract":"Mast cells constitute indispensably immunoregulatory sentinel cells in tumor microenvironment, however, their functions are poorly characterized in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Here, we performed flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to comprehensively characterize LUAD infiltrating MCs. MCs exhibited remarkably functional heterogeneity and were enriched in ground-glass opacity featured LUAD (gLUAD). The MCs in gLUAD exhibited proinflammatory and chemotactic properties while the MCs in radiologically solid LUAD (sLUAD) were associated with tumor angiogenesis. MCs were an important source of CCL2 that correlated with the recruitment of CCR2+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which represent a specific subcluster of pre-exhausted T cells with tissue-resident memory phenotype and enhanced cytotoxicity. Increased infiltration of MCs-CCR2+ CTLs and their colocalization showed a strong association with favorable prognosis after surgery but were not associated with improved survival after chemotherapy. Collectively, these findings reveal a key role of MCs in LUAD and their potential crosstalk with CTLs, suggesting that targeting MCs may be a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Immune cells,Tumor microenvironment,Mast cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fan Fan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaoming Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Haiquan Chen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"23b4feb3-add6-46b9-9918-25db99f063f8","ControlNumber":"2625","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

BRAF\/MEK targeted therapy (TT) is associated with very high initial response rates that are typically short-lived, while in contrast Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) provide more durable responses but have lower initial response rates. Hence, it has been proposed that sequencing ICIs with TT would lead to a higher frequency of durable responses. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding the choice of immunotherapy, the best sequencing strategy and the mechanism leading to this synergy. To address these questions, we have optimized a syngeneic mouse melanoma model, YUMMER1.7-PV1 that is sensitive to both TT and ICIs. Importantly, this model recapitulates the known three therapeutic response phases of targeted therapies: initial response, followed by drug tolerance and then resistance. Investigation of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) at these three drug-induced phases, demonstrates that the immune suppressive microenvironment present during the acquired resistant phase is primed at the drug tolerance phase. Utilizing this model, we have explored the time-dependent therapy-induced changes in both tumor cells and the TIME during various TT and ICI sequencing strategies. This information will determine the optimal sequencing strategy of targeted therapy and immunotherapy that will deliver better outcomes for melanoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,Targeted therapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Riyaben Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Trigos<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole Haynes<sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Lelliott<sup>2<\/sup>, Grant McArthur<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Karen E.

Presence of neutrophils in solid tumors, including the sixth most common cancer globally - head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), is associated with poor prognosis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines regulated by NF-&#954;B promote extravasation of neutrophils into tissue; neutrophils are polarized to anti-tumor (N1) or pro-tumor (N2) phenotype through the action of various pathways, including TGF-&#946;. The mechanism and role of neutrophil recruitment in HNSCC were explored this study.<br \/>Neutrophils isolated from adult donors were co-cultured for 5 hours with conditioned media (CM) from HNSCC cells SCC-9 and Cal-27, and stained with TNF-&#945;, ICAM-1, CCL2, CCL5 for analysis of neutrophil phenotype by flow cytometry. TGF-&#946; blocking antibody was used to explore the role of TGF-&#946; in polarization of neutrophils. Canonical and non-canonical TGF-&#946; signaling pathway activation was also investigated in these neutrophils through western blots. Using HNSCC patient samples, qPCR was performed for expression of genes involved in apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and neutrophil function.<br \/>Following co-culture with 24-hour HNSCC CM, neutrophils begin to exhibit cell surface markers indicative of N2 phenotype, which is impacted by TGF-&#946; blocking antibody. Neutrophils co-cultured with HNSCC CM exhibited altered expression of TGF-&#946; mediators Smad2\/3, p38 and Akt, which was abrogated with the addition of TGF-&#946; blocking antibody indicating specificity of a TGF-&#946; induced signaling. Gene expression analysis exhibited significantly higher expression of anti-apoptotic BCL2 and neutrophil function marker alpha defensin 1 in HNSCC patient samples with greater neutrophil infiltration, while caspase 3 was expressed at significantly higher levels in HNSCC patient samples with low neutrophil infiltration.<br \/>HNSCC<b> <\/b>cells recruit neutrophils; evidence suggests that TGF-&#946; pathway, which typically promotes N2 phenotype in neutrophils, is involved via canonical and non-canonical mediators including p38 and Akt.

B cell and plasma cell presence has been shown to correlate with improved survival and lower relapse rates in solid cancers and with improved response to checkpoint blockade. The aim of this study was to identify distinct immune cell compositions in the circulation and tumor microenvironment and make correlations with clinical and disease specific outcomes.<br \/>Methods: In this study, utilizing high-dimensional deep immunophenotyping techniques (mass cytometry), multispectral immunofluorescence based imaging and bulk RNA sequencing, we explored the B cell repertoire in the circulation and tumor microenvironment in early-stage lung cancer patients undergoing radical surgical resection.<br \/>Results: We demonstrate using high-dimensional deep phenotyping, clear differences in B cell composition between the circulation and the intratumoural microenvironment. Intratumoural predominant populations include plasma cells, from CD38<sup>var<\/sup> immature to CD138+ mature cells. B cells undergoing germinal center and follicular maturation as well as class-switched memory cells were predominantly found in the circulation. Eight key populations were significantly differentially abundant between compartments on generalized linear mixed modelling (p&#60;0.0001 with BH correction). These differences were observed in an external validation set. Plasma cell infiltration existed on a phenotypic spectrum from natural regulatory suppressive cells to antibody producing effector phenotypes. The latter correlating with better outcomes. Higher B cell expression of CD138 and Ig was noted within the tumor microenvironment in patients who did not experience early relapse. Significantly higher levels of circulating ki67+ CD27<sup>hi<\/sup> CD38<sup>hi<\/sup> CD95<sup>hi<\/sup> IL10<sup>int<\/sup> plasmablasts were noted in recurrence patients (p=0.02). Geospatial mapping identified clusters of suppressive plasma cells localized to the tumor stroma, likely regulating entry of effector cells into the tumor nest.<br \/>Conclusions: Our data has demonstrated the unique roles of effector and suppressive B cell subsets in NSCLC and the clear difference in surrogacy between tissue compartments. The lesser infiltration of suppressive phenotypes into the tumor nest may be to prevent the subsequent infiltration of effector plasma and effector B cells into the tumor nest. This tumor line of defense would be in keeping with the observation that higher levels of suppressive B cell subsets in the circulation links to higher rates of recurrence and a higher tumor effector plasma cell infiltrate correlates with protection against recurrent disease. The ambiguous role of B cells in the tumor environment predetermines the multidirectional development of immunotherapeutic approaches, either supporting positive B cell types or inhibiting the suppressive B cell phenotypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,B cells,Predictive biomarkers,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Akshay J.

Next, we show that tonic CIN-induced activation of cGAS-STING signaling, whose activation is typically thought of inducing type I interferon expression, results in strong suppression of anti-tumor immune signaling. Remarkably, genetic or pharmacologic suppression of cGAS, and thus depletion of the STING ligand cGAMP, results in reprogramming and re-sensitization of <i>STK11<\/i>-mutant models to cGAS-STING mediated type I interferon responses. Furthermore, we show that CIN promotes excessive production cGAMP in <i>STK11<\/i>-mutant models.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of CRC, making up 95 percent of all CRC cases. Checkpoint inhibitors used for CRC have shown efficacy for a specific subset of patients. MC38 is a very popular tumor model due to its characteristics as an immunologically warm tumor and response to some immunotherapies. To identify underlying factors that influence differences in treatment response, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of the MC38 model was analyzed following the treatment with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). The minimal tumor growth inhibition was observed in MC38 tumors treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4. The NanoString&#174; nCounter system and flow cytometry were used to provide gene and cell-specific signatures of TME in response to immunomodulatory agents. NanoString&#174; nCounter and flow cytometry analyses were complementary and demonstrated evidence of T cell recruitment and upregulation of genes associated with several immune-related pathways following treatment. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells in MC38 tumors following treatment with anti-PD-1, suggesting activation of an immune response. With treatment of anti-CTLA-4, tumors did not have demonstrable alterations to immune cell subset distribution which supports evidence that anti-CTLA-4 treatment show minimal activation of the immune system in MC38 tumors. Further, transcriptome analysis with NanoString&#174; nCounter system revealed that the immune pathways related to signatures such as interferon signaling, cytotoxicity, antigen presentation, cytokine signaling, and chemokine signaling were upregulated with anti-PD-1 treatment compared to control or anti-CTLA-4 treatment of MC38 tumors. The transcriptome analysis also demonstrated 2-5-fold increases of interferon, cytotoxicity, cytokine, and chemokine genes such as, Gbp2, Gbp3, Irf1, Irf7, Irf8, Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3, Tnfsf10, Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl7, Ccl12, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Cxcl11 over control in the case of anti-PD-1 treatment. In summary, anti-PD-1 treatment increased T cell recruitment into the tumor and upregulated genes in TME. Anti-CTLA-4 treatment known to enable combination activity with anti-PD-1, but not enough to show notable monotherapy activity. Immune cell subset distribution in TME and relative gene expression are two potential types of analyses to predict anti-tumor response. These data can be used mechanistically as well as to inform rational combination strategies for checkpoint inhibitors in colon adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,CTLA-4,Colon cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priyanka Singh<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Dan Saims<sup><\/sup>, David Draper<sup><\/sup>, Sheri Barnes<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>In Vitro Preclinical Oncology, Labcorp Drug Development, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"97b3060a-50b3-4f75-b67a-8cc9d3a48565","ControlNumber":"2405","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

OBI-999 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a GH-specific monoclonal antibody conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) through a cathepsin B cleavable linker. MMAE is known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) which involves in the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-driven adaptive immunity with long-term immunological memory.<br \/>Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the synergistic effects of OBI-999 + pembrolizumab on tumor growth suppression in several xenograft tumor models.<br \/>Methods: OBI-999-induced ICD was examined <i>in vitro<\/i> by the detection of damaging-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as calreticulin (CRT), HMGB1, and ATP in incubated Globo H expressing cells. The synergistic effects with the combination of OBI-999 and pembrolizumab as well as the ICD-related immunity were assessed <i>in vivo<\/i> using advanced severe immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).<br \/>Results: Incubation of OBI-999 with high GH expression cancer cell lines (HCC-1428, NCI-N87 and NCI-H526) and mid GH expression cancer cell line (SW-480) induced the release of DAMPs including CRT, HMGB1, and ATP, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating that OBI-999 is capable of inducing ICD <i>in vitro<\/i>. In the high GH expression human breast cancer cell line HCC-1428 xenograft model, OBI-999+pembrolizumab exhibited significantly stronger inhibition of tumor growth compared to either OBI-999 or pembrolizumab alone. Similar synergistic effects were observed in other xenograft tumor models including gastric (NCI-N87), small cell lung (NCI-H526), and colorectal (SW-480) cancers. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in HCC-1428 humanized mice showed that OBI-999 + pembrolizumab induced populations of activated cytotoxic CD8 T-cells and mature dendritic cells. Pembrolizumab decreased PD-1 expression on CD8 and CD4 cells, and OBI-999 decreased PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, which reversed the exhausted status of immune cells and alleviated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrated significant synergistic effects of OBI-999 and pembrolizumab in several animal models. These synergistic effects may be attributed to the ability of OBI-999 to induce ICD, as demonstrated by the release of DAMPs <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor-specific immunity <i>in vivo<\/i>, suggesting that OBI-999 can create a tumor microenvironment that enhances the function of pembrolizumab. The results suggest that combination therapy with OBI-999 and immune checkpoint inhibitors is warranted in human clinical studies. OBI-999 is currently in Phase 1\/2 clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors with high GH expression (NCT04084366).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Pembrolizumab,OBI-999,Globo H,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chun-Chung Wang<sup><\/sup>, Chi-Huan Lu<sup><\/sup>, Jhih-Jie Yang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Wan-Fen Li<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ming-Tain Lai<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>OBI Pharma, Inc, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"07d6b8c2-59ab-4db1-83e1-a3e369ed3143","ControlNumber":"1575","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

During radiotherapy, there is a risk that individual tumor cells survive and proliferate again after a period of dormancy. Growing evidence suggests that senescence may play a key role in this context. We investigated <i>in vitro<\/i> radiotherapy-induced senescence and found that quiescent tumor cells survived treatment with 16 Gy. Those cells exhibited characteristics of senescence, yet were able to regain their proliferative capacity, and senescence was associated with radioresistance. During radiotherapy, the cells of the tumor stroma are inevitably irradiated as well. It is already known that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote tumor progression. However, their contribution to the survival of senescent tumor cells after radiotherapy is unknown so far. Furthermore, the association between radiotherapy-induced senescence and recurrences raises the question of how residual, senescent tumor cells can be eliminated to prevent the development of a recurrence at an early stage. These aspects were the subject of the study presented here. To study the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs during their response to irradiation, both cell types were irradiated with 16 Gy <i>in vitro<\/i> individually and in co-culture. Subsequently, proliferation, cell death, morphological characteristics, and the secretome were analyzed. Additionally, we investigated whether senescent tumor cells can be targeted by treatment with zinc oxide nanoparticles. We could show that not only the tumor cells but also the CAFs go into a senescent state in response to irradiation, seen by loss of proliferation, increased senescence-associated &#946;&#8209;galactosidase activity, and typical morphological characteristics. The secretome analysis revealed that the co-culture of tumor cells with CAFs significantly altered the repertoire of cytokines released upon irradiation, indicating intense communication between the cell types during their response to irradiation. Therefore, it is important for future studies on radiotherapy-induced senescence to include the tumor stroma as well. Finally, we demonstrated that senescent tumor cells were vulnerable to cell death induced by treatment with zinc oxide nanoparticles, which thus could potentially contribute to eliminating residual tumor cells after radiotherapy. This study revealed that radiotherapy-induced senescence in tumor cells and associated fibroblasts could well be a therapeutic problem, as senescent tumor cells are not targetable by radiotherapy anymore. In the future, zinc oxide nanoparticles may help to counteract this escape mechanism to prevent recurrences.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Senescence,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Zinc,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nadine Wiesmann<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rita Gieringer<sup><\/sup>, Johannes Kupka<sup><\/sup>, Jonas Eckrich<sup><\/sup>, Sebahat Kaya<sup><\/sup>, Peer Kaemmerer<sup><\/sup>, Bilal Al-Nawas<sup><\/sup>, Juergen Brieger<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b7cc42ca-faf6-425e-b263-a66d67c5d11c","ControlNumber":"1017","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Recent developments in cancer immunotherapy have obtained encouraging clinical responses, including PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade therapy, although response rates vary depending on tumor type. For example, despite the lack of response by microsatellite-stable CRC, a subset of CRC with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) responds especially well to the PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade therapy. For other types of CRC which do not respond to PD-L1 therapy, new targets are being investigated. One family of targets is the cancer testis antigen MAGE-A whose expression is restricted to germline cells in normal tissue but is overexpressed in many cancer cells. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of MAGE-A3 expression in colon cancer along with IHC screening of mismatch protein MSH6 was performed. Many of the cases in this study observed a co-expression in the tissue. In the tumors, MAGE-A3 was observed to have weak cytoplasmic expression while MSH6 had strong nuclear expression in the epithelial cells. The immune cells adjacent to the epithelial cells were also positive for MAGE-A3. This result suggests that MAGE-A3 may be a promising target for microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Mismatch repair,Immunohistochemistry,Cancer testis antigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jina Yom<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel Gonzalez<sup>1<\/sup>, Eden Zewdu<sup>1<\/sup>, Aubrey Su<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Yin<sup>1<\/sup>, Bailey Gilmore<sup>1<\/sup>, Dehe Kong<sup>1<\/sup>, Andy Han<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhaoying Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Tianli Qu<sup>1<\/sup>, Zoe Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Christenson<sup>1<\/sup>, Yan Ma<sup>1<\/sup>, Hailey Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaomin Hu<sup>2<\/sup>, Qi Ren<sup>2<\/sup>, zhaohui Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xuan Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Fu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>OriGene Wuxi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Binhu District, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1df6527d-ad42-49cc-af52-be7b26dd37a9","ControlNumber":"2413","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Nevertheless, while revealing underlying mechanisms of blocking TAM recruitment, widely adopted <i>in vitro<\/i> migration assays like Transwell, &#181;-slides fail to distinguish cell&#8217;s random migration from chemotaxis (biased migration) and introduce 3D extracellular matrix environment. Here we present data that monocytes, as major replenishment source of TAMs, massively boost their random migration via paracrine pathway to initiate early-stage infiltration using an advanced 3D multi-compartment organoid model. In addition, before re-educated into TAMs, monocytes in the TME are capable of inducing triple negative breast cancer cells&#8217; hyper-proliferation by activating their MEK\/ERK signaling pathway. This work provides evidence that TAM infiltration is driven by monocytes&#8217; random\/biased migration separately and identifies a potential combinational immunotherapy targeting at monocytes instead of TAMs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Breast cancer,Monocyte,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wenxuan Du<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Adrian Johnston<sup>1<\/sup>, Praful Nair<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingyi Zhu<sup>2<\/sup>, Khin Sandar Win<sup>1<\/sup>, Bryan Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Jude Phillip<sup>2<\/sup>, Pei-Hsun Wu<sup>3<\/sup>, Denis Wirtz<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b4fcff2b-34d6-42ae-9ff6-c6a9297d86ed","ControlNumber":"2455","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

One method to deal with this challenge entails extending the scope of anti-cancer treatment beyond tumor cells by additionally altering their tumor microenvironment. Understanding how the tumor microenvironment can contribute to the evolution of diverse resistance pathways could aid in the rational design of sequential treatments that enforce pressure towards a more predictable resistance trajectory. Tumor associated macrophages often support neoplastic growth and are frequently the most abundant immune cell found in tumors. Here, we used clinically relevant <i>in vivo <\/i>Braf-mutant melanoma models and <i>Ccr2-RFP; Cx3cr1-GFP <\/i>mice to track the long-term changes in tumor cells and macrophages under targeted therapy with Braf\/Mek inhibitors. We assessed the dynamic evolution of the macrophage population generated by therapy pressure-induced stress. During the onset of a drug-tolerant persister state, <i>Ccr2<\/i>+ macrophage infiltration rises, underscoring a prominent role at this point in melanoma evolution for development of drug-resistance. Importantly, we show that a lack of melanoma infiltrating <i>Ccr2<\/i>+ macrophages delays onset of resistance. In this case, rebounded tumor cells from <i>Ccr2 <\/i>knockout recipients favor the evolution of cell-extrinsic mediated resistance mechanisms, which can be reversed when these adapted melanoma cells are relocated to a microenvironment with functional Ccr2. Conversely, Ccr2 presence promotes development of cell-intrinsic drug resistance with a stable phenotype in rebounded tumor cells. Overall, this demonstrates that the development of resistance may be manipulated and directed to improve timing and probability of relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dahihm Kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Luye An<sup><\/sup>, Jiwon Moon<sup><\/sup>, Andrew White<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cornell Univ.

Once appear metastasis, the 5 years survival rate reduce to 30-40% in these patients. Different with hematogenously metastasizing tumors, ovarian cancer cells primarily disseminate within the peritoneal cavity. Omentum, a lipid-rich tissue, is the most common metastatic site of ovarian cancer. In addition, the adipocyte-released free fatty acid can be used by cancer cells to fuel its growth and proliferation. In this study, we attempt to clarify the regulation between metastatic ovarian cancer cell and omental adipocytes, and find a therapeutic strategy for advanced stage ovarian cancer.<br \/>Materials and Methods: A three-cell (SKOV3, 3T3L1 and THP-1) co-culture model was established to mimic in vitro tumor microenvironment of ovarian cancer omental metastasis. Flow cytometry was performed for the adipocytes survival rate with Annexin V\/PI double staining. Caspase-1 activity assay was used to detect the cleavage of substrate YVAD-AFC level in adipocytes and quantified by a fluorescence microliter plate reader. The free fatty acid assay kit was used to detect free fatty acid level in condition medium and ascites. Invasion assay and MTT assay were used to validate the invasive ability and cell viability of ovarian cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to CD36 staining in clinical specimens, and correlation analysis through prism 8 software. Results: We observed the adipocyte pyroptosis in 3-cell co-culture model, and the free fatty acid increased in culture medium by flow cytometry analysis, caspase-1 activity assay kit and free fatty acid assay kit. In the meantime, the invasive ability and cisplatin resistance increased in ovarian cancer cells. The free fatty acid level in ascites positive correlated with CD36 expression (r<sup>2<\/sup>=0.2189, <i>p<\/i>=0.0375). Of note, combination treatment of cisplatin and sulfosuccinimidyl oleate (SSO) can reverse chemoresistance in 3-cell co-culture model. Overall, free fatty acid released form the pyroptotic adipocytes and increase invasive ability and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells. Block the interaction of free fatty acid and CD36 can reverse the chemoresistance in advanced ovarian cancer.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>In this study, we demonstrated adipocytes pyroptosis can increase the free fatty acid release to the microenvironment, and then promote ovarian cancer cell invasion and increase chemoresistance. For more important, inhibition of free fatty acid and CD36 interaction can reverse the chemoresistance in the in vitro experiments. Thus, reduce the adipocytes pyroptosis may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the omentum metastatic ovarian cancer.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-06 Inflammatory cells as regulators of tumor growth,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Adipocytes,Chemoresistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chang-Ni Lin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yu-Ling Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Keng-Fu Hsu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yi-Ying Wu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e1e991d6-5051-43cc-b20a-8160528a5d01","ControlNumber":"1734","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Interestingly, clinical observations reveal that tamoxifen is capable of inducing regression of some tumors lacking ER expression whereas tamoxifen is also capable of increasing host resistance against cancer in an ER-independent mechanism. These findings suggest the immunomodulatory effects of tamoxifen may be ER-independent, but little is known about the underlying mechanism and the potential clinical implication. Recently, we identified a novel mechanism by which tamoxifen exerts its DNA-damaging potential by re-shaping the unfavorable tumor microenvironment in breast cancer. A long-term tamoxifen administration induces downregulation of the chromatin &#8216;&#8216;reader&#8217;&#8217; RACK7\/ZMYND8, which acts as a suppressor of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs, including cytokines and chemokines) and CEACAM1 in both ER<sup>+<\/sup> and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. To investigate the immunomodulatory effects of tamoxifen in conjunction with RACK7-knockdown, the orthotopic murine TNBC 4T1 model was employed to investigate tamoxifen-mediated cellular modulation in TNBC. The control and RACK7-knockdown 4T1 cells are orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pad of female BALB\/c mice. Peripheral cytokines\/chemokines and high-content biomarker studies (multiplex immunoassays, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing) are deployed to obtain insights into the mechanistic rationale behind the immunomodulatory effects of tamoxifen and\/or RACK7-knockdown. The tamoxifen-mediated cellular modulation evokes cytokine\/chemokine secretion and further induces T-cell infiltration into tumor area. However, tumor reduction was limited due to extensive T-cell exhaustion from interaction of CEACAM1 and TIM-3, a &#8220;checkpoint&#8221; receptor expressed in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. The expression patterns of CEACAM1 and PD-L1 in 4T1 tumor cells and that of TIM-3 and PD-1 in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells correlate with intra-tumor infiltration of T-cells and tumor cell growth. Therefore, targeting the interaction between CEACAM1 and TIM-3 to overcome T-cell exhaustion is crucial for the new therapeutic role of tamoxifen treatment in TNBC breast cancer in conjugation with RACK7-knockdown. Altogether, our findings provide direct evidence to support a new therapeutic opportunity by targeting CEACAM1-TIM-3 interaction in the tamoxifen-mediated tumor immune microenvironment for improving immune checkpoint blockade therapy in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,In vivo,Tumor microenvironment,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pony Yu-Ling Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Marvin A.

Individuals with the same histopathological classification can have tumors with drastically different molecular profiles and clinical responses to treatment. It remains unclear as to when during the disease course these differences arise and why some tumors are addicted to one oncogenic pathway over another. Somatic genomic aberrations occur within the context of an individual&#8217;s germline genome, which can vary across millions of germline polymorphisms. It is unknown the extent to which germline differences influence the somatic evolution of a tumor. Interrogating 4,912 breast cancer lesions, spanning pre-invasive to metastatic disease, we demonstrate that germline variants in highly expressed and amplified genes influence somatic evolution by modulating immunoediting at early stages of tumor development. Specifically, we show that the burden of germline-derived epitopes in recurrently amplified genes selects against somatic gene amplification in pre-invasive and invasive breast cancer. As a representative example, individuals with high burden of germline-derived epitopes in <i>ERBB2<\/i> are significantly less likely to develop HER2+ breast cancer than ER+ or triple negative breast cancer. The same negative association between epitope burden and somatic amplification is observed for four recurrent amplicons observed in high risk ER+ breast tumors. No association was observed between somatic amplifications and epitope burden in metastatic breast cancer suggesting a subset of tumors are able to overcome immune-mediated negative selection. Tumors that do are more aggressive and demonstrate an &#8220;immune cold&#8221; phenotype. Taken together, these data show the germline genome plays a pivotal role in dictating somatic evolution in breast cancer. Exploiting germline-mediated immunoediting may facilitate the development of blood-based biomarkers that refine risk stratification within breast cancer subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Antigen presentation,Genetic polymorphism,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kathleen Houlahan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aziz Khan<sup><\/sup>, Christina Curtis<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Stanford University, Stanford, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c8e9398e-75dc-444f-ab22-ecec2876696f","ControlNumber":"3608","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Understanding this dynamic tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is important to guide treatment and develop novel therapies and markers. We have previously validated immuno-oncology gene expression signatures (DetermaIO (DTIO) and a 101-gene algorithm), that predict efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) based on distinguishing immunomodulatory (IM), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and mesenchymal (M) phenotypes. In this study we used TCGA and clinical cohorts to identify immune infiltrate populations within these defined TIME spaces and their association with ICI treatment.<br \/>Methods: We derived novel human immune infiltrate signatures from a translation of murine ImmGen cell populations and a search for conserved co-expression of immune markers across multiple tumors. In total, 20 tumors from TCGA were employed for derivation and analysis encompassing 7163 unique samples. These novel signatures were compared to published immune infiltrate signatures and then their association with ICI efficacy and each other assessed in three cohorts treated with ICI therapy, IMvigor210 and an additional bladder cohort, comprising 272 and 89 patients with censored outcome results, and a melanoma cohort (N=105).<br \/>Results: The ImmGen analysis created 35 immune cell signatures and pan-tumor conserved co-expression of immune markers created eight signatures. The co-expression signatures often contained a mixed population of cell-type markers, though largely dominated by either myeloid or lymphoid markers. These signatures showed highly reproducible proportions of samples with strong expression between train and test TCGA sets. Most immune signatures had their highest representation in IM and DTIO+ tumors, however there was also consistent identification of presumptive immune infiltrate presence in MSL, M and DTIO negative cases. Two of the conserved co-expression signatures, one comprised of B-cell markers, and the other of T cell and other lymphoid markers, were associated with ICI efficacy in IMvigor210 and validated in the other &#8220;real-world&#8221; bladder cohort (B-cell: OR=0.8, p=0.022, T lymphoid: OR=0.7, p=0.005). Both signatures also had significant association with outcome in the cohort with clinical response outcomes, being strongest in patients after treatment had initiated.<br \/>Conclusions: These cell-type signatures may be identifying novel immune infiltrate populations that co-exist within the tumor immune microenvironment and are potentially predictive of ICI response. The two signatures were not independent of DTIO in either cohort, suggesting that the 27-gene algorithm DTIO largely incorporates this information. This analysis begins to dissect the complex physiology of the tumor immune microenvironment that mediates response to immune therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Immune Infiltrates ,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Brian  Z.

We studied two murine orthotopic, transplantable syngeneic models of HGSOC, one that displays excellent response to carboplatin\/paclitaxel (60577) and one that is resistant to treatment (HGS2)<sup>1<\/sup>. Using immunohistochemistry, we stained omental tumors from both models for the ECM components fibronectin (FN1), collagen 1A1 (COL1A1) and versican (VCAN), also using Masson&#8217;s Trichrome to stain for collagen. We analyzed their abundance, textural features (Haralick features) and structure with the image analysis softwares, QuPath and TWOMBLI respectively. A compilation of 44 ECM metrics, which we named the &#8220;structure index&#8221;, correlated with response to chemotherapy, as measured by reduction in omental tumor weight. In parallel, we performed RNAseq on the omental tumors, identifying clusters of genes that change over time with chemotherapy treatment of the responsive model 60577, while the chemoresistant model HGS2 displayed limited alteration of gene expression. We integrated RNAseq and ECM structure and texture data, and showed the structure index was correlated with 144 core matrisome genes. To identify potential therapeutic targets, we then focused our study on genes that remained highly expressed in resistant tumors post chemotherapy, but were originally low or decreased with treatment in the sensitive tumors. Members of the LOX and P4HA family were found amongst these genes. We confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis that expression of LOX, LOXL2, P4HA1 and P4HA2 was downregulated by chemotherapy in the 60577 chemo-sensitive tumors while their levels remained relatively unaffected in the resistant HGS2 tumors. This study refines our understanding of the mechanisms of microenvironmental chemoresistance in HGSOC, highlighting putative therapeutic targets to increase the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.<br \/>1 Maniati, E.<i> et al.<\/i> Mouse Ovarian Cancer Models Recapitulate the Human Tumor Microenvironment and Patient Response to Treatment. <i>Cell Rep<\/i> <b>30<\/b>, 525-540.e527, doi:10.1016\/j.celrep.2019.12.034 (2020).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Chemotherapy response,Ovarian cancer,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Panoraia Kotantaki<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Florian Laforêts<sup><\/sup>, Eleni Maniati<sup><\/sup>, Chiara Berlato<sup><\/sup>, Anna Malliouri<sup><\/sup>, Michael John Devlin<sup><\/sup>, Beatrice Malacrida<sup><\/sup>, Samar Elorbany<sup><\/sup>, Ranjit Manchanda<sup><\/sup>, Frances  R.

The onset and progression of cancer are generally suppressed by the action of immune cells, which is an inflammatory response. MDSCs are thought to promote cancer progression and invasion by suppressing the function of immune cells, making them potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets. We measured MDSCs in GC patients and observed more monocyte-derived MDSCs in peripheral blood in advanced GC than in early GC. However, granulocyte-derived MDSCs showed no difference in GC progression when markers for classical MDSCs were used. We considered that granulocyte-derived MDSCs were much more abundant than monocyte-derived MDSCs in peripheral blood and were involved in cancer progression. We hypothesized that we had a new granulocyte-derived marker for advanced GC that did not show differences in classical markers, but may have different functions, and aimed to identify a novel subset that may be a therapeutic and diagnostic target.<br \/>Method: For GC patients, we used heparin blood samples provided by patients who consented to Juntendo University. We analyzed the expression of various cell surface proteins against populations of CD33<sup>high<\/sup>, CD66b<sup>high<\/sup>, and HLA-DR<sup>low<\/sup> as classical markers of MDSCs derived from granulocytes of GC patients using FACS (Melody). MDSCs were isolated by a cell sorter and used for experiments such as RNA-Seq. Novel markers and involved cytokines were quantified in plasma components by cytometric bead array.<br \/>Result: The chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, CXCR4, and CXCR5 were highly expressed in MDSCs of advanced GC patients. The ability to suppress T-cell activation was also found to be stronger in MDSCs with advanced GC. In addition, IL-10 produced by MDSCs was also more abundant in the plasma of patients with advanced GC, as well as chemokines according to chemokine receptors.<br \/>Conclusion: The high expression of chemokine receptors on MDSCs in advanced GC may indicate that chemokines produced at the cancer site facilitate the migration of MDSCs. These novel subsets of MDSCs found in advanced GC suggest that they may be new therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Gastric cancer,Flow cytometry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Suguru Yamauchi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takumi Iwasawa<sup>2<\/sup>, Tomoaki Ito<sup>3<\/sup>, Malcom  V.

Over the course of five years, the survival rate is &#60;20%, creating an urgent need for appropriate treatments against GEA. Currently, providing patients with peri-operative systemic docetaxel triplet-based chemotherapy (DCF or FLOT) is the most effective approach to treat GEA. Despite this, for 50% of patients that do present an initial response to therapy, the tumor returns due to pre-existing or newly acquired resistance (i.e., chemoresistance) by the cancer. Researchers have shifted their focus to the tumor microenvironment (TME) as one of the factors influencing chemoresistance in patients. The TME is composed of tumor cells, immune cells and their secreted products, as well as fibroblasts. The components of the TME have been shown to interact with one another to influence tumor growth and progression. Fibroblasts are wound-healing cells that can be transformed into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in response to stress and the release of inflammatory products. CAFs are the most abundant cells in the TME, yet their role in the chemoresponse of GEA is still unclear. Previous studies on other cancer types demonstrated that CAF expression is distinct between chemoresistant and chemo-sensitive tumors and certain CAF subpopulations may confer this resistance. This project will investigate the role of CAFs in the chemo-response of GEA using patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and CAFs from &#62;200 GEA patients. A single-cell RNA sequencing atlas developed from &#62;30 GEA DCF- or FLOT-treated patient samples will be used to identify CAF markers and targetable processes. CAF sub-populations will then be elucidated and correlated to tumor response. IF, FACS, and ELISA will be performed for subsequent CAF marker validation and characterization. Ex vivo drug testing with DCF or FLOT will be conducted on PDO-CAF co-cultures to recapitulate their drug response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Chemoresistance,Personalized medicine,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kulsum Tai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sanjima Pal<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Bérubé<sup>1<\/sup>, Iris Kong<sup>1<\/sup>, Adam Hoffman<sup>1<\/sup>, Swneke Bailey<sup>1<\/sup>, Aki Kirbizakis<sup>1<\/sup>, Sui Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Strasser<sup>2<\/sup>, David Gibbs<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicholas Bertos<sup>1<\/sup>, Veena Sangwan<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorenzo Ferri<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Institute of Systems Biology, Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4743981f-effb-4511-a9aa-273dcb278488","ControlNumber":"3113","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

However, characterizing the malignant and stromal cells that make up STSs and correlating their abundance with clinical outcomes has proven difficult in fixed clinical specimens. We employed a machine learning framework called EcoTyper (Luca et al. Cell 2021) to identify cell type-specific transcriptional states and define tumor ecotypes consisting of co-occurring cell states from bulk transcriptomes. Analyzing 292 previously published STSs profiled by bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), we identified 23 transcriptionally-defined sarcoma cell states in malignant, immune, and other stromal cells and validated the majority of these cell states using single cell RNA-Seq. Although sarcomas originate from mesenchymal tissues, we identified four epithelial-like sarcoma cell states and observed epithelial differentiation and expression of epithelial markers within malignant sarcoma cells across histologies. Cell states reflected known and novel cell phenotypes and many were strongly associated with patient outcomes in our RNA-Seq training cohort and an independent validation cohort of STSs profiled by microarray (n=309). By identifying co-occurring cell states across STSs, we discovered 3 sarcoma ecotypes associated with underlying genomic alterations and distinct clinical outcomes. On spatial transcriptomic analysis, we observed co-localization of cell states within the same sarcoma ecotypes and spatial aggregation of ecotypes within STSs, suggesting that sarcoma ecotypes represent distinct functional units within human sarcomas. One ecotype (sarcoma ecotype 3: SE3) defined by <i>CLEC5A\/SPP1+<\/i> M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages and MYC\/MTORC1-activated epithelial-like malignant cells was associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) in the RNA-Seq training cohort (P=0.01) and inferior metastasis-free survival in the microarray validation cohort (P=0.002). Remarkably, SE3 was associated with improved PFS in patients with metastatic STSs treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab (n=38, P=0.003) but not patients treated with chemotherapy. Furthermore, SE3 outperformed previously reported predictors of immunotherapy response in STSs, PD-L1 expression and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), for predicting response to immunotherapy (AUCs: SE3 0.87; PD-L1 0.81; TLS 0.62). Finally, SE3 similarly predicted response to immunotherapy in an independent validation cohort (n=29, AUC 0.89). In summary, our findings provide a high-resolution cell atlas of STSs to guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In addition, we have identified a predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint inhibition that may enable personalization of systemic therapy in patients with advanced STSs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ajay Subramanian<sup>1<\/sup>, Neda Nemat-Gorgani<sup>1<\/sup>, Timothy J.

Recently we reported that TTFields disrupt primary cilia on GBM cells which lowers resistance to standard of care temozolomide chemotherapy. Here we asked if concomitant or sequential treatment of TTFields with other agents that interfere with GBM ciliogenesis enhance TTFields efficacy. Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) plays both a role in promoting cilia disassembly and regulating GBM growth in xenograft models. We found that within 24hr of treatment with the AURKA inhibitor, Alisertib, there was surprising and significant decrease in GBM cilia frequency across multiple GBM patient derived lines. However, similar Alisertib treatment did not affect neuronal or glial cilia frequencies in mixed primary cell cultures from mouse forebrain. Notably, overnight treatment of patient GBM biopsy ex vivo with Alisertib also resulted in reduced cilia frequency within the tumor tissue. Next, we co- or sequentially treated several different GBM patient cell lines with 24hr of 200kHz TTFields together with or followed by 250nM or 1&#181;M Alisertib and examined the subsequent expansion of cells in vitro. We observed a significant synergistic reduction in cell proliferation compared to either treatment alone. However, this synergistic effect does not appear to be cilia-dependent as dual treatment reduction in proliferation was still observed in cell lines lacking different key cilia genes or in GBM cells that naturally lack cilia. Considering Alisertib crosses the blood brain barrier and inhibits intracranial growth of tumors, our data warrant investigation of whether concomitant or sequential treatment of TTFields and Alisertib in vivo can further prolong survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Aurora kinase,Glioblastoma,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jia Tian<sup><\/sup>, Julianne Mallinger<sup><\/sup>, Ping Shi<sup><\/sup>, Dahao Ling<sup><\/sup>, Loic Deleyrolle<sup><\/sup>, Min Lin<sup><\/sup>, Habibeh Khoshbouei<sup><\/sup>, <b>Matthew Sarkisian<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Florida, Gainesville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6518b049-2a4c-447a-8434-a05663f58c08","ControlNumber":"3740","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Characterization of PD-L1 protein has revealed multiple secreted forms; soluble (sPD-L1) and exosomal (ExoPD-L1) variants. In the tumor microenvironment these interfere with T-cell activation, facilitating tumor immune evasion. High circulating levels of sPD-L1 are correlated with advanced disease, a worse prognosis and\/or poor response to ICIs. High levels of ExoPD-L1 are reported to contribute to T-cell dysfunction. NUC-7738, a ProTide transformation of 3'-deoxyadenosine (3&#8217;-dA), currently in Phase 1\/2 in patients with solid tumors (NuTide:701 NCT03829254), has shown encouraging efficacy signals in several tumor types, including melanoma. This study investigates the dynamic between NUC-7738 and secreted forms of PD-L1 in a melanoma cell line and patients.<br \/>Material and Methods: A375 malignant melanoma cells were treated with NUC-7738 (10 &#956;M) or DMSO for 6 - 72 hours. Cell supernatant was collected for sPD-L1 and ExoPD-L1 analysis and cells were measured for mRNA and metabolites. sPD-L1 mRNA and protein expression were measured in supernatant using RT-qPCR and sandwich ELISA, respectively. NUC-7738 and 3&#8217;-dATP were measured by LC-MS. ExoPD-L1 protein levels were assessed by Jess Western analysis (normalized to CD81) and PD-L1 cell surface expression by flow cytometry. Findings were validated in patient plasma samples taken before and 24 hours after C1D1 treatment with NUC-7738 and prior to C2D1of a 14-day cycle.<br \/>Results: NUC-7738 was converted into anti-cancer metabolite 3&#8217;-dATP within 6 hours of treatment with an average concentration of 80 pmoles \/10<sup>6<\/sup> cells, which was maintained for at least 24 hours and decreased by approximately 50% by 72 hours. The levels are comparable to those measured in PBMCs from patients treated with NUC-7738. NUC-7738 treatment reduced sPD-L1 mRNA expression by up to 40% and caused a time dependent decrease in sPD-L1 protein in the media supernatant by up to 3-fold. NUC-7738 also reduced ExoPD-L1 protein by 50%. NUC-7738 did not alter cell surface PD-L1 expression. Preliminary studies in serum from 4 study patients treated with NUC-7738 showed reductions in Exo-PD-L1 of &#8804;50% compared to pre-treatment levels.<br \/>Conclusion: NUC-7738 reduces secreted forms of PD-L1 whilst having no effect on cell surface protein levels.

Prior studies note improvements in checkpoint immunotherapy responsiveness in patients with a gPV, which is associated with an increased neo-antigen load in gPV patients. We have also previously reported improvements in melanoma specific survival (MSS) in gPV patients vs non-gPV. No studies to date have examined the immune environment in gPV patients which may account for improvements in survival. In our study, melanoma patients with a personal or family history of multiple cancers were offered germline testing utilizing a commercial germline cancer sequencing panel. Enrolled patients also received a blood draw with subsequent flow cytometry to analyze the immune phenotype. In a cohort of 540 melanoma patients, 80 had a gPV. Multivariable linear regression indicated that significantly fewer polymorphonuclear myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC&#8217;s) were noted relative to non-gPV patients when adjusting for melanoma stage at germline testing [&#946; = -.45, 95% CI (-.76, -.15), p = .0036]. This difference was most significant in cutaneous, later stage (IIB-IV) patients, primarily stage III. We also interrogated patterns in gene signature between gPV and non-gPV patients in the TCGA PanCancer cutaneous melanoma cohort. We identified reductions in CCL27 (p = .007) and CCL1 (p = .06), genes associated with MDSC recruitment, across all stages in gPV patients, as well as reductions in ARG1 (p= .05) and S100A7 (p = .08), genes associated with PMN-MDSC&#8217;s, in later stage gPV patients. Pathway differences were analyzed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Analysis of Hallmark gene sets identified significantly upregulated signatures in inflammatory response, TNF-&#945; signaling, IFN-&#947; signaling, and IL-2 STAT5 signaling in late stage gPV patients. KEGG pathway analysis further identified NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and TCR signaling as significantly upregulated in late stage gPV patients. Notably, fatty acid metabolism pathways, which have been implicated in immunosuppression through MDSC suppressive function, were downregulated in gPV patients. These results suggest that gPV melanoma is associated with both a depletion of PMN-MDSC&#8217;s and an upregulation of inflammatory microenvironmental genes in later stages which may explain improved outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Inflammation,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alan Shen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Roshan Lodha<sup>1<\/sup>, Brandon Bungo<sup>2<\/sup>, Michelle Arbesman<sup>1<\/sup>, Nikhil Pramod<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Ko<sup>3<\/sup>, Brian Gastman<sup>3<\/sup>, C.

Previous studies have identified agonistic activation of the CD11b integrin as a potential strategy to enhance anti-tumor immunity. However, the mechanisms by which CD11b-agonism reprogram tumor immunity are poorly understood, and this may impair patient selection and identification of effective treatment combinations. Here we will use a combination of in vitro systems, animal models, and samples from first in human clinical trials of the CD11b-agonist to identify the mechanism of action of this approach and identify combinations for further testing. CD11b agonism alters tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotypes by simultaneously repressing NF&#954;B\/IL1-signaling and activating interferon (IFN) gene expression. Repression of NF&#954;B\/IL-1 signaling was due to rapid degradation of p65 protein by the proteosome, contributing to suppressing myeloid cells infiltration. In contrast, CD11b agonism triggers mitochondrial dysfunction to stimulate STING-induced, STAT1-mediated interferon signaling, contributing to macrophages-augmented anti-tumor T cell immunity. Tissues from phase I clinical trials shows that CD11b agonist activates STING and STAT1 signaling in TAMs in human tumors, which is in consistent with preclinical data. Furthermore, combining CD11b agonism with cytotoxic therapies, STING agonist or TLRs agonists leads to robust anti-tumor activity in PDAC models. These studies pave the way for mechanism-based therapeutic combination strategies in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immune response,STAT1,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiuting Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Graham Hogg<sup>1<\/sup>, Chong Zuo<sup>1<\/sup>, John Baer<sup>1<\/sup>, Varintra Lander<sup>1<\/sup>, Liang Kang<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicholas Borcherding<sup>1<\/sup>, Brett Knolhoff<sup>1<\/sup>, Robin Osterhout<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Galkin<sup>2<\/sup>, Jean Bruey<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Carter<sup>2<\/sup>, Cedric Mpoy<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Schwarz<sup>1<\/sup>, Haeseong Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Vineet Gupta<sup>3<\/sup>, David DeNardo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO,<sup>2<\/sup>Gossamer Bio, San Diego, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9d5a912b-a03e-4a82-a1cb-a4b8b3e947d3","ControlNumber":"4000","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Its genetic inactivation in tumor cells has been implicated in tumor-intrinsic immune escape and immunotherapy resistance. Currently, the impact of B2M dysregulation on tumor-immune dynamics requires furthers characterization. Using a clinical dataset of patients with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), whole-exome sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing data from baseline tumor biopsies (n=295) were analyzed to identify somatic B2M alterations and evaluate correlative clinical outcomes, infiltrating immune cells, and gene expression patterns. No loss-of-function mutations in B2M were found; however, 50% of tumors had B2M alterations in the form of homozygous loss (n=2), loss of heterozygosity (LOH; n=56), or copy number gains (n=88). B2M LOH events were overrepresented in tumors from patients who progressed during ICB therapy compared to those who responded (34% versus 19%; Pearson chi-square test, p=0.035). Additionally, tumors with B2M LOH had lower B2M expression compared to B2M-unaltered tumors (Wilcoxon test, p=0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed reduced expression of immune and inflammatory signatures in B2M-LOH tumors. Furthermore, immune cell deconvolution showed that B2M-LOH tumors had lower total immune cell counts, but greater numbers and proportions of activated natural killer (NK) cells (Wilcoxon test, numbers p=0.021, proportions p=0.032). Differential gene expression analysis revealed concordant higher expression of human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), an NK cell inhibitory ligand, in B2M-LOH tumors (Wilcoxon test, p=0.0035). Moreover, B2M-LOH progressive tumors had the highest median HLA-G expression and trended toward a positive correlation between increasing HLA-G expression and increasing numbers of activated NK cells (Pearson correlation, r=0.55, p=0.015). In conclusion, melanoma biopsies with B2M LOH were associated with non-response to ICB, had increased presence of activated NK cells, and demonstrated a compensatory increase in HLA-G. These results suggest that in melanoma B2M alterations may be implicated in modulating NK cell interactions and point toward HLA-G potentially playing a role in inhibiting NK cell anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Malignant melanoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Beta-2-microglobulin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mildred Galvez<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Katie  M.

It is associated with progression of different types of cancer, mediating the antigen presentation, extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In recent studies, CTSS was suggested as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. We found that, with a CTSS inhibitor RJW-58 treatment over tumor-bearing mouse, the serum showed an enhanced anti-tumor cytokine releasing of interleukin 7 (IL-7). In the mRNA array results of 40 pair head and neck patients&#8217; sample, we found the negative correlation between CTSS and IL-7 comparing to the normal head and neck tissue. Moreover, we also found that the level of CD8 T cell infiltration is negatively correlated with the expression of CTSS in 20 head and neck cancer patients&#8217; slides. In cell model, targeting CTSS by siRNA or RJW-58 promoted IL-7 secretion in different head and neck cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that cathepsin S decreased the secretion level of IL-7 through downregulating IL-7 receptor, a receptor that mediating IL-7 secretion, protein expression level resulting in activating lysosomal degradation pathway. Promoting cell proliferation of activated CD8 T cells was proved when CD8 T cells were treated with the condition medium from CTSS-knockdown head and neck cancer cells. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrated that CTSS acted as a negative regulator in mediating IL-7 resulting in inducing an immune cell-suppressed microenvironment in head and neck cancer cells.

Patient-derived tumoroids offers unique advantage to integrate patients&#8217; heterogeneity, and the diversity of resistance mechanisms in the drug discovery and development pathway. Organization of the tumor microenvironment both at the tissue, and at the molecular levels, is another critical factor that regulate drug response, in particular for immunotherapy. In this study, we have focused on oncolytic virotherapy, a promising concept that still deserves optimization. Different physiological barriers might limit the efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs): (i) mutations limiting viral replication and spreading, (ii) structure of the tumor tissue (basement membrane, vasculature, immune cells among other actors), (iii) physical parameters (therapeutic pressure, physical barriers), and iv) anti-viral vector response (reticulo-endothelial system, neutralizing antibodies, complement).<br \/>Purpose of the Study: Development of an advanced <i>in vitro<\/i> model for NSCLC that would recapitulate major physical and biological barriers to the action of Vaccinia-based oncolytic vectors. Identification of major determinants of activity, and of R&#38;D axes for the design of improved OVs.<br \/>Experimental Approach: Lung tumor biopsies, and healthy tissues were obtained from the CRB of Strasbourg, and organoids were generated after an enzymatic treatment. Dissociated cells were mixed with exogenous microvessels derived from the adipose tissue. At day seven of the culture, patient-derived tumoroids and organoids (PDTs\/PDOs) were transferred and embedded in a hydrogel mimicking the extracellular matrix. OVs were applied in fluidic to mimic intravenous perfusion, and viral properties were analyzed at 24h and 96h timepoints. Specificity was demonstrated by direct comparison of PDTs and PDOs from the same patient. Addition of circulating PBMCs after 24h of infection allowed us to analyze the interaction of OV with immune effectors.<br \/>Results: Under fluidic conditions, mimicking intravenous infusion, we could confirm infection at the periphery of the lung PDT after only one hour of perfusion. IL-6 was significantly increased compared to IL-10, TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946; (seven times more than the untreated condition). Compared to a passive diffusion mode (static conditions) infection was lower, suggesting the laminar flow and the matrix become efficacy-limiting factors. Indeed, under fluidic conditions, infection and replication were observed one day later than passive diffusion mode. The contribution of endothelial cells, and of immune cells was also characterized. Some experiments are still ongoing, and results on neutralizing antibodies will be presented in the poster.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Organoids,Lung cancer,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Le Hélène<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Transgene S.A., Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"28e3f7cf-bd09-4c9c-9e46-3f74f43e9e4b","ControlNumber":"3474","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated immunosuppression is a critical feature in HNSCC TME. We provide evidence demonstrating that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is involved in macrophage polarization and remodeling of the HNSCC microenvironment. By interrogating the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma RNA sequencing dataset extracted from the TCGA database, we found that the levels of LIF and M2 macrophage markers (CD163, CD206, VEGF) were enhanced in tumors compared to normal counterparts. Higher LIF expression in tumors was further correlated with worse overall survival. Immunohistochemical analysis found that macrophages with higher LIF immunoreactivities were located at the periphery of HNSCC tumors. In a macrophage-cancer cell coculture system, the presence of LIF promoted the proliferation and mobility of cancer cells and induced an M2-dominant macrophage polarization. Stimulating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with LIF increased the expression of several M2 markers (CD163, CD206, CD209, and IL10) but decreased the expression of M1 markers (iNOS, CD80, and CD86). Moreover, LIF-treated macrophages exhibited little cancer cytotoxicity compared to vehicle-treated macrophages. Treating macrophages with soluble LIF receptor (sLIFR), a LIF antagonist, partly reversed the LIF-mediated M2 polarization and enhanced cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. Results of RNA-sequencing data demonstrated that LIF suppressed antigen presentation process, type I interferon production, TNFR signaling, and molecules participating in the Hippo signaling pathway in MDMs. Mechanistic studies found that LIF might trigger M2 polarization via activating YAP1, as reflected by a reduction of p-YAP1 (S127) and an enhanced YAP1 nuclear localization in macrophages. Treating macrophages with YAP1 inhibitors (Saracatinib and Verteporfin) blocked the LIF-mediated YAP1 nuclear translocation, expression of M2 markers, and tumor-promoting effects. Our findings suggest that the presence of LIF in HNSCC promotes macrophage M2 polarization through YAP1 signaling, which assists in establishing an immune-suppressive, tumor-promoting microenvironment. The blockade of LIF-mediated effects may tailor therapeutic strategies by converting the immunosuppressive microenvironment for selected HNSCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Macrophage,Leukemia inhibitory factor,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yun Hua Sui<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tzu Tung Liu<sup><\/sup>, Shu Chen Liu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Central University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1b55fc31-7643-45e3-b6ac-2e11b9e72f3c","ControlNumber":"4106","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.
