[{"Abstract":"Molecular diagnostics and research are key drivers for improving cancer diagnosis and therapies. This is a major source for laboratory test errors. For example, nucleic acids profiles can change drastically during patient specimen collection, transport, storage, and analyte isolation. This can make diagnostics or research outcomes unreliable or even wrong because analytical tests do not measure analyte profiles as they were in the patient body but instead artificial profiles generated during pre-analytical workflows. Developing and verifying suited pre-analytical workflows has consequently become a requirement for diagnostic tests developments. Scientific evidence generated by international consortia and new workflow solutions will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Uwe Olemueller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
