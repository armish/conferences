[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) continues to face major therapeutic challenges due to its innate and acquired chemoresistance. Oncogenic, activating <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations facilitate extensive cytokine-mediated crosstalk between tumor cells and the fibrotic stroma, producing a pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). We have identified interleukin-1&#945; (IL1&#945;), downstream of KRAS, as a critical mediator of the inflammatory response due to its pleiotropic effects on cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation and immune evasion. However, the regulatory mechanisms of IL1&#945; expression remain incompletely understood. We identified p38 stress-associated MAPK &#945; (p38&#945;) as a central, KRAS-driven regulatory pathway involved in IL1&#945; production within PDAC tumor cells.<br \/>Methods: Differential gene expression analyses were performed on patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was queried for overactive pathways downstream <i>KRAS<\/i> in &#8220;high-<i>IL1A<\/i>&#8221; PDAC cases. Inhibition of p38&#945; was achieved pharmacologically with pexmetinib and genetically with an shRNA lentiviral system in human and murine PDAC cell lines. ChIP-qPCR and co-immunoprecipitation were performed on a human PDAC cell line with and without p38&#945; inhibition. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry were performed on tumors from a PDAC murine model, <i>Ptf1a<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup>; LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>; Tgfbr2<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> (PKT), treated with or without pexmetinib. PKT mice were treated daily with pexmetinib, gemcitabine and paclitaxel chemotherapy, or combination therapy for downstream analysis and survival studies.<br \/>Results: Both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of p38&#945; significantly reduced <i>IL1A<\/i> transcription and protein levels in human and murine PDAC tumor cell lines. Furthermore, p38&#945; inhibition reduced binding of Sp1 and NF-&#954;B to the <i>IL1A<\/i> promoter and prevented IL1&#945;-mediated polarization of inflammatory CAFs <i>in vitro<\/i>. In PKT mice, p38&#945; inhibition reduced tumor cell-specific <i>Il1a<\/i> and inflammatory CAF gene signatures by scRNA-seq, and favorably altered the infiltrating immune populations by flow cytometry.<i> <\/i>Lastly, pexmetinib with chemotherapy significantly reduced tumor burden and improved overall survival in a PDAC murine model.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings provide a new therapeutic opportunity to target the p38&#945; MAPK pathway for suppression of IL1&#945;-mediated stromal activation and combination with chemotherapy to overcome therapeutic resistance by modulating the stromal and immune microenvironment in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-1,p38,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Chemosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samara Singh<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Austin  R.

Here, we first reported that ectopic overexpression of <i>RAC1<\/i> p.P29S and p.A159V mutations in a human HNSCC cell line (PECAPJ41 clone D2, ATCC, USA) could cause upregulation of PD-L1 at both mRNA (by RNA-seq) and protein levels (by Western blotting), first demonstrating a direct effect of <i>RAC1<\/i> mutations on potential HNSCC TIME modulation via PD-L1. Furthermore, by tumor immune estimation resources (TIMER) analysis, we found that <i>RAC1<\/i>-mutated tumors have significantly higher level of neutrophils immune infiltration of 38.63% (p=0.027) compared to the wildtype tumors. From the CIBERSORTx analysis, M2 Macrophages was significantly increased by 40.42% in <i>RAC1<\/i>-mutated tumors vs wildtype in the TCGA-HNSCC cohort (p=0.031).

Calcium signaling is implicated in processes relevant to the breast cancer tumor microenvironment and altered calcium influx is a feature of cancer associated fibroblasts. In these studies, simultaneous use of genetically encoded calcium indicators with distinct fluorescence spectral properties (GCaMP6m or JRCaMP1b), were used to explore the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and fibroblasts via calcium signaling and changes in different cellular compartments. HMF3S human fibroblast cells co-cultured with breast cancer cells expressing GCaMP6m or JRCaMP1b were assessed in 2D and 3D co-culture using automated epi-fluorescence or confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial calcium levels were assessed using targeted GCaMP6m (2mtGCaMP6m) in HMF3S cells expressing JRCaMP1b. Results showed distinct spatial and temporal changes in free calcium levels between both fibroblasts and breast cancer cells and the mitochondria and cytosol during activation. These methodological advances provide an opportunity to better understand calcium signaling in cancer associated fibroblasts. These techniques will also help identify the calcium channels and pumps that could be targeted to manipulate the breast cancer tumor microenvironment to inhibit pathways important in breast cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Calcium,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Breast cancer,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Alice  H.

Despite improved outcomes with current multimodal care, the prognosis for patients with metastatic disease is grim. Peripheral neural regulation of cancer growth has long been suggested by clinical observations in pancreatic and prostate cancers. Prior reports suggest peripheral nerve sprouting in osteosarcoma, but the functional roles of sensory nerves in osteosarcoma are unknown. Here, the role of TrkA<sup>+<\/sup> sensory nerves in OS disease progression was assayed.<br \/>Methods: All experiments were conducted under IACUC approval at Johns Hopkins University. TrkA<sup>F592A<\/sup> mice which are homozygous for a phenylalanine-to-alanine point mutation in exon 12 of <i>Ntrk1<\/i> gene were crossbred with NOD scid mice (TrkA<sup>F592A<\/sup>\/Scid). TrkA inhibition was performed by 1NMPP1 treatment. <i>In vivo<\/i> tumor growth was examined using a periosteal xenograft model. 1 million human 143B-luc OS cells were injected. Analysis was performed using serial measurements of tumor size and IVIS imaging. Nerve distribution and macrophage polarization within the tumor microenvironment was documented using immunostaining for Beta III Tubulin (TUBB3), CD86, CD206 and F4\/80.<br \/>Results: Inhibition of TrkA led to a significant reduction in Tubb3<sup>+<\/sup> nerves (88.4%) within and around the OS xenografts. In addition, tumors within TrkA<sup>F592A<\/sup>\/Scid animals demonstrated slower growth, including a 51.5% reduction in tumor size and 60.0% reduction in IVIS luciferase activity at 4 wks. Histologic examination showed a reduction in macrophage infiltration and reprogramming of macrophages from an M2-like to M1-like phenotype in tumors with chemical denervation. Remarkably, this was associated with a reduction in Ki67 proliferative index (80.1%) and CD31 immunofluorescent staining (60.8%) within the tumors. Overall survival of mice with TrkA inhibition was significantly prolonged (<i>p<\/i>=0.0003). Retrograde tracing identified the sensory nerve fibers innervating the periosteum originated from L3-L5 lumbar DRGs and RNA seq identified OS-derived neurotrophins and axon guidance molecules.<br \/>Discussion: Disruption of TrkA<sup>+<\/sup> nerves significantly mitigates OS disease progression in a mouse xenograft model, including a significant improved overall survival. These findings are associated with a reduction of macrophage infiltration and macrophage re-polarization. Ongoing studies are examining the molecular mechanisms that mediate nerve-to-macrophage interaction in peripheral nerves and DRG neurons using a combination of sequencing approaches.<br \/>Significance\/Clinical Relevance: Sensory neurons positively regulate osteosarcoma growth and disease progression. Use of chemical or microsurgical approaches to denervate tumors may represent a future adjunctive therapy to both improve pain and prognosis in high grade bone sarcomas. <b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Neuropilins,Macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qizhi Qin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sowmya Ramesh Ramesh<sup><\/sup>, Thomas  L.

Although prostate cancer grows slowly within the prostate glands, because of a lack of efficient treatments at the appropriate timing, cancer cells eventually become aggressive and metastatic. The progression of cancer is supported by many factors, such as signals received from surrounding cells, like B cells and other effector cells. B cells play a role as a part of the adaptive immune system to produce antibodies. To become mature B cells, they rely on activation of a non-receptor kinase, Bruton&#8217;s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). Preliminary data from our lab showed that in the prostate cancer tissues, more infiltrated B cells expressing BTK were present nearby the prostate cancer cells. Upon this finding, we hypothesize that BTK expressed B cells will support the survival of prostate cancer cells through BTK signaling. In this study, we will overexpress BTK in B cells to study the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells through a co-culture system. Our findings will show an increase in migration of prostate cancer cells when cultured with BTK expressed B cells. In the future, we will validate the importance of BTK in regulating prostate cancer migration and invasion; and identify their mechanisms. Our overall findings from this project would reveal key elements of the signaling pathways of BTK expressed B cells to promote prostate cancer migration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,B cells,BTK,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Crystal Byrd<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Geou- Yarh Liou<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, GA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"05170b54-72ed-4dda-950d-153af3e6bf37","ControlNumber":"2596","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Accumulation of HA is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to the anti-ErbB-2 agent trastuzumab (TZ) in breast cancer (BC). ErbB-2 receptor is overexpressed in 15-20% of BC patients (ErbB-2+) and constitutes an important therapeutic target. Despite the clinical efficiency of therapies targeting ErbB-2, resistance to these drugs remains a major issue. In addition to its membrane function, ErbB-2 migrates to the nucleus (NErbB-2) where it acts as a transcription factor (TF) or as a coactivator of TF, modulating proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to anti-ErbB-2 therapies in BC. CD44 has also been found in the nucleus (NCD44). Although crosstalk between HA\/CD44 and ErbB-2 pathways has been reported, how their molecular interactions mediate TZ resistance remains poorly known. Our <i>in silico<\/i> studies showed that TZ-resistant cells express higher CD44 levels than TZ-sensitive ones. We previously reported that stimulation with the ErbBs ligand heregulin (HRG) induces NErbB-2 translocation, acquired-TZ resistance and proliferation in the TZ-sensitive SK-BR-3 cell line. Here, we found that HRG also increased CD44 mRNA expression in SK-BR-3 cells. Then, we explored the role of HA in modulating CD44 and ErbB-2 nuclear localization in BC cells. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy studies showed that stimulation with exogenous HA induced nuclear translocation of ErbB-2 in T47D cells. Interestingly, we found constitutive presence of CD44 and ErbB-2 protein in nuclear lysates of JIMT-1 cells, a <i>de novo<\/i> TZ-resistant BC model. HA stimuli further enhanced this nuclear localization. Contrarily, treatment with the chemical inhibitor of HA synthesis 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) decreased not only HA levels but also NErbB-2 in JIMT-1 cells. Furthermore, 4MU inhibited the proliferation of two TZ-resistant cell lines, JIMT-1 and MDA-MB-453, in a dose-dependent manner. 4MU also inhibited HRG-induced proliferation in SK-BR-3 cells. Even more, wound-healing assays showed that 4MU inhibited migration of JIMT-1 cells. This inhibition was similar to the one observed when ErbB-2 was excluded from the nucleus via transfection with the hErbB-2&#916;NLS mutant. In summary, we reveal that HA induces CD44 and ErbB-2 nuclear localization in BC cells, suggesting a novel crosstalk between HA\/CD44 and ErbB-2 pathways. These findings also highlight the blockade of HA synthesis with 4MU as a novel therapeutic strategy in TZ-resistant BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hyaluronan,CD44,ErbB2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Santiago Madera<sup><\/sup>, Valentina C.

Novel actionable targets and complementary therapies are critically needed. AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase, drives pleiotropic phenotypes of TNBC and IBC aggressiveness. Targeting AXL reduces IBC tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> and inhibits polarization of M2 macrophages. To identify novel tumor microenvironment (TME) targets to enhance the efficacy of AXL-targeted therapy, we conducted a synthetic lethal kinome siRNA screening. We identified TBK1 as a candidate to synergize with AXL growth inhibition. TBK1 is a serine\/threonine protein kinase that regulates innate, adaptive responses and antitumor immune responses. We hypothesized that inhibition of TBK1 enhances the antitumor effect of AXL-targeted therapy in aggressive breast cancers.<br \/>Methods: We used knockdown, knockout (KO) and inhibitors to suppress AXL and TBK1 pathways and tested the synergistic effect of targeting AXL and TBK1 on the growth of human SUM149 and BCX010 IBC cells, and HS578T TNBC cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. To determine the synergistic effect of targeting both pathways <i>in vivo<\/i>, we inoculated control or TBK1 KO murine TNBC 4T1.2 cells into BALB\/c mice. We assessed the activity of AXL inhibitor TP-0903 in reducing tumor growth. Using multicolor flow cytometry, we studied the effects of targeting AXL and TBK1 on the TME. We tested the activity of TP-0903 combined with a TBK1 inhibitor in another TNBC mouse model, E0771. We used RNA-sequencing and real-time PCR\/Western blot to determine the molecular mechanisms of how TBK1 inhibition synergizes AXL-targeted therapy in these cancers.<br \/>Results: Compared with AXL or TBK1 suppression alone, genomic or pharmacologic suppression of AXL and TBK1 significantly reduced the growth of SUM149, BCX010, and HST578T cells<i> in vitro<\/i>. In both 4T1.2 and E0771 syngeneic mouse models, TP-0903 was more active in reducing tumor growth in TBK1-inhibited tumors than in control tumors. Tumors with TBK1 inhibition and treated with TP-0903 had a significantly higher population of cytotoxic T cells than control tumors. Depletion of CD8+ T cells blocked the synergistic effect of targeting AXL and TBK1 pathways on reducing tumor growth, suggesting that cytotoxic T cells contributed to the anti-tumor synergy of targeting AXL and TBK1. Mechanistically, TBK1 induced M2 macrophage migration via IRF3-regulated CCL5 secretion in SUM149 and HS578T cells, and AXL KO attenuated the polarization and migration of M2 macrophages by inhibiting the CCR5\/CCL5 axis.<br \/>Conclusions: Targeting TBK1 enhances the efficacy of AXL-targeted therapy in aggressive breast cancer by suppressing the paracrine effect of CCR5\/CCL5 axis. This combination represents a novel and effective therapy modulating the TME of aggressive breast cancer, which warrants further investigation in the clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,Tumor microenvironment,Inflammatory breast cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lan Phi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takashi Semba<sup>1<\/sup>, Ngu  V.

We previously reported that liver endothelial cells (ECs), a key component of the liver microenvironment, secrete LRG1 to promote CRC growth via activating human epidermal growth factor receptor (ERbB3, also known as HER3). However, we found that LRG1-induced HER3 activation is distinct from the canonical neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-induced HER3 pathway. The present study further validated LRG1 as a new HER3 ligand for promoting mCRC growth and elucidated the novel downstream signaling pathway induced by LRG1-HER3.<br \/>Methods: We first measured the binding affinity between HER3 and LRG1 by Biolayer interferometry (BLI). We then used <i>in vitro<\/i> and<i> in vivo <\/i>xenograft approaches to determine the effect of LRG1 monoclonal antibody (15C4) on HER3 activation and CRC growth. To further determine the role of LRG1 in promoting CRC growth in the liver, we used murine CRC cells in a syngeneic orthotropic liver injection model to establish CRC allografts in the liver of LRG1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice with systemic LRG1 knockout and wild-type siblings (LRG1<sup>+\/+<\/sup>). We also performed unbiased phospho-MS analysis and subsequent validations to determine the downstream signaling pathway activated by LRG1-HER3.<br \/>Results: We identified that LRG1 binds to HER3 with the affinity at ~100nM. The LRG1 antibody 15C4 completely attenuated LRG1-induced HER3 activation and <i>in vitro<\/i> and xenograft growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Moreover, LRG1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice with CRC allografts in the liver had 2 times longer overall survival than tumor-bearing LRG1<sup>+\/+<\/sup> mice. Lastly, unbiased -omics analysis identified eIF4-protein synthesis is significantly activated by LRG1. With target-specific inhibitors, we further determined that LRG1-HER3 activates the PI3K-PDK1-RSK1\/3-eIF4 axis independent of AKT.<br \/>Conclusions: We identified LRG1 as a novel HER3 ligand and demonstrated that the liver microenvironment-derived LRG1 plays a key oncogenic role in mCRC, by activating a novel RSK-eIF4 survival pathway.

Both the cellular and the extracellular compartments of the tumor microenvironment (TME) can contribute to the evolution of BC by immune escape and immune suppression processes. In this context, structural and extracellular components of the TME, namely the extracellular matrix (ECM), has been shown to contribute to many aspects of tumor progression, exerting important regulatory functions on tumor cells. The relevance of the ECM in cancer progression is strengthened by study showing that the ECM composition is a prognostic factor able to identify patients subgroups endowed with a different clinical outcome according to the distinct enrichment in ECM genes leading to four specific ECM signatures (ECM 1-4). Among the different ECM-related signatures, only the ECM3 signature - characterizing about 35 % of HGBC - identifies the most aggressive tumors with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, poor prognosis, T-cell exclusion and an increased infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To evaluate whether local immune suppressive features of ECM3+ tumors can be intercepted in the peripheral blood (PB), to represent a potential biomarker for this subset of tumors, we collected consecutive HGBC patients that included 22 ECM3+ and 30 ECM3- and performed a multiparametric flow cytometry analysis. We found PD-1<sup>neg<\/sup> Treg being correlated to ECM3 patients and through ad hoc mouse BC models, we provided the mechanisms through which SPARC, a key functional gene of the ECM3 signature, was responsible for the down-modulation of PD-1 on Treg, positively affecting their suppressive activity. By sustaining the release of IL-23, SPARC promotes SATB1 expression that repress PD-1. Notably, fluvastatin treatment in vivo decreased the expression of SATB1 in treated Treg cells, a result paralleled by an increased expression of PD-1 on Treg cells. Our data extend the regulatory activity of the extracellular matrix and SPARC, which are large characterized for myeloid cells, to regulatory T-cells also offering new possible targets for the treatment of high-grade breast tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giovanna Talarico<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mara Lecchi<sup>2<\/sup>, Massimo Costanza<sup>3<\/sup>, Claudia Chiodoni<sup>2<\/sup>, Vera Cappelletti<sup>2<\/sup>, Paolo Verderio<sup>2<\/sup>, Massimo Di Nicola<sup>2<\/sup>, Francesco Bertolini<sup>1<\/sup>, Mario Paolo Colombo<sup>2<\/sup>, Sabina Sangaletti<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta, Milan, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c35e6a17-ca21-4bc9-989e-fba8c10e61a3","ControlNumber":"2809","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Current single-cell RNA sequencing technologies itself could enable the exploration of gene expression heterogeneity at the single cell level, but they cannot require the morphological information within the tumor, nor the protein profiles of individual cells. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an in situ RNA capturing technique which preserved the spatial information of histological tissue section, and CITE-Seq is a method to preform scRNA sequencing along with acquiring protein information on a single cell level. Combining CITE-Seq and ST together can enable us to understand the roles of specific cell subpopulations and their interactions in tumor microenvironment at RNA, protein and spatial level at the same time. KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer, and AMG510 is a small covalent specific KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors by blocking KRAS in its GDP-bound state, which leads to the regression of tumors and improved the anti-tumor efficacy. But the intrinsic mechanism of AMG510 in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not fully understood. Therefore, we develop a multi-omics method to find the mechanism of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor AMG510 in NSCLC.<br \/>Material and Method: We established a NSCLC HSC-humanized NOG-EXL model, treated it with vehicle and AMG510, and collected 3 tumor tissues from each group. Samples were processed and cDNA library of CITE-seq were constructed based on the protocol of TotalSeq-B Human Universal Cocktail (BioLegend) and Single Cell 3&#8217; Reagent Kits v3.1 (10x Genomics). Spatial sample preparation and cDNA library generation was carried out following the user guide of Visium FFPE Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits (10X Genomics). All the final libraries were sequenced by NovaSeq platform. After obtained feature-cell\/spot matrix, data preprocessing and analysis were performed in R environment. Cell components in the tumor microenvironment were annotated by a cross-validated multi-approaches using CITE-seq data. And ST data were further analyzed by integrating CITE-seq data.<br \/>Results: Using a multi-omics analysis system, firstly, we constructed a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of NSCLC tumor microenvironment; and then explored the characterization of cell-type infiltration. Furthermore, CITE-seq and ST datasets were integrated to assess the spatial organization of infiltrated immune cells and tumor cells. We found how AMG510 affected tumor microenvironment and enhanced the checkpoint pathways. The results in return proved the reliability of the multi-omics system, which enables us to explore how drugs treat cancer by affecting its microenvironment in multiple levels.<br \/>Summary: We established a multi-omics analysis system and explored the mechanism of the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor AMG510 against the NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Single cell,Cancer immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Panpan Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Huacheng He<sup><\/sup>, Jingjing Wang<sup><\/sup>, Ting Ni<sup><\/sup>, Dan Lu<sup><\/sup>, Qiangqiang Fan<sup><\/sup>, Wenting Shi<sup><\/sup>, Qingyang Gu<sup><\/sup>, Qiyao Zhang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Oncology & Immunology Unit, WuXi Biology, WuXi AppTec, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"81a5e8e5-dc52-41f2-9b31-7c4c5baf949e","ControlNumber":"2708","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

KRAS mutations are not only associated with poor patient survival, but also with increased tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. Tumor development and metastasis are impacted by intercellular communication. Key mediators of cell-to-cell communication include vesicles secreted by cells, also known as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs released by cancer cells can mediate malignant transformation of non-cancerous cells as well as influence pre-metastatic niche formation. Conversely, inhibiting the secretion and release of EVs by cancer cells decreases tumor growth and metastasis. However, the mechanisms through which EVs drive tumorigenesis in KRAS mutant tumors are still understudied.<i> <\/i>Our lab recently reported that EVs from lung cancer cells drive invasion of non-tumorigenic lung epithelial cells<i>. <\/i>Here, we found that KRAS oncogenic signaling in the donor cells contributes to the EV-driven migration and invasion of non-tumorigenic lung epithelial cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that KRAS signaling drives immune evasion and promotes an &#8220;immune cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment. Our preliminary studies showed that EVs derived from Kras<sup>G12C<\/sup> lung cancer cells (H358) inhibit T cell proliferation and that blocking KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> signaling, using ARS-1620 (Kras<sup>G12C <\/sup>inhibitor), impairs EV-driven T cell immunosuppression. We performed a comprehensive proteomic comparison between EVs isolated from H358 treated with ARS-1620 and those isolated from cells treated with DMSO (vehicle) and identified proteins involved in migration and invasion, such as LAMB-3, to be downregulated in EVs isolated from ARS-1620 treated cells. Ongoing studies aim to pinpoint the detailed mechanisms by which cancer cells utilize mutant KRAS signaling to promote loading of oncogenic cargo into EVs, and the resulting contributions to tumorigenesis and immune evasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Extracellular vesicles,,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zulaida  M.

Pancreatic cancer accounts for almost as many deaths as cases because of its poor prognosis. Many studies have led to the paradigm that stromal elements contribute to pancreatic tumor growth. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a primary cell type in the desmoplastic stroma in PDAC, and targeting them to improve PDAC treatment is thought to be a promising strategy, however; studies have shown both tumor-promoting and tumor-limiting activities associated with PDAC CAFs. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is one of the most well-described tumor suppressor genes and can regulate essential transcription factors in stromal fibroblasts. On the other hand, STAT3 signaling in pancreatic CAFs contributes to the immunosuppressive and fibrotic stroma observed with disease progression. In this study, we used novel, dual recombinase mouse models of PDAC, with Kras and p53 mutations engineered in the pancreatic epithelium (Flp-based) and Stat3 deleted in a subpopulation of CAFS (Cre). CAFs isolated from these mice were used to probe PTEN-STAT3 interaction in vitro using the Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) and by ChIP-seq using an RNA seq. Mouse and Human pancreatic tumor samples were analyzed and quantified using multiplex-immunofluorescence and multispectral imaging. In the mouse genetic model, we found PTEN downregulated in ~80% of CAFs, consistent with previous work from our group that demonstrated PTEN loss in 25% of PDAC patient samples. At the same time, pY705-STAT3 was activated in CAFs, and deletion of STAT3 in CAFs correlated with increased survival, decreased M2-like macrophages, and increased T-cell infiltration. STAT3 ablation in CAFS resulted in the re-expression of PTEN in CAFS, implying an autoregulatory loop. PLA on CAFs isolated revealed that IL6 treatment resulted in the transfer of a STAT3-PTEN protein complex into the nucleus ChIP-seq on CAFs with PTEN STAT3 antibodies revealed a significant overlap in PTEN and STAT3 occupation of gene promoters. This result is consistent with <i>in silico<\/i> analysis on the PTEN and STAT3 ChIP-Seq data in human cell lines. ChIP-Seq data is being interacted with RNA data to identify essential target genes. Human PDAC tissue microarrays are stained with pSTAT3, PTEN, CD3, and CD8.Our study suggests an autoregulatory look between PTEN and STAT3 in PDAC CAFs. PTEN may suppress specific STAT3 target genes through direct interactions with chromatin. Alternatively, PTEN\/STAT3 complexes may target CAF genes that suppress tumor growth or activate anti-tumor immune responses. These investigations could identify potential targets in CAFs for restoring the anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Microenvironment,Fibroblasts,Stroma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samaneh Saberi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sudarshana Sharma<sup><\/sup>, Cameron Bumbleburg<sup><\/sup>, Julia  E.

There is no cure for advanced-stage CTCL, the remissions are generally rare and short, and the overall survival is around 5 years with an impaired quality of life. Thus, the development of new treatments inducing longstanding responses in CTCL is a major unmet need (2).<br \/>Because S&#233;zary cells express several Treg markers as PD-1, ICOS, CD39 or CCR8 (3), we analyzed the expression of CD51, the &#945;V integrin, which is expressed with the &#946;8 integrin on Treg cells (4). CD51 is involved in the production of active form of TGF-&#946;, a cytokine with immunosuppressive properties that promotes tumor escape.

This makes studying the mechanisms that promote metastasis of critical importance. Research shows that the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) progression and metastasis. Specifically; the density, stiffness, and orientation of collagen I fibers in the stroma all impact IDC motility, invasion, and metastasis. Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is a secreted enzymatic protein that is implicit in ECM remodeling. By catalyzing an oxidative reaction in peptidyl lysine\/ hydroxylysine present on collagen I fibers, LOXL2 initiates crosslinking of the fibers. Our previous publication demonstrates that interleukin-6-related pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, specifically oncostatin M (OSM), led to the overexpression and secretion of the LOXL2 enzyme. This increased the metastatic potential of IDC cells by promoting the crosslinking and alignment of collagen I fibers, which in turn led to increased invasion in 3D collagen I matrices. Thus<i>, <\/i>we hypothesize that OSM-induced LOXL2 expression, secretion, and subsequent collagen I fiber crosslinking and alignment, leads to an increase in IDC metastasis<i>. In vivo<\/i> studies utilizing nude athymic mice injected with either MCF7-Luc-EV control or MCF7-Luc-OSM overexpressing cells were performed in conjunction with LOXL2 inhibition using specially designed chow containing either LOXL2 SMI or control. Further analysis of OSM signaling pathways was performed in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 IDC cells to determine mechanism for OSM induction of LOXL2. Our studies demonstrate that canonical OSM signaling pathways (pERK, pSTAT3, and pAKT) all contribute to LOXL2 expression in MCF7 cells suggesting a possible mediator protein we identified as c-Myc. Furthermore, OSM-induced LOXL2 played a significant role in OSM promoted tumor growth and metastasis as LOXL2 inhibition led to decreased tumor size and far less metastatic lesions. We also analyzed and confirmed a synergistic interaction between OSM and interleukin-1beta (IL-1&#946;) in LOXL2 expression. These results confirm the significance of LOXL2 expression in OSM promoted metastasis and suggests LOXL2 would be an important target for future breast cancer therapies, specifically in patients with elevated levels of OSM. Furthermore, the synergistic interaction between OSM and IL-1&#946; in LOXL2 expression suggests that patients with high levels of both cytokines are at even greater risk of metastasis, making these great markers for determining at risk IDC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Extracellular matrix,Tumor microenvironment,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Simion Dinca<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Cody Wolf<sup><\/sup>, Laura Bond<sup><\/sup>, Cheryl Jorcyk<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biomolecular Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6ec300eb-1141-4e73-8985-69a510e44ad1","ControlNumber":"8198","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Therefore, the identification of promising target or new strategy to enhance ICB therapy in breast cancer is crucial. Here, we uncover that the DNA-damaging potential of tamoxifen (TAM) can shape the unfavorable but ready-to-fire tumor immune microenvironment in breast cancer. We discover that a long-term TAM administration unexpectedly induces JAK\/STAT signaling and Type I interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene expression to promote T-cell infiltration. Furthermore, TAM also induces the expression of CEACAM1, which acts as an alternative T-cell inhibitory ligand <i>via<\/i> binding to TIM-3, a &#8220;checkpoint&#8221; receptor expressed on CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. The chromatin &#8216;&#8216;reader&#8217;&#8217; RACK7\/ZMYND8, which functions as a transcriptional repressor of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) and a critical factor in DNA repair, is found to be downregulated upon tamoxifen exposure and involved in the tamoxifen-mediated cellular modulation. We demonstrate that TAM in conjunction with RACK7-knockdown (KD) triggers robust upregulation of ISGs and CEACAM1 in both estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This immunomodulatory effect lead by loss of RACK7 is specific to TAM treatment, and is not observed when combined with other endocrine therapeutics. TAM combined with RACK7-KD promotes mitochondrial DNA damage, which leads to accumulation of cytosolic DNA and subsequent activation of the cGAS\/STING pathway. The murine breast orthotopic models with TS\/A, EO771 and 4T1 cells further demonstrate that TAM-mediated immunomodulatory in conjunction with RACK7-KD evokes cytokine\/chemokine secretion and further induces T-cell infiltration into tumor microenvironment. However, the tumor killing effect is limited due to promotion of T-cell exhaustion from CEACAM1-TIM-3 interaction between tumor and T cells. Thus, our study indicates that targeting CEACAM1-TIM-3 interaction is crucial for TAM-mediated tumor immune response. This brings promising therapeutic approach with TAM by combining RACK7-KD with blockage to CEACAM1-TIM-3 interaction in breast cancer. The resistance of tamoxifen treatment may be overcome, and RACK7 may serve as both a therapeutic target and a biomarker to enable ICB therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immuno-oncology,Tumor microenvironment,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Marvin A.

The treatment for BM-PCa is limited to palliative therapy, and it is currently incurable. Neutrophils are the most prevalent immune cell in the bone, and we have found that PCa enhances their recruitment and infiltration into the prostate tumor-bone microenvironment of patients with BM-PCa. Additionally, we observed that bone marrow neutrophils directly induce apoptosis of PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo and that this is mediated by the inhibition of STAT5, a transcription factor that promotes PCa progression. Moreover, STAT5 has also been found to contribute to the development of resistance to standard care androgen deprivation therapy. Neutrophils specifically target and kill only cells that express STAT5, as stable knockdown of STAT5 in BM-PCa cells makes them resistant to neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity, while the overexpression of STAT5 in STAT5-negative PCa cells, which are generally resistant to killing by neutrophils, sensitizes them to neutrophil-mediated killing. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses derived from the STAT5 knockdown and STAT5 overexpressing cells suggest that STAT5 expression in PCa induces pro-inflammatory signaling and that neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity may be exerted via STAT5-induced IL-1 and\/or IL-6. Preliminary data in our laboratory show that STAT5-induced production of IL-1 by PCa cells leads to their death by neutrophils, as knocking out the IL-1 receptor on neutrophils reduces their cytotoxic potential against STAT5-positive PCa cells. Interestingly, in addition to killing BM-PCa cells, we have demonstrated that bone marrow-derived neutrophils are also capable of killing pancreatic cancer cells. Further delineation of the role of neutrophils in STAT5 signaling in BM-PCa growth holds promise for enhancing neutrophil cytotoxicity in the bone which could lead to novel therapeutic options for bone metastatic prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Bone metastasis,Neutrophils,STAT5,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sanjana Rajgopal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Massar Alsamraae<sup>2<\/sup>, Diane Costanzo-Garvey<sup>2<\/sup>, Leah Cook<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Genetics, Cell Biology & Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE,<sup>2<\/sup>Pathology & Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1b8445de-8417-4bdf-bb74-4b1f7b217565","ControlNumber":"5121","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

NF1 is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF1,<\/i> which encodes for neurofibromin, a negative regulator of RAS activity. Selumetinib, a specific inhibitor of MEK1\/2, is the only FDA-approved drug for NF1-associated PNFs. However, the anti-tumor effects of selumetinib are limited in MPNSTs and have dose-limiting side effects. Deficiency of the <i>NF1<\/i> gene not only promotes tumorigenesis but also has broad effects on the immune cells and cytokine signaling driven by hyperactive RAS signaling.<i> <\/i>Because macrophages account for almost half of cells in NF1 lesions and their infiltration highly correlates with disease progression, we hypothesized that targeting tumor-promoting immune cells could be an alternative approach for NF1 treatment. The novel retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist MSU-42011 reduces tumor growth in experimental Kras-driven cancers by decreasing pERK expression, reducing tumor-promoting immune cells like CD206<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages and regulatory T cells, and increasing activated cytotoxic T cells<i>. <\/i>Here, we tested MSU-42011 and selumetinib, either alone or in combination, to evaluate their efficacy against NF1 cancer cells and macrophages using monoculture and conditioned media (CM) treatments. Treatment with 200 nM MSU-40211, 50 nM selumetinib, and the combination for 3 hours reduced pERK protein levels by approximately 40%, 70% and 90%, respectively vs. untreated controls. Treatment for 72 hours with selumetinib and the combination reduced the viability of PNF cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CM from human PNF cells increased monocyte chemoattractant <i>CCL2 (<\/i>C-C motif chemokine ligand 2) mRNA expression in human THP1 monocytes and THP1 macrophages differentiated by PMA. Notably, MSU-42011 and selumetinib alone similarly inhibited <i>CCL2<\/i> mRNA expression by 25% in THP1 macrophages stimulated with CM from PNF cells, and the inhibition of <i>CCL2<\/i> mRNA expression was enhanced to 50% with combination treatment.

The CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling pathway has emerged as an axis of interest in cancer tumorigenesis <sup>1,2,3<\/sup>. Current clinical trials aim to increase immune cell inflammation in solid tumors by blocking this pathway. Our analysis of bulk-RNAseq revealed ER+ breast cancer has high gene expression levels of CXCL12 transcripts, making it a potential tumor indication to investigate. We spatially characterized 20 ER+ breast cancer FFPE samples by developing a 13-plex antibody panel for the Akoya PhenoCycler&#174;-Fusion system. This panel was designed to identify immune cells (CD45, CD3e, CD4, CD8, FoxP3, CD68), stromal cells (FAP, SMA, Podoplanin, S100A4), tumor and epithelial cells (PanCK) as well as the signaling duo (CXCR4, CXCL12). We performed cell segmentation on the multiplex immunofluorescence images, and quantified marker intensity in each cell. Phenotypes were manually identified after normalization, integration, and clustering of over 10+ million cells across 20 samples. Overall, the composition of tumor and immune cells varies significantly between patients showing the heterogeneity of their microenvironments. We observed CD8 T-cell exclusion in tumors associated with infiltration of fibroblasts (FAP+, SMA+, PDPN+) that do not express CXCL12. Instead, the CXCL12 signal is highly correlated with PanCK<b> <\/b>in all samples suggesting that either tumor cells are producing the chemokine or are being &#8220;coated&#8221; with the CXCL12 produced by fibroblasts. We also identify at least three known CXCR4+ immunosuppressive populations (fibroblasts, macrophages and Tregs) in the tumors which are known to be recruited via CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling<sup>4,5<\/sup>. This immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment (TME) results in the CD8 T-cell exclusion we observe in our samples as well as mentioned in multiple studies<sup>1,6<\/sup>. In summary, these results show the exclusion of cytotoxic T cells in the TME and the intricate relationship between tumor cells and immunosuppressive cells through the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis. This study shows the benefits of the Akoya platform compared to conventional IHC as well as the power of spatial phenotyping to study the TME immune biology for development of therapeutic strategies.<br \/>References: <sup>1<\/sup> Wang Z et al., 2022; doi:10.1073\/pnas.2119463119 <sup>2<\/sup> Bockorny B et al., 2020; doi:10.1038\/s41591-020-0880-x <sup>3<\/sup> Biasci D et al., 2020; doi:10.1073\/pnas.2013644117 <sup>4<\/sup> Raschioni C et al., 2018; doi:10.1155\/2018\/501867 <sup>5<\/sup> Costa A et al., 2018; doi:10.1016\/j.ccell.2018.01.011 <sup>6<\/sup> Chen IX et al., 2019; doi:10.1073\/pnas.1815515116","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,CXCR4-CXCL12,Spatial biology,Phenocycler-Fusion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julien Tessier<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Amir Bayegan<sup>1<\/sup>, Dinesh Bangari<sup>2<\/sup>, Joon Sang Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Lily Pao<sup>3<\/sup>, Robert Rowlands<sup>4<\/sup>, Donald Jackson<sup>1<\/sup>, Angela Hadjipanayis<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Precision Oncology, Sanofi, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Global Discovery Pathology, Sanofi, Cambridge, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Oncology Research, Sanofi, Cambridge, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Kymab, Large Molecules Research Platform, Sanofi, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cfc12022-b62a-4f0c-a9d1-0c6b31ec7294","ControlNumber":"6140","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Within this severe disease lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) belongs to the most common form of lung cancer. LUAD is highly correlated with KRAS mutations. Although, the first KRAS inhibitors entered into clinics recently, therapy resistance arises. Since KRAS-mutant LUAD is an inflammation driven disease, we focus on the JAK-STAT pathway as an alternative target. Preliminary data suggests that human KRAS-mutant LUAD is correlated to enriched JAK-STAT signaling, as well as STAT1 upregulation. Accordingly, we aimed to explore the tumorigenic functions of STAT1 in this form of lung cancer. Genetically engineered C57BL6\/N mice which develop autochthonous KRAS-driven and P53-deficient LUAD proficient (KP) and deficient for STAT1 (KPS) were used. In a second mouse model expression of ovalbumin was induced in tumor cells, mimicking a neoantigen to increase immune infiltration in the presence (KPO) or absence of STAT1 (KPOS). Kaplan-Meyer analysis was performed to assess the overall survival. Tumor burden, as well as immune infiltration was analyzed in lungs 6 and 10 weeks after tumor induction via H&#38;E, IHC and IF staining. Furthermore, the lung fluid was collected by bronchoalveolar lavage and used to profile inflammatory cytokines. Deletion of STAT1 reduced the survival in KRAS-driven LUAD mice only when ovalbumin was expressed. Tumor burden and tumor grades were increased in tumors lacking STAT1 at 6 and 10 weeks after tumor initiation. Surprisingly, although tumors of KPOS mice showed a decreased infiltration by T cells and CD4 T cells, CD8 T cell infiltration did not change, suggesting a tumor suppressive function of STAT1 via T cell exhaustion. Moreover, the macrophage attracting cytokine CCL9 secretion was upregulated and the number of tumor infiltrating, immunosuppressive macrophages was increased in KPOS mice. This data implicates a tumor suppressive function of STAT1 by secretion of cytokines that can recruit suppressive myeloid immune cells to the TME leading to CD4 T cell exclusion and CD8 T cell exhaustion. Further studies are needed on the changes in the immune infiltrating cells to explain the mechanism behind these intriguing findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,KRAS,Tumor progression,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christoph Trenk<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Sagmeister<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaqueline Horvath<sup>1<\/sup>, Monika Homolya<sup>1<\/sup>, Andreea Corina Luca<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Eferl<sup>2<\/sup>, Herwig Moll<sup>1<\/sup>, Emilio Casanova<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Wien, Austria,<sup>2<\/sup>Center for Cancer Research, Medical University of Vienna, Wien, Austria","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bb0ec3c7-bb74-44dc-9017-87e8593bbe76","ControlNumber":"6090","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an aggressive subtype with poor prognosis for which there are no known targeted therapies. Understanding what drives complex cell-cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to developing new strategies. BLBC has previously been shown to have high expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL1&#946;, which then promotes the recruitment of pro-tumoral tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to the TME. Here we report that BLBC is uniquely capable of IL1&#946; secretion due to elevated expression of caspase-1, a key component of the inflammasome required for IL1&#946; maturation.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> Using publicly available gene expression data sets, the association between caspase-1, breast cancer subtype and estrogen receptor (ER) co-expression was examined. These associations were further assessed <i>in vitro <\/i>by exposing luminal (T47D\/MCF7) or BLBC (MDA-MB231) cell lines to siER knockdown or ER overexpression. Using both a CRISPR\/Cas9 generated caspase-1 knockout (KO) BLBC mouse line as well as pharmacological inhibition with the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, the effect of caspase-1 on tumor growth was studied in syngeneic immunocompetent mice. Immune infiltrates were assessed via flow cytometry of the excised murine tumors as well as immunohistochemistry. To prove these results were IL1&#946; specific, caspase-1 KO tumor allografts containing self-cleaving IL1&#946; were used for comparison.

Because of their structural conformation, these RNAs are incredibly stable in the cellular space, where they can regulate tumor-associated and anti-immunogenic pathways. Although circRNAs have been profiled in many tumors, their functional contribution to cancer progression is still poorly understood. In the current study, we profiled the most abundant circRNAs expressed in Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) and characterized them functionally and mechanistically. Surgery and chemotherapy are the standard treatments for STS, but the 5-year survival rate is still below 20% for the advanced cases. Response to immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, is also marginal for STS, likely because sarcoma cells are not sufficiently immunogenic to recruit a high volume of cytotoxic T cells. To implement discoveries on STS, we recently generated novel immunocompetent STS mouse models and characterized the sarcoma-elicited mechanisms to block immune-recruitment. Interestingly, we observed that two circRNAs, circCsnk1g3, and circAnkib1, promote sarcoma growth by shaping a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment, possibly due to their capabilities to regulate tumor-promoting elements extrinsic to the sarcoma cells. More specifically, we observed that circCsnk1g3 and circAnkib1 control the expression of interferon-related genes and pro-inflammatory factors in the sarcoma cells, thus directing immune cell recruitment into the tumor mass and hence their activation. Mechanistically, we observed that circRNAs might repress pro-inflammatory elements by buffering activation of the pathways mediated by RIG-I, the cytosolic viral RNA sensor. The current findings suggest that targeting<br \/>specific circRNAs could augment the efficacy of sarcoma immune response to mainstay therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Noncoding RNA,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Tumor microenvironment,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jlenia Guarnerio<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"943040d8-9742-44b2-88e2-e8a4cc3c29a5","ControlNumber":"5752","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Ovarian tumor microenvironment (TME) is undeniably complex which presents considerable challenge in understanding the immunotherapy treatment responses. Our previous study has revealed that Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) is highly expressed in ovarian cancer cells and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), whereas its ligand OSM is predominantly expressed in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). This study aims to investigate how the OSM-OSMR paracrine signaling between tumor cells, CAFs and TAMs reprograms the TME to influence therapeutic responses in ovarian cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We employed a 3D-3-cell co-culture method <i>in vitro<\/i> to understand how OSM\/OSMR signaling modulates the interactions between ovarian cancer cells, CAFs and TAMs, that can impact therapy response of cisplatin resistant cancer cells in the ovarian TME. We performed RNA sequencing to study the differential gene signatures of each cell component in a 3-cell co-culture with their monolayer counterparts. This system was also challenged with chemotherapy-cisplatin and immunotherapy such as our newly developed anti-OSMR monoclonal antibodies to assess the therapy response of each cell component.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Using single-cell and single-nuclear RNA seq dataset analyses of 17 human HGSOC patient ascites, we found that CAFs and TAMs are the predominant stromal or immune cell population enriched in ovarian cancer tissues. Using immunofluorescence, we identified that enrichment of CAFs along with extracellular matrix proteins surrounding tumor cells as an indication of heavily desmoplastic tumors. Using tumor-infiltrating immune cells dataset-TIMER, we found that high OSMR in cancer cells or CAFs along with high OSM in TAMs are associated with poor survival in ovarian cancer patients. Further, RNA sequencing data of 3-cell coculture models revealed an invasive, desmoplastic and immune-suppressive gene signature compared to independent culture conditions. Notably, CAFs and ovarian cancer cells co-cultured with TAMs exhibited an improved activation of JAK\/STAT3 and PI3K-AKT oncogenic pathways for chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our preliminary findings uncovered a potential mechanism of action of OSM-OSMR signaling in reprogramming ovarian cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts in ovarian cancer TME. Importantly, we highlight the importance of crosstalk between CAFs, ovarian cancer cells and TAMs for harnessing OSM\/OSMR signaling for chemoresistance in cancer cells. Our findings also demonstrated the potential of anti-OSMR antibody therapy to target cancer cells and CAFs in the tumor microenvironment for abrogating desmoplasia; thus, improving chemosensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapy resistance,Ovarian cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anjali Geethadevi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shirng-Wern Tsaih<sup>2<\/sup>, Ajay Nair<sup>3<\/sup>, Zhiqiang Ku<sup>4<\/sup>, Ishaque Pulikkal Kadamberi<sup>2<\/sup>, Deepak Parashar<sup>2<\/sup>, Prachi Gupta<sup>2<\/sup>, Sudhir Kumar<sup>2<\/sup>, Jasmine George<sup>2<\/sup>, Sonam Mittal<sup>1<\/sup>, William Bradley<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert  F.

To investigate the effects of Ola combined with Ent, we used HR-proficient ID8 P53 wild-type and ID8 P53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> syngeneic murine models. Mice were randomized into 4 groups: control, Ola, Ent and Ola+Ent. Mice (Ent and Ola+Ent) were pre-treated with 15 mg\/kg entinostat or vehicle (Ola and Ola+Ent) for one week via oral gavage and then treated with vehicle\/Ent\/Ola (100 mg\/kg)\/ Ola+Ent for two weeks. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last dose to harvest tumors and ascites. Tumors were processed for histology to determine cell proliferation (Ki67) and immune cell markers (CCL2, M1 and M2-like macrophages). Ascites fluid was processed for flow cytometric analysis of immune cells. Tumors from parental ID8 P53 wild type mice showed significantly lower cell proliferation marker Ki67 (P<u>&#60;<\/u>0.05), higher anti-tumorigenic M1-like CCL2 (P<u>&#60;<\/u>0.05), and lower pro-tumorigenic M2-like mannose receptor (P<u>&#60;<\/u>0.05) in Ent and Ola+Ent groups compared to vehicle and Ola. Ascites showed no significant change in anti-tumorigenic M1-like macrophages, but significantly increased pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophages (P<u>&#60;<\/u>0.005). ID8 P53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice tumors showed significantly lower Ki-67 (P<u>&#60;<\/u>0.05) in Ola+Ent group compared to vehicle and mono-treatments. Ascites showed no significant change in total macrophage or pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophages, but a significant decrease in anti-tumorigenic M1-like macrophages in Ent and Ola+Ent groups compared to vehicle. To summarize, in HR proficient ID8 P53 wildtype and ID8 P53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> syngeneic mouse models, Ola and Ent treatment exerted anti-tumorigenic effects in tumors but potentially pro-tumorigenic effects in ascites.

Despite the impressive clinical success of cancer immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer and melanoma, it is largely ineffective in OvCa patients. Resistance to cancer immunotherapy is mediated by the apoptosis of T-cells, which can be prevented by blocking Fas ligand (FasL), a death gene. However, little is known about the expression and function of FasL in OvCa. Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify the cells in the OvCa tumor microenvironment that produce and secrete FasL, and to delineate the functional role of FasL in T-cell apoptosis within the OvCa tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Methods: FasL protein localization and levels were evaluated in OvCa tumors by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a FasL antibody on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing primary and matching metastases from 72 OvCa patients. In-situ hybridization (ISH) using a FasL specific probe was performed on omental OvCa tumors from pre- (n=12) and post-chemotherapy (n=12) patients to localize FasL mRNA. To define the role of OvCa and endothelial cell derived FasL on T cell apoptosis, co-culture experiments were completed. First, FasL was knocked down with a FasL siRNA or neutralized with a FasL antibody in OvCa (OVCAR8 and OVCAR5) cells or endothelial (HUVEC) cells. Next, the OvCa or endothelial cells were co-cultured with primary human blood mononuclear cell-derived T cells. Subsequently, the level of FasL secreted was measured using a FasL specific enzyme-linked immunoassay, and early (4h; cleaved-caspase 3) and late (24h; TUNEL assay) T cell apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: FasL protein and mRNA are present in OvCa and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment of OvCa patients. Higher levels of FasL are detected in the endothelial cells when compared to the OvCa cells in these OvCa tumors. These results were confirmed in vitro as primary human endothelial cells secrete higher levels of FasL when compared to the OVCAR8 and OVCAR5 ovarian cancer cell lines. Functionally, both OvCa and endothelial cells stimulate early and late apoptosis in primary human blood mononuclear cell-derived T cells after a four hour co-culture. Knockdown or neutralization of FasL significantly inhibits the ability of OvCa or endothelial cells to induce early and late T cell apoptosis. In summary, FasL is localized to OvCa and endothelial cells in the OvCa tumor microenvironment, and both OvCa and endothelial cell derived FasL induce T cell apoptosis.<br \/>Discussion: These findings indicate that blocking FasL may be an effective approach for reducing T-cell apoptosis and improving cancer immunotherapy response in OvCa patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Grace Keegan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hilary Kenny<sup>2<\/sup>, Agnes Bilecz<sup>3<\/sup>, Ricardo Lastra<sup>4<\/sup>, Ernst Lengyel<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Ob\/Gyn, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>4<\/sup>Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3c1f14a3-c563-4b4b-87ef-92ab7b0417e3","ControlNumber":"7698","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Central to controlling both processes is the TGF-&#946;\/BMP signaling pathway, for which the SMAD proteins serve as major downstream effector molecules. Upon ligand-binding, TGF-&#946; or BMP type I\/II receptor heterotetramers phosphorylate receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs). TGF-&#946;-receptor binding leads to SMAD2\/3 phosphorylation, whereas BMP-receptor binding induces phosphorylation of SMADs 1\/5\/8. Phosphorylated SMADs (pSMADs) then form a complex with the co-SMAD SMAD4 at which point they undergo nuclear translocation, where they function as transcriptional modulators of target genes. The magnitude of SMAD phosphorylation and functional output (e.g., stimulated angiogenesis or attenuated cell proliferation) depends on both the ligand concentration, as well as the duration of exposure. In this study, we quantitatively evaluate the phosphorylation states of R-SMADs, as well as their downstream biological effects at three different biological scales: 1) biochemical, 2) cellular, and 3) tissue\/3D models. At the biochemical level, the temporal and dose-dependent phosphorylation of R-SMADs in response to growth factor stimulation can be quantified using a quantitative ELISA approach. Growth factor stimulation can be quantified at the cellular level by high content imaging of SMAD phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, while simultaneously monitoring cell proliferation rates. Lastly, high-resolution confocal imaging can be employed to observe developmental consequences of phospho-SMAD signaling using a HUVEC-based 3D angiogenesis model system.<br \/>For Research Use Only.
