[{"Abstract":"There are many pathways that activate the Type I interferon (IFN) response to combat tumor progression including the cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathways. PARP7 is a monoART enzyme that was reported to negatively regulate the Type I IFN response by interacting with TBK1 during viral infection. We and others have demonstrated that PARP7 is a novel negative regulator of cytosolic nucleic acid sensing in tumor cells. RBN-2397 is the first potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of PARP7 catalytic function. We have shown that administration of RBN-2397 to CT26 tumor-bearing mice significantly decreased tumor growth and led to complete and durable regressions in a subset of mice. The antitumor effects correlated with activation of p-STAT1 and increased expression of ISGs including CXCL10, MX1, and CCL5 in tumors. A growing body of work has shown that DNA damaging agents such as chemotherapies activate the Type I IFN response by generating accumulation of nucleic acids, including DNA, in the cytosol or tumor microenvironment. These aberrant cytosolic nucleic acids are recognized by the innate immune response via cGAS leading to activation of the STING\/TBK pathway and subsequent production of IFN-&#946; and expression of ISGs (interferon induced genes). Given that PARP7 suppresses the Type I IFN response, we hypothesized that the immune-related mechanism observed with chemotherapy would be inhibited in tumors with high PARP7 expression. Combining chemo with RBN-2397 could potentiate Type I IFN response activation in PARP7 expressing tumors and enhance immune mediated anti-tumor responses. We tested the ability of platinum (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin) and taxane (docetaxel and paclitaxel) chemotherapy agents to activate the Type I IFN response in the CT26 mouse colon cancer cell line in vitro by gene expression analysis of several ISGs (CXCL10, CCL5, MX1, IFIT1, and IFN-&#946;). Single agent chemo led to modest increases in the expression of ISGs. The combination of cisplatin or oxaliplatin with RBN-2397 significantly potentiated the effect of RBN-2397 and led to a synergistic increase of the ISGs in CT26 cells after 24 hours of treatment. Similar effects were obtained with the combination of docetaxel or paclitaxel with RBN-2397. To evaluate if the combinatorial effect observed in vitro translated into increased efficacy in vivo, we first identified doses of single agent cisplatin or docetaxel that increased expression of ISGs and enhanced cytosolic-DNA in CT26 tumors. Next, we verified the tolerability of validated doses in combination with RBN-2397. Finally, we performed an efficacy study in CT26 tumor bearing mice and observed that the combination of cisplatin and RBN-2397 increased tumor growth inhibition and survival relative to single agent activity. This study provides rationale for exploration of DNA damaging agents in combination with RBN-2397.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP,Interferons,Cisplatin,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kaiko Kunii<sup><\/sup>, Jeff  J.

The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Sharpless, Meldal, and Bertozzi in recognition of the transformative effect click chemistry has had in research and drug development.<br \/>Shasqi is pioneering the use of click chemistry in humans with the Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC&#8482;) platform, which enables localization of an activator to tumors and conversion of attenuated protodrugs to active drugs though click chemistry reactions. Shasqi&#8217;s lead candidate, SQ3370, is a therapeutic based on click chemistry in humans to activate doxorubicin (Dox) specifically at tumors. SQ3370 consists of an intratumorally-injected tetrazine-modified biopolymer and a systemically administered trans-cyclooctene-modified Dox protodrug. SQ3370 provides enhanced safety and efficacy in preclinical models compared to conventional Dox and is being evaluated in a Phase 2a study in solid tumors (NCT04106492).<br \/>Here, we report the findings from immune cell profiling of samples collected from patients enrolled in the SQ3370-001 Phase 1 study. Tumor biopsies and PBMCs isolated at baseline and after each of the initial two treatment cycles were analyzed using multiplex immunohistochemistry and mass cytometry, respectively. SQ3370 treatment induced immune activation in tumors despite a heavily pre-treated patient population. Specifically, we saw elevated cytolytic lymphocyte activity in tumors after SQ3370 treatment, marked by an increase in Granzyme B<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells relative to baseline. Moreover, SQ3370 promoted a shift from an immune suppressive towards a T-cell permissive tumor immune microenvironment, in part by modulating the myeloid-to-CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell ratio in tumors. No changes in major lymphocyte populations with treatment were observed by mass cytometry, suggesting no systemic treatment-related toxicity or immunosuppression. Minor changes were indicative of a favorable systemic response to SQ3370. Trends in the expansion of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells, central memory CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells, and transitional monocytes coupled with a reduction in systemic neutrophils and T regulatory cells indicate subtle shifts within adaptive and innate immune cell compartments that correspond with anti-tumor responses. Our assessment of immune changes after SQ3370 treatment confirms that observations in preclinical models are translatable to humans, as similar T-cell supportive immune changes were observed in syngeneic tumor models with SQ3370. Consistency between immune responses in clinical and preclinical samples underlines the translatability of the click chemistry-based drug and suggests that its broad therapeutic potential may be further enhanced with combined immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Doxorubicin,Immuno-oncology,Immune response,Click Chemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Masa Aleckovic<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sangeetha Srinivasan<sup><\/sup>, John Lee<sup><\/sup>, Jesse M.

In order to develop effective immunotherapeutic and combinatorial treatment strategies for HGSC, a deeper knowledge on the effects of NACT on the spatial tumor-immune interactions is required. We performed genetic and single-cell spatial characterization of the tumor-immune microenvironment of 22 HGSC samples collected before and after NACT using Whole Genome Sequencing and tissue cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CycIF) highly-multiplexed imaging platform. We used image analysis and bioinformatics to analyze 30 antibodies in over 6 500 000 single-cells in the context of their spatial tissue architecture. The results were integrated with genomic features and clinical data.<br \/>We identified four distinct tumor cell metaclusters, eight immune cell subtypes and six stromal cell subpopulations. Chemotherapy induced distinct phenotypic changes in the tumor and immune cells including glutamine metabolism, cell proliferation and antigen presentation. Using single-cell spatial analyses, we identified 18 unique tumor-immune-stromal communities, characterized by different tumor, stromal and immune cell proportions, as well as the tumor-stromal interface. Interestingly, we observed increased CD8+T-cell and decreased CD163+ macrophage infiltration specifically at the tumor-stroma interface induced by chemotherapy. Furthermore, NACT induced spatial CD8+T-cell and macrophage cell-cell interaction patterns specifically in the tumor-stromal interface. Further dissection of the functional properties of the spatial cell-cell interactions using spatial transcriptomics revealed distinct tumor-cell clonal dynamics and gene expression programs on the tumor-stroma interface during NACT.<br \/>In conclusion, we identified distinct spatial features in the tumor-immune microenvironment indicating the tumor-stromal interface as the underpinning of spatial dynamics in HGSC during NACT. Using a spatial single-cell multi-omics approach has the potential to improve patient stratification and immunotherapeutic strategies in HGSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immunosuppression,Platinum drugs,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Inga-Maria Pauliina Launonen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Angela Szabo<sup>1<\/sup>, Fernando Perez<sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Casado<sup>1<\/sup>, Zoltan Maliga<sup>2<\/sup>, Sampsa Hautaniemi<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaana Oikkonen<sup>1<\/sup>, Johanna Hynninen<sup>3<\/sup>, Tuulia Vallius<sup>2<\/sup>, Ajit Johnson Nirmal<sup>2<\/sup>, Peter Sorger<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Vähärautio<sup>1<\/sup>, Anniina Färkkilä<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>ONCOSYS, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,<sup>2<\/sup>Harvard University, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Turku University, Turku, Finland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"caf8b561-97ff-4196-8b7e-171b759d5b38","ControlNumber":"2171","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Oncolytic virotherapy is emerging as a promising approach to reprogramming the immunosuppressed microenvironment of GBMs and restoring anti-tumor immunity. Delta-24-RGD is an oncolytic adenovirus that has shown favorable results in phase I clinical trials (NCT00805376; NCT03178032). However, immune responses functionally cleared the virus within weeks of administration, limiting anti-cancer efficacy to a subset (~20%) of patients. A better understanding of the innate immune response against adenoviruses may provide the rationale for developing improved anticancer approaches. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we have examined the transcriptome of normal lung fibroblasts infected with wild-type adenovirus. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed upregulation of several immune response-related pathways, including interferon response factor 3 (IRF3). Interestingly, these analyses also showed an unexpected upregulation of the Non-POU Domain Containing Octamer Binding (NONO) pathway during adenoviral infection. In fact, upstream regulators analyses showed a 7-fold increase in the NONO pathway in two different cell lines. Increases in NONO expression changes in response to adenovirus treatment were validated by western blot. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that NONO binds to adenoviral capsid proteins during infection and to the foreign DNA sensor cyclic GMP AMP synthase (cGAS), which is critical for the activation of the innate immunity, via IRF3. In our proposed model, NONO protein binds to the adenoviral capsid protein and associates with the sensor cGAS in the nucleus to enable sensing of viral nucleic acid. In conclusion, we uncovered a new mechanism for detecting adenovirus infection that involves the interaction of adenoviral capsid proteins with members of the NONO pathway in the nucleus of the infected cell. Further studies are in progress to examine to which extent adenoviruses unable to bind NONO may persist longer in the infected tumors than unmodified adenoviruses and whether the persistence of the virus in the tumor correlates with enhanced anti-glioma effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Oncolytic adenovirus,Glioblastoma,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew Gregg Gillard<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Ho Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Virginia Laspidea<sup>2<\/sup>, Hong Jiang<sup>3<\/sup>, Fan Xuejun<sup>3<\/sup>, Yanhua Yi<sup>3<\/sup>, Marta  M.

Recently, new compounds were developed that selectively bind to K-RAS with G12C mutation. While recent clinical results demonstrate activity of these compounds, their underlying mechanisms of action and impact on the antitumor immune response are not well understood. Here, we tested G12C-Kras inhibitor (Sotorasib\/AMG-510) using multiple approaches. We found that Sotorasib significantly promoted the tumor regression and the expansion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in both CT26-G12C heterotopic colon cancer, and KP-G12C autochthonous GEMM lung cancer mouse models, with more profound impact when combined with anti-PD1 ICB immunotherapy. In addition, it generated a &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor microenvironment with strikingly augmented T cell effector phenotype, endorsed by enrichment of MHC-II high macrophage and reduction of suppressive myeloid cells. Interestingly, Single cell RNA sequencing of CT26-G12C tumors shows an enrichment of tumor clusters with TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; as top upregulated pathways in Sotorasib-treated tumors, generating a more immune active TME. These immune active tumor clusters were conserved or further expanded upon cotreatment with anti-PD1 ICI. Conversely, immune-deficient, or Sotorasib-resistant tumors exhibited a remarkable contraction of the immune active clusters, substantiating that the immune-modulatory impact of Sotorasib relies on tumor cells adaptation and their cross talk with the tumor infiltrated lymphocytes. In vitro, Single cell RNA sequencing of CT26-G12C cells also revealed that Sotorasib and TNF&#945;\/IFN&#947; cytokines are affecting different tumor clusters. Moreover, further in vitro testing demonstrated that Sotorasib dramatically enhances KRAS-G12C mutant cancer cell killing by PSCA-specific CART cells. These findings provide insight into the molecular basis of G12C-Kras inhibitor-mediated immune modulation in the TME and provide insight for combinatorial regimens with checkpoint inhibitor and adoptive T cell immunotherapy to achieve optimum anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TNF-&#945;,KRAS,Small molecule inhibitor,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mohammed L.

The benefit of adding ipilimumab + nivolumab to TMZ and the impact of MGMT silencing remain unclear. Here, we aimed to determine in a controlled in vitro system if adding ICI to TMZ enhances T cell killing of MSS CRC cells. We also aimed to determine the role of MGMT in this response. MGMT protein expression was measured by western blot in CRC (n=4) and GBM (n=4) cell lines. Cell viability assays were conducted to measure sensitivity to TMZ. CRC and GBM cells were co-cultured with TALL-104 cells -\/+ TMZ and -\/+ ICI to measure TALL-104-mediated cell death. Western blot analysis indicated that CRC cells had significantly elevated MGMT expression as compared to GBM cells likely due to MGMT promoter methylation in GBM cells. In line with this, CRC cells were slightly more resistant to TMZ (IC50=100-150 &#181;M) compared to GBM cells (IC50=10-90 &#181;M) after five days of treatment. TMZ + ICI sensitized MGMT-expressing, MSS CRC cells to T cell killing. TMZ alone did not enhance T cell killing of MSS or MSI CRC cells but did enhance T cell killing of T98G GBM cells. Our results indicate that TMZ sensitizes MSS, MGMT-expressing CRC cells to ipilimumab + nivolumab ICI. Importantly, this suggests that TMZ-mediated sensitization to ipilimumab + nivolumab is independent of MGMT status and the patient cohort that may benefit TMZ + ipilimumab + nivolumab may be expanded to CRC patients with MGMT-expressing, MSS tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Temozolomide,Immune checkpoint blockade,MGMT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zenovia Gonzalez<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lindsey J.

Most patients receive chemotherapies 5-FU and folinic acid combined with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, or both. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are effective for 3% of patients with microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors but 97% of patients have ICI-resistant microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. Chemotherapy-mediated sensitization of MSS CRC to immune cell killing has been described in preclinical models and in the CheckMate 9X8 clinical trial. We hypothesize that chemotherapy modulates cytokine secretion within the MSS CRC tumor microenvironment and can enhance immune cell killing in certain contexts. SW480 and HT29 cells were pre-treated with chemotherapy (IC50<sub>72h<\/sub>, 24 hours), then co-cultured with TALL-104 cells -\/+ pembrolizumab to measure immune cell-mediated killing. Using the Luminex 200 platform, the levels of 50+ cytokines were measured after chemotherapy treatment of SW480 and HT29 cells (IC50<sub>72h<\/sub>, 48 hours) and TALL-104 and NK-92 cells (1 &#181;M or 10 &#181;M, 36 hours). A humanized mouse model was established by injecting HCT 116 tumor-bearing nude mice with TALL-104 cells. Infiltration of injected TALL-104 cells was measured in mice that received either 5-FU + oxaliplatin or 5-FU + irinotecan. 5-FU + folinic acid + oxaliplatin -\/+ pembrolizumab enhances TALL-104-mediated killing of SW480 and HT29 cells. In TALL-104 cells, soluble DcR3 increased significantly after low-dose 5-FU + oxaliplatin and the triple treatment but did not change with 5-FU + irinotecan. The triple treatment also slightly reduced GrB levels and MIF trended upward with all treatments. In NK-92 cells, B2M, CHI3L1, IL-10, IFN-&#947;, CCL3, CCL4, FasL, GrB, and IL-6 significantly decreased after all treatments and M-CSF increased with low-dose triple treatment. In SW480 cells, CHI3L1, IL-10, GrB, CCL2, and VEGF decreased after all treatments. GM-CSF increased only with 5-FU + oxaliplatin. In the humanized mouse model, there was a trend toward increased TALL-104 cell infiltration in chemotherapy pre-treated tumors.<b> <\/b>Chemotherapy tends to decrease cytokine secretion of TALL-104 and NK-92 cells. GM-CSF increases after 5-FU + oxaliplatin treatment in SW480 and HT29 cells, and pre-treatment with this regimen also enhances TALL-104-mediated killing of SW480 and HT29 cells -\/+ ICI, pointing to 5-FU + oxaliplatin-induced GM-CSF as a mediator of chemotherapy-dependent enhancement of T cell killing. Chemotherapy pre-treatment may enhance TALL-104 cell infiltration in MSI tumors. Future directions include evaluation of concurrent vs. sequential chemotherapy + immunotherapy regimens using murine models of MSS colorectal cancer and isolation of circulating tumor cells from patients before and after chemotherapy treatment to measure effects on cytokine secretion and immune cell killing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Chemotherapy,Cytokines,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lindsey Carlsen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kelsey  E.

Still, the majority of patients eventually develop resistance to the therapy. This study thus explored therapeutic targets to overcome this resistance immunologically. Our screening in the public database and in vitro confirmatory experiments revealed that the expression of the innate immune checkpoint CD24 was induced in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines such as PC9 and H1975 when treated with EGFR-TKIs. Immunohistochemistry revealed tissue samples from patients who developed resistance to EGFR inhibition without the acquired T790M mutation demonstrated increased tumor CD24 expression compared to pre-treatment samples. Tumor CD24 binds to Siglec-10 on macrophages and inhibits tumor cell phagocytosis in breast and ovarian cancer. However, in NSCLC, we found that the transcriptional expression levels of <i>SIGLEC-10<\/i> across human tumor-associated macrophages were quite heterogeneous, as evidenced by scRNA-seq. In addition, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) required M-CSF, IL-10, and TGF-&#946; to express Siglec-10. Its expression was absent in MDMs differentiated either by GM-CSF&#177;IFN-&#947;\/LPS or M-CSF&#177;IL-4. These data suggest that the CD24\/Siglec-10 inhibitory pathway may be present but partial in NSCLC. Therefore, we asked whether CD24-targeted therapy could be beneficial regardless of the presence of the CD24\/Siglec-10 inhibitory pathway. Using our MDM differentiation protocols mentioned above, MDMs devoid of Siglec-10 facilitated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis of EGFR-TKI-treated PC9 tumor cells when co-cultured with anti-CD24 monoclonal antibodies. Subsequently, we focused on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released from dying tumor cells. The amounts of cfDNA from dying tumor cells were at least twice and more by EGFR-TKIs than conventional cytotoxic drugs such as paclitaxel. cfDNA from EGFR-mutant cells following EGFR inhibition activated the IRF pathway in THP-1 monocytes in a STING-dependent manner. Moreover, PMA-differentiated THP-1 monocytes no longer produced CXCL9 upon interferon-&#947; stimulation when pre-treated with cfDNA. The same results were obtained when they were pre-treated with interferon-&#945;. In conclusion, we demonstrated two potential mechanisms which could facilitate tumor immune escape. Targeting these pathways may overcome the resistance to EGFR inhibition in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Targeted therapy,EGFR,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Akihiko Shiiya<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takuro Noguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Utano Tomaru<sup>2<\/sup>, Shin Ariga<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuta Takashima<sup>3<\/sup>, Yoshihito Ohhara<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Taguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Satoshi Takeuchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yasushi Shimizu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ichiro Kinoshita<sup>4<\/sup>, Tomonobu Koizumi<sup>5<\/sup>, Yoshihiro Matsuno<sup>2<\/sup>, Naofumi Shinagawa<sup>3<\/sup>, Jun Sakakibara-Konishi<sup>3<\/sup>, Hirotoshi Dosaka-Akita<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgical Pathology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Clinical Cancer Genomics, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Research Division of Cancer Immunotherapy, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"94bde571-1018-4bbd-b23d-44b99fecedaa","ControlNumber":"674","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

We showed that targeted therapy (TT)-tolerant BRAFV600 melanoma persister cells (MPC) have a reduced global mRNA translation activity but an increased translation efficiency of a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling and epigenetic changes. Here, we identify protein markers of MPC in patient biopsies treated either with TT or with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Since persister cells are not destroyed by the immune system, we explored the interactions of MPC with their immune microenvironment. Single cell expression of these candidate MPC markers, as well markers of the tumor microenvironment (31 lymphoid and myeloid markers), were studied in sequential biopsies from melanoma patients treated with TT or ICI by CyTOF. Spatial localization of MPC markers and various types of immune cells were studied by multiplex immunohistochemistry (Akoya Codex). In addition, the <i>in vitro<\/i> effect of the cell supernatants of MPC or na&#239;ve parental cells on immune cells was studied.<br \/>Results: Biomarkers of persistence included 7 protein markers that are regulated at the translational level (MLL3, HDAC6, CCSER2, MT-ND5, ANK2, HIPK2, CBP) and 4 that are transcriptionally regulated (MITF, NGFR, CD36 and SLIT2). Some MPC markers were expressed at baseline in melanoma patients&#8217; biopsies (n = 27) and their baseline expression tended to be associated with progressive disease (to TT or ICI). Paired biopsies from 18 patients showed that an increase in HDAC6, ANK2, HIPK2, CBP5 and MITF was statistically correlated with a short survival regardless of the type of treatment. Baseline lymphocytic infiltrate, especially CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells, was associated with favorable clinical outcome. In addition, we found that the supernatants derived from na&#239;ve parental and persister cells have distinct effects on human CD4<sup>+<\/sup>, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and macrophages. MPC supernatant had a significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation and activation of CD4<sup>+<\/sup>, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells as well as the expression of immune checkpoint markers (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4, LAG3, Tim3) compared to supernatant of na&#239;ve parental cells. We also found that supernatants of MPC induced M2-like polarization of macrophages. One major candidate to convey this effect is MIF (Macrophage migration inhibitory factor) that is specifically increased in MPC supernatant.<br \/>Conclusion: Melanoma persister cells can be identified in patients&#8217; biopsies during TT as well as ICI therapy. The expression of MPC protein markers is associated with poor clinical outcome regardless of the type of treatment. Their expression is inversely correlated with a hot immune environment that could result from the effect of immunosuppressive cytokines secreted by persister cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Biomarkers,Resistance,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hongxu Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Shensi Shen<sup>2<\/sup>, Sara Faouzi<sup>3<\/sup>, Alexia Alfaro<sup>4<\/sup>, Dorothee Baille<sup>5<\/sup>, Séverine Roy<sup>3<\/sup>, Naima Benannoune<sup>3<\/sup>, Hugues Hermann<sup>1<\/sup>, Samad Muhammadnejad<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephan Vagner<sup>5<\/sup>, <b>Caroline Robert<\/b><sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>INSERM U981, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>2<\/sup>West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China,<sup>3<\/sup>INSERM U981 & Department of Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Imaging and Cytometry Platform, UMS AMMICA, UMS 23\/3655, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>5<\/sup>CNRS UMR3348 & INSERM U1278, Curie Institute, Orsay, France,<sup>6<\/sup>INSERM U981 & Department of Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy & Paris Saclay University, Villejuif, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4413c1be-54ce-440a-b97e-4ea2458be741","ControlNumber":"3381","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

In addition to direct cytotoxic effect of HMA on MDS\/AML, HMA upregulates effector T-cell function by demethylating T-cell exhaustion-associated genes (Hazem, Cell 2017) and promoting effector T-cells trafficking to tumor microenvironment by Th1-type chemokines reactivation (Peng, Nature 2019). To elucidate dynamic changes of immune cells profile and gene expression after HMA treatment in MDS\/AML, we conducted single cell RNA sequencing of three sequential bone marrow (BM) samples from one HR-MDS patient treated with azacitidine. In BM samples at diagnosis (&#8216;diagnosis&#8217;), after 2 cycles of azacitidine (BM blasts increased from 6 to 11%; &#8216;progression&#8217;), and after 3 additional cycles of azacitidine (BM blasts decreased to 3.5% with trilineage hematopoiesis; &#8216;response&#8217;), cell clusters were identified according to immune cell types. The relative proportion of the NK-cell cluster showed the most significant increase up to response (1.3% at &#8216;diagnosis&#8217;, 4.3% at &#8216;progression&#8217;, and 11.8% at &#8216;response&#8217;). By contrast, the CD8 T-cells cluster showed modest increase of proportion at the 3 timepoints (2.7%, 3.9%, and 7%, respectively). Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) analysis showed CXCR4 was overexpressed in the BM NK-cell cluster at the &#8216;response&#8217; time point. To determine whether the NK cells can be trafficked to BM by HMA treatment in mouse MDS\/AML models, mouse myeloid leukemia cells (C1498 cells) were transplanted into the tail vein of 6-to-8-week aged syngeneic C57\/BL6 mice. C1498 bearing mice were intraperitoneally treated with HMA (decitabine) or vehicle for 5 consecutive days. While HMA inhibited in vivo AML proliferation, the quantity of NK cells (NK1.1+) was significantly increased in BM of HMA-treated mice than vehicle controls. In addition, CXCR4 expression in NK1.1+ cells from BM of HMA-treated mice were significantly up-regulated, compared with vehicle controls. The NK depletion in HMA-treated AML mice decreased anti-leukemic effect, suggesting that NK cells may be one of immune cell subsets responsible for HMA induced anti-leukemia effect. Taken together, recruitment of NK cells into MDS\/AML BM through CXCR4 overexpression and anti-leukemic cytotoxicity exerted by NK cells can be one of the important immunologic mechanisms of HMA in MDS\/AML. Treatment strategy of recruiting more NK cells BM by HMA and maximizing cytotoxicity of NK cells should be further investigated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Natural killer cells,DNA methyltransferase,CXCR4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Junshik Hong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Suji Min<sup>1<\/sup>, Jihyun Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Carly M.

Results from a phase Ib, multicenter study (NCT02680184) showed that a combination of vidutolimod and pembrolizumab provided a best overall response of 23.5% in patients with metastatic or unresectable cutaneous melanoma who had received prior anti-PD-1 therapy. The Xerna&#8482; TME Panel consists of an artificial neural net that utilizes the expression of ~100 genes involved in angiogenesis and tumor immune biologies to classify patient samples into one of four tumor microenvironment (TME) biomarker subtypes: Angiogenesis (A), Immune Active (IA), Immune Desert (ID), or Immune Suppressed (IS). We hypothesized that the IS subtype is predictive of vidutolimod + pembrolizumab benefit in this cohort compared to the other TME subtypes (A, IA, and ID).<br \/>Methods: Total RNASeq was performed on FFPE biopsies collected from a subset of patients prior to therapy (N=38) and 2 weeks post-initiation of therapy (N=10). Gene expression data was analyzed using the Xerna TME Panel algorithm to assign a TME subtype. Correlational analyses between TME subtypes, response to therapy, and other hallmark gene signatures were performed.<br \/>Results: Overall response rate in the pretreatment cohort available for biomarker analysis was 26%, comparable to the entire vidutolimod\/pembrolizumab arm. The cohort had a skewed distribution of TME subtypes with high prevalence of IS (34%) and ID (45%), indicative of immune therapy-refractory biologies. An overall response of 54% was observed in the IS subtype, compared with 12% in the other subtypes combined. Comparison with other &#8220;hallmark&#8221; gene signatures confirmed enrichment of immune and angiogenesis biologies in the IS subtype, but none of these individual hallmark signatures were found to differentiate between responders and non-responders. The Xerna TME Panel demonstrated superior classification performance across all criteria compared to a baseline classifier, including accuracy (0.76 vs. 0.62), sensitivity (0.70 vs. 0.27) and specificity (0.79 vs. 0.74). Among matched post-treatment samples, 70% revealed a change in TME subtype compared to their pre-treatment status. Three of the post-treatment samples represented changes from an immune-low subtype to an immune-high subtype, including one complete responder with a pre-treatment ID that changed to IA while on therapy, illustrating how the TME Panel may be used to interpret the mechanism of drug response.<br \/>Conclusions: The Xerna TME Panel shows potential activity as a predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarker for the combination of vidutolimod and pembrolizumab in anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Biomarkers,RNA sequencing,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mark T.

Differential predictors of response are poorly characterized. Combination ICB has the highest response rates but also much higher toxicity, and which patients to treat with single agent vs. combination ICB is controversial. In this study, we set out to understand the differential biology of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 by integrating transcriptomic and clinical characterization from large cohorts of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or combination blockade.<br \/>Methods: We performed a standardized meta-analysis of all available cohorts of ICB-treated (anti-PD-1 alone, anti-CTLA-4 alone, and combination) melanoma patients with sequencing of pretreatment tumor and clinical annotations (n=572; 268 evaluated post quality-control filtering, cutaneous). Raw data in the form of FASTQs were obtained for all cohorts, and data were reprocessed using standardized pipelines. Immune infiltrate was characterized using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores from 18 immune cell type signatures, and GSEA was performed on differentially expressed genes between responders and non-responders for each treatment cohort accounting for differences in immune infiltrate. To dissect the cell types and drivers of nominated signatures, we analyzed scRNAseq from a separate cohort of pretreatment metastatic melanoma.<br \/>Results: We found that immune infiltrate was strongly predictive of response to combination blockade (OR=6.16, p&#60;0.05) but had a weaker signal in the monotherapy context (anti-PD-1 OR=1.42, n.s.; anti-CTLA-4 OR=1.10, n.s.). Among samples with a high degree of immune-infiltrate treated with either anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1, non-responders were enriched in hypoxia (avg. NES=-1.38, FDR&#60;0.05) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (avg. NES=-2.32, FDR&#60;0.05) gene signatures. Preliminary analysis of the single cell cohort shows a specific population of myeloid cells (MW p&#60;0.05) and exhausted CD8+ T cells (MW p&#60;0.05) increased in pretreatment hypoxic tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: High rates of response to combination in patients with high levels of immune infiltrate suggests that immune high patients may differentially benefit from combination blockade. Identifying features of non-responding patients stratified by immune infiltrate can lead to new biological insights into ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Malignant melanoma,,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amy  Y.

A number of in vitro studies have demonstrated that TTFields play an important role in suppressing the DNA damage pathways and increasing replication stress, in addition to interfering with mitosis. During interphase TTFields creates a conditional vulnerability environment that would make cells more susceptible to radiation and chemotherapy. The PULSAR concept relies on ablative doses of radiation spaced at least one week apart to allow a tumor to adapt to the first radiation dose before a second dose of radiation is applied. As a result, the therapy should be less toxic and be adaptable according to changes in tumor morphology, location, and response to radiation. TTFields seems well suited to the PULSAR paradigm given the time between radiation doses where TTFields application would have the potential to enhance tumor response to a subsequent radiation exposure and this is described here. First, in in vitro studies, a greater increase in radiation susceptibility was observed when cells were exposed to TTFields before radiation (IR) treatment compared to IR treatment followed by TTFields. In the present study, TTFields were combined with IR or IR+immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) to evaluate the combinatorial effectiveness in mouse tumor models. Three syngeneic mouse tumor models, LLC (Murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma), KPC63 (Pancreatic Cancer) and MC38 (Colon Cancer), were used in the initial tumor growth delay (TGD) studies. TTFields exposure increased TGD in all three mouse models, but the difference in tumor volume over time was not statistically significant due to small sample sizes. Combination studies were then initiated using the MC38 mouse model since TTFields resulted in a greater TGD effect in this model. The first in vivo experiment combined one round of TTFields with radiation therapy, which significantly delayed tumor growth. The combined efficacy of two rounds of TTFields and IR treatment was further delayed compared to radiation or TTFields alone. The combination of TTFields prior to each IR dose, two rounds of IR spaced one week apart, and an ICI (PD-L1 Ab) given sequentially inhibited tumor growth far more than either TTFields plus the ICI or TTFields plus IR or IR plus the ICI alone. To explain this increased efficacy immune-related changes in the tumor microenvironment is being evaluated. In addition, gene expression analysis is also ongoing to confirm the changes in gene expression underlying the in vitro TTFields effect on DNA repair and replication stress. In conclusion, the PULSAR paradigm for radiotherapy seems well suited for the application of TTFields prior to each radiation dose and that effect is enhanced when an ICI is also introduced.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Immune checkpoint blockade,Radiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Narasimha  K.

Providing initial support to this notion, the phase Ib NIBIT-M4 study, a dose-escalation trial of the DHA guadecitabine plus ipilimumab, has shown this regimen to be safe, tolerable and with promising immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activity in advanced melanoma. Here we report the 5-year clinical outcome of NIBIT-M4 patients and its correlation with an integrated multi-omic analysis. The NIBIT-M4 enrolled unresectable Stage III or IV cutaneous melanoma patients. Median Overall Survival (OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS), 5-year OS and PFS rate, and median Duration of Response (DoR) were assessed. Tumor biopsies were performed at baseline and at week 4 and 12 on-treatment. RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing (WES), RRBS methylation profiling, and tumor immune contexture data generated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), were integratively analyzed and correlated with clinical outcome. Patients were classified as responder (R) or non-responder (NR) based on Disease Control. Nineteen patients were enrolled in the NIBIT-M4 study between October 2015, and August 2018. As of July 1, 2022, median OS was 25.6 months (mo) (95% CI, 0.0-52.9), median PFS was 5.2 mo (95% CI, 4.0-6.4); 5-year OS rate was 28.9% and 5-year PFS rate was 5.3 %; median DoR was 20.6 mo (95% CI, 12.4-28.8). Tumor biopsies for correlative analyses were available from 14 patients. Compared to NR, R patients showed higher mutation frequency in NRAS, while NR patients harbored more frequent somatic alterations in genes involved in Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and chromatin organization pathways. By tumor transcriptome analysis, NR patients showed enrichment for proliferation\/ differentiation\/EMT pathways associated with suppression of INF-&#611;\/HLA-II\/immune-related transcriptional modules. R patients displayed a dynamic pattern of activated immune signatures related to CD8+ Tex cells, B cells, tertiary lymphoid structures, TFH cells and IFN-&#611;, reaching highest expression levels in week 12 biopsies. Deconvolution of transcriptomic data showed higher CD8+ and NK cell content and higher correlation of TCRB clonality with CD8+ content in R patients. By integration of a genetic immunoediting index (GIE) with an adaptive immunity signature (ICR) lesions were stratified into four distinct subsets. Interestingly, the ICR\/GIE classification discriminated 5-year OS and PFS while the classification based on response groups did not. Moreover, patients with a &#8220;high ICR\/non-GIE&#8221; (i.e., without immunoediting) showed lower expression of antigen presentation and processing-related genes associated with defective HLA-class I expression in the lesions, in spite of high CD8+ content.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Epigenetics,Malignant melanoma,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Teresa Noviello<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Maria Di Giacomo<sup>2<\/sup>, Francesca Pia Caruso<sup>1<\/sup>, Alessia Covre<sup>2<\/sup>, Giovanni Scala<sup>1<\/sup>, Luigi Ferraro<sup>1<\/sup>, Sandra Coral<sup>2<\/sup>, Wolf  H.

Blocking the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 unleashes the immune system and enhances anti-tumor responses. Immunotherapy using PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibodies has led to a paradigm shift in cancer drug discovery, due to its durable effect against a wide variety of cancers. However, despite its tremendous clinical success in cancer treatment, a significant fraction of patients and tumor types remain unresponsive to this therapy. This has led to the development of combination therapies linking PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors with inhibitors of several other IC receptors. A major challenge in immunotherapy drug development is the lack of quantitative and reproducible functional assays. Existing methods rely heavily on primary immune cells are highly variable and labor-intensive. Here, we report the development of a suite of cell line-based reporter bioassays for monoclonal antibodies targeting human PD-1\/PD-L1, or bispecific antibodies targeting PD-1\/PD-L1 and a co-stimulatory receptor (e.g., 4-1BB, OX40, ICOS) or an immune inhibitory receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIGIT). A mouse PD-1\/PD-L1 assay and a human PD-1\/PD-L2 assay are also developed and can be used in parallel with human PD-1\/PD-L1 assay to enable preclinical studies and assess assay specificity. Each of these assays consist of two engineered cell lines: a T effector cell line that express a luciferase reporter driven by specific promoter\/response elements responding to the intracellular signals mediated by the T cell receptor (TCR), with modulation from PD-1 and the second immune receptor, and an engineered artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC). Importantly, these combination bioassays demonstrate the synergetic effect of PD-1 blockade with blockade of a second IC inhibitor receptor or activation of a costimulatory receptor, thus reflecting the mechanisms of action for the therapeutic antibodies of interest. The bioassays are sensitive and quantitative, are prequalified according to ICH guidelines, and demonstrate the performance characteristics (specificity, precision, accuracy, and linearity) to be used as potency assays for product release and stability studies during immunotherapy drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint,Combination therapy,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jun Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Julia Gilden<sup><\/sup>, Denise Garvin<sup><\/sup>, Pete Stecha<sup><\/sup>, Jim Hartnett<sup><\/sup>, Frank Fan<sup><\/sup>, Mei Cong<sup><\/sup>, Jamison Grailer<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Promega, Fitchburg, WI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9a010ec6-08eb-4748-ba8e-97a8205f6049","ControlNumber":"3528","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

S1607 is a single arm Phase 2 study of T-VEC plus pembro in patients with advanced melanoma after PD-1\/L1 inhibitor progression. The primary endpoint is ORR by modified RECIST (progression at the first follow-up disease assessment had to be confirmed). Secondary endpoints include durable response rate (response &#8805; 6 months), ORR in injected, non-visceral non-injected, and visceral lesions, PFS, OS and toxicity. In Cohort A patients must have at least one measurable visceral lesion; in Cohort B patients must not have any visceral lesions. Each cohort had an independent accrual goal with a 2-stage design. All received intratumoral T-VEC and pembro 200mg IV every 21 days. Tumor biopsy and research blood are taken at baseline and on Day 28 (both injected and non-injected lesions). Tumor assessments are performed every 12 weeks for up to 2 years. 38 evaluable patients were enrolled. As of July 26, 2022, the median follow up was 28 months. Treatment was well tolerated, with 5\/38 (13%) grade 3 AE (no grade 4\/5) including injection site reactions, lymphocyte count decrease, and hypoxia. Cohort A was closed after stage I (n=11) with no confirmed responses. In Cohort B (n=27), there were 7 confirmed responses (26%; 2 CR, 5 PR; this rejected H<sub>0<\/sub>: ORR = 10%, p=0.01). Clinical outcomes are summarized in Table 1. Baseline tumor mutational burden from 17 patients in Cohort B were not different between responder vs non-responders (p=0.96). Translational study is ongoing for pharmacodynamic confirmation. T-VEC plus pembro in melanoma patients who have progressed on prior anti-PD1\/L1 therapy has efficacy in the subset of melanoma patients who have non-visceral metastases.<br \/>$$table_{B77E4652-270A-4849-8205-FBD28FD53F6E}$$<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{5F407450-4A09-442B-9205-828D5AEF9A47}\"><caption>Table 1<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cohort A (Visceral)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cohort B(Non-Visceral)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N (%;

The METIMMOX study (NCT03388190) explored an unconventional concept, that patients with previously untreated, unresectable abdominal metastases from MSS-CRC may achieve therapeutic efficacy from short-course oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FLOX) and sequential ICB (nivolumab). Among study patients who were assigned this highly experimental treatment, 15% obtained long-lasting complete response and more than a half met an early occurring radiologic signal of ICB responsiveness predicting significantly extended progression-free survival (PFS) compared to study control arm patients given standard FLOX chemotherapy [PMID: 36229579]. The aim of the present study was to verify if systemic tumor-defeating immunity had been invoked by the short-course FLOX treatment in the responding patients. The fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) is a circulating factor that reflects the direct cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and also activates dendritic cells that present the shed tumor antigens to tumor-targeting T-cells.<br \/>Procedures: Study patients were randomly assigned to the control arm of FLOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on day 1 and bolus 5-fluorouracil 500 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> and folinic acid 100 mg on days 1 and 2) Q2W or the experimental arm of repeat sequential cycles of 2 FLOX Q2W and 2 nivolumab (240 mg) Q2W. Radiologic response assessment was done every 8 weeks with PFS as the primary endpoint. Patients were categorized into those with target lesion (TL) reduction of &#8805;10% or &#60;10% at the first post-baseline assessment (8 weeks) [PMID: 36229579]. Serum Flt3L was measured at baseline and following the initial 2 FLOX cycles (at 4 weeks) using a Luminex assay.<br \/>Results: For all subjects, median Flt3L was 103.8 pg\/ml (range 24.6-306.1) at baseline and 162.4 pg\/ml (range 53.3-503.8) at 4 weeks. For the experimental arm patients (<i>n<\/i> = 34), the higher 4-week Flt3L level, the deeper overall radiologic response (<i>rho<\/i> = -0.39, <i>p<\/i> = 0.022, Spearman correlation). The 4-week Flt3L level was higher in patients who obtained &#8805;10% TL reduction (<i>n<\/i> = 18; median 233.5 pg\/ml, range 94.9-466.7) than in those who did not meet this 8-week predictive signal of extended PFS (<i>n<\/i> = 16; median 161.9 pg\/ml, range 53.3-374.8; <i>p<\/i> = 0.022, Mann-Whitney U test). Selecting a 160 pg\/ml cut-off, patients with 4-week Flt3L values above (<i>n<\/i> = 21) obtained longer PFS (median of 13.6 months, 95% CI 7.6-19.7) than those with serum values below (<i>n<\/i> = 13; median PFS of 5.9 months, 95% CI 2.4-9.3; <i>p<\/i> = 0.046, log-rank test).<br \/>Conclusions: High circulating Flt3L after initial short-course FLOX chemotherapy, as a proxy of invoked tumor-defeating immunity, was associated with an early radiologic signal of ICB responsiveness and improved PFS in patients with MSS-mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Oxaliplatin,Immunogenic cell death,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sebastian Meltzer<sup>1<\/sup>, Kjersti Flatmark<sup>2<\/sup>, Anniken  J.

Although in vitro studies of bortezomib (Velcade, V), lenalidomide (Revlimid, R), and dexamethasone (d) reveal mechanisms of these individual drugs, VRd therapy induced immune cell phenotype changes in vivo are unknown. We have utilized multimodal single cell methods to elucidate novel mechanisms of induction therapy response in human immune cells over time as a longitudinal study: pre-treatment (pretrt), after 2-cycles of VRd therapy (post-induction; pi) and after the end of 4-6 additional cycles of VRd therapy (end induction; ei). Protein measurements in plasma demonstrate significantly increased levels of IL-15 and IL-18 only at pi compared to pretrt but IL-2 and IFN-&#947; are progressively reduced from pretrt to ei. Both flow cytometry and single cell RNA -seq reveal that the proportion of NK cells (NK) significantly increased in PBMC only at pi compared to pretrt. NK subsets with strong dexamethasone effect emerge at pi; In contrast, memory like NK subsets (CD56<sup>dim<\/sup>CD16<sup>+<\/sup>NKG2A<sup>+<\/sup>CD94<sup>+<\/sup>) become the major NK in PBMC and bone marrow (BM) at ei. In addition, single cell ATAC-seq suggests that RUNX-family transcription factors may mediate lenalidomide to up-regulate NK cytotoxic gene expression during VRd therapy. In summary, comprehensive immune profiling of newly diagnosed MM patients suggests that transient increase of IL-15 and IL-18 may mediate the generation of memory like NK cells, which may play important roles in controlling MM growth and\/or reducing risk of infection during VRd induction therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Bone marrow,Single cell,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tao Peng<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Emma Kuan<sup><\/sup>, Anthony Cicalo<sup><\/sup>, Qiuyu Gong<sup><\/sup>, Troy Torgerson<sup><\/sup>, Xiaojun Li<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Allen Institute for Immunology, Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"232bec73-0b61-4232-b068-b83bcffcc223","ControlNumber":"924","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

We previously showed that GEN1042 induces conditional CD40 and 4-1BB agonist activity, leading to dendritic-cell maturation and enhanced T-cell activation and effector functions in vitro. However, dysfunction of exhausted T cells in the solid tumor microenvironment may represent a potential resistance mechanism to checkpoint inhibitors\/agonists. Here we utilized a multi-omics approach to evaluate whether GEN1042 could reverse T-cell exhaustion in vitro. Publicly available single cell RNA sequencing datasets were harmonized across multiple solid-tumor indications (including treatment-na&#239;ve and anti-PD-1 and\/or anti-CTLA-4 pretreated samples) and analyzed for expression of CD40, 4-1BB and PD-1 on various immune-cell subsets based on their transcriptomic signatures to characterize target prevalence. In vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) functional assays were performed where unstimulated healthy donor CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells or CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells exhausted by repeated stimulation with anti-CD3\/CD28 beads were co-cultured with allogeneic lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-matured dendritic cells. Cultures were analyzed for cytokine secretion and expression of cell surface proteins. In the unstimulated T cell\/mDC MLR assay, concurrent treatment with GEN1042 and PD-1 blockade potentiated IFN&#947;, TNF&#945; and IL-2 production compared with either compound alone. In the T-cell exhaustion MLR assay, T cells showed increased expression of inhibitory receptors (e.g., TIM-3, LAG-3) and exhibited hyporesponsiveness for both proliferation and cytokine secretion upon restimulation with anti-CD3\/CD28 beads. Here, the combined functional effect of GEN1042 plus PD-1 blockade further potentiated IFN&#947; secretion compared to single agent activity and induced IL-2 at similar levels to that observed for GEN1042 alone. These data suggest that, in addition to enhancing T-cell effector functions during T cell priming, GEN1042 can amplify the magnitude of the immune response in combination with PD-1 blockade by re-establishing the functional activity of dysfunctional T cells. GEN1042 is currently being evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors in a phase 1\/2 clinical trial (NCT04083599).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,CD40,4-1BB,Combination IO\/IO,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vanessa  M.

According to Ministry of Health and Welfare&#8217;s research, bladder cancer plays 15th leading causes of death in Taiwan in 2020. Recently immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy show several benefits on preventing T cell exhaustion, accumulating evidences showed ICI therapy still remain some limitation, including unable to regulated immunosuppressor cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) related elements which might lead to ICI therapy dysfunction. Recently, study report that DNA damage may activate the innate immune response and improve ICI efficacy. Thus, regulating DNA damage or illustrate the role of DNA damage related factor may bring the twilight to immunotherapy. To identify the possible combination methods with ICIs, we used MB49 cells and animal model to test the combination property of regorafenib (a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and 10F.9G2 (a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody). Our research illustrated the mechanism between regorafenib and PD-L1, we proved that regorafenib-induced regulated PD-L1 is associated with ATM activation. TUENL assay showed regorafenib are able to activate ATM by causing DNA break and thus enhance the expression of PD-L1 on tumor surface. This effect could be an important step to open the interaction potential of PD-L1 antibodies and thus enhance its efficacy. Through the interaction analysis of miRNA targeting gene (RNA22), we found that IDO1 mRNA could specifically interact with endogenous miR-124. Here, the propose mechanism in our research is that regorafenib may downregulate IDO1 expression via increasing of endogenous miR-124 expression. In animal model, the combination therapy showed extraordinary therapeutic effect, not only dramatically decreased tumor volume, but also upregulating the positive TME components, such as CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells and M1 macrophage. Though regorafenib may induce PD-L1 expression, regorafenib still showed several therapeutic benefits, including downregulating immunosuppressive factors, such as IDO1, VEGF, and suppressing the accumulation of regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and also repolarizing macrophage from M2-to-M1&#8943;etc. In conclusion, this study points out the combination therapy of regorafenib and anti-PD-L1 has present several benefits to bladder cancer patients and is associated with miR-124\/ATM signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Tumor microenvironment,Regorafenib,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kai-Jen Pai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, I-Tsang Chiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Fei-Ting Hsu<sup>3<\/sup>, Jai-Jen Tsai<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Administrative Center, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua City, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Yuan-Shan\/Su-Ao Branch, Su-Ao Twp., Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fd642b22-f6f4-4f48-a22a-c98c27fa9ab4","ControlNumber":"4213","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Previously, we described encouraging preclinical and early clinical activity of GEN1046 (Muik, et al., 2022, Cancer Discovery). We hypothesized that combining GEN1046 with PD-1 blockade would further potentiate anti-tumor activity through distinct and complementary immune modulatory effects. Addition of an anti-PD-1 agent would free up PD-L1 for binding to GEN1046, thus promoting PD-L1-dependent 4-1BB conditional agonism, while maintaining complete blockade of the PD-1 pathway by inhibiting interactions with both PD-L1 and PD-L2. &#8203;Here we provide preclinical evidence supportive of therapeutic synergy by the combination of GEN1046 and anti-PD-1 and describe the mechanisms of enhanced anti-tumor immunity elicited by the combination.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>in vitro<\/i> studies, combining GEN1046 with an anti-PD-1 agent potentiated cytokine release in mixed lymphocyte reaction assays (using either unstimulated T cells or T cells exhausted by repeated CD3\/CD28 co-stimulation) and enhanced T-cell expansion and cytokine secretion in antigen-specific proliferation assays compared to each single agent. In <i>in vivo<\/i> studies in mice bearing syngeneic subcutaneous MC38 tumors, the combination of an anti-mouse PD-L1x4-1BB bispecific antibody with anti-mouse PD-1 potentiated anti-tumor activity with significant enhancement of survival (P&#8804;0.001) and durable, complete tumor regressions (CR) in 7\/10 mice compared to no CR observed with either single agent, suggesting therapeutic synergy with the combination. The combination treatment elicited long-lasting immune memory response, as animals with CR were protected from tumor outgrowth upon rechallenge with MC38 cells. Mechanistically, animals treated with the combination showed a trend for &#8805;1.5-fold increase in the average density of CD3<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), as well as proliferating (Ki67<sup>+<\/sup>) and cytotoxic (GZMB<sup>+<\/sup>) CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs relative to each single agent, consistent with an amplified anti-tumor immune response.&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these preclinical results suggest that combining GEN1046-induced conditional 4-1BB stimulation with complete PD-1 blockade can improve the anti-tumor immune response via distinct and complementary immune modulatory effects. The combination of GEN1046 with pembrolizumab is currently being investigated in ongoing clinical studies in patients with advanced NSCLC, who are treatment-na&#239;ve (NCT03917381) or have progressed on prior CPI-containing therapy (NCT05117242).&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,4-1BB,Bispecific antibody,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michela Capello<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Angelica Sette<sup>1<\/sup>, Theo Plantinga<sup>1<\/sup>, Vanessa Spires<sup>2<\/sup>, Kristina Nuermberger<sup>3<\/sup>, Jordan Blum<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexander Muik<sup>3<\/sup>, Carol Costa Sa<sup>2<\/sup>, Omar Jabado<sup>2<\/sup>, Saskia Burm<sup>1<\/sup>, Aras Toker<sup>3<\/sup>, Sina Fellermeier-Kopf<sup>3<\/sup>, Tahi Ahmadi<sup>2<\/sup>, Brandon Higgs<sup>2<\/sup>, Suzana Couto<sup>2<\/sup>, Özlem Türeci<sup>3<\/sup>, Mark Fereshteh<sup>2<\/sup>, Ugur Sahin<sup>3<\/sup>, Maria Jure-Kunkel<sup>2<\/sup>, Nora Pencheva<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Genmab B.V., Utrecht, Netherlands,<sup>2<\/sup>Genmab US, Inc., Princeton, NJ,<sup>3<\/sup>BioNTech, Mainz, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dbc7f4d4-f15a-4d2e-9101-c9bc1da1162c","ControlNumber":"4430","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

We identified the innate immune kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as a candidate immune evasion gene in a pooled genetic screen. Using a suite of genetic and pharmacologic tools across multiple experimental model systems, we confirm a role for TBK1 as an immune evasion gene. Targeting TBK1 enhances response to PD-1 blockade by lowering the cytotoxicity threshold to effector cytokines (TNF&#945;\/IFN&#947;). TBK1 inhibition in combination with PD-1 blockade also demonstrated efficacy using patient-derived tumor models. Cancer cells lacking TBK1 are primed to undergo RIPK- and caspase-dependent cell death in response to TNF&#945;\/IFN&#947; in a JAK\/STAT-dependent manner.

When CD94\/NKG2A recognizes the HLA-E-peptide complex, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is recruited to the signaling synapse, resulting in the delivery of inhibitory signals to the effector cells and inhibition of their immune activities. In preclinical mouse models, blocking antibodies against NKG2A restores the reactivity of these effector cells, resulting in better suppression of tumor growth. Thus, NKG2A targeting is currently being evaluated in the clinic to evaluate tumor cell killing. To evaluate the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of anti-NKG2A in mice, we successfully generated a humanized CD94\/NKG2A double knock-in mouse strain (B-hCD94\/hNKG2A mice), in which the mouse CD94 and NKG2A genes are replaced by the corresponding human CD94 and NKG2A genes <i>in situ in cis<\/i>, respectively. Human CD94 and NKG2A mRNA and proteins were exclusively detectable by flow cytometry in homozygous humanized mice, confirming successful generation of the model. This model was used to demonstrate <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy of monalizumab analog in suppressing the growth of MC38 tumor cells expressing human HLA-E (B-hHLA-E MC38). Furthermore, dual blockade of monalizumab and PD-L1 further suppressed B-hHLA-E MC38 tumor growth. Together, these data indicate that this double humanized model is an effective tool for evaluating novel anti-human NKG2A therapies, and warrants the generation of a quadruple humanized model (B-hPD-1\/hPD-L1\/hCD94\/hNKG2A mice) to further evaluate the synergy of drugs blocking each checkpoint.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Mouse models,HLA class I,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chengzhang Shang<sup>1<\/sup>, Fang He<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Mari Kuraguchi<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Jing Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingcong Lin<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Biocytogen Boston Corp, Wakefield, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1ade1ce2-b681-47cd-b72d-ded4f101a200","ControlNumber":"4907","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

We previously conducted a phase 1 trial of cabiralizumab (anti-CSF1R) with sotigalimab (CD40 agonistic antibody) and nivolumab. Our purpose was to determine safety and the effects of this regimen on circulating and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and to determine the activity of this regimen in a phase 1b trial for melanoma patients whose disease had progressed on anti-PD-(L)1. CyTOF analysis on circulating immune cells taken before and during treatment revealed a reduction in non-classical monocytes and an increase in dendritic cells. Patients with prolonged stable disease had less T-regulatory cells and more circulating antigen presenting cells after treatment compared to patients that were treated for a shorter time. In the phase 1b component of the trial in 13 melanoma patients, objective response rates were: 1 confirmed partial response (7.7%), 1 unconfirmed partial response (7.7%), 5 stable disease (38.5%) and 6 disease progression (42.6%). Despite therapy-induced changes in circulating immune cells and previous preclinical studies supporting rationale for this combination, responses in humans were insufficient to proceed to the second stage of the phase 1b trial. Given the challenges with translating doses from mice to humans, we proceeded to study various doses of anti-CSF1R in combination with CD40 agonist and anti-PD-1 in a murine model. Higher dose anti-CSF1R in mice was associated with increased tumor growth, worse survival and by single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, we identified a more suppressive monocyte\/macrophage profile in murine tumors. Our study suggests that more anti-CSF1R might not be better. Further optimization of cabiralizumab dosing is necessary to evaluate the clinical potential in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CD40 in a difficult-to treat patient population whose therapeutic options are limited.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Malignant melanoma,CD40,Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dijana Djureinovic<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah  A.

Although poly(I:C) is a representative dsRNA with potent adjuvanticity, its clinical application has been severely limited due to heterogenicity, inconsistent activity, poor stability, and toxicity. In spite of numerous clinical trials, few products have been approved for human use. To overcome these limitations, we try to develop a novel defined form of TLR3 agonist. A single 275-kDa homogeneous molecule was selected as an alternative of poly IC and its derivatives and named NexaVant (NVT). The analytical analyses including reverse phase-HPLC analysis demonstrated that NVT is homologous without a lot-to-lot variation. NVT appears to be stable since its appearance, concentration, and molecular size were unaffected under 6 months of accelerated storage conditions. Moreover, preclinical evaluation of toxicity under good laboratory practices showed that NVT is a safe substance without signs of serious toxicity. NVT increases the expression of dsRNA sensors such as TLR3, MDA-5, and RIG-I. Together with a potent apoptotic cell death to several cancer cell lines, NVT substantially induced the phenotypic markers of DC maturation and activation including MHC-II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 together with IFN-alpha production. Several poly IC and its derivatives are used as a in situ anticancer agent in clinical trials. NexaVant was tested as an in-situ cancer therapy reagent in several animal models. When NVT is injected into tumors, it induces and recruits diverse immune cells with a potent anti-cancer effect. Combined with anit-PD-1 antibody, it shows the increase number of DC and T-cells, especially CD8 T cells and decrease that of Tregs. Using human PD-1 knock-in mouse model, NVT has shown the synergistic anti-cancer effect with anti-PD-1 antibody. Several animal efficacy data target to head and neck cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and melanoma would be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint blockade,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dongho Kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sungwhan Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>NA Vaccine Institute Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b93f28bd-bea8-4211-8035-edd8c158df67","ControlNumber":"5754","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Tebentafusp, which targets gp100, is the first ImmTAC to demonstrate an overall survival benefit and is approved for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01 adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma<sup>1<\/sup>. Clinical benefit was observed in patients with both high and low gp100 expression<sup>2<\/sup>, suggesting direct and indirect mechanisms of tumor control, which we explored using in vitro models.<br \/>Method: Uveal and cutaneous melanoma cell lines were pulsed with 0-1 &#181;M peptide concentrations or were treated with supernatants from ImmTAC-activated PBMC, with or without blocking antibodies against IFN&#946;, IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, and IL6. Peptide-HLA (pHLA) molecules on tumor cell surface were quantified by microscopy. ImmTAC-redirected T cell activation and killing were measured by ELISPOT, MSD, and xCelligence assays. Antigen presentation machinery (APM) gene expression was measured by qPCR. Linear regression models were used to assess the influence of variables on ImmTAC-mediated T cell activation.<br \/>Results: Peptide-pulsing of tumor cells showed a dose response relationship between surface pHLA number and ImmTAC-mediated T cell killing (R<sup>2<\/sup>= 0.85), which was confirmed by ImmTAC redirected killing assays using tumor lines with differential endogenous expression of pHLA targets. Higher effector: target (E: T) and higher pHLA number are the key factors, by regression analyses, influencing ImmTAC mediated T cell activation. These account for 53% and 29% variability in IFN&#947; production (p&#60;0.01), respectively. To assess the indirect impact of ImmTAC-activated T cells on tumor cells, cell lines were pre-treated with supernatants. ImmTAC-activated PBMC supernatants reduced tumor growth (2 to 25-fold) and increased tumor death (20 - 80%) in 5 of 8 cell lines tested. Blocking IFN&#947; restored tumor growth by over 40%, which was further enhanced by additional blocking of IFN&#946;, TNF&#945;, and IL6. All cell lines significantly upregulated APM genes and became more susceptible to direct ImmTAC-mediated T cell killing (1.4 to 2-fold increase).<br \/>Conclusions: In vitro, ImmTAC bispecifics kill cancer cells by both direct and indirect mechanisms. Redirection of polyclonal T cells to kill melanoma cells is greatly influenced by surface pHLA number and E:T ratio. ImmTAC-induced cytokines inhibited tumor growth, increased tumor apoptosis and resulted in higher antigen presentation demonstrating the indirect effect of ImmTAC. These observations highlight how ImmTAC-treated melanoma patients could benefit through direct and indirect mechanisms of tumor control, and in part help to explain how patients with low gp100 expression can derive benefit from tebentafusp.<br \/>References:<br \/>1.
