VT3989 is an oral, highly potent and selective inhibitor of TEAD palmitoylation, which blocks YAP function and has shown promising preclinical activity.<br \/>Materials and Methods: This FIH trial used a 3 + 3 dose escalation design and evaluated VT3989 from 25 to 200 mg QD continuously and 50 to 200 mg intermittently. Pts with refractory solid tumors, ECOG PS 0-1, serum albumin &#62; 2.5, urinary protein creatinine ratio <u>&#60;<\/u> 0.5 mg\/mg and albumin creatinine ratio <u>&#60;<\/u> 100 mg\/g were enrolled. Objectives were to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of VT3989; to evaluate antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics (PK) and correlate <i>NF2<\/i>m and other alterations in tumor and ctDNA with response.<br \/>Results: 67 pts have been enrolled. Median age 63.5y (21-83y), ECOG PS 0:1 13:54 pts. Median prior therapies 3 (range 0-8). Tumor types: 42 MM (29 pleural and 13 non-pleural) and 25 solid tumors including 9 meningioma and 4 sarcoma pts. 34 pts had <i>NF2<\/i>m (29 somatic and 5 germline). All MM pts had progressed on prior platinum\/pemetrexed; all but 2 had prior immune checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>VT3989 is safe and well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities. No MTD was defined up to 200 mg QD. The most common AEs are proteinuria, albuminuria and peripheral edema, mainly observed with the continuous schedule. There were 7 possibly related G3 AEs (fatigue, ALT, AST, dehydration, dyspnea, hypotension and peripheral edema) and 1 G4 cardiomyopathy. No pt developed decreased renal function or nephrotic syndrome. VT3989 has a 12-15 day half-life, dose proportional PK and reaches steady state within 2 weeks.<br \/>Seven pts (6 refractory MM and 1 <i>NF2<\/i>m sarcoma) achieved RECIST v1.1 partial responses (PRs) with 4 confirmed, 3 unconfirmed (1 pending). 3 PRs in MM pts are ongoing up to 18+ months. The clinical benefit response rate (PR + SD &#62; 8 weeks, per protocol) in MM pts is 57%.<br \/>Of the 6 MM pts (1 pericardial, 1 pleural\/peritoneal and 4 peritoneal) with PR, 2 have <i>NF2<\/i>m, 3 are wildtype, and 1 is unknown.<br \/>Conclusions: VT3989 is safe and well tolerated with durable RECIST v1.1 antitumor responses in pts with advanced MM and <i>NF2<\/i>m cancers, providing the first early clinical proof-of-concept for effectively drugging the Hippo-YAP-TEAD pathway. RP2D optimization including further schedule evaluation and expansion are ongoing in pts with MM and <i>NF2<\/i>m tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Yes-associated protein (YAP),Mesothelioma,Hippo pathway,Transcriptional Enhancer Activator Domain (TEAD),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy A.

The non-epithelioid subtype of mesothelioma is particularly aggressive and arginine-auxotrophic due to frequent ASS1 loss. ATOMIC-meso is a pivotal phase 2-3 trial comparing standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy plus pegargiminase or placebo for patients (pts) with non-epithelioid PM.<br \/>Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2-3 trial, we randomly assigned ECOG PS 0-1 pts with chemona&#239;ve non-epithelioid PM in an intention-to-treat 1:1 ratio to receive q3 week SOC chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> i.v.) and cisplatin (75mg\/m<sup>2 <\/sup>i.v.) with q1 week pegargiminase (36 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> i.m.) or placebo i.m. up to 6 cycles. Carboplatin (AUC5) was permitted in the phase 3 portion instead of cisplatin. Maintenance therapy with pegargiminase or placebo was continued until progression, toxicity or 24 months. The primary end point was median OS (mOS) and secondary end points included median PFS (mPFS), safety, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity. ORR was assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) for the phase 2 portion only using modified RECIST or RECIST v1.1.<br \/>Results: 249 pts with non-epithelioid PM (median age 71, range 28-86; male 82.7%; 48.2% biphasic and 51.8% sarcomatoid) from 5 countries were randomized between Aug 2017 and Aug 2021: 125 pts were assigned to the pegargiminase-chemotherapy group and 124 pts to the placebo-chemotherapy group. The experimental arm showed a superior mOS respect to SOC: 9.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-11.8) vs. 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.1-9.5) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93; p=0.023). Also, the mPFS was higher in the experimental vs. control arm: 6.2 months (95% CI, 5.8-7.4) vs. 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.14-5.91) ([HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.90; p=0.019). The ORR by BICR was 13.8% in the pegargiminase-chemotherapy group vs. 13.5% in the placebo-chemotherapy group (p=0.95) with more stable disease in the former (71.3% vs. 62.9%). Plasma arginine declined with a reciprocal increase in citrulline. Anti-ADI-PEG20 antibodies were detected in 97.4% of patients by week 25 on pegargiminase. Grade &#8805; 3 treatment-related adverse events to pegargiminase occurred in 28.8% and to placebo in 16.9%; grade &#8805; 3 drug hypersensitivity and skin reactions occurred in 3.2% and 1.6% in the experimental arm, respectively, and none on placebo. Post-study drug treatment was comparable in both arms (45.6% post-pegargiminase vs. 46.8% post-placebo).<br \/>Conclusions: In this first randomized trial of an arginine-depleting chemotherapy in cancer, the pegargiminase-pemetrexed-platinum triplet prolonged survival and had a favorable safety profile in pts with non-epithelioid PM (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02709512)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelioma,Arginine deprivation,Pemetrexed,Overall survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peter W.

KEYNOTE-966 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial of pembro versus placebo in combination with gem\/cis as first-line therapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic BTC (NCT04003636).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Eligible patients (pts) with histologically confirmed, RECIST v1.1-measurable disease with no prior systemic therapy in the unresectable or metastatic setting were randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg or placebo administered IV on day 1 Q3W for &#8804;35 cycles added to gemcitabine 1000 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> administered IV on days 1 and 8 Q3W until disease progression and cisplatin 25 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> administered IV on days 1 and 8 Q3W for &#8804;8 cycles. Randomization was stratified by region (Asia vs non-Asia), stage (metastatic vs locally advanced), and tumor origin (gallbladder vs intrahepatic vs extrahepatic). The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points were PFS, ORR, and DOR per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review and safety. Per protocol, the final analysis of PFS and ORR was at the first interim analysis (IA1; data cutoff, December 15, 2021). All other data are from the protocol-specified final analysis (FA; data cutoff, December 15, 2022). One-sided <i>P<\/i>-value boundaries for significance were 0.0200 for OS, 0.0125 for PFS, and 0.0125 for ORR.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: 1069 pts were randomized to pembro + gem\/cis (n = 533) or placebo + gem\/cis (n = 536). Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms; 45.5% of pts were from Asia, 88.2% had metastatic disease, and 59.2% had intrahepatic origin. Median study follow-up was 25.6 mo (range 18.3-38.4) at FA. At FA, median (95% CI) OS was 12.7 mo (11.5-13.6) for pembro + gem\/cis vs 10.9 mo (9.9-11.6) for placebo + gem\/cis (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72-0.95; <i>P<\/i> = 0.0034); 24-mo OS was 24.9% vs 18.1%. OS results were generally consistent across subgroups. At IA1, median (95% CI) PFS was 6.5 mo (5.7-6.9) for pembro + gem\/cis vs 5.6 mo (5.1-6.6) for placebo + gem\/cis (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75-1.00; <i>P<\/i> = 0.0225); 12-mo PFS was 25.4% vs 19.8%. At IA1, ORR (95% CI) was 28.7% (24.9-32.8) for pembro + gem\/cis vs 28.5% (24.8-32.6) for placebo + gem\/cis (difference 0.2; 95% CI -5.2 to 5.6; <i>P<\/i> = 0.4735); median (range) DOR was 9.7 mo (1.2+ to 22.7+) vs 6.9 mo (0.0+ to 19.2+). Grade 3-5 AEs occurred in 85.3% of 529 pts treated in the pembro + gem\/cis arm vs 84.1% of 534 treated in the placebo + gem\/cis arm (drug related, 71.3% vs 69.3%). Grade 5 AE incidence was 5.9% vs 9.2% (drug related, 1.5% vs 0.6%). Potentially immune-mediated AEs and infusion reactions occurred in 22.1% vs 12.9%.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Pembro + gem\/cis provided a statistically significant, clinically meaningful OS improvement versus placebo + gem\/cis in pts with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable BTC. The safety profile of pembro + gem\/cis was as expected and manageable. These data support pembro + gem\/cis as a new first-line treatment option in this setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL04-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Immunotherapy,Pembrolizumab,Biliary Tract Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robin Kate Kelley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Changhoon Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard S.

A previously published retrospective review of patients with PD-1 blockade treated DM suggested this cancer may be highly responsive to PD-1 blockade (Eroglu et al. Nature 2018). S1512 is the first prospective study investigating PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab in patients with DM. 1512 Cohort A results were presented and demonstrated a 59% complete pathologic response rate with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in patients with resectable DM (Kendra et al. ASCO 2022). Herein, we present results from S1512 Cohort B in patients with metastatic DM.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures<\/b>: Patients aged <u>&#62;<\/u>18 with metastatic DM received pembrolizumab 200 mg q3 weeks. Eligibility criteria included: Zubrod PS 0-2, no central nervous system metastases, autoimmune disease, or steroid <u>&#62;<\/u>10 mg of prednisone. The primary endpoint was complete response rate (CR) assessed per RECIST 1.1, with the assumption that CR of 20% or higher indicates that the treatment is of interest. A single stage design with 21 eligible patients would have an alpha of 8.5% (when the true CR is 5%) and a power of 82%. Tumor assessments were performed every 9 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity assessment. Biopsies were analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES) for mutational load and oncogenic driver mutations.<br \/><b>Summary of data<\/b>: 27 eligible patients were enrolled in Cohort B. 93% were male, 70% had Zubrod PS 0, median age 75 (range 59-90). Median number of cycles received: 15 (range 1-34). At the time of data cutoff, 3 patients remain on protocol treatment with pembrolizumab. Treatment was discontinued due to: 2 years of therapy (4), adverse event (AE) (8), physician and patient choice (6), progressive disease (4), and under review (2). Objective response rate (including both confirmed and unconfirmed partial and complete responses) was 85% (95% CI: 66%-96%), with 7\/27 CR (26%) and 16\/27 PR (59%). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 10 patients. WES analysis was available for 16 patients. Both baseline (N=10) and on-treatment biopsies (N=12) were evaluated for canonical genetic drivers of melanoma; 7 patients had tumors with loss of function (LOF) mutations in <i>NF1<\/i>, and all had mutations in <i>TP53<\/i>, with no case having activating mutations in <i>BRAF<\/i> or <i>NRAS<\/i>, consistent with the known genetic alterations in DM. The median TMB in baseline biopsies was 79.4 Mut\/Mb (range 34.3-159).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Patients with metastatic DM are exceptional responders to single agent PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab. Based on this data, the pathologic subtype of melanoma can be used as a predictive biomarker of response to single agent pembrolizumab.
