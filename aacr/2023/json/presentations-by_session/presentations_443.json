[{"Abstract":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal forms of cancer. To date, there are few therapies that are efficient against this disease, and patients often develop therapy resistance. The homologous Rho GTPases, Rac and Cdc42, are overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and correlated with poor prognosis. Rho GTPases regulate cell migration\/invasion, cell morphology\/polarity, and cell survival\/viability. Rac and Cdc42 are essential Rho GTPases in oncogenic transformation and invasiveness and govern invasion in both cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs are immunosuppressive cells that exacerbate cancer progression via inflammatory responses and crosstalk signaling with malignant cancer cells to promote invasion and immunesuppression. Our laboratory has developed a dual Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitor, MBQ-167 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 100nM), as an anticancer agent that recently received IND approval from the US FDA due to its safety and efficacy in breast cancer models. The hypothesis tested in this study is that MBQ-167 will simultaneously target the migration and activity of pancreatic cancer cells and immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). To evaluate this, we performed pulldown assays for Rac and Cdc42 activation, MTT cell viability assays, wound-healing assays for cell migration, and phagocytosis assays using human and rat macrophage and human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Results show that MBQ-167 is not toxic to macrophages even at concentrations as high as 10uM. MBQ-167 inhibited Rac1activation by 75% and Cdc42 activation by 40% in THP-1 human macrophages at 500nM. MBQ-167 reduced macrophage migration by 67% at 150nM, and decreased pancreatic cancer cell migration by 60% at 250nM. In addition, MBQ-167 reduced macrophage phagocytosis by 56% at 500nM. This study demonstrates the utility of Rac\/Cdc42 inhibition to reduce pancreatic cancer progression in the TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment ,Therapeutic target,GTPase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anamaris Torres-Sánchez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Rivera-Robles<sup>2<\/sup>, Stephanie Dorta-Estremera<sup>3<\/sup>, Suranganie Dharmawardhane<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biology, University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico,<sup>2<\/sup>Biochemistry, University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus, San Juan, Puerto Rico,<sup>3<\/sup>Microbiology, University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"85b2251b-70d9-486c-990a-482ba2d5a3b6","ControlNumber":"6155","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

The interaction between IQ3 and Ras-ERK signaling has been reported, but how IQ3 regulates Ras-ERK signaling in malignancies is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of IQ3 in coordinating diverse pathways, such as ERK-Ras and TGF&#946; in gastric cancer (GC).According to Stomach Adenocarcinoma of TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas, the frequency of gene mutations is high in TP53 (60.1%), RTK-Ras (51.8%), and TGF&#946; pathways (36.4%). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that KRAS signaling was significantly downregulated after IQ3 knockdown (KD) in three GC cell lines (AGS, NUGC3, Hs746T). Ingenuity upstream regulator analysis (IPA) of RNA sequencing data revealed that TGF&#946;1, the top-ranked growth factor, is significantly inhibited after IQ3 KD. Immunoblot analysis showed that IQ3 KD led to suppression of TGF&#946;-induced phosphorylation of MEK\/ERK in three GC cell lines, particularly NUGC3. While TGF&#946; treatment promoted invasion and migration in transwell migration assays, IQ3 KD significantly diminished TGF&#946;-mediated cell migration. <i>In vivo, <\/i>the size and volume of subcutaneous tumors from IQ3 KD NUGC3 cells were significantly smaller than that from Control (Ctrl) cells. According to RNA sequencing using bulk tumors, mouse stromal cells in Ctrl tumors showed significantly higher expression of <i>acta2, fap, pdgfa<\/i>, which are the markers of cancer-associated fibroblasts, than in IQ3 KD tumors. The TGF&#946;1 expression levels in the NUGC3 xenograft and mouse stromal cells harvested from Ctrl were significantly higher than that from IQ3 KD, respectively. Additionally, digital spatial profiler (DSP) GeoMx evaluation of the intra-tumoral expressions from the human xenograft and mouse stromal cells showed that the mouse stromal cells from Ctrl expressed significantly higher <i>acta2<\/i> and tgf&#946;1 than that from IQ3 KD. Furthermore, metastasis assays via tail vein injection <i>in vivo<\/i> showed dramatically lesser lung metastases from IQ3 KD cells than that from Ctrl cells. This study shows that IQ3 KD suppressed Ras signaling and blocked upstream regulator TGF&#946;1 <i>in vitro<\/i>. The stromal cells in the IQ3 KD xenografts showed a reduced population of cancer-associated fibroblasts <i>in vivo<\/i>. Consequently, tumorigenesis and metastasis were strongly suppressed after IQ3 KD.

The structure and composition of membrane-bound RAS complexes is dynamic, but defined states appear to exist. We previously found biological and biophysical evidence for two different models of membrane-bound RAS assemblies where RAS proteins form symmetric or asymmetric RAS-RAS interactions. It is unknown what functions these two architectures might serve and what determinants these nanoclusters might be subject to. To further characterize which architectural states occur in various biological scenarios, we developed a plate-based assay to detect RAS-RAS interactions in cells. The system controls for RAS expression and can be used to discriminate symmetric and asymmetric RAS-RAS interactions. It can also be used to assess the relative contributions of the G domain (1-166) and hypervariable region (HVR) in mediating RAS-RAS interactions. We found that RAS isoforms can homo- and hetero-dimerize and observed that the G domain contributes to RAS-RAS interactions, but that the HVR does not. We also found that the primary determinant of HVR interaction with the membrane is electrostatic charge. Regarding cancer-causing mutations, we found that in the KRAS G12D context, RAS-RAS interactions appear to favor asymmetric RAS-RAS interactions while KRAS Q61H favors symmetric RAS-RAS interactions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GTPase,Signaling pathways,Mutations,Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhiwei Zhou<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xing-Xiao Li<sup><\/sup>, Cynthia Meyer<sup><\/sup>, Yu-An Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Deekshi Angira<sup><\/sup>, Kenneth Westover<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UTSW, Dallas, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7cbc4081-53ae-40b3-93dc-5aceac7e4bfa","ControlNumber":"3792","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

Cot\/MAP3K8) kinase becomes oncogenic via disruption of the C-terminus, which abrogates its proteasomal degradation. However, the mechanism underlying degradation of TPL2 remains unclear. Using proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), for the first time we have discovered that Tripartite Motif Containing 4 (TRIM4) is the E3-ligase that binds and degrades TPL2 via polyubiquitination of lysine 415 and 439. Notably, naturally-occurring oncogenic R442H and E188K mutations in TPL2 abrogated the binding and polyubiquitination by TRIM4. Furthermore, KRAS oncoprotein stabilizes TPL2 by promoting TRIM4 degradation. Using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we identified TRIM21 as a ligase that binds and stabilizes TRIM4, in part by reducing TRIM4 polyubiquitination. Therefore, oncogenic KRAS binds to and promotes TRIM21 degradation, destabilizing TRIM4 and prolonging the half-life of TPL2. Overall, we discovered novel mechanisms of TPL2 regulation which are influenced by oncogenic KRAS, providing opportunities for the development of novel therapies.<br \/>[S. Bansod and P.B.

It has been shown that mutant K-ras preferentially signals through RAF-MEK-ERK signaling and that blockade of this pathway is essential for tumor regression. However, targeted MEK inhibitors (MEKi) have shown limited clinical benefit in the treatment of K-ras mutant cancers due to resistance caused by the feedback activation of the upstream kinase CRAF. Recently, PROTACs (Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras) targeting MEK1 and MEK2 were developed, providing a new therapeutic strategy to degrade MEK1\/2 in K-ras mutant cancer cells. Due to the fact that feedback-induced CRAF causes MEKi resistance in K-ras mutant cells, we postulated that degrading MEK1\/2 could bypass CRAF-mediated resistance. Indeed, treatment of MEKi-sensitive or resistant K-ras mutant cell lines with MEK1\/2 degraders rapidly reduced MEK1\/2 protein levels and downstream ERK signaling causing growth inhibition and apoptosis. Proteomics characterization of K-ras mutant cell lines following MEK1\/2 degrader or inhibitor treatment revealed MEK1\/2 degradation exhibited distinct signaling pathway responses compared to inhibition. Together, our studies showed MEK1\/2 degraders represent a promising avenue for the treatment K-ras mutant cancers that can by-pass resistance mechanisms observed with traditional MEK1\/2 inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Proteomics,Signaling,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carlos Herrera-Montavez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alison  M.

Breast cancer is categorized by the overexpression (or lack thereof) of estrogen receptors (ER+\/-), progesterone receptors (PR+\/-) or human epidermal growth factor 2 receptors (HER2+\/-). Specifically, HER2+ breast cancer is one of the most aggressive subtypes, comprising ~20% of all cases. Overexpression of the HER2 receptor leads to active downstream signaling that results in cell proliferation and metastasis. Clinically, this problem has been tackled by targeting the HER2 receptor with antibodies (e.g., Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab) and (or) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; e.g., Lapatinib). However, patients may present with intrinsic or acquired resistance to these therapies. Molecular mechanisms of resistance to HER2 targeted therapy include activating mutations, alterations in downstream effectors, and compensation from other growth factor receptors. The active signaling sequelae from such mechanisms converge on the activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that regulate the GTPases Rac and Cdc42. These GTPases are critical for cell migration\/invasion and have been correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Therefore, targeting the activation of Rac\/Cdc42 is a rational strategy to overcome HER2-targeted therapy resistance. Previously, we characterized the dual Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitor MBQ-167 with IC50s of 103nM and 78nM for Rac and Cdc42, respectively. Our objective is to test MBQ-167 as an alternative to overcome HER2-targeted therapy resistance. To test the hypothesis that MBQ-167 will overcome HER2 therapy resistance, metastatic trastuzumab resistant HER2 overexpressing cells were treated with vehicle or individual or combined Trastuzumab and MBQ-167. Rac activity was determined by pulldown assays for active (GTP-bound) Rac, and viability was tested by MTT assays. Additionally, we measured apoptosis via caspase 3\/7 activity and western blotted for the active signaling sequelae downstream of Rac. MBQ-167 reduced Rac activity and downstream signaling, as well as cell viability with a GI50 of 78nM after 72 hours, while caspase activity was increased after 24 hours of treatment. The results presented herein show the utility of the Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitor MBQ-167 in overcoming HER2-targeted therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule drugs,Therapy resistance,GTPase,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miciely Cristal Aponte Reyes<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Luis  E.

They regulate cell growth, survival and differentiation by coupling receptor activation to downstream effector pathways. Activating mutations of oncogenic RAS pathway genes are frequently detected in human cancers. KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers. Most of these tumors are addicted to KRAS signaling. However, tumors can become resistant to RAS signaling pathway inhibitors through the activation of suppressor mechanisms. A possible explanation is that these tumors carry a second genomic perturbation that can compensate for the detrimental effects of the RAS signaling inhibitors, a phenomenon referred to as suppression. In model organisms, suppression interactions are generally divided into two classes: genomic suppressors which are secondary mutations in the genome that bypass a mutant phenotype, and dosage suppression interactions in which overexpression of a suppressor gene rescues a mutant phenotype. We decided to use the latter strategy in human cancer cells to identify KRAS suppressor genes. KRAS suppressor genes can be involved in resistance mechanisms of RAS pathway inhibitors and this approach could identify new targets for drug research programs and\/or novel drug combinations. In this study we performed a screen on a human Open Reading Frame library (hORFeome collection) to identify potential KRAS suppressor genes. First, we engineered a SW620 cell line with a conditional expression of KRAS G12V by replacing the KRAS endogenous promoter by the doxycycline regulated TREG3 promoter. Second, we transduced this conditional cell line with a human ORFeome collection, and we looked for suppressors among the transduced cells that lead to cell proliferation in absence of KRAS G12V protein. Then candidate suppressors have been identified by NGS and validated after individual cloning and expression in SW620 KRAS conditional cells. Finally, two transcription factors and two orphan G protein-coupled receptors have been validated as KRAS suppressor genes when they are highly expressed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Suppressors,ORFeome,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christophe Marcireau<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Philippine Furge<sup><\/sup>, Fanny Sennechael<sup><\/sup>, Alice willart<sup><\/sup>, Anne-Marie Blanchet<sup><\/sup>, Veeranagouda Yaligara<sup><\/sup>, Michel Didier<sup><\/sup>, Frederic Lacroix<sup><\/sup>, Melina Meunier<sup><\/sup>, Laurent Debussches<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Sanofi, Vitry-Sur-Seine, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3b562e06-cf45-4014-904b-9afc977fa305","ControlNumber":"2049","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

However, there are cases in which disease progresses rapidly at the end of treatment even after AR suppression, suggesting that the disease progresses by mechanisms different from AR. The aim of this study is to investigate the KRAS signaling pathway as one of the mechanisms.<br \/>Methods: We used the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) cell line LNCaP and the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell line DU145. We performed KRAS knockdown by si-RNA and activation of KRAS signaling by EGF stimulation. To examine KRAS signaling, PCR and Western blotting were performed. The changes in proliferation and migration due to inhibition and activation of KRAS signaling were confirmed.<br \/>Results: RT-PCR showed a fusion gene of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2L3 and KRAS (UBE2L3-KRAS) in DU145. Western blotting showed increased phosphorylation of ERK and p38 downstream of KRAS in DU145. KRAS knockdown inhibited proliferation and migration in DU145 but not in LNCaP. In EGF-stimulated activation of KRAS signaling, Western blotting showed activation of downstream KRAS signaling in LNCaP, but no change in proliferation and migration in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-added medium. In contrast, EGF stimulation of DU145 further activated downstream KRAS signaling and promoted proliferation and migration. The AR-dependent LNCaP showed almost no effect of KRAS signaling activation on cancer progression, whereas DU145 showed that KRAS signaling is involved in cancer progression.<br \/>Conclusion: While HSPC is highly AR-dependent and does not show any effect of KRAS on cancer progression, KRAS may be involved in cancer progression in some CRPCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,KRAS,EGF,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Taiki Kamijima<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kouji Izumi<sup><\/sup>, Yoshifumi Kadono<sup><\/sup>, Atsushi Mizokami<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Integrative Cancer Therapy and Urology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical, Kanazawa, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"af8fb80d-241a-4cef-a098-afde4dc45a7e","ControlNumber":"2538","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Focal and transient Rac activity stimulates protrusion at the leading edges of migrating cells. Rac is also a component of the complex machinery cells use to engulf apoptotic bodies, pathogens, and fluid. Loss of function of the hematopoietic-expressed Rac2 gene causes immunodeficiencies due to impaired migration and survival of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Paradoxically, human patients with germline mutations that hyperactivate Rac2 also exhibit immunodeficiencies. In this study, we report that persistent expression of a hyperactive Rac in a subset of epithelial follicle cells in<i> Drosophila<\/i> ovary leads to tissue-scale destruction by stimulating engulfment. Further, hyperactive Rac2 enhances engulfment in macrophages and renders lymphocytes prone to engulfment, causing immunodeficiencies in a hyperactivate Rac2 mouse model. Human macrophage-like cells overexpressing a dominant activating Rac2 can engulf and kill living Raji B-cell lymphoma or Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells.<br \/><b>Objective:<\/b> This study aims to understand the role of hyperactive Rac in causing immunodeficiency due to hyper-phagocytosis and harnessing this property to develop novel cancer therapies.<br \/><b>Study design:<\/b> <i>UAS-Gal4<\/i> system was used to study the tissue-specific expression of hyperactive Rac in<i> Drosophila<\/i> ovary.

Also, resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors and other KRAS\/RAF\/MEK pathway drugs is commonly observed in the treated cancer patients. A vital unmet need is the development of agents that potently and safely inhibit the altered KRAS signaling in these settings. A broadly acting KRAS mutation small molecule inhibitor lead series was developed using KRAS domain structure-guided scaffold modifications starting from a group of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors. Optimized properties of these compounds were evaluated by tumor cell selectivity in vitro and pharmacophore elaboration. A novel lead series was identified with robust tumor cell growth inhibition, exemplified with the TEB-17112 lead candidate, having IC50 of inhibition against multiple KRAS-altered cell lines: NCI-H358 (KRAS-G12C, 33.6nM), AGS (KRAS-G12D, 23.5 nM), SW480 (KRAS-G12V, 22.5 nM) and A375 (KRAS-wildtype, 58.9 nM) respectively. TEB-17112 demonstrated inhibition of SW480 and H358 mouse xenografts at 25 or 50 mg\/kg PO QD (21 days) without significant body weight loss. On further optimization of the lead series, TEB-17231 had on average a higher potency against KRAS mutant tumor cell lines, including H358 (12 nM), AGS (5.4 nM), SW480 (3.6 nM), and A427 (KRAS-G12D, 9.7 nM). With a candidate group of 7 compounds from this lead series, there was consistently a 5- to 6-fold selectivity of inhibition for KRAS mutant over KRAS wildtype cell lines. The lead candidate TEB-17231 was also observed to inhibit cell lines with other KRAS mutations: NCI-H1734 (KRAS-G13C, 6.5 nM), MDA-MB-231 (KRAS-G13D,11.2 nM), RPMI-8226 (KRAS-G12A, 11.3 nM), Calu-6 (KRAS-Q61K,19.8 nM), KP-2 (KRAS-G12R, 24.1 nM), LS123 (KRAS-G12S, 21 nM), as well as HRAS and NRAS mutant cell lines. TEB-17231 inhibits phospho-ERK downstream signaling in several tumor cell lines. Further, TEB-17231 exhibited tumor growth inhibition (IC50) in KRAS-G12C Ba\/F3 (14 nM) and derivative cell lines that acquired resistance to G12C inhibitor MRTX849 by the additional KRAS domain mutations as follows: H95Q (32 nM), H95D (40 nM), Y96C (39 nM), Y96D (20 nM) and R68S (22 nM), compared with greater than 1&#956;M for MRTX849. TEB-17231 induces late apoptosis of NCI-H358 cells in a manner that is time and concentration dependent. In addition to the improved selectivity and potency, TEB-17231 demonstrated satisfactory pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability in mice (55%). Furthermore, with the SW480 (G12V) in vivo xenograft model, TEB-17231 showed clear tumor growth inhibition with QD dosing for 4-8 mg\/kg PO without body weight loss. These properties highlight TEB-17231 as a potential clinically actionable inhibitor for the KRAS-modified tumor population and warrant investigation of TEB-17231 in combination with other agents in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Signaling,Resistance,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Zusheng Xu<sup><\/sup>, <b>David T.

Of the currently identified mutations, the M90I variant (RIT1<sup>M90I<\/sup>) is most prevalent. A targeted therapy for <i>RIT1<\/i>-mutant and <i>RIT1<\/i>-amplified tumors would address a major unmet clinical need, but little is known about how <i>RIT1<\/i> drives cellular transformation. Recent work suggests that the protein abundance of RIT1 is important for its function. In line with these findings, our lab performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen in <i>RIT1<\/i>-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells and identified the deubiquitinase USP9X as a potential regulator of RIT1 abundance. We hypothesize that USP9X positively regulates wild-type and mutant RIT1, and USP9X inhibition could be a tractable means of abrogating <i>RIT1<\/i>-driven tumor growth. We have explored this hypothesis in numerous different cell line models, including NCI-H2110 cells&#8212;a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line that harbors an endogenous RIT1<sup>M90I<\/sup> mutation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP9X in NCI-H2110 cells resulted in a 56.29% reduction of RIT1 abundance (95% CI = -76.63 to -10.8) via Western Blot analysis. Furthermore, cycloheximide-chase experiments revealed that RIT1 stability was decreased in siUSP9X-treated cells compared to siCtrl-treated cells. We have also explored USP9X-mediated RIT1 regulation of endogenous wild-type RIT1 in PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cells and found that CRISPR knockout of USP9X reduced wild-type RIT1 abundance by 46.83% (95% CI = -73.84 to -32.51). In PC9 cells engineered to express RIT1<sup>M90I<\/sup>, siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP9X decreased RIT1<sup>M90I<\/sup> abundance by 58.56% (95% CI = -59.3 to -23.59). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of USP9X with two different small molecule inhibitors (WP1130 and G9) decreased RIT1 abundance in PC9 cells. Cells treated with 1&#956;&#924; of WP1130 showed a 56.21% (95% CI = -131.1 to 43.55) reduction in RIT1 abundance compared to DMSO-treated cells. In addition to assessing protein abundance and stability, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in <i>RIT1<\/i>-mutant and <i>RIT1<\/i>-overexpressing HEK293T cells and found that both RIT1<sup>WT<\/sup> and RIT1<sup>M90I<\/sup> physically interact with USP9X. We also performed ubiquitination experiments in <i>RIT1<\/i>-overexpressing HEK293T cells and found that co-expression of wild-type USP9X decreased RIT1 ubiquitination, but a catalytically dead USP9X variant did not affect levels of RIT1-Ub. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that USP9X controls the deubiquitination and stabilization of RIT1<sup>WT <\/sup>and RIT1<sup>M90I<\/sup>. This work provides more insight on the basic biology of RIT1 regulation and has important therapeutic implications given that USP9X inhibition could reduce RIT1 protein abundance and abrogate <i>RIT1<\/i>-driven tumor growth, thereby addressing a major unmet clinical need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,GTPase,Targeted therapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amanda  K.

NF2 patients are likely to develop Schwannomas on the eighth cranial nerve that lead to progressive deafness and spinal cord compression as well as meningiomas and peripheral nerve tumors. Effective treatment for these patients is lacking, with risky surgery being the most reliable approach and pharmacotherapies having inadequate results. The hallmark mutation of this condition is inactivation of NF2, which codes for the protein Merlin. Merlin plays several roles in the cell, two of the most consequential being inhibition of PAK1 and activation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. However, drugs targeting these pathways have not yet been investigated in NF2-deficient Schwannoma. In this study, we explored the use of YAP-TEAD inhibitors as well as the combination of Hippo family and Group I PAK inhibition in NF2-deficient Schwannoma cells. We used several Schwannoma cells lines of human, mouse, and rat origin as well as a human Schwann cell line with NF2 knocked out via CRISPR compared to its wild-type control line. We investigated the role of YAP, the main effector of the Hippo pathway, and PAK1\/2 in NF2 Schwannoma cells via genetic and pharmacologic inhibition. We also combined YAP-TEAD inhibitors with several PAK family inhibitors to induce a synergistic reduction in cell viability and proliferation as well as an increase in apoptosis. We found that genetic inhibition of both YAP and Group I PAK proteins led to partial reduction in Schwannoma growth. Using several YAP-TEAD binding inhibitors (TED-347, NSC682769, IK-930), Group I PAK inhibitors (FRAX-1036, G555) and PAK1-specific inhibitor (NVS-1-PAK1) we found that YAP-TEAD binding inhibition combined with Group I PAK inhibition has the greatest reduction on Schwannoma cell viability, proliferation, and increase in cell death. Taken together, our findings indicate that both the Hippo pathway and PAK proteins may be viable targets for Schwannoma therapies. Furthermore, combining the two may lead to a synergistic effect and further prevent growth of NF2-deficient Schwannomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dorothy Benton<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jonathan Chernoff<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ce5034de-c6f6-45b6-863e-6190857a919e","ControlNumber":"3075","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.
