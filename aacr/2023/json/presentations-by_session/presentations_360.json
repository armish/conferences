[{"Abstract":"Introduction: There are similar and different properties between the epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (mEGFR), which are classified into common, uncommon, and compound mutation subtypes depending on their location and pattern on the EGFR gene. We investigated the RWD and RNA expression profile of non-common mutations (uncommon and compound mutations) in the mEGFR+ NSCLC patients.<br \/>Method: We analyzed the NGS data extracted from the Foundation Medicine (FMI) SRC. And, we collected the medical information for stage I-IIIA mEGFR+ NSCLC patients receiving curative surgical resection. In B&#246;ehringer Ingelheim (BI) open data access (ODA), we analyzed treatment results in stage IV mEGFR+ NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKI. We explored the RNA expression profile by High-Plex Digital Spatial Profiling. A total of 18,676 DEG libraries were constructed, and 419 significance genes with &#62; 2-fold changes, 3-log 2 normalized read counts, and p-value = 0.05 (up and down) were identified.<br \/>Result: In FMI-SRC cohort, 10,059 mEGFR+ cases of total 78,656 cases consist of common, 6,994 (69.5%), uncommon, 1,966 (19.6%), and compound, 1,099 (10.9%). In hospital cohort, 941 mEGFR+ cases consist of common, 860 (91.4%), uncommon, 60 (7.4%), and compound, 21 (2.2%). Median relapse-free survival (mRFS) in non-common mutations (31.4M and 33.7M) was shorter than common mutations (40.1M, p=0.877). CNS recurrence in the non-common mutations (40.0% and 35.3%) tended to be higher than that of common mutations (27.4%, p=0.361). In BI-ODA, median time on treatment (mTOT) in 163 uncommon mutations (10.0M) and 139 compound mutations (11.5M) were shorter than historical data of common mutations (17.3M). Spatial RNA-seq data of the ratio of deconvolution individual cells showed that genes involved in inflammatory and immune response were relatively lower in non-common mutations. Gene ontology string analysis revealed RNA expression of genes in compound mutations was functionally associated with chemokine production (23.4%), electron transfer activity (14.9%) and T cell selection (8.5%), and, in uncommon mutations, was associated with regulation of oligopeptide transport (26.1%), hypermethylation of CpG island (21.7%), and CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cell lineage commitment (13.0%), compared to common mutations. Based on the GSEA, relatively highly clustered genes in compound mutations were the protein modification process, G-protein coupled receptor, regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, and IL-5 production pathways, and lower ES levels in oxidative phosphorylation and RNA processing pathways, when compared to common mutations.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that uncommon and compound mEGFR subtypes exhibiting shorter mRFS and mTOT, and distinguishing RNA expression profile of functional signaling pathways be not same disease entity as common mEGFR subtype","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,EGFR,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seoree Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yeoun Eun Sung<sup>2<\/sup>, Joo Ri Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Chan Kwon Jung<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeong-Oh Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeong-yeon Shin<sup>2<\/sup>, Guk Jin Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Sang hoon Chun<sup>1<\/sup>, Young Ho Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, Jin Hyoung Kang<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital, Bucheon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Research Center for Bioconvergence Analysis, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"712053de-42c9-4c70-84aa-22167bee1737","ControlNumber":"2792","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a Trop-2-directed ADC, is approved for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) with &#8805;2 prior therapies (&#8805;1 in metastatic setting). SG is also being investigated in other breast cancer subtypes, including hormone receptor-positive\/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+\/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer and in earlier lines of treatment. To understand the landscape of Trop-2 expression and potential clinical actionability of Trop-2 and other antigens, we evaluated RNA expression data in breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> TCGA and METABRIC datasets were assessed for Trop-2, HER2, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression via processed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarray data of the corresponding genes <i>TACSTD2<\/i>, <i>ERBB2<\/i>, and <i>CD274<\/i>. Gene expression across clinical parameters was assessed via one-way ANOVA, t-test, or Spearman correlation. HER2 status was classified as HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0 or HER2-low (IHC1+, or IHC2+ and in situ hybridization-negative). Survival was estimated via Kaplan-Meier method. Neoadjuvant therapy datasets were assessed for effects of aromatase inhibitors on Trop-2 expression.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RNA-Seq data was available from 1030 and 2136 breast cancer patients in TCGA and METABRIC datasets, respectively. Most patients (96%) had high <i>TACSTD2<\/i> expression (&#62;100 transcripts per million [TPM]). <i>TACSTD2 <\/i>expression was comparable by breast cancer histology (median log2TPM 6.8-7.5), by disease stages I-IV (median log2TPM 7.0-7.5), or by subtypes (median log2TPM 7.1-7.3). <i>TACSTD2 <\/i>expression was not correlated with <i>ERBB2<\/i> (Spearman rho=0.06) or <i>CD274<\/i> (Spearman rho=-0.13) expression. No difference in <i>TACSTD2 <\/i>expression was noted between HER2 IHC0 or HER2-low subtypes. <i>TACSTD2<\/i> expression was not associated with survival, though low tertile <i>TACSTD2<\/i> groups had better prognosis in the basal subtype; treatments were heterogeneous. Changes in <i>TACSTD2<\/i> gene expression were not observed post-aromatase inhibitors.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> While SG is approved for use in mTNBC, <i>TACSTD2<\/i> is stably expressed across all breast cancer stages and subtypes, including HER2 IHC0 and HER2-low, and across all ranges of PD-L1 expression, suggesting a broad patient population may benefit from Trop-2-directed ADCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Trop-2,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),sacituzumab govitecan,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kai Song<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Oh Kyu Yoon<sup><\/sup>, Luting Zhuo<sup><\/sup>, Emon Elboudwarej<sup><\/sup>, Biao Li<sup><\/sup>, Jillian Boice<sup><\/sup>, Yang Pan<sup><\/sup>, See Phan<sup><\/sup>, Monica Motwani<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6e8daa53-24ea-4a0e-82a7-29ee36c164a4","ControlNumber":"6441","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Response was annotated using RECIST 1.1. Manual segmentation of primary and measurable metastatic lesions on pre-treatment CT scans was performed, and tumor volume was calculated from these measurements. Tumor burden was defined as the involvement status, volume, or lesion counts within specific organs (lungs, pleura, lymph nodes, liver, adrenals, bone, and soft tissue) and across whole body. We explored the impact of baseline tumor burden on ICI response and its association with other clinical features.<br \/>Results:152 patients were included; patients with progressive disease (PD; n=50) at 3 months were compared to all others (n=102). Overall disease volume correlated to tumor volume at the primary lesion (spearman rho=0.69), lymph node (rho=0.45), soft tissue (rho=0.23), lung metastases (rho=0.22), and pleura (rho=0.20); overall lesion counts correlated to lesion counts in lymph nodes (rho=0.61), lung metastases (rho=0.45), and bone (rho=0.16). On univariate analysis, overall tumor volume (P=2e-53) and lesion counts (P=2e-51) had the strongest association with PD, outperforming PD-L1 (P=0.02), ECOG performance status (PS, P=7e-16), and clinical variables including prior treatment and smoking status. PD correlated with higher disease burden in all individual organs except bone; adrenal metastases inversely correlated with PD. Volumetric features complemented PD-L1 and other clinical risk factors to predict PD; in a composite model (ClinVol) AUC=0.82, sensitivity=66%, specificity=93%, while PD-L1 alone yielded an AUC=0.62, sensitivity=94%, specificity=28%. Similar trends were observed for subgroup analyses stratified by brain metastasis status or smoking history, in which volumetric measures increased the power of PD-L1 to predict PD by a consistent AUC increase of ~0.2. Upon subgroup analysis stratified by PD-L1, volumetric models showed robust stratification of PD, with AUC of 0.97, 0.81, 0.81 respectively for PD-L1 &#60;1%, 1-49%, and &#8805;50%.<br \/>Conclusion: Higher baseline tumor burden was associated with increased likelihood of disease progression on combination ICI therapy. ClinVol modeling improves predictive accuracy of 3-month progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immune response,Immune checkpoint blockade,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Muhammad Aminu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Natalie  I.

The purpose of this study was to identify the most commonly needed eligibility criteria that are specified in cancer CT to investigate whether and how they could be found in clinical databases.<br \/>Design: We examined the data elements needed for the trial eligibility criteria that would be used in queries for all the Breast, Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, Head and Neck, and Cutaneous Cancer treatment trials open for enrollment across our health system. We then performed a sort-rank exercise for these eligibility criteria terms.<br \/>Results: The analysis included 33 trials and 12 data elements. Table 1 shows the number of times each eligibility criterion appeared in the 33 CTs and its feasibility for an EHR query. The data elements that appeared most frequently were Organ\/Cancer Site (100%), Tumor Morphology (66.7%), Presence of Metastases (51.5%), TN Staging (39.4%), and Days Since Diagnosis (24.2%). Of these, only Organ\/Cancer Site and Days Since Diagnosis were accessible as structured datapoints in our clinical databases.<br \/>Conclusions: The lack of feasibility for EHR query is likely due to the fact that healthcare information is generally stored in a discrete, structured form as a means of completing care transactions (drug orders or laboratory values) and ensuring billing compliance (ICD and outpatient CPT codes). This presents a critical challenge when data are required for CT enrollment, quality assurance metrics, and prospective and retrospective clinical research. Health systems&#8212;and by extension, their patients&#8212;would benefit from investing in structured data schemas involving AJCC staging, tumor morphology, and presence of metastases.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{1E737282-9150-4DD6-B6B5-09D8E086F1F1}\"><caption>Eligibility criteria with corresponding number of appearances in CTs and feasibility for EHR query<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Eligibility criterion<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Number of trials with each criterion<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Feasibility for EHR query<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Organ\/Cancer Site<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33 (100%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Accessible (ICD codes very detailed for site and used consistently for purpose of billing)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tumor Morphology<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22 (66.7%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not accessible (Code have not been created in ICD system, SNOMED is not widely adopted, not needed for billing)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Presence of Metastases<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17 (51.5%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not accessible (Not coded consistently, coded in ICD as a “secondary” malignancy but generally does not affect billing)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TN Staging<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (39.4%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not accessible (Not coded in ICD system)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Days Since Diagnosis<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8 (24.2%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Accessible (Structured data captured for purpose of initial transaction)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tumor Markers and Other Lab Results<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (12.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Accessible (Structured data captured by laboratory instrument for purpose of initial transaction)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Immunohistochemical Biomarkers<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (12.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not accessible (Pathologist assessment documented as narrative text)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">History of Systemic Therapy<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (9.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Accessible (NDC drug code captured with initial order in order to complete the initial transaction)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Feasibility of Resection<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (9.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not accessible (Surgeon assessment documented as narrative text)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Disease progression<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (9.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not accessible (Radiologist assessment documented as narrative text)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Surgical Procedure<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (6.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Accessible as CPT codes for outpatient surgeries as needed for billing.

A variety of novel therapeutic strategies are being explored to improve patient outcomes including the use of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) to deliver highly potent, cytotoxic payloads to tumors. Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2), also known as tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2), has emerged as an attractive target for ADCs. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is a novel ADC composed of a TROP2 antibody coupled to SN-38 and is being evaluated in NSCLC. High TROP2 mRNA expression is observed in many tumor types, however, TROP2 protein expression in NSCLC is not well-established. Here we characterized TROP2 expression across three independent datasets to explore the TROP2 relationship to baseline characteristics, molecular features of interest, and its prognostic value in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed three independent datasets: (1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) NSCLC adenocarcinoma (LUAD, N=660) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC, N=484) mRNA expression data, (2) a NSCLC adenocarcinoma FFPE tumor sample set (&#8220;Translational data set&#8221;; N=107), (3) an independent clinical NSCLC adenocarcinoma (N=103) and squamous cell carcinoma (N=37) data set. TROP2 IHC was performed on tumor sample sets (2) and (3) using the SP295 antibody (Robust Prototype Assay, Ventana) with H-Score and assessment of the percentage of membrane-positive tumor cells as readouts. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests (continuous variables), Kaplan-Meier method (survival probability curves) and log-rank test (time to event outcome) were used (GraphPad Prism 8.1.2 and R version 4.0.5).<br \/>Results: TROP2 mRNA was highly expressed in NSCLC and expression was similar in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the TCGA data set. TROP2 expression did not vary with patient&#8217;s age, gender, race or tumor stage. Furthermore, TROP2 expression was not associated with TP53, KRAS or driver mutation status (including EGFR, ALK, ROS, RET, MET). TROP2 expression in the Translational sample set was consistent with the findings from the TCGA data analysis: TROP2 mRNA and protein expression were high and independent of patient baseline demographics, tumor stage and TP53 and KRAS mutation status. Finally, in an independent clinical NSCLC dataset, TROP2 protein was highly expressed and there was no relationship between TROP2 and baseline demographics including gender and age. TROP2 membrane H-scores and percentage of membrane-positive tumor cells also highly correlated in the two independent datasets.<br \/>Conclusions: Three large independent datasets confirmed high expression of TROP2 in NSCLC both, as mRNA and protein. TROP2 expression in tumors did not differ between histological subtypes, baseline characteristics or clinically relevant driver alterations. Based on the TCGA data set, TROP2 expression was not prognostic for survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Biomarkers,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Peiwen Kuo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emon Elboudwarej<sup>1<\/sup>, Lauri Diehl<sup>1<\/sup>, Jilpa Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Sabeen Mekan<sup>2<\/sup>, Juliane M.

However, it is not clear which domains of balance or gait best reflect the impact of treatment-induced peripheral neuropathy on mobility or differentiate fall risk in cancer survivors. This study aimed to determine which domains of balance and gait differed between cancer survivors who reported 1) symptoms of peripheral neuropathy versus asymptomatic survivors and 2) falls in the previous six months versus non-fallers.<br \/>Methods: Both postural sway during 30 seconds of quiet stance and gait characteristics from the Instrumented Time-Up-and-Go test (ITUG) were recorded with six synchronous inertial sensors (Opals by APDM Wearable Technology, a Clario company). The sensors were placed on both shanks and wrists, and one on the lumbar spine and sternum in 425 female cancer survivors (age: 62 &#177; 6 years). A principal component analysis (PCA) approach was used first to identify independent domains of mobility from 14 balance and gait measures for subsequent analysis.<br \/>Results: PCA analysis revealed 5 independent domains (PC1: Sway amplitude, PC2: Gait pace; PC3: Sway frequency; PC4: Gait spatial-temporal and PC5: Turning) that accounted for 81% of the variance of performance across the participants. Cancer survivors who reported neuropathy showed a significantly higher sway frequency (PC3) than asymptomatic survivors. Cancer survivors who reported falls showed a significantly larger sway area (PC1) and slower gait pace (PC2) than non-fallers.<br \/>Conclusions: Wearable sensor instrumentation from short balance and gait tests capture objective digital gait and balance outcomes reflective of treatment-related neuropathy and fall risk in women treated with chemotherapy for cancer. Wearable sensors could be used for oncology clinical trials to assess the impact of cancer treatment and symptom mitigation strategies to limit changes in mobility that might lead to excess falls in people with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vrutangkumar Shah<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Muzyka<sup>1<\/sup>, Carolyn Guidarelli<sup>2<\/sup>, Kristen Sowalsky<sup>1<\/sup>, Kerri  M.

This study updated and validated a previous treatment-based algorithm that uses claims data to identify NSCLC vs small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Turner RM, et al. Front Pharmacol 2017;8:883).<br \/>Methods: This study used Optum&#8217;s de-identified Market Clarity Data (2007-2021) which deterministically links medical and pharmacy claims with electronic health record (EHR) data from providers across the continuum of care. Included patients had lung cancer diagnosis and histology information available in the EHR, which is the gold standard for validation. Patients were required to have &#8805;3 months of continuous health plan enrollment before and after the diagnosis date. First, to replicate the Turner algorithm, patients were identified between Jun 2014 and Oct 2015 with any first-line NSCLC treatment and no SCLC treatment (Step 1). Next, the Turner algorithm was applied from Nov 2015 to Dec 2020 to evaluate if performance decreased given the approval of immunotherapies since 2015 (Step 2). Finally, the Turner algorithm was updated with NSCLC treatments approved since 2015 in concordance with the latest US treatment guidelines. Algorithm performance at each step was measured using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).<br \/>Results: Sample sizes and performance statistics for each step are presented in the Table. From Step 1 to Step 2, specificity and PPV decreased while sensitivity and NPV increased. Algorithm performance improved slightly for all measures from Step 2 to Step 3.<br \/>Conclusions: This updated treatment-based algorithm improves validity and accuracy in identifying NSCLC patients in claims databases and supports its use in real-world research using claims databases when histology data is unavailable.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{9656CB6F-A74A-45DA-B9B8-4CC022B2C704}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Step 1: <\/b><b>Turner replication<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Step 2: <\/b><b>Turner 2015-2020<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Step 3: <\/b><b>Updated Turner <\/b><b>2015-2020<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Date range<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Jun 2014-Oct 2015<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Nov 2015-Dec 2020<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Nov 2015-Dec 2020<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sample size<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">406<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2573<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2744<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sensitivity<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.873<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.920<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.932<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Specificity<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.933<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.865<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.923<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PPV<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.987<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.976<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.988<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NPV<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.560<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.640<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.673<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Databases,Real-world data research,Claims database algorithm,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sandip Pravin Patel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rongrong Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Summera Qiheng Zhou<sup>3<\/sup>, Daniel Sheinson<sup>2<\/sup>, Ann Johnson<sup>2<\/sup>, Janet Lee<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of California, San Diego, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Genesis Research, Hoboken, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9be07e71-b248-4865-adb3-cadca436151a","ControlNumber":"1921","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Increased participation by surgical, medical and radiation oncologists was also documented for the MCCs (mean score: 3.9 vs 4.1; p &#60; .001, 3.4 vs 3.9; p &#60; .001, and 3.5 vs 3.6; p = 0.035 respectively) as well as increased frequency of consensus (85.9% to 95.5%; p = 0.001). No change in discussion time was seen. Pathologists\/radiologists surveyed reported greater ease of finding information they needed to prepare for the MCC (76.1% vs 96.7%; p = 0.048).<br \/>Conclusions: Using technology to organize and convey data at MCCs improves quality of information presented and discussed, clinician participation and the ability to reach a consensus.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{3A5BCB23-B5EB-4792-B4BD-0FF126E973D8}\"><caption>Table 1.

As there is no head-to-head randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) between Abi and Enza, predicting 1L comparative effectiveness of these two drugs for mCRPC, especially in patient groups under-represented in RCTs is critical. ML was performed on electronic health records (EHR) to evaluate risk factors of TTD in 1L mCRPC patients and identify predictive markers of patient subgroups with differential outcomes from enza vs. abi.<br \/>Methods: Patients with curated mCRPC diagnosis and 1L tx between Jan 2012-May 2022 were identified in a ConcertAI&#174; oncology EHR database. For dynamic prediction of TTD, survival XGBoost models were built with four different timepoints as index: 1L start, and 30, 60, and 90 days from 1L start. A 60:20:20 split was used for train, validation, and test sets. TTD was defined as either tx end or death. Risk factors and interaction terms were identified using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and marginal hazard ratios.<br \/>Results: The sample size ranged between 1580-1636 patients (Table 1). Holdout testset cumulative dynamic AUROC for the models ranged between 0.65-0.75. PSA rise from 1L start, elevated PSA, liver enzymes, and platelets to lymphocytes ratio, low hemoglobin and albumin, prior NAT tx, intake of pain medications, lower BMI, and high comorbidity were risk factors for TTD across all models. Tx with enza or abi was predictive of lower risk of TTD. While enza was better than abi in the overall population, SHAP interaction terms revealed that enza had worse TTD than abi in patients with higher ALP and NATs did not have any TTD benefit over chemo for patients with lower HGB.<br \/>Conclusions: ML on RWD identified prognostic markers for 1L mCRPC tx discontinuation and predictive markers of patient subpopulations with different outcomes from enza vs. abi.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{A8751D54-161F-483F-91DD-A293773265EE}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\"><b>Table 1: Summary of TTD Models: Cohort characteristics, model performance, risk factors: Mean HR (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">Index of models<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>1L Tx-start <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>1L Tx start + 30 days <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>1L Tx start + 60 days<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>1L Tx start + 90 days<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N patients (event prevalence)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1636 (89 %)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1611 (89.8%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1585 (91.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1570 (92.2)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Model performance: hold-out CD-AUC (mean &#177;

So gynecologic oncologists often have to consider several factors when choosing next chemotherapy regimen. Therefore, this study aimed to find serial chemotherapy regimen choice to anticipate patients&#8217; better prognosis.<br \/>Materials and Methods: We reviewed 656 patients diagnosed ovary cancer in one tertiary institutional hospital between 2006 and 2020. Patents&#8217; clinic-pathologic characteristics, primary treatment, chemotherapy regimens, survival outcomes were collected. We divided patients into several groups according to their chemotherapy regimen by mechanism of action and compared them. 1<sup>st<\/sup> line chemotherapy(CTx) type 1: carboplatin-paclitaxel, carboplatin-docetaxol, cisplatin-paclitaxel, cisplatin-docetaxol2<sup>nd<\/sup> line CTx type 1 : carboplatin-paclitaxel, carboplatin-docetaxol, cisplatin-paclitaxel, cisplatin-docetaxol2<sup>nd<\/sup> line CTx type 4 : carboplatin-gemcitabine2<sup>nd<\/sup> maintenance CTx type 2 : PARP inhibitor(PARPi)2<sup>nd<\/sup> line CTx Type 5: Platinum + topoisomerase inhibitor 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line CTx Type 6(cisplatin-vinorelbine)2<sup>nd<\/sup> line CTx Type 8(topoisomerase inhibitor only) 2<sup>nd <\/sup>line CTx Type12 (single taxol) The survival rate of ovary cancer patients decreased from stage 1 to stage 4.Among 1<sup>st<\/sup> line CTx type 1 and 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line CTx type(1 or 4) patients, those who used PARPi in 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line maintenance CTx(n=14) had a higher death rate than those who did not receive maintenance CTx or received that other than PARPi(hazard ratio 1.44). In the 1<sup>st<\/sup> line CTx 1~4 group, we divided patients according to 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line CTx type. We compare 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line CTx type 5 group(n=30) with type 6+8+12 group(n=26).

This approval was a result of studies which demonstrated improved recurrence free survival. However, overall survival (OS) benefit has yet to be observed. We examine the OS of postoperative immunotherapy in stage 3 melanoma using real world data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB).<br \/>Methods: Data was collected from the 2020 NCDB Participant Use File (October 2022 release). Patients were staged by both the 7<sup>th<\/sup> and 8<sup>th<\/sup> version of American Joint Committee on Cancers (AJCC). Those who underwent definitive surgery since 2016 and had sufficient pathologic data for staging were included. Patients who received systemic therapy prior to surgery were excluded. Patients were then sorted by the type of postoperative therapy started within 12 weeks from definitive surgery and classified into the no post-operative systemic therapy (NP) or postoperative immunotherapy (PI) groups. Survival time was calculated from the time of definitive surgery to last contact or death. OS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank method.<br \/>Results: 18,167 patients underwent surgery for stage 3 disease between 2016-2020. By AJCC v8 staging, 4,256 had Stage 3A disease, 3,752 stage 3B disease, 9,251 stage 3C disease, and 908 stage 3D disease. Median OS was not met in any stage 3 PI groups. The 36 - month landmark survival of all stage 3 subgroups is shown in Table 1. Only 13.3% of patient received PI in 2016. PI use increased to 24.8% in 2017, 43.8% in 2018, 46.8% in 2019, and 50.8% in 2020.<br \/>Discussion: Using a large real-world database, we found that patients receiving post-operative immunotherapy in the checkpoint era have a significant survival benefit compared to those who did not. The benefit was significant in stage IIIB-C in AJCC v7 and Stage IIIC-D in AJCC v8. However, the benefit was not significant in stage 3A melanoma.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{96D97184-3942-4842-A41C-93201C02A257}\"><caption>Table 1: 36-month

In 2017, metastatic MCC treatment options expanded when the FDA approved immune checkpoint inhibitors based on single-arm uncontrolled studies. We utilized data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to examine the survival benefit of first line immunotherapy (IO) or chemotherapy (CT) in metastatic MCC.<br \/>Methods: The NCDB was analyzed to identify patients with metastatic MCC from 2017-2020. Patients who did not have data available on AJCC version 8 staging group, survival status, and treatment details (surgery, radiation therapy, CT, IO) were excluded from the analysis. Patients were divided into cohorts based on first line systemic therapy; those who received chemotherapy and those who received immunotherapy. Survival time was calculated from the time of initiation of systemic treatment to last contact or death. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-ranked method.<br \/>Results: We identified 648 patients with stage IV MCC between 2017-2020. Of those, 15.3% (n=99) received CT, 51.7% (n=335) received IO, and 32.9% (n=213) did not receive systemic therapy. Median OS was 13.2 (95% CI: 10.1-16.2) months for those receiving any systemic therapy. Median OS was 13.8 (95% CI: 7.9-19.7) months for CT and 12.9 (95% CI: 9.6-16.2) months for immunotherapy (p=0.379).

We sought to delineate the impact of non-liver metastatic sites on the response to these combinations.<br \/>Methods: We performed a single center retrospective analysis of MSS mCRC receiving REGONIVO or RIN. To isolate the impact of immunotherapy on metastatic disease sites, we performed a 2-month (mo) analysis of organ specific response using organ specific RECIST assessment.<br \/>Results: 96 patients (Pts) (39 RIN and 57 REGONIVO) were evaluated. Overall response rate (ORR), median progression free survival (PFS), and median overall survival (OS) were 0%, 2 mo, and 7 mo in pts with liver metastatic (LM) disease (n = 33). We focused on the impact of other metastatic disease site on OS and PFS within the non-LM group to exclude liver as a confounding variable (n=63). Pts with lung-only mCRC had the best prognosis with an ORR, median PFS, and median OS of 56%, 13 mo, and unreached at 24 mo. Pts with peritoneal mCRC fared poorly (ORR 0%, median PFS= 1.5 mo, median OS =12 mo). A high ORR (75%) was noted in a small cohort of 4 pts with lymph node only disease. However, concurrent LN with lung only mCRC diminished efficacy outcomes. Differences in PFS and OS by organ involvement were independent of treatment (REGONIVO or RIN) based on estimates from Cox proportional hazard model. 2-mo response rates by metastatic sites are shown in Table 1. Responses at the 2-mo mark in the 96 pt cohort occurred in lung, LN, and soft tissue metastases but were most robust in lung only metastatic disease.<br \/>Conclusions: Responses to the combination REGONIVO or RIN are most robust in lung-only metastatic disease and appear to be modest in the setting of LN and soft tissue involvement. Liver and peritoneal disease was associated with lack of benefit from these combinations.<br \/>Table 1 2-month Response Rates by Site of Metastatic Disease<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"

Analysis of the TCGA-HNSCC dataset indicates that MYC amplification is estimated to be present in ~12% of HNSCC cases, and has a significant impact on patients&#8217; median survival (32.2 vs 56.9 months for patients with wild-type MYC). While the association between MYC amplification and HNSCC progression was previously reported, its role in regulating mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapy remain under investigated. In this study, we seek to further characterize the clinicopathological features associated with MYC amplified HNSCC, and highlight the molecular changes that may contribute to acquired resistance to treatment.<br \/>Seven HNSCC patients with MYC amplification were identified by searching the Oncoplus database at the University of Chicago. A retrospective chart review was conducted to collect demographic and clinical data for each patient, and mutational landscape was characterized. In a single patient, MYC amplification was acquired following treatment with chemoimmunotherapy (nivolumab, carboplatin, paclitaxel), chemoradiation, and maintenance nivolumab resulting in rapidly progressive disease despite an initial response to therapy. RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining was performed to compare specimens collected before and after progression.<br \/>Seven patients were diagnosed with HNSCC and were found to have MYC amplification on molecular testing of their cancer between 2018 and 2021. Four were male, median age 61 (range 46-71), stage T2-4 (n=6), N2-3 (n=6), p16+ (n=2). All patients (n=7) developed recurrent and\/or metastatic disease following primary therapy with locoregional recurrence (n=3), metastatic recurrence (n=2), or both (n=2). Median survival for the cohort was 3.1 years. Previous therapy included surgery (n=4), radiotherapy (n=7), chemotherapy (n=7), targeted therapy (n=4), and immunotherapy (n=4). The most common mutations co-occurring with MYC amplification were CDKN2A loss (n=5), TP53 loss (n=5), CCND1 amplification (n=2) and KDM6A loss (n=2). Acquisition of MYC amplification and acquired resistance to chemoimmunotherapy was associated with upregulation of glycolysis pathway, WNT\/beta-catenin signaling, and significant changes to tumor microenvironment (TME) such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes repertoire and PD1\/PD-L1 expression levels.<br \/>Alongside the data from TCGA, the cases described in this study highlight the poor prognosis associated with MYC amplified HNSCC. While loss of function mutations in CDKN2A and TP53, upregulation of glycolysis pathway, and TME reprogramming may contribute to treatment resistance and secondary immune evasion, further studies in larger cohorts are warranted to develop therapies that target MYC mediated mechanisms of resistance in HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Head and neck cancers,Myc,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thomas Cyberski<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alka Singh<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Lingen<sup>3<\/sup>, Alexander Pearson<sup>2<\/sup>, Nishant Agrawal<sup>4<\/sup>, Evgeny Izumchenko<sup>2<\/sup>, Ari Rosenberg<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>Medicine, Section Hematology\/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>4<\/sup>Surgery, Section Otolaryngology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"01878a73-9be6-451e-bd79-d42593db38c6","ControlNumber":"6665","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

It is an aggressive disease with an overall poor prognosis. However, the disease presents a diverse spectrum of survival outcomes. We conducted this study to develop a provisional MEITL prognostic score (MPS) for this rare disease.<br \/>Methods: We used our updated MEITL database, which contains retrospective data on 218 cases. Such data included demographics such as sex, age, and race. It also included disease presentation symptoms, duration of symptoms before diagnosis, site(s) of the disease, stage, blood counts, disease immune and molecular phenotype, types of treatment, quality of response, and survival outcomes. Out of the 218 cases, only 140 cases had complete survival and outcomes data, the sample chosen for this study. Cox proportional-hazards model and Log-rank tests were used to assess the influence of clinicopathologic factors on overall survival (OS). Due to the relatively small training cohort, we included factors that statistically impacted OS as well as factors that numerically trended that way.<br \/>Results: The median OS of the cohort was 11 months. The following dichotomous variables were identified as impactful prognostic factors in this cohort: Bone marrow involvement (9 vs. 14 months), Non-biclonal TCR status (10 vs. 17.5 months), CD56+ (10 vs. 26 months), Ki67<u>&#62;<\/u>70% (4 vs. 8 months), cMyc expression &#62;15% (7 vs. 12 months). A prognostic model was devised using these variables to identify different levels of risk. Each variable was assigned a score of 1 when present, except for cMyc, which was assigned 2 points for having the highest hazard ratio among all the variables. In this exploratory cohort, low risk was assigned a score of 0, intermediate risk a score of 1-2, and high risk a score of 3-6. This prognostic score system led to our cohort's most optimal risk discriminatory model, where low, intermediate, and high risk had a median OS of 26, 12, and 4 months, respectively (p=0.002).<br \/>Conclusion: This MPS is a promising new tool for risk-stratifying patients with MEITL.

The disease encompasses a vast phenotype ranging from the smoldering and chronic indolent subtypes to the lymphoma and acute aggressive subtypes. Aggressive ATLL which comprise acute\/leukemic, lymphoma, and other indolent subtypes with aggressive transformation tend to have poor outcome with conventional chemotherapy rarely achieving durable lasting remission. We conducted this pooled database analysis to identify key factors that affect the clinical outcomes of aggressive ATLL subtypes.<br \/>Methods: To study the demographic characteristics, molecular and immunohistochemical signatures, therapeutic interventions, survival, and prognostic factors, we compiled a pooled database of 462 ATLL cases. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed. Cox proportional hazards model and Log-rank tests were used to assess the influence of demographic and clinicopathologic factors on the overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: Three hundred and forty-seven aggressive ATLL patients with survival data were included in this analysis. The median OS of the whole group was 14 months, with a median OS of 12.8, 16, and 12 months for acute, lymphoma, and transformed subtypes. The median age was 54 years, with a M:F ratio of 1.1. SCT demonstrated superior OS compared to chemotherapy (28 vs. 10 months, p&#60;0.0001). Similarly, LSG15 regimens were superior to no chemotherapy and other combinations (29 vs. 1 vs. 15 months, p&#60;0.0001). Asians and Afro-Caribbeans lived longer than Whites, Indians, and Hispanics (15.7, 15, 10, 3, 1 months, p&#60;0.0001, respectively).

It accounts for approximately 1-2% of non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma and 15-20% of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. AITL has unique clinical features with an aggressive course and poor prognosis. Therefore, it is essential to uncover the clinically significant prognostic factors to chart an optimal treatment strategy for AITL. Currently, AITL prognostic factors are not well established. Several retrospective AITL series with limited numbers reported varying prognostic factors and occasionally discordant results. Consequently, such studies lacked the power to validate factors that influence long-term clinical outcomes. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the pooled impact of selected clinicopathologic factors on progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with AITL.<br \/>Methods: A review of the medical literature was conducted using online databases. Inclusion criteria comprised AITL diagnosis, English language, and studies reporting factors impacting PFS and OS with hazard ratios (HR). A meta-analysis was conducted using an inverse variance method. The pooled value for the estimate, with 95% CI, was calculated using the Fixed effects model and the Random effects model.<br \/>Results: Eight retrospective series with 944 patients were included and analyzed. Factors that impacted both PFS and OS included: Bone marrow involvement (HR 1.51, 95%CI:1.01-2.25; HR 1.58, 95%CI:1.02-2.44), mediastinal involvement (HR 1.44, 95%CI:1.10-1.88; HR 1.48, 95%CI:1.09-2.02), B-symptoms (HR 1.40, 95%CI:1.14-1.71; HR 1.55, 95%CI:1.22-1.96), stage &#62;II (HR 1.50, 95%CI:1.05-2.13; HR 1.74, 95%CI:1.15-2.61), ECOG <u>&#62;<\/u>2 (HR 1.74, 95%CI:1.42-2.13; HR 2.39, 95%CI:1.65-3.44), &#8593;LDH (HR 1.47, 95%CI:1.12-1.94; HR 1.39, 95%CI:1.01-1.91), Albumin&#60;3.5g\/dl (HR 1.43, 95%CI:1.10-1.85; HR 1.57, 95%CI:1.01-2.45), sIL2R &#62;530U\/ml (HR 1.72, 95%CI:1.12-2.65; HR 1.90, 95%CI:1.29-2.80), and extra-nodal involvement &#62;1 site (HR 1.92, 95%CI:1.53-2.41; HR 2.01, 95%CI:1.48-2.72). Factors that impacted OS only are: effusion (HR 2.60, 95%CI:1.32-5.14), leukocytosis (HR 1.11, 95%CI:1.02-1.22), and PIT &#62;1 (HR 1.83, 95%CI:1.22-2.73). Factors that impacted PFS only are: Age (HR 1.37, 95%CI:1.18-1.59), Anemia (HR 1.63, 95%CI:1.34-1.97), and &#8593;&#946;2-microglobulin (HR 1.73, 95%CI:1.19-2.52). However, sex, thrombocytopenia, &#8595;total protein, &#8593;IgG, &#8593;IgA, &#8593;IgM, &#8593;CRP, and IPI &#62;2 did not significantly impact PFS or OS.<br \/>Conclusions: This is the first meta-analysis to explore the impact of clinicopathologic factors on AITL PFS and OS. It delineates factors that impact PFS and OS and those that do not influence either.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,T cell,Overall survival,Prognostic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Philip A.

It often occurs in the context of untreated or long-standing Celiac disease (CD) or the development of refractory sprue. EATL tends to be less responsive to conventional chemotherapy, often with poor clinical outcomes. We conducted this analysis to explore the clinicopathologic determinants of survival in this rare extranodal T-cell entity.<br \/>Methods: To study the demographic characteristics, molecular and immunohistochemical signatures, therapeutic interventions, survival, and prognostic factors, we compiled a pooled database of 220 cases. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed. Cox proportional-hazards model and Log-rank tests were used to assess the influence of demographic and clinicopathologic factors on overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: A total of 220 patients with confirmed EATL were identified. The median age was 60, with a peak incidence between 64 and 75. There was a slight female predominance with F:M ratio of 1.1. The jejunum was the most involved site (47%). The median OS of the whole group was 10 months. The most common presentations were abdominal pain, followed by perforation, diarrhea, obstruction, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The majority presented at stage I&#38;II (53%). The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 2 months. Younger patients (p=0.02) and HLH (p=0.006) had worse OS. The time interval between diagnosing CD and EATL impacted OS, with &#60;1 yr and &#62;20yrs having worse outcomes (p=0.04). Combination chemotherapy and stem cell transplant (SCT) were statistically superior to no treatment, with a median OS of 11, 22, and 0.75 months respectively (p=0.002). Further analysis revealed that surgical resection imparted a survival advantage in combination with chemotherapy and SCT. When surgical resection was incorporated into the analysis, median OS amounted to 0.75, 9, 16, 8, 69 months for surgery alone, chemotherapy, surgery+chemotherapy, SCT, and surgery+SCT, respectively (p=0.003). Combinations that used anthracyclines (p=0.02) and etoposide (p=0.05) had better OS. The quality of response to treatment also seemed to impact the outcome (p=0.0001) with median OS of 9, 9, and 69 months for &#60;PR, PR, and CR, respectively. OS was not impacted by stage, constitutional symptoms, presentation with obstruction or perforation, or CD30+. While male sex, colon and visceral involvement, and null TCR type seemed to impact OS negatively, they did not reach statistical significance.<br \/>Conclusions: This study presents updated clinicopathologic data from a pooled cohort of patients with EATL. It identifies age, CD duration, HLH, treatment modalities, and quality of response as major determinants of OS in this rare disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,T cell,Overall survival,Prognostic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Philip A.
