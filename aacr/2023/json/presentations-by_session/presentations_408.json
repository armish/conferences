[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Protein Kinase CK2 level and activity are high in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) stem cells. Genetic inhibition of CK2 promotes apoptosis and shows synergistic cytotoxic activity with cytotoxic therapy. Here we report the anti-leukemia efficacy of a novel and potent small molecule inhibitor of CK2, BMS-135, in AML mouse models.<br \/>Methods: AML cell lines (n=8) and primary AML cells (n=3) representing various AML genetic subtypes (MLL rearranged, FLT3-ITD, TP53 mutation) were tested in vitro. Cells were treated with serial dilution of BMS-135 for 24 to 48hrs, and cell viability was measured using calorimetric cell viability (WST) assay. Similarly, treated cells were analyzed for cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and colony formation. We measured the mRNA and protein levels of known CK2 targets. RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis was done to evaluate gene expression changes following treatment with BMS-135. Cell line-derived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft of AML were treated with BMS-135 at a dose of 7.5mg\/kg oral gavage twice daily for 21 days or vehicle.<br \/>Results: Combined <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments establish the efficacy of BMS-135. Cytotoxicity at inhibitory concentrations of 30-800nM, G0-G1 cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and poor colony formation following treatment were noted consistently in all cells. Single-drug treatment with BMS-135 achieved 50-80% leukemia inhibition and significantly prolonged survival in treated mice after 3 weeks of therapy. Following in vivo treatment with BMS-135, we confirmed the inhibition of known CK2 targets (AKT, PI3K, Bcl-xL) in the bone marrow and spleen AML cells. No significant myelosuppression or organ toxicity was noted in tumor-bearing mice following 3 weeks of treatment when compared to vehicle-treated mice. BMS-135 shows synergistic cytotoxic activity with daunorubicin and cytarabine.<br \/>Conclusions: Selective inhibitor of CK2 is well tolerated and shows superior in vivo efficacy and target inhibition in a series of AML cells and xenografts. BMS-135 works synergistically with cytotoxic agents like daunorubicin and cytarabine. These results support further pre-clinical characterization and clinical development of BMS-135 for treating AML in combination with cytotoxic therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,CK2,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Koby Duke<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Katherine Mercer<sup>2<\/sup>, Rajesh Rajaiah<sup>1<\/sup>, Muhammad Daniyal<sup>1<\/sup>, Yi Qiu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashok Purandare<sup>3<\/sup>, Yasin Uzun<sup>1<\/sup>, Lijun Zhang<sup>4<\/sup>, Morgann Klink<sup>4<\/sup>, Chandrika Gowda<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pediatrics, Penn State Hershey - College of Medicine, Hershey, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Penn State Health Milton S.

The common mutations, ex19del (D) and L858R (L) substitution, are sensitive to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. However, acquired on-target resistance, especially T790M (T) mutation, comprises the anti-tumor effects of these inhibitors. Though the third-generation EGFR-TKI Osimertinib potently inhibits both EGFR common mutations and T790M mutation, 10-24% of patients acquire C797S (C) resistant mutation. Here, we report a highly potent and selective fourth-generation EGFR-TKI, PH009-1, designed to overcome both EGFR common mutations and T790M\/C797S-mediated resistance in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Kinase selectivity of Ph009-1 was assessed by KINOMEscan against 468 human kinases. A functional safety panel including 47 targets contributing to clinical adverse drug reactions was used to evaluate pharmacological profiling of PH009-1. Biochemical enzyme activities were detected with kinase assays and anti-proliferative activities were measured in various tumor and engineered Ba\/F3 cell lines. The <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy was tested in four cell derived xenograft (CDX) mouse cancer models with tumor harboring single, double or triple mutant EGFR. The <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>pharmacokinetic (microsome metabolic stability, hepatocyte metabolic stability, plasma protein binding, drug-drug interaction, oral absorption, et al) and safety properties (hERG potassium channel assay, Ames assay, repeated dosing study, et al) of PH009-1 were assessed in various species with corresponding assay methods.<br \/>Results: High kinase selectivity and very low off-target effects were observed in KINOMEscan and safety panel assays, respectively. PH009-1 inhibited kinase activity of all tested EGFR mutants with IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#60;4 nM. Furthermore, PH009-1 displayed potent anti-proliferation activity against Ba\/F3 (EGFR L, D, LC, DC, DT, LTC, DTC) with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 3.6, 3.1, 1.6, 1.7, 0.3, 3.9, 3.1 nM, respectively. Excellent selectivity of PH009-1 was observed when compared the above values to IC<sub>50<\/sub> against Ba\/F3 (WT, 93.3 nM), A431 (WT, 2415 nM), LoVo (WT, 3700 nM) and NCI-H23 (WT, 2359 nM). In all four CDX cancer models including HCC827 (D), Ba\/F3 (DC), Ba\/F3 (LC) and Ba\/F3 (DTC), PH009-1 at a dose of 40 mg\/kg BID induced tumor regression or eradication without significant effect on mouse body weight. Favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles were suggested in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations.<br \/>Conclusion: The present data suggest that PH009-1 is a promising and highly selective fourth-generation EGFR TKI with potent <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> activity against single, double and triple EGFR mutations including T790M and C797S.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Drug resistance,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Feng Gao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bin Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, YongYong Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Liandong Jing<sup>1<\/sup>, Pengzhi Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuai Yuan<sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhizhong Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaofan Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yongqi Guo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Puhe Biopharma, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Shiyu Children Foundation, Beijing, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5d5db2a0-e273-4b00-86c3-382601e66af6","ControlNumber":"2390","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Approximately 20% of patients with advanced NSCLC harbor an EGFR mutation. Osimertinib is a 3<sup>rd<\/sup>-generation oral EGFR-TKI targeting the EGFR sensitizing mutations Del19 and L858R, as well as an acquired mutation, T790M. Despite osimertinib's efficacy in NSCLC, resistance develops and the mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib are complex. Development of another mutation, C797S is the most common mechanism of acquired resistance following osimertinib treatment. This mutation occurs with about 12% frequency after a 1L therapy of osimertinib, and with approximately 17% frequency after a 2L therapy. Here, we report TRX-221 as a novel 4<sup>th<\/sup>-generation EGFR-TKI that can overcome C797S-mediated acquired resistance in NSCLC models in vitro and in vivo. TRX-221 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against multiple EGFR mutant kinases, including Del19\/T790M\/C797S, L858R\/T790M\/C797S, Del19\/C797S, L858R\/C797S, Del19\/T790M, L858R\/T790M, Del19, and L858R. Likewise, TRX-221 potently inhibited the proliferation of Ba\/F3 cells stably overexpressing these eight EGFR mutants. TRX-221 however showed sparing activity against EGFR wild-type kinase and cell lines. TRX-221 also demonstrated marked anti-proliferative activity against osimertinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cell lines (PDCs). With favorable DMPK profiles, once-daily oral dosing of TRX-221 induced strong anti-tumor effects in a dose-dependent manner in a variety of osimertinib-resistant CDX and PDX models. As a reversible, selective, and broad-spectrum 4th-generation EGFR-TKI, TRX-221 is currently undergoing IND-enabling studies and shows strong potential as a therapeutic solution to treat advanced NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,4th Generation EGFR-TKI,Osimertinib resistance C797S,Broad Spectrum,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sumin Lim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Seulgi Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Ju-Kyung Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Eunhyun Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Sungwon Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Kwangwoo Chun<sup>1<\/sup>, Myoungki Baek<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiyeon Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Jihyun Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Areum Kang<sup>1<\/sup>, Younghoon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Namkyoung Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Byoungchul Cho<sup>3<\/sup>, Taebo Sim<sup>2<\/sup>, Koo Lee<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Therapex Co., Ltd, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Sevrance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Medical Oncology, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f88b01ce-daec-4044-a765-55cb0317e2cb","ControlNumber":"1547","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Here we investigated the efficacy of Vepa in comparison to other RET-selective inhibitors in preclinical models of pediatric sarcomas harboring <i>RET<\/i> fusions.<br \/>Methods: Multiple preclinical models of <i>SPECC1L::RET<\/i>-driven sarcomas were established: 1) Paired patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line models from a brain metastasis (BM) of an IFS tumor (SR-Sarc-0001); 2) A human mesenchymal stem cell line with RET fusion introduced with CRISPR-Cas9 (HMSC-RET); 3) A murine BM model produced by injection of luciferase-expressing HMSC-RET into the cerebellum. CNS penetration of Vepa was assessed by pharmacokinetic profiling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma in freely-moving male Han Wistar rats after oral administration of 3, 10, or 50 mg\/kg single doses.<br \/>Results: Exposure of SR-Sarc-0001 and HMSC-RET cells to Vepa resulted in dose- and time-dependent decreases in phosphorylation of RET, ERK1\/2, AKT, STAT3 and S6, expression changes in cell cycle regulators (p27 up, cyclin D1 down), induction of pro-apoptosis proteins (c-PARP, BIM), and loss of MYC expression. Growth of SR-Sarc-0001 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 0.09 &#181;M, 95% CI: 0.03-0.2) and HMSC-RET cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 0.2 &#181;M, 95% CI: 0.09-0.5), but not parental HMSC cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 1 &#181;M), was suppressed by Vepa, with concomitant elevation of caspase 3\/7 activity. Vepa was more effective than vandetanib and similar to the FDA-approved RET inhibitors, selpercatinib (Selp) and pralsetinib (Pral), in all <i>in vitro<\/i> assays. Significant regression of SR-Sarc-0001 PDX tumors was seen after Vepa treatment (64.8 &#177; 0.5%). Notably, no regrowth was observed up to 46 days after cessation of Vepa treatment, whereas 25 days after stopping Selp (10 mg\/kg BID) and Pral (15 mg\/kg BID) treatment, 1\/5 and 3\/5 tumors started to regrow, respectively. Similar efficacy was observed in the HMSC-RET xenograft model. Vepa was more effective than Selp at blocking HMSC-RET brain xenograft tumor growth (p=0.001) and increasing survival (p=0.0001). CNS penetration of Vepa was excellent, with near-equivalent concentrations detected in the PFC, CSF, and plasma-free fraction after equilibration between body fluid compartments.<br \/>Conclusions: Our preclinical results suggest that vepafestinib has the potential to more effectively manage CNS metastasis compared to selpercatinib, representing a promising new therapeutic option for patients with RET-driven sarcomas.

Brain metastasis is more common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer than in other cancers. Genetic alterations in <i>ERBB<\/i> family genes are frequently observed in those cancers, with about half of <i>HER2\/EGFR<\/i> aberrations metastasizing in the brain. <i>EGFR<\/i> aberrations have been also observed in glioblastoma. Several pan-ERBB inhibitors are clinically available or under clinical development, such as afatinib, neratinib, and poziotinib. However, none are highly brain-penetrable as they are pumped out via the BBB. Here, we report TAS2940 as a novel potent pan-ERBB inhibitor that elicits brain penetrability and anti-tumor effects in brain metastasis models.<br \/>Methods: The kinase selectivity of TAS2940 was evaluated in a panel of 257 kinases. Autophosphorylation of wild-type and mutant ERBB in stably expressing cell lines was evaluated using a quantitative immunofluorescence assay. The growth inhibitory effect on cell lines expressing HER2\/EGFR aberrations was evaluated based on quantitation of the cellular ATP concentration. Cell lines were transplanted subcutaneously or intracranially in BALB\/cAJcl-nu\/nu mice. HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including TAS2940, were then orally administered once daily followed by evaluation of tumor volume and body weight.<br \/>Results: TAS2940 showed potent and selective inhibition against ERBB family proteins over more than 250 kinases on enzymatic assay. TAS2940 also showed preferential cytotoxicity in cells harboring <i>HER2\/EGFR<\/i> genetic alterations <i>in vitro<\/i>, while sparing cells without <i>ERBB<\/i> genetic aberrations. TAS2940 showed potent anti-proliferative activity in cells containing <i>HER2<\/i> genetic alterations or <i>EGFR<\/i> exon 20 insertions, commonly found in NSCLC or breast cancer, as well as EGFRvIII alterations, frequently observed in glioblastoma. <i>In vivo<\/i> xenograft tumor models with various <i>EGFR<\/i> genetic alterations showed that TAS2940 exerted anti-tumor effects, such as growth retardation or regression. We further examined brain penetration by assessing the brain to blood concentration of TAS2940 in mice with intact BBBs, showing higher brain penetrability compared to other ERBB inhibitors.

Even though multiple FLT3 inhibitors are in various stages of clinical evaluation, resistance to FLT3 inhibitors resulting from acquired point mutations in tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) have limited the sustained efficacy of treatments. Among them, a &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; mutation (F691L) is resistant to most available FLT3 inhibitors. Here, we show the efficacy and mechanism of PLM-102, developed an orally available and highly selective small molecule, in overcoming drug-resistant FLT3-ITD-TKD mutations as a strong candidate of the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation of FLT3 inhibitor.<br \/>PLM-102 displays extraordinary potency of enzyme inhibitory activities of all FLT3 WT\/mutants including F691L with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of &#60;1 nM. In FLT3-ITD-positive cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-13, MOLM-14, Ba\/F3-ITD-D835Y, Ba\/F3-ITD-F691L), PLM-102 shows about 18~25-fold higher anti-proliferative activities than Gilteritinib. Also, PLM-102 potently inhibited the phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream signaling pathways, and induced apoptosis as evidenced by PARP-cleavage and caspase-3 activation.<br \/>Moreover, in AML-related xenograft mouse models (MV4-11, MOLM-14, Ba\/F3-ITD-D835Y, Ba\/F3-ITD-F691L), once-daily oral dose of PLM-102 significantly suppressed the tumor growth and achieved complete tumor regression. In addition, the outstanding efficacy of our compound has been confirmed in large tumor xenograft models. These results are very encouraging because large tumors have a limited blood supply and high interstitial fluid pressure, leading to a poor absorption of anticancer drugs. Pharmacokinetics of PLM-102 displayed higher bone-marrow exposure indicating better target engagement and benefits in the clinical translation in AML.<br \/>In conclusion, PLM-102 is a promising therapeutic candidate for the FLT3-ITD-mutated AML as well as the acquired resistance to current FLT3 inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"FLT3,Acute myeloid leukemia,FLT3 gate keeper mutation (F691L),3rd generation inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jin-Hee Park<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Jae-Seon Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Su-jin Oh<sup>1<\/sup>, So-Deok Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Yong June Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Keon Wook Kang<sup>2<\/sup>, Miran Moon<sup>1<\/sup>, Soo Yeon Jang<sup>1<\/sup>, Myung Jin Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Yong-Chul Kim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>PeLeMed, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"52e4d553-fe97-481a-b4f7-7b76e9fae74e","ControlNumber":"1710","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Furthermore, the approvals for VEGFR-targeting receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs), cabozantinib in second-line, and tivozanib in third-line RCC patients were based on modest objective response rates and median progression-free survival. There is an urgent need for novel mechanisms that target adaptive tumor responses that drive resistance to these agents, as well as combination drug partners that improve outcomes for patients.<br \/>As part of their mechanism, VEGFR-TKIs induce oxygen- and nutrient-deprivation that drives ER stress. Tumors can evade deleterious ER stress by activating PERK branch of the integrated stress response, which arrests global translation and restores homeostasis. We hypothesized that inhibiting PERK would enhance the anti-tumor activity of VEGFR-TKIs <i>in vivo<\/i> and tested this using HC-5404, a potent and selective PERK inhibitor currently in Ph1 clinical testing (NCT04834778). Here, we present preclinical evidence that supports combining HC-5404 with VEGFR-TKIs in ccRCC. We demonstrate that axitinib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, and sunitinib all activate PERK in 786-O ccRCC xenografts in a dose-responsive manner. The addition of HC-5404 significantly enhanced the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of VEGFR-TKIs across multiple ccRCC tumor models, resulting in tumor stasis or regression in combination groups. Expression profiling and IHC analysis of tumor sections revealed that HC-5404 enhanced the anti-angiogenic effects of axitinib and lenvatinib in 786-O tumors, highlighting the protective role of PERK in response to anti-angiogenics.<br \/>To evaluate whether the combination treatments could benefit a diverse patient population, sensitivity to HC-5404 and axitinib was evaluated across a panel of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. This experiment confirmed widespread responsiveness to the combination treatment that in some cases achieved <u>&#62;<\/u>50% tumor regression. As tumor progression on VEGFR-TKIs limits the success of these agents in the clinic, we evaluated the effect of adding HC-5404 to tumors that have previously progressed on axitinib. In this study, 786-O xenografts were treated with axitinib for 2-weeks and non-responders were rerandomized into groups of either single agent or combination of HC-5404 and axitinib. The combination treatment significantly improved TGI relative to either monotherapy, resulting in tumor regression of ~20%. Taken together, these findings highlight that by disrupting an adaptive stress response evoked by VEGFR-TKIs, HC-5404 presents a clinical opportunity to enhance the anti-tumor effects of well-established standard of care therapies in ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,PERK,Antiangiogenic agents,Endoplasmic reticulum stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael  E.

We previously reported that ESK981, a phase I-cleared multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (MTKI), exhibited tumor growth inhibitory abilities in multiple preclinical castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and androgen-negative models by blocking the PIKfyve activity and disrupting autophagy. The results suggested that AR-negative prostate cancer have better response to ESK981 induced tumor inhibition than AR+ prostate cancer (Qiao et al, <i>Nature Cancer<\/i> 2022).<br \/>Methods: In order to examine the tumor growth efficacy of ESK981 in NEPC, we assessed the efficacy of ESK981 monotherapy in six NEPC (LTL-352, LTL-331R, LTL-545, and LTL-610 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs); and NCI-H660 cell line-derived xenograft) <i>in vivo <\/i>models. PDXs were maintained in CB17 SCID male mice and passaged by subcutaneous implantation. When the tumors reached ~100mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were randomized and treated with either vehicle (Ora-plus) or 30mg\/kg ESK981 administered by oral gavage once a day in a five-day per week schedule. Mouse body weight and tumor volume was monitored throughout the treatment schedule. Subcutaneous tumors were collected post five days of treatment for early assessment and long-term treatment for efficacy evaluation, respectively. H&#38;E staining, TUNEL <i>in situ<\/i> cell death assay, and western blotting were performed to determine the morphology changes and apoptosis after ESK981 treatment. Single cells were isolated from tumors and stained with Zombie live\/dead dye, CD45, CD11b and Ly6G fluorescently conjugated antibodies to assess neutrophil population by flow cytometry.<br \/>Conclusions: We demonstrated that ESK981 monotherapy is well tolerated in all <i>in vivo<\/i> models and ESK981 exerted greater cytotoxicity in NEPC than previous evaluated prostate adenocarcinoma by percent tumor growth inhibition. ESK981 also induced dramatic cell deaths in NEPC preclinical models, determined by H&#38;E staining, TUNEL-positive apoptotic tumor cells, and increased protein level of PARP cleavage via western blotting. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis revealed a dramatic increase in the intratumoral neutrophil infiltration after ESK981 treatment in the NEPC preclinical models in a time-dependent manner. NEPC tumors are sensitive to ESK981 monotherapy <i>in vivo<\/i>, suggesting NEPC patients may be the right population to target with ESK981. Together, ESK981 monotherapy is safe and effective therapy in NEPC preclinical models, and these results will warrant the clinical trial of ESK981 on NEPC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell death,Targeted therapy,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yang Zheng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kyle  J.

SHP2 also mediates PD-1 immune blockade of T cells by binding to the immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and immune receptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) of PD-1. SHP2 has long been considered as a plausible oncology drug target not only as an oncoprotein, but also as an important immune modulator. However, for decades, SHP2 was thought to be \"undruggable\" due to difficulties in targeting its catalytic site. Recent discovery of allosteric site of SHP2 has inspired a novel approach for SHP2 targeting. Here we report the development of ICP-189, which is a potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable allosteric inhibitor of SHP2, demonstrated robust efficacies in various <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> RAS\/MAPK pathway-driven models as mono-therapeutic agent or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs.<br \/>Results: ICP-189 inhibits phosphatase activity of SHP2 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values &#60; 5 nM. In a phosphatase profiling assay, ICP-189 efficiently inhibits the catalytic activity of SHP2, with no significant effects on 21 other tested tyrosine and serine\/threonine phosphatases, indicating its high selectivity for SHP2. ICP-189 has demonstrated robust <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacies in a panel of tumor cell lines bearing activated RTK, RAS, NF1 loss-of-function, or BRAF class III mutations. It has also exhibited synergistic tumor killing effects in combination with EGFR, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, MEK and CDK4\/6 inhibitors. In a series of <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy studies, ICP-189 treatment results in robust tumor growth control of MIA-PaCa-2, KYSE-520 and NCI-H358 xenografts. ICP-189 has also shown strong synergies in tumor killing when combined with MEK inhibitor trametinib, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor sotorasib, EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in xenograft models; and when combined with anti-PD-1 antibody in EMT6 syngeneic tumors. The <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy of ICP-189 is well accompanied by pharmacodynamic modulations, where ICP-189 exposure levels correlate with the inhibition of p-ERK and <i>DUSP6<\/i> mRNA level in tumors. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ICP-189 are overall favorable, with high oral bioavailability. Nonclinical safety evaluations also exhibit acceptable drug tolerability in SD rats and Beagle dogs.<br \/>Conclusions: ICP-189 is a novel allosteric inhibitor of SHP2 with broad-spectrum anti-tumor activities as a single agent or in combination with other targeted or immune modulating anti-cancer therapeutics.

Bruton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key oncogenic driver in many B cell malignancies. Orelabrutinib is a highly selective BTK inhibitor approved for r\/r CLL\/SLL and r\/r MCL in China. In addition, multiple clinical trials of orelabrutinib are being carried out for the treatment of other B cell lymphomas including the MCD subtype of DLBCL. In this study, we have investigated the potential benefit of combining orelabrutinib with tafasitamab and lenalidomide in pre-clinical B cell tumor models.<br \/>Results: ADCC activity of tafasitamab alone or in combination with lenalidomide and orelabrutinib\/ ibrutinib was measured by co-culturing CD19<sup>+<\/sup> B cell tumor cells TMD8 or RS4;11 with Jurkat-CD16a(V158)-NFAT reporter cells or PBMC. In both assays, orelabrutinib slightly enhances, or well retains the ADCC activity of tafasitamab, while ibrutinib consistently suppresses the ADCC function of tafasitamab. Mechanistically, our data indicate that ibrutinib has an off-target effect on ITK, a key kinase regulating FcR signaling in NK cells, which in turn may lead to compromised ADCC activity of tafasitamab. In contrast, orelabrutinib is a highly selective BTK inhibitor with no effect on ITK, which confers its ability to enhance or retain the ADCC activity of tafasitamab. Combination of orelabrutinib with tafasitamab and\/or lenalidomide also leads to synergistic tumor lysis activity, with or without the presence of immune effector cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy study of REC-1 xenografts has further demonstrated much improved tumor growth inhibition with combinatory treatment of orelabrutinib, tafasitamab and lenalidomide compared to single agents.<br \/>Conclusions: The highly selective BTK inhibitor orelabrutinib offers an alternative to ibrutinib as a combinatory partner with antibody therapeutics whose mechanism of action is highly dependent on ADCC. Confirmation of the synergistic effects of orelabrutinib with tafasitamab and lenalidomide in various preclinical models has provided scientific rationales for testing the combinatory treatment in clinical studies. An open-label, single-arm, multi-cohort phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of orelabrutinib, tafasitamab and lenalidomide combinations in patients with relapsed\/refractory non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,anti-CD19 antibody,lenalidomide,combination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hongjuan Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Ruixia Liang<sup><\/sup>, Haipeng Xu<sup><\/sup>, Xiaorong Li<sup><\/sup>, Renbin Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Jason Bin Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Davy Xuesong Ouyang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>InnoCare Pharma Tech co.

Yet the clinical use of VEGFR-2 inhibitors has been challenged by limited efficacy and various side effects, potentially due to the low selectivity of these TKIs for VEGFR-2. Thus, potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors with improved selectivity are needed. Rivoceranib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that potently and selectively inhibits VEGFR-2. A comparison of the potency and selectivity of VEGFR-2 inhibitors can provide a rationale for selecting a specific TKI for anticancer therapy in the clinic.<br \/>Methods: Binding of rivoceranib to VEGFR-2 was determined on a Biacore T200. The affinity constant (<i>K<\/i><sub>D<\/sub>) was derived from the association and dissociation rate constants. Inhibitory potency of rivoceranib and 10 FDA-approved reference inhibitors on kinase enzyme activity was determined using mobility shift assays (MSA) or immobilized metal ion affinity particle (IMAP) assays. The half-maximum inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) of the 11 inhibitors on VEGFR-2 was determined in 10-point dose-response curves. The selectivity of the inhibitors was determined on 270 wild-type kinases at a fixed concentration of each inhibitor. Rivoceranib was tested at 10- and 100-times IC<sub>50 <\/sub>(160 nmol\/L and 1.6 &#181;mol\/L). Reference inhibitors were tested at 1 &#181;mol\/L (35 to 1056-times IC<sub>50<\/sub>).<br \/>Results: Rivoceranib had a <i>K<\/i><sub>D<\/sub> of 3 nmol\/L on VEGFR-2. In enzyme activity assays, rivoceranib had intermediate potency compared with the 10 reference inhibitors, with a VEGFR-2 kinase inhibition IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 16 nmol\/L. Analysis of the residual activity of the panel of 270 kinases in the presence of rivoceranib or the reference inhibitors showed wide variation in selectivity for VEGFR-2, with rivoceranib identified as the most selective inhibitor (activity of 16 additional kinases inhibited by &#62;50% at 1.6 &#181;mol\/L). Tivozanib, the most potent VEGFR-2 inhibitor, displayed greater than 50% inhibitory activity against more than 70 additional kinases. Sunitinib was identified as the least selective inhibitor included in this study, inhibiting 125 additional kinases by &#62;50%.<br \/>Conclusion: Variations in selectivity among TKIs with similar anti-VEGFR-2 potency can help explain differences in their clinical toxicity profiles, which may be partially due to variant inhibitory effects against TKIs other than VEGFR-2. This comparative biochemical analysis highlights the potential for rivoceranib to address clinical limitations associated with the poor selectivity of currently available VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Rivoceranib is under ongoing investigation as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in various tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR),Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seong Jang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bill Strickland<sup>1<\/sup>, Lynda Finis<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeffrey  J.

In this preclinical study, we investigated the adaptive resistant mechanisms to lorlatinib and its therapeutic strategies to overcome, using in vitro and in vivo experiments. We have identified EGFR as an adaptive resistance mechanism of lorlatinib using phospho-RTK array and siRNA library. Cell line-based assay showed that exposure of lorlatinib accelerated EGFR signal activation as an adaptive response via activation of JNK cascade in ALK-rearranged lung cancer cells. Knockdown for EGFR suppressed the survival signal of ALK lung cancer cells when treated with lorlatinib. The combination of lorlatinib and erlotinib, a first-generation EGFR-TKI, was shown to enhance cell growth inhibition by inducing cell apoptosis via suppressing the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xl compared with lorlatinib monotherapy. Moreover, cell line-derived xenograft model indicated that the combination of lorlatinib plus erlotinib enhanced anti-tumor effects compared with lorlatinib monotherapy. Taken together, our results displayed that EGFR activation plays an important role in the initial adaptive resistance to lorlatinib for ALK-rearranged lung cancer. The combination of lorlatinib and erlotinib is expected as the promising strategy for those tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,EGFR,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuki Katayama<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tadaaki Yamada<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenji Morimoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroaki Ozasa<sup>2<\/sup>, Shinsaku Tokuda<sup>1<\/sup>, Koichi Takayama<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b1ed2e46-48a7-4818-8f4c-cad7efe3e8ed","ControlNumber":"1597","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

EGFR gene mutations, such as Exon 19 deletion (Del19) and L858R mutations, induce abnormal activation of the EGFR protein even in the absence of the ligand leading to various cancers. EGFR mutations are found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with 10-15% frequency (approximately 50% in Asian patients).<br \/>Starting from Del19 and L8585R mutations, additional mutations in the EGFR gene occur during the treatment with 1st\/2nd\/3rd generation EGFR inhibitors, resulting in Del19\/T790M, L858R\/T790M, Del19\/T790M\/C797S, L858R\/T790M\/C797S, Del19\/C797S, and L858R\/C797S mutations.

High potency and selectivity were confirmed by in vitro kinase assays and cellular assays. Outstanding anti-cancer activity was observed in mouse xenograft models with various EGFR mutations and, importantly, it was inactive in the EGFR wild-type model.

Genomic alterations in HER2 are present in brain metastases of breast cancer (BC; ~20%) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 13-20%), and EGFR alterations occur frequently in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; &#62;50%). Despite the advancements in standard of care options, optimal treatment management for these patients remains an unmet medical need. Recent evidence suggests activity of systemic therapy for immune and targeted therapies in the brain, including agents targeting HER2\/EGFR. HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors lapatinib, neratinib, and tucatinib and the HER2-targeted antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, have been shown to improve survival of patients with HER2 overexpressing BC in the presence of brain metastases. The limited penetration of these compounds into the CNS, however, limits their efficacy. TAS2940 is an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor with greater brain-penetrability than poziotinib, tucatinib, and neratinib. Here, we demonstrate that TAS2940 induces downregulation of phosphorylated HER2\/EGFR, reduces tumor burden, and promotes a significant increase in survival in intracranial xenograft mouse models with HER2-amplification (BC), HER2-Exon20 insertion mutation (NSCLC), and EGFR-amplification (GBM). These promising preclinical data highlight potential novel therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-aberrant GBM and brain metastases harboring HER2\/EGFR alterations, and may help support the advancement of the ongoing first-in-human clinical trial (NCT04982926) for TAS2940 in solid tumors with EGFR and\/or HER2 alterations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,EGFR,Brain tumors,ErbB,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jing Han<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mikhila Mahendra<sup>1<\/sup>, Poojabahen Gandhi<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph  R.

The most commonly acquired on-target resistance mutations are T790M and C797S, often appearing after progression on 1st-, 2nd-generation, and 3rd-generation EGFR TKIs, respectively. To prevent the emergence of drug-resistant subclones, a next-generation EGFR TKI must have activity against both treatment-emergent and drug-na&#239;ve mutants. Further preclinical studies were conducted to evaluate the activity of BBT-207 in delaying tumor regrowth or prolonging survival in NSCLC tumor models driven by the <i>EGFR<\/i> T790M and C797S mutation.<br \/>Method: We evaluated the inhibitory potency of BBT-207 against wild-type (WT) and mutated EGFR proteins. In vivo anti-tumor activity was evaluated in Ba\/F3 <i>EGFR<\/i> ex19del\/T790M (DT), L858R\/T790M (LT), ex19del\/C797S (DC), L858R\/C797S (LC), ex19del\/T790M\/C797S (DTC) or L858R\/T790M\/C797S (LTC), H1975 <i>EGFR<\/i> LTC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX), and <i>EGFR <\/i>DTC-patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. In vivo inhibition of brain metastases (BM) was evaluated in a luciferase-expressing PC-9<i> EGFR<\/i> DTC BM model through direct intracranial implantation.<br \/>Results: BBT-207 is broadly active against activating and acquired resistance <i>EGFR<\/i> mutants and displayed potent anti-proliferation activity against Ba\/F3 <i>EGFR<\/i> DT, LT, DC, LC, DTC, LTC with 4, 4, 1, 16, 5 and 8nM, respectively while being highly selective against Ba\/F3 <i>EGFR<\/i> WT (184 nM). BBT-207 also showed IC<sub>50<\/sub><sub> <\/sub>values &#60;5 nM against Osimertinib-resistant <i>EGFR<\/i> L792H triple mutants, DTL and LTL in cell-free <i>in vitro<\/i> kinase assay. QD administration as a single agent resulted in significant tumor regression in the Ba\/F3 <i>EGFR<\/i> DT, LT, DC, LC, DTC, LTC CDX models and <i>EGFR<\/i> DTC PDX model. Indeed, BBT-207 showed sustained anti-tumor efficacy in Ba\/F3 <i>EGFR<\/i> DC CDX model. Furthermore, BBT-207 exerted dose-dependent intracranial anti-tumor activity and enhanced survival rate of mice in the PC-9\/<i>EGFR <\/i>DTC_Luc BM model. PK studies revealed CNS penetration with good B\/P ratios in animals.<br \/>Conclusion: BBT-207 is a reversible, mutant-specific, broad-spectrum TKI, active to clinically observed mutations of <i>EGFR<\/i> and is expected to be compatible with monotherapy of QD schedule in humans. BBT-207 is well-positioned to augment the treatment of <i>EGFR<\/i> mutated NSCLC, either for acquired drug resistance or in earlier line, with potential to treat or prevent CNS metastasis. PK\/TK evaluation justify exploration in humans. First-in-human study in patients harboring <i>EGFRm<\/i> and previously treated with EGFR TKI, is to begin enrollment in USA 1H 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),NSCLC,Mutations,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chulwon Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Youn Hee Jung<sup>1<\/sup>, Naeun Jeon<sup>1<\/sup>, Yong-Hee Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Sang-Yoon Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Jimmy Taiguang Jin<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Research Center, Bridge Biotherapeutics, INC., Seongnam-si, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Bridge Biotherapeutics, INC., Cambridge, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Bridge Biotherapeutics, INC., Seongnam-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7ff0db37-1b95-4e78-bb38-e83133d5873b","ControlNumber":"3229","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

These genetic alterations are believed to confer elevated HER2 activity resulting in oncogenic transformation. In NSCLC, an estimated 3% of patients harbor activating mutations in the HER2 gene. Enhertu (T-DXd), a HER2-specific antibody-drug conjugate was recently approved as an important therapy for this patient population. However, for patients who are not candidates for T-DXd or have discontinued treatment due to an adverse event or disease progression, there exist few therapeutic options. Accordingly, HER2 inhibitors have the potential to provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to these patients. Due to significant structural homology between EGFR and HER2, most investigational small molecule HER2 kinase inhibitors are dual EGFR\/HER2 inhibitors and are substantially dose-limited by EGFR-related toxicities in patients. These toxicities likely limit their clinical activity. Currently, tucatinib is the only HER2-selective small molecule inhibitor approved for metastatic breast cancer in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. However, it lacks sufficient potency against several of the key clinically relevant mutations, including HER2 YVMA, the most common exon 20 insertion mutation, prevalent in HER2 mutant NSCLC. ELVN-002 is a potent, irreversible inhibitor of HER2 with a &#62;100-fold selectivity over EGFR. ELVN-002 potently inhibits the phosphorylation of HER2 in cell lines endogenously expressing HER2 or in those engineered to express specific clinically relevant HER2 mutants. This activity readily translates into marked anti-proliferative activity against cell lines dependent upon HER2 for their growth and survival. In addition, ELVN-002 is highly selective for HER2 and HER2 mutants versus wild-type EGFR as demonstrated via assessment of both EGFR-driven proliferation and EGFR phosphorylation in cells. Furthermore, ELVN-002 is highly active in mouse models of HER2-driven cancers, including subcutaneous models driven by wild type or mutant HER2. ELVN-002 is also active in an NCI-N87 wild-type HER2 intracranial model. In all models tested, ELVN-002 treatment is well tolerated and resulted in tumor regressions at exposures believed to be clinically achievable. Due to its selectivity and breadth of activity versus the clinically relevant HER2 mutants, ELVN-002 has the potential to be an effective treatment for HER2 mutant NSCLC as well as other HER2 mutant amplified solid tumors, including metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. Additionally, ELVN-002 could provide a meaningful therapeutic option for patients with CNS metastases. ELVN-002 has been selected for clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB,HER2,Mutations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Monette Aujay<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Amanda  J.

BTK inhibition blocks BCR signals and prevents B-cell activation and growth. First-generation BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib covalently binds to a cysteine residue (C481) of BTK. Their most frequent acquired resistance is the development of a serine mutation in the binding site (C481S). Next generation BTK inhibitors such as LOXO-305 and ARQ 531 are being developed to overcome this resistance to first-generation inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: HMPL-760 was tested in biochemical assays using recombinant human wild type (WT) and C481S mutant BTKs. Its selectivity was carried out using Eurofins Cerep KinaseProfiler<sup>TM<\/sup> panel. Cellular activity of HMPL-760 was evaluated in HEK293 cells stably transfected with BTK<sup>WT<\/sup> or BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup>, and other tumor cell lines, which are either human diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines. The in vivo antitumor activity and PKPD correlation of HMPL-760 was studied in HBL-1 xenograft mouse models bearing BTK<sup>WT<\/sup> or BTK<sup>C481S <\/sup>respectively.<br \/>Results: In biochemical assays, HMPL&#8209;760 strongly inhibits BTK kinase activities towards wild-type BTK (BTK<sup>WT<\/sup>) and C481S mutant (BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup>), and binds to BTK in a reversible way. HMPL-760 demonstrates high selectivity in a panel containing 413 kinases. In cellular assays, HMPL-760 displays strong anti-proliferative activities in B-cell lymphoma cells (TMD-8, OCI-LY10, REC-1, HBL-1 and HBL-1-BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup>) harboring either BTK<sup>WT <\/sup>or BTK<sup>C481S <\/sup>(GI<sub>50<\/sub>: 0.0015-0.046 &#956;M). In human whole blood assay, HMPL-760 inhibits activation of B-cells at nanomolar concentrations measured by inhibition of immunoglobulin-induced CD69 expression in CD19<sup>+<\/sup>cells. HMPL-760 shows &#8805; 10-fold inhibitory potency than ARQ 531 in both BTK<sup>WT <\/sup>and BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup> cells, and ~3-fold higher inhibitory potency than that of LOXO-305 in BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup> cells. In cellular assay by detecting p-BTK after compound washout, HMPL-760 maintains a longer duration of target inhibition than LOXO-305 in both BTK wild type (HBL-1) and BTK mutant (HBL-1-BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup>) cell lines. HMPL-760 displays dose-dependent antitumor efficacy in multiple human B cell lymphoma xenograft models in mice when orally administered at 3~50 mg\/kg once daily. Complete tumor regression occurs in most of the tested models at the high dose levels. HMPL-760 shows much stronger antitumor efficacy than LOXO-305 and ARQ 531 at similar dose level, which may be associated with HMPL-760&#8217;s higher drug exposures and more sustainable inhibition on BTK phosphorylation in the tumor tissues.<br \/>Conclusion: HMPL-760 is a reversible, selective, highly potent, BTK inhibitor targeting both BTK<sup>WT<\/sup> and BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup>. The first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trials of HMPL-760 are under way in patients with r\/r B-NHL (NCT05190068, NCT05176691).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Linfang Wang<sup><\/sup>, Junqing Liang<sup><\/sup>, Zhihu Gao<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jia Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Weigang He<sup><\/sup>, Xianwen Yang<sup><\/sup>, Fangfang Mao<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Ying Yu<sup><\/sup>, Qihang Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Na Yang<sup><\/sup>, Chun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jian Wang<sup><\/sup>, Yu Cai<sup><\/sup>, Xiong Li<sup><\/sup>, Weiguo Qing<sup><\/sup>, Guangxiu Dai<sup><\/sup>, Yongxin Ren<sup><\/sup>, Michael Shi<sup><\/sup>, Weiguo Su<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>HUTCHMED Limited, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"099aa718-5ce5-43eb-9fcc-f2df5f4f3b69","ControlNumber":"2356","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

Overexpression of AXL is associated with metastasis, drug resistance, and poor prognosis of various hematological and solid tumors, which are all broadly modulated with epigenetic regulation. In addition, inhibition of AXL phosphorylation may overcome drug resistance to current FLT3 inhibitors in <i>FLT3-ITD+<\/i> Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (Park <i>et al<\/i>., 2015). We tested CTS2016 as a single agent or in combination with either venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, or azacitidine, a hypomethylating agent (HMA) and an epigenetic modulation drug, in a series of&nbsp;<i>in vitro<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>in vivo<\/i>&nbsp;studies using various AML models.&nbsp;CTS2016 resulted in a potent growth inhibitory effect with strong induction of cell death in a spectrum of AML cell lines carrying <i>FLT3<\/i> mutations (<i>FLT3-ITD<\/i> and\/or <i>FLT3-TKD<\/i>).&nbsp;CTS2016 orally administered once daily, demonstrated potent and dose-dependent antitumor responses in a variety of AML xenograft mouse models. The anti-tumor activity was correlated with the inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, as measured by decreased phosphorylation of key downstream signaling targets of FLT3. In a tail vein injection of mouse LLC-Luciferase model, CTS2016 treatment could significantly reduce tumor metastasis. A combination of CTS2016 with venetoclax or azacitidine provides a therapeutic benefit over monotherapy and supports a rationale for testing these combination therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory (R\/R) AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In addition, CTS2016 significantly reduced the tumor burden of a leukemia model harboring <i>FLT3-ITD-F691L<\/i>, a drug-resistant mutation of <i>FLT3<\/i>. Notably, the selectivity of CTS2016 over other kinases (such as c-KIT) mitigates the off-target toxicity effects on normal hematological differentiation which is common in clinics for other FLT3 inhibitors. These data demonstrate that CTS2016 could be a promising therapy for treating patients diagnosed with AML and MDS harboring <i>FLT3<\/i> mutations and solid tumors such as NSCLC and TNBC with high-expression of AXL.

Brain metastases are common in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with an incidence of ~40% at diagnosis and ~60% after progressive disease on the first-generation ALK TKI (crizotinib) due to its limited brain penetration. Second- (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, and ensartinib) and third-generation (lorlatinib) ALK TKIs have higher intracranial responses than crizotinib but are still limited by emergence of resistance mutations, most commonly G1202R-containing single and compound mutations. We previously reported that NVL-655 has intracranial activity in a preclinical model of Ba\/F3 EML4-ALK v1 G1202R\/L1196M. Here we further demonstrate the intracranial activity of NVL-655 in a preclinical patient-derived model harboring EML4-ALK v3 G1202R.<br \/>Methods: The YU-1077 cell line was established from a patient with ALK-positive NSCLC after relapse on alectinib and was confirmed to harbor EML4-ALK v3 G1202R alteration. ALK TKIs (crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, lorlatinib, and NVL-655) were profiled against YU-1077 cells in 3-day viability assays and signaling assays. YU-1077 cells were intracranially implanted in Balb\/c nude mice and treated with NVL-655 orally twice daily. Brain tumor burden was monitored weekly using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br \/>Results: NVL-655 suppressed the viability of YU-1077 cells bearing EML4-ALK v3 G1202R (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 1 nM) with potency &#62;10-fold that of lorlatinib. NVL-655 at &#8804;10 nM fully inhibited ALK signaling as measured by ALK, ERK, and S6 phosphorylation, compared to &#8805;100 nM of lorlatinib required to achieve similar inhibition. Other ALK TKIs tested had limited activity against YU-1077 cells in viability and signaling assays, consistent with the G1202R mutation conferring resistance to first- and second-generation ALK TKIs. In mice intracranially implanted with YU-1077 cells, MRI scans confirmed rapid tumor regression upon treatment with 0.5 and 1.5 mg\/kg NVL-655.<br \/>Conclusion: Patient-derived models are widely viewed as among the most disease-relevant models for evaluating new therapies and drug resistance. Using a xenograft model derived from an alectinib-relapsed patient, we showed that NVL-655 had high intracranial activity against brain tumors bearing the ALK G1202R mutation that confers resistance to multiple ALK TKIs.

However, some of the patients who received EGFR-TKIs showed the acquired resistance, and eventually relapsed within several months. In the TCGA data sets, gene expression of glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78), an ER chaperone, was upregulated in NSCLC tissues. We also confirmed that protein level of GRP78 was increased in HCC827-GR, H1993-GR and H1993-ER NSCLC cell lines with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Since GRP78 modulates ER stress level which induces ROS and apoptosis, Ru(II) complex 1 and HA15, both the known GRP78 inhibitors induced higher ER stress and ROS generation accompanying more remarkable anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines. GRP78 level was also found to be higher in H1975, EGFR-TKI-resistant T790M-mutant cell line than other NSCLC cell lines. Blockade of GRP78 also led to apoptosis in H1975, which is consistent with the results found in the acquired EGFR-TKI-resistant cell lines. In summary, we suggest GRP78 targeting as a potential therapeutic strategy for the acquired EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-01 Cellular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jaewoo Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Baskaran Purushothaman<sup><\/sup>, Sera Hong<sup><\/sup>, Munkyung Choi<sup><\/sup>, Joon Myong Song<sup><\/sup>, Keon Wook Kang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Seoul National University College of Pharmacy, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5fd10c65-8647-45dd-b284-870da8dace53","ControlNumber":"5494","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

While survival rates have improved steadily with each new generation of ALK TKI, resistance generally develops, including second site ALK kinase mutations as well as by-pass track activation. Since almost all anti-ALK approaches have focused on kinase domain inhibition, we sought to develop novel inhibitors with alternative mechanisms of action against ALK to overcome current drug resistance. Cysteine-reactive small molecule drugs may enable new mechanisms of target inhibition, and clinically successful examples of recent FDA-approved drugs in NSCLC include afatinib, osimertinib, sotorasib, and adagrasib.We aimed to explore and uncover novel cysteine-reactive covalent inhibitors of EML4-ALK. Using cysteine druggability mapping (CDM), a proteome-wide mass spectrometry target engagement assay, we first determined the landscape of reactive cysteines in ALK-positive cell lines and identified various targetable cysteines within the MAPK pathway and within the EML4-ALK fusion protein itself. To identify small molecules that modulate ALK activation, degradation, and downstream signaling, we conducted a high-content phosphorylated protein screen by testing 4,400 reactive cysteine compounds and found 20 potential hits that impacted ALK phosphorylation or expression. Using proteomic analysis, we have determined the comparative specificity of these compounds, and have ranked them based on p-ALK reduction efficiency and on their off-target binding patterns. We have initiated hit-to-lead development on a compound that binds to the EML4 portion of the fusion and we are performing a detailed analysis of its mechanism of action. To further optimize the potency of the compound, we designed, synthesized, and are testing several hundred analog compounds. By applying the hit compounds from the screen in ALK TKI-resistant models, we will be able to evaluate the ability of these compounds to overcome ALK resistance. To our knowledge, we have identified the first EML4-ALK covalent binder targeting the EML4 domain. Using the unique mechanism of action of the current ALK kinase inhibitor, we have uncovered a potential compound to overcome ALK resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Diane Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Harry<sup>2<\/sup>, Edwin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zavontae Oppong-Holmes<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander Daniel Carlin<sup>1<\/sup>, Wenxin Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Abigail Smith<sup>1<\/sup>, Maristela Onozato<sup>1<\/sup>, Liron Bar-Peled<sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony  J.
