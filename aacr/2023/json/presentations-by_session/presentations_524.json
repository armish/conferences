Although localized disease can be effectively treated and usually has a favorable prognosis, progression to metastasis results in high mortality rates as current treatment modalities are not yet curative. The standard of care for advanced PC is hormonal therapy, termed Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT). Unfortunately, ADT typically elicits the emergence of a lethal phenotype, termed Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), which is treatment-resistant and frequently gives rise to a highly aggressive variant with features of neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation, known as Neuroendocrine PC (NEPC). There is no cure for NEPC, thus identifying drivers that lead to its emergence is of paramount importance. We used the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system to perform a forward genetic screening on Genetically-Engineered Mouse Models (GEMMs) of CRPC that are known to develop NEPC under ADT pressure. SB transposon activation generated tumors with an accelerated growth phenotype and increased metastasis incidence compared to non-activated controls. Notably, several tumors presented histological features of NEPC. We sequenced SB transposon integration sites on tumors&#8217; genomes to identify recurrent patterns suggesting genes responsible for phenotype acceleration and NEPC differentiation. Recently, we generated and assembled a set of &#62;100 GEMM-derived tumors, that recapitulate a broad spectrum of PC disease states, to reverse-engineer a network of regulatory proteins. We used this network on RNA-Seq data collected from SB-activated tumors to identify Master Regulator (MR) proteins that are specifically associated with NEPC emergence. Cross-species network analysis of patient-specific MRs activity conservation between patient and our mouse cohorts, aligned NEPC patients to mice tumors with NE features, corroborating our study's clinical relevance. We performed an integrative network analysis that links genomic events as generated by SB transposon integrations to downstream regulatory programs implemented by MR proteins. This analysis prioritized Sirt1 as upstream modulator of NEPC MRs activity. Activation of SIRT1 in human adenocarcinoma PC cells induced NE-like phenotype, while SIRT1 inhibitor in NEPC cells reduced tumor aggressiveness. In summary, we used <i>in vivo <\/i>models of prostate cancer to elucidate molecular drivers of NEPC, a lethal variant that is treatment-resistant. Integrative network data analysis prioritized Sirt1 as driver of NEPC emergence and was validated <i>in vivo.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Systems biology,Prostate cancer,Therapy resistance,Neuroendocrine differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alessandro Vasciaveo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Francisca Nunes De Almeida<sup>2<\/sup>, Min Zou<sup>2<\/sup>, Matteo Di Bernardo<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrea Califano<sup>1<\/sup>, Cory Abate-Shen<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"25feafb8-b419-47f5-b1d0-63ea37478fa7","ControlNumber":"6882","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

However, existing model development approaches require long periods of culture time and it is difficult to create long-term models of many cancers, greatly limiting the share of patient samples that can be studied. To enable high-throughput perturbation screens in primary cells without an intermediate model generation step, we are developing a label-free imaging-based platform for early living tissue perturbation. Here, we present our ex vivo system for the preservation and morphological characterization of malignant ascites from patients with gastroesophageal cancer, whose prognosis remains poor and there is an urgent need for rapid evidence-based therapeutic discovery. First, we established a workflow to acquire and perturb cells within 1 day of sample collection. We found that mixing ascites fluid with organoid media improves the preservation of cellular composition and viability of the samples. Next, we hypothesized that label-free microscopy can be a potential alternative for fluorescence-based biomarkers of which signal fades over time in live-cell imaging. To test this, we designed a systematic approach for data generation to assess the reproducibility of measures, and we built a dataset consisting of over 1.0M cells from 14 samples (10 unique patients). For training input, we extracted morphological features of each identified cell by generating several projections from z-stacks of label-free bright-field microscopy images. For training labels, we used fluorescence labels to annotate cell type and viability during the imaging screens. Then, using solely bright-field morphological data as input, we trained models to infer cell identity and viability, we found that the accuracy of predictions was 92% and 82%, respectively.<b> <\/b>Strong correlations were found between tumor fractions determined by flow cytometry and the prediction of tumor cell fraction from label-free morphology only. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, we designed a candidate panel of 28 compounds that are anticipated to exhibit antitumor activity via different mechanisms that are of relevance to our study cohort. We observed that label-free inference of compound activity showed a strong correlation (R2 &#62; 0.8) with fluorescent-based predictions. We are now expanding the scale of our rapid screens by finding the minimal number of necessary z-stacks of bright-field and fluorescent channels maintaining the prediction accuracy of cell identity and viability. By finding the appropriate minimum setting for imaging setup, the throughput of the system can be increased both in the compound and sample number. Our approach couples the timing of the perturbation with the preservation of subcellular heterogeneity, it will serve as a strong foundation for preclinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Response,Imaging,Drug sensitivity,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mushriq Al-Jazrawe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Csaba Molnar<sup>1<\/sup>, Elisabeth Abeyta<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Blum<sup>2<\/sup>, Niklas Rindtorff<sup>3<\/sup>, Kathryn Cebula<sup>1<\/sup>, Sean Misek<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Alimova<sup>4<\/sup>, William Colgan<sup>4<\/sup>, Carmen Rios<sup>4<\/sup>, Moony Tseng<sup>4<\/sup>, James McFarland<sup>4<\/sup>, Aviv Regev<sup>1<\/sup>, Beth Cimini<sup>4<\/sup>, Anne Carpenter<sup>4<\/sup>, Adam Bass<sup>4<\/sup>, Samuel Klempner<sup>5<\/sup>, Jesse Boehm<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Koch Institute, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b59645d9-2b73-476e-abfc-0e69900b7b25","ControlNumber":"8184","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

We performed scRNA-seq of PDAC from standard-of-care endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) specimens at the time-of-diagnosis and from surgical samples obtained from tumor resections. In total, we acquired 32k cells across 25 independent PDAC samples for our in-house EUS-FNB cohort, and 12k cells from 6 independent PDAC samples for our in-house surgical cohort. To increase power, we then combined the in-house scRNA-seq data with three publicly available datasets, increasing our dataset to 80 samples. Cells were subsequently annotated based on a combination of known marker genes and gene set scores from the literature. Importantly, we partitioned malignant cells into Classical and Basal subtypes, CAFs into myofibroblast (myCAF) and inflammatory (iCAF) fibroblast, and TAMs into C1QC+, FCN1+, SPP1+, and proliferating TAMs based on similarity with previously published markers. We then determined the developmental status of the malignant and CAF subclusters with the CytoTRACE tool. We found that Basal malignant cells were less differentiated than their classical counterparts, agreeing with previous literature suggesting the aggressive basal subtype is more likely to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly, we also found that myCAFs are significantly less differentiated than iCAFs. We then extended our single cell expression profiles to 391 publicly available bulk expression samples with associated clinical metadata to find cell state patterns associated with patient survival. To this end, we modified the in-silico TME dissection tool EcoTyper and grouped significantly co-occurring cell states into ecotypes. Notably, one ecotype, termed PE3, showed consistently poor survival across all bulk RNA-seq datasets and harbored significant associations between Malignant - Basal, myCAF, and TAM - SPP1+ cell states, suggesting patients may benefit from treatment regimens that concurrently target TAM, CAF, and malignant cell dynamics in PDAC. In summary, we identified a novel TME community that revealed new connections between TME composition, developmental status, and patient survival that could lead to better upfront risk stratification and more personalized clinical decision-making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Tumor associated macrophages,Cancer associated fibroblasts,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Erik Storrs<sup><\/sup>, <b>Prathamesh Chati<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Abul Usmani<sup><\/sup>, Li Ding<sup><\/sup>, Ryan Fields<sup><\/sup>, Koushik Das<sup><\/sup>, Aadel Chaudhuri<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9e13bc78-8a9d-4952-8468-fc9b5dc312b4","ControlNumber":"7644","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

Although the structure of many target proteins is available and their binding affinity to specific compounds can be experimentally assessed, drug efficacy and toxicity are infrequently determined based on single target affinity. Rather, the pharmacologic property of drugs is often the result of its complex polypharmacology, as mediated by both unknown or poorly characterized off-target effects (i.e., lower-affinity binding proteins) as well as by tissue-specific secondary effector proteins (i.e., non-binding) that are undetectable by traditional assays. MoA elucidation typically relies on in vitro affinity binding assays tailored to specific protein classes, such as kinases or metabolic enzymes, which cannot reveal critical high- and low-affinity binding targets among other protein classes, as well as context-specific downstream effectors. The goal of this study is to address critical unresolved questions in cancer pharmacology by characterizing the proteome-wide MoA of oncology drugs as a critical, yet highly elusive step necessary to fully understand their clinical efficacy and toxicity. To elucidate proteome-wide, drug-mediated changes in protein activity (drug MoA), we performed network-based analyses of genome-wide RNA-seq profiles representing the response of patient-matched cell lines to a comprehensive repertoire of clinically relevant drugs. More specifically, we generated genome-wide drug perturbation profiles from 23 cancer cell representing high-fidelity models of patients in clinical cohorts representing distinct tumor subtypes, using &#62; 700 oncology drugs. This represents the largest resources of functionally annotated, clinically-relevant, genome-wide perturbational profiles for clinically relevant drugs, named PanACEA. VIPER-based analysis of this resource effectively elucidated the effect of each individual drug on the activity of ~6,500 regulatory and signaling proteins, in each of the 23 distinct represented cancer subtypes. Analyses of these data, using a graph theory approach, helped elucidate critical functional relationship between individual drugs and group drugs into functionally-distinct modules within each cancer context, thus providing critical insight into both drug MoA and polypharmacology. These analyses also effective drug inhibitors for critical cancer dependencies represented by transcription factors and co-factors, considered undruggable, that were experimentally validated. Finally, integrative analysis of PANCEA predictions and Cancer Dependency Map data significantly improved our understanding of cancer-related drug pharmacology, thus providing a unique resource for cancer related studies, which has been used in key clinical and pre-clinical trials, both published and in review.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacogenomics,Systems biology,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lucas Zhongming Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Eugene Douglass<sup><\/sup>, Ron Realubit<sup><\/sup>, Karan Charles<sup><\/sup>, Mariano Alvarez<sup><\/sup>, Andrea Califano<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5f24330f-f409-48f9-8347-fb777627425e","ControlNumber":"8024","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

However, when evaluating these questions using tumor single-cell data, current statistical methods for this task are limited in two major aspects: (i) They are not representative of the hierarchical nature of tumor single-cell datasets (where cells are more similar within the patient than between patients); and (ii) They often do not contextualize statistical significance (p-values) in the context of variability that is expected biologically between patients. This can lead to molecular hypotheses that are skewed by patient-specific biology with high false positive rates. To address these challenges, we developed a nonparametric statistical method, BEANIE (group Biology EstimAtioN in sIngle cEll), for estimating group biology in single-cell transcriptomic datasets. BEANIE uses monte carlo simulations to estimate the p-value distribution for the gene signature of interest and normalizes with respect to a background distribution of the expected patient-to-patient variability. The method then performs leave-one-out cross-validation to infer robustness of the gene signatures to patient exclusion. We applied our method to public cancer single-cell datasets to evaluate candidate differences in tumor cell populations between known groups. When comparing tumor cell programs derived from treatment-naive vs. chemotherapy-treated Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients, BEANIE identified upregulation of hallmark gene signatures for fatty acid metabolism and hypoxia to be statistically significant and robust in the treatment-naive group, indicative of response to chemotherapy treatment. We also compared BEANIE to conventional methods like Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction and Generalized Linear Models (GLM). MWU test and GLM also identified these signatures to be upregulated, but they additionally identified other immune cell gene signatures like T-cell markers, B-cell markers and NK cell markers, to also be upregulated, which was not expected since we were comparing between tumor cells. Similarly, BEANIE identified candidate tumor cell intrinsic programs relevant to hypotheses in lung cancer patients (early vs. late-stage) and melanoma patients (Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB)-naive vs. ICB-treated). Therefore, BEANIE greatly increased the specificity of analysis, and reduced false positive rates. This method is publicly available and may overcome existing methodological limitations to guide tumor-intrinsic hypothesis generation in rapidly growing clinical cancer single-cell cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Statistical approach,Tumor heterogeneity,Pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shreya Johri<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kevin Bi<sup>2<\/sup>, Breanna  M.

To find one drug that will be effective in the clinic, drug developers have to test 20 agents, 19 of which will ultimately prove ineffective. Such high attrition rates drive up the cost of treatment and delay getting effective drugs to the market. Here we describe the Patient-centric Discovery by Active Learning (PeDAL) platform and present results of a study that shows it can predict the effectiveness of a drug or a set of drugs in a patient population with 92% accuracy in only 11 weeks while only performing in vitro assays on a fraction of the drug-patient combinations. The power of PeDAL is derived from a combination of AI technology, an extensive drug response and biomarker database, and a biobank of 150,000 tumor samples from 137 tumor types. The study consists of two phases, the first demonstrates that PeDAL&#8217;s predictive model efficiently reveals drug-response patterns that provide insight into the treatment of ovarian cancers. The second phase focuses on the <i>in vitro<\/i> validation of the accuracy of the predictions.<b> <\/b>The experimental space was 175 FDA-approved drugs and 130 primary ovarian tumor samples. PeDAL&#8217;s active machine learning algorithm iteratively optimizes predictive models by learning from <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments which take into account tumor-stromal interactions and cellular heterogeneity. Importantly, the ability to model patient-drug combinations across a diverse population of primary samples adds a patient heterogeneity dimension to the generated drug response predictions. After performing 720 high throughput experiments, PeDAL was able to make drug-response predictions for an additional 4,600 drug\/tumor predictions. Additional <i>in vitro<\/i> validation experiments confirm the reproducibility and accuracy of the high-confidence predictions generated by PeDAL with area under the curve (AUC) values &#62;0.95. These results have strong implications not only for the new drug discovery process, but also for identifying opportunities for drug repurposing. We demonstrate that the PeDAL platform is a highly efficient tool to make confident predictions about drug-tumor pairings allowing the discovery of many more drug-tumor responses than are practical to test <i>in vitro<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Drug-discovery screen,Response,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Robert  J.

These genetic elements may be an abundant yet underexplored source of immunogenic molecules that create chimeric transcripts composed of transposons and non-transposons. However, it remains challenging to accurately identify such transposon-fusion events from short RNA-seq reads mainly due to the repetitive nature of transposon sequences and error-prone read alignment near exon-intron junctions, and there are few existing methods for such detection. We developed a computational pipeline, <i>rTea (RNA Transposable Element Analyzer)<\/i> to detect transposons-fusion transcripts from RNA-seq data. Using <i>rTea<\/i>, we performed a pan-cancer analysis of 10,257 cancer samples across 34 cancer types as well as 2,994 normal tissue samples from the TCGA\/ICGC, our unpublished colorectal cancer cohort, and the GTEx consortia. Among normal human tissues, higher fusion loads were found most notably in the testis and to a lesser extent in other tissues that have been characterized as immune-privileged. Somatic fusions found in cancer were enriched in known cancer genes, implicating their contribution to tumorigenesis. We also found distinct epigenetic and tumorigenic mechanisms underlying fusions from different transposon families. Through in silico immunogenicity modeling and experimental validation, we confirmed the MHC-I binding and CD8+ T cell activation by peptides derived from transposon fusions to the extent comparable to EBV viruses. Our findings highlight endogenous retroelements as novel therapeutic targets and a significant source of neoantigens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Fusion genes,Transposon-fusion RNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.
