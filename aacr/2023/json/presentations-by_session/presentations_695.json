[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Fusosomes are viral vectors pseudotyped with modified paramyxovirus envelopes targeting specific cell types. A CD8-targeted fusosome delivering CD19CAR transgene has the potential to provide an off-the-shelf therapeutic approach to generate CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients after direct intravenous delivery or extracorporeal delivery (ECD), i.e., a short-term exposure of apheresis product to fusosome before re-infusion into the patient. Here, we demonstrate that an improved manufacturing process resulted in higher fusosome titer and quality, increasing the potency of CAR T generation from resting CD8 T cells. This potency is also observed when fusosomes are evaluated in a clinically relevant mock ECD approach.<br \/>Methods: Fusosome titer was quantified by ddPCR directly for physical titer (vector genomes, GQA) or after infections of SupT1 cells for functional titer (IU\/mL). Transduction of CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry and vector copy number analysis after short-term (1-4 hour) incubation of PBMCs with fusosome followed by wash and culture in resting or CD3\/CD28-activated conditions. To assess CD19CAR T cell generation at a mock clinical setting and scale, a healthy donor was apheresed to collect PBMCs, fusosome was administered into the apheresis bag and PBMCs were sampled from the bag over a 2.5-hour time course for further analysis. <i>In vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy of the fusosome was measured in immune-deficient NSG mice engrafted intravenously with Nalm6, then PBMCs followed by fusosome one day later. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging.<br \/>Results: Fusosomes produced by the improved process had both a higher functional concentration (&#62;14-fold higher IU\/mL) and better infectivity (&#62;10-fold higher IU\/GQA) in comparison to fusosomes produced by the original process. Exposure of PBMCs to fusosomes produced by the improved process led to increased fusosome binding to CD8 T cells at high IU\/PBMC doses and higher transduction efficiency in CD8 T cells at the same calculated dose per cell compared to fusosomes produced by the original process (&#62;3-fold higher mean CAR+ percentage after 2-hour exposure to 2 IU\/PBMC, <i>n<\/i>=8). Furthermore, fusosomes produced by the improved process generated higher frequencies of CAR+ CD8 T cells and resulted in increased ability to control tumor growth at lower doses <i>in vivo <\/i>in a Nalm6 model. Importantly, the ECD approach translated well to a mock clinical setting, resulting in successful generation of CAR T cells (12.6% of CD8 T cells after a 2.5-hour incubation).<br \/>Conclusion: CD8-targeted fusosome encoding a CD19CAR transgene represents a potential novel therapeutic approach for cancer. This study demonstrates that improvements in the manufacturing process can significantly increase the potency of the fusosome in T cells, and we intend to move forward to clinical trials using this improved process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Gene therapy,Targeted therapy,Lentivirus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jesse Green<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Granger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ouwen Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesus Moreno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Tucker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aesha Vakil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reuben Burch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Mozdzierz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Scott-Skandera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Riofrio<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mike DeCosta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amey Gaikwad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanket Phadke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaely Gallagher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Charlton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hosein Kouros-Mehr<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Misha Shamashkin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neal Van Hoeven<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kutlu Elpek<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Terry Fry<\/i><\/presenter>.

TATs hold great promise for treatment-resistant tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) due to the extensive DNA damage and cell death induced by alpha particles. GBM is an aggressive and lethal primary adult brain tumor that is highly resistant to external beam radiation and chemotherapy. Herein, we present the preclinical evaluation of a novel TAT for treatment of GBM targeting the most common tumour-specific mutant, epidermal growth factor receptor variant 3 (EGFRvIII). Our EGFRvIII TAT consists of a humanized EGFRvIII monoclonal antibody, a proprietary bifunctional chelate, and the alpha-emitting radionuclide, actinium-225 (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac). <i>In vivo<\/i> biodistribution and efficacy of our EGFRvIII TAT was evaluated in two aggressive orthotopic EGFRvIII-expressing GBM patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs; G06 and G39) with varying degrees of blood-brain-tumor barrier (BBTB) permeability. Imaging biodistribution studies were performed using an [<sup>111<\/sup>In]-anti-EGFRvIII agent analogous to our [<sup>225<\/sup>Ac] therapeutic candidate. SPECT\/BLT imaging 96 h after intravenous administration of the imaging agent revealed high tumor-specific uptake of 50.2 %ID\/cc in G39 tumors with a disrupted BBTB, and 10.4% ID\/cc in G06 tumors with a relatively intact BBTB. Normal brain showed very low uptake (1.6-2.1% ID\/cc), and all other normal organs were &#60;10 % ID\/cc except for highly perfused organs such as heart and liver, indicating no significant off-target uptake. [<sup>225<\/sup>Ac]-anti-EGFRvIII single-dose and fractionated multi-dose efficacy studies were conducted in G06 and G39 orthotopic PDX models, respectively. Survival analysis showed a dose-dependent increase in survival in response to treatment with [<sup>225<\/sup>Ac]-anti-EGFRvIII therapy, with a greater than 3-fold increase in survival compared to vehicle controls at doses of 200-400 nCi. Furthermore, the survival benefit of the 400 nCi single-dose or fractionated equivalent dose groups were comparable, demonstrating that efficacy was dependent upon the total administered radioactivity dose. Finally, we show that combined treatment of [<sup>225<\/sup>Ac]-anti-EGFRvIII with the standard of care (SoC), external beam radiation plus temozolomide, resulted in a significant survival advantage (&#62;1.7-fold) compared to TAT or SoC therapy alone. Collectively, these results demonstrate that [<sup>225<\/sup>Ac]-anti-EGFRvIII is a highly selective and potent therapeutic for GBM which holds great potential as both a single-agent and in combination with SoC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Glioblastoma multiforme,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julie Metcalf<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Nielsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suma Prabhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Robinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Marinacci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Grinshtein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brigitte L.

Apart from the oncogenic translocations in leukemias, MLL1 forms a COMPASS complex with Menin and other binding partners to act as an H3K4 methyltransferase. Inhibition of COMPASS complex by blocking the Menin-MLL1 interaction is reported to be effective in different cancers. In this study, we found that a specific Menin-MLL1 inhibitor, MI-503 inhibits neuroblastoma cancer stem cells (NB CSCs; CD114+ cells) to inhibit overall neuroblastoma (NB) growth in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>NB tumor models. NB is an extracranial solid pediatric cancer that accounts for about 15% of all pediatric cancer-related deaths, with the long-term survival of relapsed NB patients being less than 10%. We found that MI-503 significantly and in a dose-dependent manner inhibits cell proliferation in nine NB cell lines tested including MYCN amplified (NGP, LAN-5, IMR-32), MYCN non-amplified (SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS, CHLA-255), and primary patient-derived NB cell lines (COG-N-415, COG-N-269, COG-N-357), in contrast to control fibroblasts. Additionally, MI-503 significantly inhibits NB 3D spheroidal tumor growth and live cell counts compared to control treatments. Further, flow cytometry analysis revealed that MI-503 specifically induces apoptosis and blocks cell cycle progression at the S phase in the NB CSCs (CD114+ cells) in comparison to non-CSCs (CD114- cells) that leads to significant inhibition of overall NB CSC levels in different NB cell lines. By inhibiting the COMPASS complex, MI-503 significantly inhibits H3K4me3 levels as determined by the histone immunoblot assays. This leads to the inhibition of multiple cancer stemness-related genes expression such as OCT4, Nanog, HOXA, AF9, and MEIS1. Further, we determined the efficacy of MI-503 in NB xenograft mouse models and found that MI-503 significantly inhibits overall NB tumor growth (12.3 fold; p&#60;0.001) and tumor burden (10.2 fold; p&#60;0.01) by directly inhibiting tumor NB CSCs (p&#60;0.01). We have not observed any drug-treatment-related toxicities or gender bias. Overall, our study highlights a novel epigenetic-based therapeutic approach for high-risk NB and underlines the role of epigenetic regulators in maintaining the NB CSCs and NB growth. In our future efforts, we will develop concomitant therapeutic approaches by combining MI-503 with current chemotherapies to target both NB CSCs and bulk tumor cells. This will lead to the development of effective, targeted, and clinically tractable therapies for NB patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Pediatric cancers,Cancer stem cell,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Rameswari Chilamakuri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Saurabh Agarwal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

In fusion positive (FP) RMS, <i>FGFR4 <\/i>overexpression is driven by the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion oncogene. In fusion negative (FN) RMS, <i>FGFR4 <\/i>is often overexpressed and mutationally activated in 7.5% of patients. CRISPR knockout experiments have shown that many RMS cell lines are dependent on FGFR4 for survival. Thus, targeting FGFR4 with a small molecule inhibitor is a promising approach to treat RMS. Futibatinib, a highly selective, irreversible FGFR1-4 inhibitor that was recently granted FDA approval for cholangiocarcinoma, may be effective in treating RMS. Single agent small molecule therapy with kinase inhibitors commonly leads to acquired resistance through compensatory signaling pathways. We hypothesized that inhibition of FGFR4 would lead to suppression of negative feedback loops, resulting in activation of oncogenic kinase pathways. Furthermore, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of FGFR4 and one of these upregulated kinases would be synergistic in delaying or reversing RMS progression.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Cell viability assay was used to determine the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of futibatinib in RMS cell lines in which <i>FGFR4 <\/i>is mutationally activated (RMS559, FN RMS) or overexpressed (RH4, FP RMS). A high throughput kinome activity assay was used to discover kinases that were activated in RMS cells treated with futibatinib. A drug matrix screen combining futibatinib with 144 drugs was used to discover synergistic combinations. Incucyte live cell imaging was used to validate the synergy of the inhibitor combinations. Western blot was used to confirm the activity of the kinase inhibitors.

Western blot showed that futibatinib inhibited FGFR4 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner. The kinome activity assay found that futibatinib treatment resulted in SFK, AKT, and IGF1R activation. Drug matrix screening in RMS559 found that futibatinib was synergistic with SFK, IGF1R, and AKT inhibitors at cell killing. Incucyte confluence measurements confirmed the synergy of futibatinib with SFK, IGF1R, or AKT inhibitors in both RMS559 and RH4.

The KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation (single amino acid substitution of cysteine for glycine at position 12) accounts for ~14% of lung cancer, ~4% of colorectal cancer, and ~2% of pancreatic cancer. Currently, two covalent KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors, namely sotorasib (AMG-510) and adagrasib (MRTX-849), have been approved as monotherapy to treat locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation through accelerated approval process. Despite the beneficial effects of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors in clinic for certain patients, the limited antitumor efficacy in most patients and potential drug resistance are major concerns. A next-generation inhibitor with better inhibitory activity may improve anti-tumor efficacy. Combination with other therapeutic agents may also improve the single-agent activity of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors.

Four selective FGFR inhibitors have been approved (erdafitinib, pemigatinib, infigratinib, and futibatinib) and several others are in clinical development. Unfortunately upon treatment with these first-generation FGFR inhibitors, acquired resistance often develops and is frequently associated with the emergence of secondary FGFR2\/3 kinase domain mutations. Therefore, selectively targeting FGFR2\/3 as well as their resistant mutations may render a second-generation treatment approach for the refractory\/relapsed patients. Using advanced computation-aided structural analysis and medicinal chemistry design, we have discovered a novel, next-generation, and highly selective FGFR inhibitor, ABSK121. This novel inhibitor demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity in FGFR-dependent tumor models with strong activities against not only <i>de novo<\/i> but also acquired resistant mutations.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: ABSK121 was evaluated in biochemical and cellular proliferation experiments for its inhibition on wile type FGFR enzymatic activity and FGFR-dependent cancer cell proliferation. Its potency against FGFR mutations was also analyzed in relevant biochemical and cellular experiments. Efficacy studies were conducted in multiple tumor models to confirm its in vivo activities. Preliminary selectivity profile and ADME profiles were also evaluated.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: ABSK121 inhibited wild type FGFRs with IC50&#60;10 nM in biochemical assay. ABSK121 also displayed great potency against resistant kinase domain mutations. In cell lines harboring FGFR amplification, fusions, or resistant mutations, ABSK121 demonstrated strong anti-proliferation activity as well as strong inhibition of FGFR downstream signaling activities. In preclinical <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, oral administration of ABSK121 strongly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous xenograft tumors dependent on wild type or resistant mutant FGFR. Suppression of tumor growth was dose-dependent and well correlated with pharmacodynamic inhibition of FGFR signaling. ABSK121 also showed great kinase selectivity with no CYP or hERG inhibition.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: ABSK121, presented here by Abbisko Therapeutics, is a highly potent, selective, and next-generation small molecule FGFR inhibitor with great potency against resistant FGFR mutations.

Sumoylation is an essential pathway for all cells and is involved in diverse processes such as inflammation, DNA damage response, signaling and cell survival\/apoptosis. Due to its involvement in such cellular functions, sumoylation intersects with the majority of the hallmarks of cancer. Many cancers display elevated expression of SUMO pathway components, a mechanism co-opted by tumors to survive under stressful conditions. In addition to its tumor intrinsic functions, sumoylation has emerged as a novel target for activating anti-tumor immunity due to its role in regulating type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Targeting sumoylation is a compelling anti-cancer strategy due to the multiple mechanisms of action that may drive anti-tumor activity for cancer patients. We report the discovery of SB-4826, a novel, orally active, covalent small molecule inhibitor of the Sumo Activating Enzyme (SUMO E1), the initiating enzyme of the sumoylation cascade. SB-4826 selectively and irreversibly binds an allosteric pocket of SUMO E1 and drives potent biochemical and cellular activity. SB-4826 inhibits global sumoylation in cells and blocks proliferation across a broad panel (100+) of cancer cell lines. Cysteine-proteome profiling by mass spectrometry indicated that Cys-30 of SUMO E1 was the only cysteine-containing peptide (out of 14,541 measured) that met the criteria for covalent engagement indicating exquisite selectivity across the cellular proteome. In an in vivo pharmacodynamic model measuring IFN signaling SB-4826 treatment led to dose- and time-dependent induction of IFN regulated cytokines. SB-4826 treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in multiple in vivo models. In a syngeneic A20 lymphoma model SB-4826 led to tumor stasis. In a human RAJI xenograft model, SB-4826 induced near-complete inhibition of tumor growth as a single agent and resulted in tumor regression when combined with rituximab. In a mouse CT-26 colorectal tumor model which is generally refractory to anti-PD-1 treatment, SB-4826 significantly inhibited tumor growth as monotherapy and led to 60% complete tumor responses when combined with anti-PD-1. SB-4826 caused increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in CT-26 tumors supporting the role of SB-4826 in inducing IFN signaling and leading to a tumor microenvironment that is more responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition. SUMO E1 is a clinically validated cancer target as evidenced by recent data showing encouraging responses to TAK-981, an IV-administered, ATP-competitive inhibitor. SB-4826 is a differentiated and optimized SUMO E1 inhibitor that is administered orally and demonstrated improved activity in preclinical models. SB-4826 has favorable properties for development, is a new and promising cancer therapy, and is entering phase 1 clinical studies in 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sumoylation,Interferons,Small molecule inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jude R.

Current advanced pharmacological agents which aim at inhibiting YAP-TEAD oncogenic function do so by engaging into the lipid pocket of TEAD. Thereby the consequences of a direct pharmacological disruption of the interface of YAP and TEADs remain unexplored. Here we report the identification of IAG933, the first molecule able to potently and directly disrupt the YAP\/TAZ-TEADs PPI with suitable properties to enter in clinical trial. The path to drug discovery was established by structure-based optimization of a truncated natural YAP peptide allowing the pharmacophore mapping of TEAD coil binding site. Based on <i>in silico<\/i> screening, validated hit was optimized using structure- and property-based lead optimization yielding IAG933, whose chemical structure will be for the first time disclosed here. Biochemical and cellular assays demonstrate that IAG933 specifically abrogates the interaction between YAP\/TAZ coactivators and all four TEAD isoforms, thus selectively inhibiting TEAD-driven transcriptional activity and inducing anti-cancer effects. At the epigenome level, YAP eviction from chromatin was observed upon treatment with IAG933, while leaving TEADs genomic occupancy unaffected. Concomitantly, engagement of co-repressor VGLL4 translated to a decrease in enhancer activity with rapid and progressive changes in transcription of Hippo target genes. In preclinical experiments, IAG933 linear pharmacokinetics was consistent with dose proportional TEAD transcriptional inhibition and anti-tumor efficacy in xenograft and primary-tumor derived malignant pleural mesothelioma models. Daily treatment with IAG933 elicited complete tumor regression in the MSTO-211H xenograft model at well-tolerated doses. In line with the current clinical strategy for IAG933, robust anti-tumor efficacy in cancer models bearing NF2 loss of function or expressing TAZ-fusions was observed. Moreover, we provide evidence for combination benefits of IAG933 with several MAPK\/KRAS inhibitors, both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, in non-Hippo altered models including lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Overall, our results provide a rationale of progressing IAG933 as a monotherapy in patients with Hippo-mutated cancers, and as a combination partner in MAPK-dependent cancers, with the potential to treat patient populations of high unmet medical need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP\/TAZ,Transcription factor,Drug discovery,Mesothelioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tobias Schmelzle<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilie Chapeau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Bauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Chene<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Faris<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cesar Fernandez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pascal Furet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgio Galli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiachang Gong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Harlfinger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Hofmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eloisa Jimenez Nunez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joerg Kallen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thanos Mourikis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurent Sansregret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paulo Santos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clemens Scheufler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Holger Sellner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Voegtle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Wartmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Wessels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederic Zecri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Soldermann<\/i><\/presenter>.

Until recently, KRAS was regarded as undruggable, but newly approved covalent inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> have demonstrated clinical benefit in patients harboring this mutation. However, patients with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation only represent approximately 10% of the <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutated or amplified cancer population, and multiple RAS-mediated resistance mechanisms have emerged with these covalent compounds.<br \/>Here we show that QTX3034 is a potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable mutant KRAS inhibitor. Using the most common KRAS mutant, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, QTX3034 demonstrated picomolar binding affinity (0.6 nM) to the inactive form of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and inhibited SOS1\/2 mediated nucleotide exchange with picomolar potency (0.2 nM). In a NanoBiT cellular target engagement assay, QTX3034 treatment disrupted KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>:RAF1 protein-protein interaction in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 17 nM in HEK293T cells. Western blot analyses and CTG proliferation assays illustrated that QTX3034 treatment inhibited downstream ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation in <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i>-driven cancer cell lines. Similar inhibitory effects were observed across <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> and <i>KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup><\/i> mutant cancer cell lines, albeit less potent against the latter. Notably, QTX3034 produced no effect against <i>NRAS<\/i> or <i>BRAF<\/i> mutant cells.<br \/><i>In vivo<\/i>, QTX3034 achieved sustained systemic exposure levels required for efficacy following single oral administration in mice, indicating potential durable inhibition of KRAS signaling <i>in vivo<\/i>.

While recently approved covalent KRAS inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefit in lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and other solid tumors, the requirement for the cysteine mutant limits potential applications to the approximately 10% subset of <i>KRAS<\/i> patients bearing a <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> mutation. As the most prevalent <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation, <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i>&#8211;driven malignancies represent a high unmet need, attracting immense attention in drug discovery. However, direct KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibitors described in the literature to date lack oral bioavailability.<br \/>Here we show that QTX3046 is a potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable non-covalent KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibitor. QTX3046 demonstrated picomolar binding affinity (0.01 nM) to the inactive form of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> by SPR, &#62; 400-fold affinity over the inactive KRAS<sup>WT <\/sup>protein, and inhibited SOS1\/2-mediated nucleotide exchange with picomolar potency (0.1 nM). QTX3046 also displayed nanomolar binding affinity to the GppNHp-bound &#8220;ON&#8221;-state of KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>by SPR. Allosteric activity of QTX3046 selectively disrupted KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>:RAF1 protein-protein interaction in a concentration-dependent manner using both biochemical and cell-based (NanoBiT) target engagement assays, while showing weak or no activity against KRAS<sup>WT<\/sup> and other KRAS mutants. Western blot analyses and CTG proliferation assays illustrated that QTX3046 treatment inhibited downstream ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation selectively in <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i>-driven cancer cell lines. KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> selectivity was further confirmed in panels of isogenic SW48 human colorectal cancer and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines harboring various single <i>RAS<\/i> mutations.<br \/>QTX3046 achieved sustained systemic exposure levels required for efficacy following single oral administration in mice, indicating potential durable inhibition of KRAS signaling <i>in vivo<\/i>. In a <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i>-driven xenograft model, oral administration of QTX3046 twice daily (BID) achieved tumor regression in 100% of tumors and was well-tolerated. The physiochemical profile for QTX3046 is generally favorable with good solubility. The systemic clearance in rats and dogs was high to moderate, respectively and despite low apparent permeability, demonstrated good oral bioavailability in each species. The current PK profile and preclinical proof-of-concept data support advancement of QTX3046 into IND enabling studies to support potential clinical investigation in <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i>-driven solid tumor indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Inhibitors,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth Donohue Vo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yang W.

Poor survival is frequently due to advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, as well as the high prevalence of KRAS driver mutations. Currently, approved KRAS-targeted therapeutics are designed to covalently inactivate only KRAS-G12C mutants, whereas the most common mutations in PDA are KRAS-G12D, KRAS-G12V, and KRAS-G12R. Thus, the need for novel RAS-targeted therapeutics with efficacy in tumors with these more common mutations is of utmost urgency to reduce PDA disease burden. We have synthesized a novel chemical class of pan-RAS inhibitors with unique biological properties and attractive drug-like properties. As a prodrug, ADT-1004, generates an active metabolite, ADT-007, that potently inhibits the growth of human and murine PDA cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> with single-digit nM IC<sub>50<\/sub> irrespective of specific RAS mutational codon or isozyme by inhibiting activated RAS and signaling downstream of KRAS (ERK1\/2 and AKT phosphorylation). ADT-1004 is well tolerated with no discernable toxicity at oral dosages of up to 175 mg\/kg bid. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that ADT-1004 produces sustained plasma concentrations of ADT-007 ~50-fold above IC<sub>50<\/sub> values, with even higher concentrations in both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumors. Once daily oral administration of ADT-1004 significantly inhibited the growth of orthotopically implanted PDA tumors with a corresponding reduction in RAS\/MAPK signaling. ADT-1004 represents a 1st-in-class pan-RAS inhibitor with potential advantages over mutant-specific KRAS inhibitors for greater efficacy and ability to avert mechanisms of resistance. These data support future clinical trials of ADT-1004 as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with PDA regardless of the underlying mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Inhibitors,Pancreatic cancer,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yulia Y.

As part of the adaptive immune response, checkpoint inhibitors (CIs) have shown promise in the clinic, but seem to only work in a small subset of cancers with response rates below 20%. It is anticipated that activation of the innate immune response may help sensitize multiple cancer types to adaptive immune therapies. cGAS-STING pathway, which is activated in response to cytosolic DNA, has emerged as a key mechanism to activate innate immunity, primarily through type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Several direct STING agonists have been developed but their performance in the clinic has been dissatisfactory. A key limitation with direct STING agonists is the widespread expression of STING in normal tissues, whereby the hyperactivation of STING can lead to a systemic cytokine storm. Thus, there is a need to identify alternative approaches to activate STING in a controlled manner. ENPP1 is the only known direct negative regulator of the STING pathway that hydrolyzes 2&#8242;3&#8242; cGAMP, the direct ligand of STING. Highest levels of 2&#8242;3&#8242; cGAMP are found in tumors and recent evidence suggests that 2&#8242;3&#8242; cGAMP acts locally, as a paracrine immune transmitter. Therefore, inhibition of ENPP1 may produce superior outcomes by activating STING in the tumor microenvironment. Previously, we reported the development of SR-8541A, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of ENPP1 that activates the STING pathway. Here, we show that the inhibition of ENPP1 with SR-8541A enhances the effect of CIs in breast and colon cancer models.<br \/>Methods: Immune infiltration assays were conducted using human breast cancer cell line derived organoids (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468). Co-cultures of cancer organoids and immune cells (PBMCs) were exposed to SR-8541A +\/- CIs (CTLA-4 and\/or PD-1) for 48 hours. Confocal Z-Stack imaging, RT-PCR, and MSD cytokine assays were performed to evaluate the effects. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies were conducted using syngeneic mouse models (CT-26 and EMT-6), which were engrafted subcutaneously and treated with SR-8541A +\/- CIs. Tumor growth was monitored over the course of the study. IHC and RT-PCR were conducted on the tumors.<br \/>Results: Combination of SR-8541A with CIs showed a significant increase in immune infiltration in both the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 organoid models. Corresponding RT-PCR analysis showed activation of IFN signaling (IFN-&#223;, CXCL10, ISG15). <i>In vivo<\/i> combination with CIs also exhibited a significant increase in overall efficacy, along with increased levels of CD3+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumors, and increased levels of IFN response.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, we show that combination of ENPP1 inhibition with checkpoint inhibition promotes a robust antitumor activity by stimulating both innate and adaptive immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Combination therapy,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexis S.

Inhibition of the kinase activity of HPK1 results in the activation of exhausted T cell in tumor microenvironment and enhanced anti-tumor immune response. Observation of HPK1 overexpression in various tumor tissues further indicates the kinase as a novel target for immuno-oncology therapy. Here we report BB3008 as a small molecular HPK1 inhibitor.<br \/>Methods: BB3008 was developed through structure-based drug design, and optimized by SAR analysis and medicinal chemistry iteration. Biochemical assays and cell-base functional assays were applied in compound evaluation. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary toxicity studies were performed with mice and dogs. Syngeneic tumor models in mice were conducted to demonstrate the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of BB3008 as a single agent and in combination with mouse PD-1 antibody.<br \/>Results: BB3008 shows sub-nanomolar HPK1 potency, with good selectivity against kinases in the MAP4K family and other TCR signaling-related kinases, such as FYN and ZAP70. Inhibition of HPK1 by BB3008 strongly suppresses the phosphorylation at Ser376 of the downstream biomarker protein SLP-76, with IC50 at 30 nM. With the stimulation of CD3\/CD28, boost of IL-2 production was observed in Jurkat cells, purified human T cells, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon treatment of BB3008 at sub-micromolar concentration. BB3008 also enhanced the killing activity of T cell against EL4 lymphoma cell <i>in vitro<\/i> in a concentration-dependent manner. PK profile of BB3008 showed good bioavailability (&#62;80%) with a nearly linear dose-dependent exposure. The compound had no significant suppression on various normal cell lines proliferation, and had no hERG liability. In preliminary safety evaluation, no abnormal clinical symptoms and serum\/blood tests were observed in mice and dogs dosed up to 1000mpk and 150mpk for 14 days, respectively. BB3008 showed significant tumor-growth inhibition rates in CT26, Hepa 1-6 and 4T1 mouse models as single agent, and in MC-38 mouse model in combination with mouse PD-1 antibody.<br \/>Conclusion: As a potent, selective and oral available small molecule HPK1 inhibitor, BB3008 shows good safety tolerance in preclinical animals, and promising efficacy in multiple solid tumor models, both as single agent or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade.

Patients affected by the disease develop vestibular schwannomas (VS), meningiomas, and ependymomas resulting in high morbidity and premature mortality. To date, neurofibromatosis type 2 has no FDA-approved drug-based treatment. Merlin plays a central role in mediating cell contact inhibition (CI) of proliferation. Loss of Merlin leads to abnormal activation of multiple signaling pathways, including those regulated by small G-proteins Ras\/Rac\/cdc42 and the Hippo-YAP pathway. The Hippo-YAP pathway plays a major role in cell growth and organ size control and at its core is comprised of a kinase cascade that regulates the transcriptional regulator YAP. The function of YAP is crucial for VS development, and there are several mechanisms by which YAP regulates transcription. Some of these functions have been shown to involve the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) proteins acting as co-factors. We have previously shown that the BET inhibitor JQ1 can selectively reduce the growth of the <i>NF2<\/i>-null schwannoma and Schwann cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumorigenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Additionally, evidence has shown that Merlin loss can lead to increased cell proliferation that it requires the activity of Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 (FAK1). We have previously demonstrated that FAK1 inhibition via Crizotinib has antiproliferative effects in NF2-null Schwann cells, and is currently in phase II clinical trials in NF2-related VS. In this study, wild-type and NF2-null Schwann cells and schwannoma cell lines were used to determine the impact on cell growth by employing the treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 and the FAK1 inhibitor Crizotinib. Our analysis in NF2-null Schwann cells and schwannoma cell lines shows that the combined inhibition exerts an antineoplastic effect at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, this combination resulted in selective inhibition of NF2-null Schwann cell proliferation when compared to wild-type Schwann cells in vitro, when compared to either drug alone. Our preliminary data suggest that combined targeting of BET and FAK1 may offer a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of NF2-related schwannomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,BET inhibitor,Combination therapy,Crizotinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Alejandra Gonzalez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Kissil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Troutman<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although several EGFR Exon20 inhibitors have reached clinical stage or received approval, there still leave large room for improvement in safety and efficacy, likely due to their limited selectivity against wild-type EGFR or other kinases, suboptimal mutation coverage, and lack brain penetrating ability. Herein, we have discovered a novel and next-generation EGFR Exon20 mutation inhibitor, ABSK112. It showed high selectivity over wild-type EGFR and other kinases, as well as a more comprehensive coverage over majority of EGFR Exon20 mutations in comparison with other EGFR Exon20 inhibitors.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: Anti-proliferation experiments in cell lines harboring various EGFR Exon20 mutations were used to evaluate potency and spectrum of coverage for ABSK112 and other inhibitors. Efficacy studies and PK\/PD study in multiple tumor models confirmed its <i>in vivo<\/i> activities. Cell proliferation and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacies studies in models harboring mutated or wild type EGFR were used to demonstrate its selectivity. Kinome selectivity, safety profiles, PK and ADME profiles were also characterized.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: ABSK112 showed potent inhibition of proliferation in multiple EGFR Exon20 mutation cell lines and superior wild-type EGFR selectivity compare to other inhibitors including mobocertinib (TAK788). In xenograft mouse models with various EGFR Exon20 mutations, oral dose of ABSK112 showed strong and dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy. Moreover, ABSK112 exhibited much reduced <i>in vivo<\/i> inhibition against xenograft tumors with wild-type EGFR, compared to mobocertinib, confirming its superior selectivity. PK\/PD analysis showed good correlation between ABSK112 exposure and inhibition of EGFR signaling. ABSK112 also demonstrated excellent preclinical brain penetration, bioavailability, and safety profile.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: ABSK112 is a novel and next-generation EGFR Exon20 mutation inhibitor with improved selectivity over wild-type EGFR and strong brain penetrating ability.

However, the observed responses only lasted a few months before tumors relapse. Acquired FGFR4 resistant mutations were found in ~30% of FGFR4 inhibitor responsive patients. Similar FGFR4 mutations haven also been found <i>de novo<\/i> in about 7-10% of Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and ER-treated invasive lobular carcinoma patients. First generation FGFR4 inhibitors have minimal activity against these <i>de novo<\/i> or acquired resistant mutations. Therefore, next-generation of FGFR4 inhibitors are needed to overcome these resistant FGFR4 mutations to provide better treatment options for patients. Using advanced computation-aided structural analysis and medicinal chemistry design, we have discovered a next-generation small molecule FGFR4 inhibitor, ABSK012, and demonstrated its strong activities against <i>de novo<\/i> and acquired resistant FGFR4 mutations while retaining inhibition for wild-type FGFR4.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: Inhibitory activity of ABSK012 against FGFR4 and FGFR4 mutants was evaluated by MSA assay and its inhibition on FGFR4-dependent cell proliferation was evaluated by Celltiter-Glo assay in wile type FGFR4-dependent cancer cell lines or mutant FGFR4-dependent Ba\/f3 cell lines. Its selectivity against other FGFR family member and kinases was analyzed by cellular and KinomeScan profiling. Efficacy studies were conducted in HCC xenograft models and mutant FGFR4-dependent xenograft models including a RMS PDX model harboring FGFR4 V550L mutation.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: ABSK012 demonstrated strong potency over multiple FGFR4 mutants that are insensitive to a first generation FGFR4 inhibitor BLU-554. It also inhibited wild-type FGFR4 with IC50&#60;5 nM in biochemical assay and exhibited great selectivity against other kinases. In multiple mutant and wild-type FGFR4-dependent cell lines, ABSK012 demonstrated significantly improved anti-proliferation activity. In preclinical <i>in vivo<\/i> studies in HCC models, oral administration of ABSK012 strongly inhibited the tumor growth at doses without obvious toxicities. More importantly, in a RMS PDX xenograft harboring FGFR4 V550L mutation, ABSK012 also showed significant anti-tumor activity.

Surgery combined with multimodal chemotherapy remains as the standard treatment for osteosarcoma patients. However, patients with osteosarcoma metastasis have a five-year survival rate of less than 30%, and their long-term outcomes have not improved over the last 30 years. CSF-1\/CSF-1R signaling is crucial for the survival, function, proliferation and differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, including osteoclasts and monocytes\/macrophages. Targeting CSF-1R either on tumor cells or tumor-associated macrophages has been reported to limit osteosarcoma progression in preclinical models. ABSK021, an oral, highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of CSF-1R discovered by Abbisko, has entered into Phase I trial (NCT04192344) and showed significant anti-tumor activity and favorable safety profile in patients with advanced tenosynovial giant cell tumor. Here, we conducted a series of preclinical<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments, as well as human osteosarcoma profiling, to investigate the treatment potential of ABSK021 for osteosarcoma patients.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Cellular potency of ABSK021 was evaluated by Celltiter-Glo assay in osteosarcoma cell lines and CSF-1R expression was evaluated by western blot. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies were conducted in murine osteosarcoma models and pharmacodynamics changes were measured. CSF-1R IHC staining was conducted in tissue microarray samples from osteosarcoma patients.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: ABSK021 potently inhibited the proliferation of K7M2, a murine osteosarcoma cell line with high expression of CSF-1R. In animal, ABSK021 showed strong anti-tumor activity on K7M2 syngeneic model and SA4094 osteosarcoma PDX model without causing significant body weight loss. Pharmacodynamics analysis displayed robust inhibition of macrophage infiltration and CSF-1R signaling by ABSK021, confirming its effective target engagement <i>in vivo<\/i>. Parallel IHC analysis of human tissue microarray samples revealed high prevalence of positive CSF-1R staining in osteosarcoma patients.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Taken together, these results demonstrate that ABSK021 has strong inhibition of CSF-1R activity and corresponding anti-tumor activity in preclinical osteosarcoma models.
