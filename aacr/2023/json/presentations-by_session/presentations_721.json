This staggering discrepancy is partly because most pancreatic cancers evade early detection and patients most commonly present with metastatic disease. As cancer initiates from a single transformed cell, passenger mutations that accumulate over the course of the patient&#8217;s lifetime in that cell are then clonally propagated to the growing tumor and metastases, providing a targetable molecular signature throughout the cancer. Here we propose a CRISPR-Cas9 gene therapy aimed at these tumor-specific somatic mutations. Using whole genome sequencing of rapid autopsy tumor and normal samples from five patient cases, we identified single base substitutions present in tumor tissues and absent in patient-matched normal tissue. A subset (6.6% on average) of these mutations lead to novel protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites. These tumor specific PAM sites are necessary for Cas9 binding and DNA scission and are therefore selectively targetable by CRISPR-Cas9 systems. Using a hybrid capture\/NGS approach, we demonstrate in patients with multiple metastases that the majority of these novel PAM sites, ~70%, are maintained among the different metastases. Using multitarget sgRNA which cut at a known number of sites in the human genome, we determined a relationship between number of CRISPR-Cas9 cuts and growth inhibition in PDAC cells. We found that 8-10 cut sites in non-coding regions are sufficient to induce &#62;95% cancer cell death. Finally, using cocultures of fluorescently labeled PDAC cells and a multiplexed sgRNA array targeting multiple tumor specific PAMs, we demonstrate selective cell killing of the targeted cell line. Importantly, deep sequencing of patient-matched normal lymphocytes lacking the tumor-specific PAMs treated with the same sgRNA array exhibited no editing at the targeted loci. This work establishes a bioinformatic platform for the discovery of tumor-specific CRISPR targets in the context of metastatic disease and demonstrates selective killing to cancer cells while sparing the patient&#8217;s normal cells. These data establish the proof of principle for a gene therapy approach targeting metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 Gene therapy and radiation studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,CRISPR\/Cas9,Gene therapy,DNA double-strand break,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kirsten Bowland<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Selina Shiqing K.

However, most precision oncology approaches rely on molecular profiling which, unfortunately, provides therapeutic options for less than 10% of cancer patients. Functional precision medicine (FPM) complements molecular profiling by combining it with rapid, high-throughput drug testing on live patient cells to identify promising treatment options. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of FPM in the management of pediatric patients with recurrent and\/or refractory cancers. We enrolled 25 pediatric\/young adult patients with refractory solid or liquid cancers in this clinical trial (number NCT03860376). Enrolled patients represented the breadth of cancer indications generally presenting in pediatric patients: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3 patients), acute myeloid leukemia (3 patients), astrocytoma (1 patient), ependymoma (1 patient), Ewing&#8217;s sarcoma (4 patients), glioblastoma (1 patient), malignant rhabdoid tumor (1 patient), medulloblastoma (1 patient), neuroblastoma (1 patient), osteosarcoma (4 patients), rhabdomyosarcoma (4 patients) and Wilms&#8217; tumor (1 patient). We used a functional <i>ex vivo <\/i>drug sensitivity test (DST) panel encompassing 40 formulary drugs frequently used at Nicklaus Children&#8217;s Hospital and 47 non-formulary drugs approved by FDA for cancer treatment, as well as drugs from phase III and IV clinical trials. Drug sensitivity scores (DSS) were calculated for each drug based on cancer cells&#8217; responses. DST results were then combined with results from targeted mutation profiles to match actionable mutations with selective targeted therapies. FPM and molecular data were prospectively generated and treatment recommendations were provided to an FPM Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) of clinicians. In total, 19 of 25 patients (76%) had complete functional and molecular profiling data provided to the MTB to support clinical decision-making. Six patients had their subsequent treatment guided by FPM recommendations, of which 83% (five of six patients) demonstrated greater than 1.3x increased progression-free survival compared to their previous therapy. Interestingly, hierarchical clustering analysis of DST results shows that patients with the same subtype of cancer do not cluster together, and no cancer subtype is differentially represented in either high-level cluster, suggesting the importance of functional profiling to provide deeper insight into individual patient pharmacological response. This FPM study is the first pediatric cancer study to enroll both solid and hematologic cancers regardless of tumor type, and the first FPM study in the United States to generate prospective treatment data on pediatric oncology patients. We illustrate the feasibility and efficacy of FPM to meet the needs of cancer patients with both liquid and solid tumors, especially for high-risk populations such as pediatric cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Precision medicine,Molecular profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Arlet Maria Acanda de la Rocha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie Fader<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ebony R.

We have previously identified a population of lymph node resident memory T cells (LN T<sub>RM<\/sub>) that are critical for protection against melanoma growth in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN). However, the precursor population that gives rise to these cells, and mechanisms supporting their generation are not understood. Here we sought to define the features of tumor-specific T cells that govern their fate as T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells in TDLNs. We employed our previously described model wherein depletion of CD4+ T cells induces the generation of protective melanoma Ag-specific T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells throughout skin and LNs of B16 tumor-excised mice. To map the fate of T<sub>RM<\/sub> precursor cells (pre-T<sub>RM<\/sub>), we implemented paired scTCR\/RNA sequencing of antigen-experienced (CD44+ CD8+) T cells from surgically harvested TDLNs of individual mice and identified clonotypes that matched to differentiated T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells in LNs and skin of the same mice 30 days later. Additionally, we tracked gp100-specific CD8+ transgenic T cells (pmel cells)<i> in vivo<\/i> to define requirements for LN T<sub>RM<\/sub> generation. Clonal tracing revealed that expanded clonotypes in TDLNs differentiated into T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells in LNs and skin of tumor-excised mice. Interestingly, there were no apparent differences in the transcriptional properties of pre-T<sub>RM<\/sub> clonotypes (in early TDLNs) that acquired a T<sub>RM<\/sub> fate in the skin versus the LN. These pre-T<sub>RM<\/sub> clonotypes in TDLNs clustered into three major subsets, one of which appeared terminally differentiated with high expression of cell cycle genes, and two of which had high expression of genes associated with memory (<i>Il7r, Tcf7, Slamf6<\/i>) and tissue residency (<i>Cd69, <\/i><i>Itgae<\/i><i>, Cxcr6, Cxcr3<\/i>). One of the two memory-like precursor clusters additionally expressed high levels of interferon responsive genes (<i>Isg15, Isg20, Ifit1, Ifi47<\/i>). Experiments involving pmel cell adoptive transfer and FTY720 treatment showed that pre-T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells seeded LNs early, underscoring the existence of a committed T<sub>RM<\/sub> precursor population. Based on the pronounced IFN-sensing signature in pre-T<sub>RM<\/sub> clonotypes, we sought to define a role for IFN in T<sub>RM<\/sub> formation. Using Mx-1-GFP reporter pmel cells, we found that type-1 IFN sensing reached peak levels in TDLNs during tumor growth. To test whether type-1 IFN sensing was required for T<sub>RM<\/sub> generation, responses were assessed in IFNAR1 KO mice and additionally in mice that received wild-type vs. IFNAR1 KO pmel T cells. Interestingly, in both cases the absence of IFNAR1 resulted in a reduction in T<sub>RM<\/sub> generation TDLNs but not in skin. Overall, these results reveal the features of tumor-specific pre-T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells in TDLNs, and demonstrate that early type 1 IFN sensing dictates tissue-specific T<sub>RM<\/sub> fate decisions, predisposing to T<sub>RM<\/sub> generation in LNs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Interferons,Melanoma\/skin cancers,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nikhil Khatwani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksey Molodtsov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cameron Messier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jichang Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tyler Glenn Searles<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron R Hawkes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fred W Kolling IV<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mary Jo Turk<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite their prevalence, the impact of OD-mutant p53 proteins in cancer, especially beyond a loss of canonical p53 activity, has not been well elucidated. We sought to delineate the gain-of-function (GOF) vs. loss-of-function (LOF) activities of OD-mutant p53, specifically focusing on the LFS tumor-derived p53(A347D) variant. We obtained LFS patient-derived dermal fibroblasts heterozygous for the mutation and generated an allelic series of U2OS cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53, heterozygous (p53<sup>+\/AD<\/sup>) or homozygous (p53<sup>AD\/AD<\/sup>) mutant p53 or no p53 (p53 KO). In contrast to wild-type p53, mutant p53(A347D) exclusively forms dimers in both fibroblasts and cancer cells and has lost the ability to bind and transactivate the majority of canonical p53 target genes, which yields comparable tumorigenic properties between mutant p53 and p53 KO cells. Mutant p53(A347D), however, displays neomorphic activities. Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways are enriched in cells bearing p53(A347D) relative to both wild-type p53 and p53 KO cells. Furthermore, dimeric mutant p53 induces striking mitochondrial network aberration and preferentially associates with mitochondria to drive apoptotic cell death upon topoisomerase II inhibition in the absence of transcription. Ultimately, we describe dimeric mutant p53 as wielding a double-edged sword: driving tumorigenesis through LOF while gaining enhanced apoptogenic activity, thereby providing a potential basis for select therapeutic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,Mitochondria,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joshua H.

Validation was done using an independent technology and population (totaling 317 cases and 483 control) and complemented with pan-tissue methylation-stability (n=5,023 tissues; 30 types) and methylation-expression (n=2,294 tissues; 26 types) analyses.

Differential methylation was found to be associated with a change in gene expression and with worse pre-B ALL patient survival, supporting a functional and translational role for differential methylation.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our results provide proof-of-concept to detect at birth epigenetic alterations predisposing to childhood leukemia, reproducible in three continents and two ethnicities.

In addition, how well iPSC-derived cells resemble their primary counterparts is currently largely unknown. We developed a reprogramming method tailored to human malignancies, &#8220;Complete Capture of Mutational Burden&#8221; (CCoMB), that combines comprehensive genetic characterization of the starting sample and inference of its clonal architecture with large-scale screening of clonally reprogrammed colonies. Using this method we were able to generate a panel of iPSC lines representing all major genetic groups of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Specifically, we derived iPSC lines from 15 patients representing all major genetic groups of AML - PML-RARA; chromatin-spliceosome; TP53-mutated\/aneuploidy; AML1-ETO, MLL-rearranged; NPM1-mutated and others - collectively capturing 21 distinct genotypes and 24 driver genetic lesions (mutations, translocations, deletions). Matched normal iPSCs were derived from 7 of these patients. Reprogramming to iPSCs captured both preleukemic (CH\/initiating mutation only) and fully leukemic clones (baring the full set of patient mutations). In almost all cases, reprogramming informed reconstruction of the evolutionary hierarchy of the AML, with unexpected hierarchies unveiled in 4 of the cases. These AML-iPSCs retain genetic fidelity and, upon in vitro hematopoietic differentiation, produce hematopoietic cells with hallmark phenotypic leukemic features, including serial engraftment of a lethal myeloid leukemia into immunocompromised mice and extended self-renewal in vitro. Transplantation of cells derived from iPSCs representing two distinct AML clones from each of 3 patients revealed that these mimic the clonal dynamics in the patients, with more advanced clones showing increased representation in the xenografts, compared to the earlier clones. To compare the iPSC-derived to the primary leukemias, we performed single-cell transcriptomics analyses in patient-matched iPSC-derived and primary leukemic cells from 3 patients, both ex vivo\/in vitro and after transplantation into NSGS mice. Clustering analyses identified cell types corresponding to primitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)\/ multipotent progenitor (MPP), hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and more mature myelomonocytic lineage cells in all samples from all patients, at varying frequencies. Leukemias derived through in vitro differentiation from iPSC lines exhibited both similarities, as well as differences, in their cellular composition and transcriptome, compared to the patient-matched ex vivo leukemias. However, upon transplantation of the same leukemias into NSGS mice, iPSC-derived xenografts were strikingly similar to the patient-derived xenografts. iPSC-derived leukemic cells exhibited a more stem\/progenitor cell phenotype in vitro, with progressive maturation along the myeloid lineage upon primary and, even more, upon secondary transplantation, mimicking primary xenografts. In summary, our results reveal very few true biological barriers to the reprogramming of AML cells and show that AML-iPSC-derived leukemias faithfully mimic the primary patient leukemias upon xenotransplantation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-06 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Modeling,Xenografts,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Andriana Kotini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saul Carcamo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nataly Cruz-Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malgorzata Olszewska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Hasson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Eirini Papapetrou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Currently, no model is available to provide a genotype to phenotype correlations for the heterogeneity. We developed the HNSCC spheroids from single cell that showed hyperproliferation\/hypomigration or hypoproliferation\/hypermigration properties, and performed transcriptome and proteomics approach to identify the underlaying mechanisms.<br \/>Materials and methods: Two cells\/well from HNSCC cell line UMSCC-22B were cultured in ultra-low attachment plate to develop spheroids, which were identified for their functionality by monitoring growth and cell migration. Hyperproliferative\/hypomigratory or hypoproliferative\/hypermigratory spheroids were pooled to perform single cell transcriptome. sSpheroid were used for proteomic analysis.<br \/>Results: Single cell analysis showed four distinct clusters of cells in hyperproliferative\/ hypomigratory spheroids and six clusters in hypoproliferative\/hypermigratory spheroids. Each cluster showed specific gene expression signature enriching a specific pathways. The hyperproliferative\/hypomigratory spheroids clusters showed enrichment of cell cycle, anti-apoptosis, and pro-survival genes associated with EGFR, Wnt and Notch signalling pathways. Whereas hypoproliferative\/hypermigratory spheroids cluster showed enrichment of TGF-beta, VEGF, and wound healing related pathways. Cell ontology tracing with gene signatures revealed the dominance of neoplastic cells with enrichment of EGFR, MAP Kinase, Wnt signalling pathways in the hyperproliferative\/hypomigratory spheroids. The fibroblast cell cluster showed expression of stem cell markers and enrichment of ERK and EGFR related pathways. Bayesians and non-bayesians network analyses identified the surface proteins, ITGA6, Met, CD63, ICAM, and Kit as unique driver genes for hyperproliferative\/hypomigratory spheroids whereas ITGB3, CD44, and EGFR were the driver genes for hypoproliferative\/hypermigratory spheroids. Proteomic analysis also conformed the enrichment of antiapoptosis and cell survival related pathways in hyperproliferative\/hypomigratory spheroids. While epithelial cell differentiation to keratinized cells and wound healing pathways were enriched in hypoproliferative\/hypermigratory spheroids. TCGA data shows correlation with our analysis for survival\/stage\/ progression of the disease.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results suggest that single cell-derived clonal spheroid represents the genetic heterogeneity of cell population and correlates with functionality of the spheroids. These spheroids can be used as tools and the identification of cell clusters in head and neck cancer patients can be used for deciding the optimal therapeutics as well as to predict the progression of the cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Tumor heterogeneity,Transcriptomics,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jyoti Pandey<sup>1<\/sup>, Md Jubbair Malik<sup>1<\/sup>, Ritis  K.
