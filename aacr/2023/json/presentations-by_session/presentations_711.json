[{"Abstract":"Immune checkpoint control is one of several mechanisms that negatively influence the immune system and contribute to the development and progression of cancer. To enhance anti-tumor immune responses in patients with advanced solid tumors, we employ a novel autologous cancer cell therapy, APN401, which allows transient and highly specific silencing of Casitas B-lineage lymphoma-b (Cbl-b) in patients&#8217; peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cbl-b is an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that plays a central role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we present two patients with advanced, metastatic solid tumors: one patient diagnosed with appendix carcinoma, and one patient diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Both showed stable disease (SD) during treatment with APN401.<br \/>In an open-label, multicenter Phase Ib trial, two increasing dose levels of APN401 were evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors. Using invIOs&#8217;s closed cell-processing platform - Enhancement Platform for immune Cells (EPiC) - patients&#8217; PBMCs were purified from leukapheresis products and subsequently transfected with a small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) to specifically block Cbl-b expression. The entire manufacturing process required less than six hours, and the drug product could be reinfused on the same day. The trial evaluated safety and clinical outcomes, as well as the activity and potency of the drug product. Additionally, various biomarkers were analyzed in patients&#8217; peripheral blood, which was collected prior to each treatment cycle. Two patients, one with appendix carcinoma and one with HNSCC, showed stable disease after repeated APN401 treatments at the lowest and\/or intermediate dose levels. Subsequent drug product analyses revealed increased IL-2 levels and elevated CD8\/CD4 ratios, suggesting potential cytotoxic efficacy. In stimulation assays with HLA class I-restricted viral or tumor antigens, increased IFN-&#947; levels were detected and served as surrogate markers for improved immunity and tumor reactivity. 10X genomics and TCR clonotyping revealed clonal expansion of T cell subsets throughout the course of the treatment. Taken together, these initial results indicate that APN401, a novel personalized cancer cell therapy based on targeted silencing of Cbl-b in PBMCs, may be a safe and effective immunotherapy for solid tumors. This cell therapy will be further evaluated as a monotherapy along with potential combinations in clinical trials in various solid tumors.<br \/>Ethics approval: The clinical trial was approved by the Medical University of Vienna institution&#8217;s independent Ethics Committee, approval number 1778\/2020.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immuno-oncology,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mario Kuttke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Dohnal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Tanzmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beate Pribitzer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Batrina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Bunka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Spagl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuela Branka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Bischof<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathrin Thell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Urban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannes Muehleisen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernhard Peball<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bianca Gapp<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Halfmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Raderer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerald Prager<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thorsten Fuereder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Romana Gugenberger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nina Worel<\/i><\/presenter>. invIOs, Vienna, Austria, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, University Hospital Vienna, Vienna, Austria","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bb9d2567-144f-4728-87ed-7083b9292718","ControlNumber":"9626","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

However, greater than 50% MM achieve refractory or relapse (r\/r) within five-year due to MM target heterogeneity and bone marrow tumor microenvironment (TME). The approved B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) -directed CAR T therapies have shown unprecedented efficacy in advanced r\/r MM, yet relapse remains to occur. The shedded soluble BCMA, target escape and bone marrow TME may contribute to the r\/r MM mechanism through compromising clinical efficacy and durability. TACI and BCMA are co-expressed on the tumors of ~78% MM patients, and therefore, dual targeted TACI\/BCMA CAR therapy could be an attractive strategy in addressing challenges of BCMA mono-CAR therapy. We have developed EPC-004, a fully human anti-TACI and BCMA bispecific armored tandem CAR, aiming to overcome BCMA target escape mechanism, reduce immunosuppression within the bone marrow tumor microenvironment, and be more persistent with engineered armor and the improved cell manufacturing process.<br \/>Methods: Fully human anti-TACI, anti-BCMA and anti-PDL1 scFv antibodies with a broad affinity range and epitope coverage have been discovered by proprietary mRNADis<sup>TM<\/sup> mRNA display and live cell selection platform. The T cell modulatory activity fine-tuned IL2 was discovered by the mSCAFold<sup>TM<\/sup> technology through the structure guided mutagenic library design and high throughput systemic screening. The anti-PDL1 scFv was then fused to the engineered IL2 to generate an armor molecule to enhance CAR activities and persistence. Finally, EPC-004, an optimal bispecific tandem TACI\/BCMA armored CAR candidate, was developed by precision engineering of multiple pairs of anti-TACI and BCMA scFvs with monospecific and bispecific target binding properties, spacers and scFv orientation.<br \/>Results: EPC-004 demonstrated both mono-specific and bispecific TACI and BCMA target cell engagement and effective cytotoxic cancer cell killing activities. EPC-004 showed potent anti-tumor activity in MM1R, BCMA knock out or TACI knock out MM1R -luciferase orthotopic animal models, which validated the mechanism of EPC-004 in overcoming BCMA or TACI target escape resistance. Furthermore, EPC-004 showed strong persistent CAR-T activity against tumor cells in re-challenging models in mice. Importantly, the secreted armor molecule selectively activates central memory T cells and contributed to the enhanced anti-tumor activity and persistence <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusion: EPC-004, engineered with multi-modules and multi-mechanisms is a promising candidate which enhances anti-tumor activity, prevents target escape, reduces immunosuppression within the bone marrow tumor microenvironment. These novel mechanisms could potentially translate EPC-004 into durable clinical efficacy in treating R\/R multiple myeloma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,BCMA\/TACI Dual target,PD-L1\/IL2 Armor,Multiple myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Garima Agrahari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenle Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katie O'Callaghan Katie O'Callaghan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keming Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ning Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyi Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryan Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenna Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam Hassan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annie Luu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tony Ruan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kehao Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Chen<\/i><\/presenter>.

The reasons for ICI resistance are multi-faceted and suggest that additional immunomodulation is required to improve outcomes. MTL-CEBPA is a novel immunotherapy based on RNA activation that upregulates expression of a master myeloid transcription factor, CEBPA. The small activating RNA for CEBPA is encapsulated within a NOV340 liposome that targets the myeloid cell lineage. MTL-CEBPA has shown favorable safety and promising clinical activity in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Sorafenib) in hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT-02716012) [Hashimoto et al, CCR 2021; Sarker et al, CCR 2020]. We recently reported preliminary clinical data from the ongoing multi-center phase 1 TIMEPOINT study (NCT-04105335) evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunomodulation, and clinical activity of MTL-CEBPA in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors who have exhausted standard therapy. This demonstrated a favorable safety profile and initial clinical activity [Plummer et al, JITC 2021]. Here we report the findings from a biomarker pharmacodynamic analysis of paired baseline and cycle 2 tumor sample biopsies in 23 patients from the TIMEPOINT trial. Brightplex&#174; IHC and digital pathology analyses of the samples for myeloid and T cell panels were undertaken, alongside gene expression (Nanostring I\/O 360). Prior to study treatment, nine patients out of 23 had an immune cold tumor microenvironment (TME) at baseline as measured by the Immunosign&#174;21 score. Following the combination of MTL-CEBPA with pembrolizumab, seven of these patients converted to an inflamed TME by Immunosign&#174;21 (<i>P<\/i>=0.008). This change in the TME was associated with infiltration of CD8 and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+, GrzB+, Ki-67+) (<i>P<\/i>=0.1). GSEA analysis indicated that a Tstem-like signature was enriched post-treatment. A Brightplex&#174; IHC analysis of myeloid cells in these patients indicated that, post treatment, there was a significant influx of HLA-DR+ myeloid cells into the TME (<i>P<\/i>=0.04). We also observed a significant increase in the expression of CXCL9, 10, and 11.The remaining 14 patients had an inflamed TME at baseline. Here, we also observed an increase in HLA-DR+ cells, T cells, and chemokines, though to a lesser extent. Further, however, in these inflamed tumors&#8212;which have significantly greater infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) than desert tumors&#8212;we observed a reduction in 8\/10 patients with detectable PMN-MDSCs (<i>P<\/i>=0.1) post treatment, consistent with the mechanism of action of CEBPA. An expression signature based on 18 genes significantly enriched for clinical response across all patients. Collectively, these data suggest a positive immunomodulatory TME effect of the combination of MTL-CEBPA with pembrolizumab. In both hot and cold TME tumors, the combination drives directed differentiation of progenitor monocytes into HLA-DR+ myeloid cells secreting chemokines that stimulate the ingress of T cells into the TME. We observe a significant positive correlation between the change in cytotoxic T cells and HLA-DR+ myeloid cells post treatment (<i>P<\/i>=0.004). These effects are most pronounced in cold tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immunomodulation,Immunotherapy,C\/EBP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ruth Plummer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mikael Sodergren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brid Ryan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilian Tchakov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nina Raulf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rose Hodgson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>CP Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanna P.

It is expressed on activated CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, and on the surface of B cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells (DC). It has also been found to be highly expressed on activated T cells upon treatment with monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway, which may explain the resistance mechanism of monotherapy. Several anti-LAG-3 antibodies are being examined in clinical trials to treat different types of cancers. Despite their specificity and affinity, antibody-based checkpoint inhibitors are hampered by poor tumor permeability and high production costs. In this study, we aimed to discover a small peptide-based anti-LAG-3 inhibitor using a novel biopanning technique developed in our laboratory. We discovered several anti-LAG-3 inhibitor peptides, and the CMA16 peptide showed the highest stability and blocking efficacy. The peptides were synthesized by the solid-phase peptide synthesis using PurePep<sup>TM<\/sup> Chorus synthesizer (Gyros Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ). The molecular weights and purity were confirmed by mass spectrometry and HPLC, respectively. To evaluate the function of the CMA16 peptide, a series of <i>in vitro<\/i> functional assays including binding ELISA, serum stability and cell viability assays were performed. <i>In vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity of the peptides was examined in five-week-old C57BL\/6 mice bearing MC38 cells. CMA16 significantly inhibited the growth of MC38 tumors. Quantification of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> tumor-infiltrating cells revealed a significant increase in this type of immune cells in the group of mice treated with CMA16. These findings support the further development of the CMA16 peptide as potential anti-LAG-3 inhibitor for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peptides,Immunotherapy,Cancer immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohammed Alahmari<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Umar-Farouk Mamani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuhan Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chien-Yu Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammed Nurudeen Ibrahim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongren Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kun Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>.

Analysis of 64,097 immune cells from seven HGSOC omental metastases showed that positive effects of NACT on immune responses were counterbalanced by induction of immunosuppressive mechanisms, especially related to antigen presentation and Treg activity. We identified stabilin-1 (Clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs as targets and validated actions of their inhibitors in vitro. ScRNA-seq analysis of 69,781 cells from chemotherapy-treated syngeneic mouse HGSOC tumors showed significant agreement with the patient results. Combinations of chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and\/or FOXP3 inhibitor (AZD8701), FOXP3i, significantly increased median survival of mice with established peritoneal disease. Long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from treated murine tumors confirmed our hypothesis and suggested potential mechanisms to explain the anti-tumor response seen in the murine models. Tumors treated with chemotherapy plus anti-stabilin1 antibody showed significant enrichment of anti-tumor macrophage signature and antigen presentation pathway compared to chemotherapy alone. Tumors treated with chemotherapy plus FOXP3i in combination with anti-stabilin1 antibody showed significant upregulation of antigen presentation, T cell activation and cytotoxicity and T helper 1 differentiation pathways. There was significant reduction in FOXP3 positive cells and significant increase of Tbet positive cells in FOXP3i treated murine tumors suggesting repolarization of naive T cells in the tumor microenvironment towards a more anti-tumor T helper phenotype. As there are early phase clinical trials of FOXP3 inhibitor and anti-stabilin1 (Clever-1) antibody in patients with advanced cancer, these results suggest ways of improving response to chemotherapy not only in HGSOC but in other cancers that are treated by NACT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samar Elorbany<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Berlato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Larissa Carnevalli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleni Maniati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Barry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ranjit Manchanda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Kzhyshkowska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frances Balkwill<\/i><\/presenter>.

NOUS&#8211;PEV is a personalized viral prime&#8211;boost cancer vaccine that expresses 60 patient&#8211;specific neoantigens identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and selected with a proprietary algorithm VENUS <i>(Leoni &#38; D&#8217;Alise et al, Vaccines, 9, 2021<\/i>). Administration is intramuscular, with a priming Great Ape Adenovirus (GAd) vaccination, followed by Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) &#8220;boosts&#8221;, administered in combination with the PD&#8211;1 blocking antibody pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma and non&#8211;small cell lung cancer. Data from the Part 1 dose&#8211;confirmation cohort of 3 patients demonstrated the combination of NOUS&#8211;PEV and pembrolizumab to be safe and well&#8211;tolerated, with early indications of efficacy and immunogenicity (Bechter, et al SITC 2022 Poster number: 706). Now in Part 2 extension&#8211;expansion cohorts, we present extended safety, immunogenicity and clinical data at 11 months median follow&#8211;up for 6 vaccinated melanoma patients. Tolerability remains good with no grade 3 or 4 vaccine related adverse events and activity encouraging, with 4 PRs, 1 SD and only 1 PD as best response. Immune responses were evaluated by <i>ex&#8211;vivo<\/i> interferon&#8211;gamma ELISpot on PBMC collected at baseline, post pembrolizumab, and post vaccination. Vaccine immunogenicity was demonstrated in all evaluable patients receiving the prime\/boost regimen (n=4), with a mean of T cell response of ~ 650 IFN&#8211;&#947; spot forming cells (SFC) per million of PBMC (range 380&#8211;1,250 SFC\/10<sup>6<\/sup>) and with observed induction of both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses which lasted for at least 6 months. By analyzing<b> <\/b>the intratumoral TCR repertoire, we found increase of T cells by ~3 fold on average post treatment with NOUS&#8211;PEV in all evaluable patients (n=3), with expansion and diversification of intratumoral T cell clones. Vaccine&#8211;induced TCR clonotypes were found in on&#8211;treatment tumor biopsies of 2 vaccinated patients, providing the proof&#8211;of&#8211;concept for neoantigen induced T cells homing and infiltrating into the tumor. Overall, these data show that NOUS&#8211;PEV continues to be safe, and elicits a robust long lasting immune response and clinical activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Immunotherapy,Immune response,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Oliver Bechter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Morena D'Alise<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guido Leoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriella Cotugno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Loredana Siani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosa Vitale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentino Ruzza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irene Garzia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Antonucci<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Micarelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sven Gogov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessia Capone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Martin-Liberal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emiliano Calvo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victor Moreno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Symeonides<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Elisa Scarselli<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Vaccination against mutant KRAS (mKRAS) is thus a promising approach as an off-the-shelf immunotherapeutic treatment for PDAC. We developed a mKRAS peptide vaccine targeting 6 common KRAS mutations (G12V, G12A, G12C, G12R, G12D, or G13D (NCT04117087). We evaluated the mKRAS specific T cell response induced by vaccination in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with resected PDAC.<br \/>Materials and Methods: This is an ongoing pilot study of a pooled mKRAS long peptide vaccine in combination with ICIs in patients with resected PDAC and mutations in one of 6 KRAS mutations in our vaccine. Patients with no evidence of disease on imaging within 6 months of completion of adjuvant chemotherapy were vaccinated with the mKRAS vaccine (0.3mg\/peptide and 0.5mg poly-ICLC (Hiltonol: Oncovir)) weekly for 4 doses followed by booster vaccines every 8 weeks. Patients also received ipilimumab (1mg\/kg, every 6 weeks for 2 doses) and nivolumab (3mg\/kg, every 3 weeks in the priming phase) followed by nivolumab (480mg, flat dose in boost phase). To evaluate the expansion of mKRAS-specific T cells in the periphery, pre- and post-vaccination peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were restimulated with control or individual mKRAS peptides and assessed for IFN&#947; release by ELISPOT. To further phenotype the responding CD4 and CD8 T cell compartments, peptide-restimulated PBMCs were evaluated for T cell activation, proliferation, memory and exhaustion marker expression by CyTOF. Paired single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing are being performed to isolate mKRAS-specific TCRs and their corresponding transcriptional profiles. These TCRs are being functionally validated in vitro using CRISPR-Cas12a-based genome knock-in of human T cells.<br \/>Results: At the time of data cut off (1\/12\/2023) 8\/11 patients enrolled had a positive mKRAS-specific T cell response in post-vaccine sample timepoints defined by a &#62;5 fold increase in IFN&#947; producing T cells after peptide restimulation. CyTOF analysis of peptide-restimulated PBMCs demonstrated expansion of polyfunctional (IFN&#947;+IL2+TNF&#945;+) mKRAS-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells with both central and effector memory phenotypes after vaccination. mKRAS-specific CD4 T cells were induced at a greater proportion. Our single-cell analysis has identified and validated a novel CD4+ TCR that recognizes KRAS G12V in the context of HLA-DRB1*07:01.<br \/>Conclusions: This study thus far indicates the induction of <i>de novo<\/i>, high quality mKRAS-specific T cells in the periphery post-vaccine. Ongoing studies will define TCR diversity and clonality of mKRAS-specific T cells to each mKRAS epitope. Overall, our data will be used to identify peripheral T cell-based biomarkers that may be able to predict response to mKRAS-targeted immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Peptides,Combination therapy,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda L.

The recommended dose (RD) of SAR44100 in combination with cemiplimab was further investigated to confirm the anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic melanoma who had previously exhausted all standard of care options and failed treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies. Serum samples and tumor biopsies were collected at baseline and post-treatment to characterize the PK\/PD profile, and immune cell tumor infiltration.

Vaccines delivering tumor-specific neoantigens have demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety results in numerous preclinical and early clinical studies. However, selecting therapeutically relevant neoantigens amongst the myriad of cancer mutations has proven challenging. To overcome this, we have developed a proprietary AI-based target discovery platform, PIONEER, with enhanced predictive performance and increased precision. The PIONEER top-ranked neoantigens were selected and included in the personalized DNA vaccine candidate EVX-02. To assess the ability of the PIONEER designed neoantigen vaccine candidate to induce neoantigen immunogenicity and anti-tumor effect in preclinical models, mice were immunized with a mouse surrogate EVX-02 molecule, mEVX-02. mEVX-02 vaccination completely prevented establishment of tumors and induced neoantigen-specific, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood and spleen of immunized mice. An enhanced antitumor effect was obtained when combining mEVX-02 with anti-PD-1 mAb treatment. Encouraged by the preclinical results, we conducted a first-in-human multicenter Phase I clinical study of EVX-02 in combination with nivolumab in patients with resected malignant melanoma. The objectives of the trial were to investigate safety and tolerability, operational and clinical feasibility, and immunogenicity of the applied personal neoantigens. Each patient received a fully personalized drug that was produced in a complex process, from biopsy, through genome sequencing, AI-profiling, vaccine design, manufacturing, quality testing, and drug product release. This was succeeded with every single step for each patient.<i><\/i> In all patients, EVX-02 treatment was well tolerated, and only very mild adverse events (AEs) have been observed in relation to immunization with EVX-02. Interim data demonstrated neoantigen-specific T-cell immune responses upon EVX-02 treatment and that the responses were mediated by activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The measured T-cell responses were robust and long lasting. Together, these findings validate the precision and predictive power of our proprietary AI platform, PIONEER, and provide proof of mechanism for the DNA-delivery technology in that the encoded neoantigens gave rise to significant immune reactions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA vaccine,Neoantigens,Personalized medicine,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniela Kleine-Kohlbrecher<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadia Viborg Petersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michail Angelos Pavlidis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Trolle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stine Friis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jens Kringelum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anders Bundgaard Soerensen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Strandet Jepsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camilla Højgaard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anders Jespersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik D.

These cells have been characterized in mice, but, despite their importance, circulating counterparts in humans have not yet been identified for study. We hypothesized that immunotherapy designed to enhance immunogenic antigen-presentation during chemotherapy might produce extensive reactivation of these precursor T cells. While the antigen-presentation step occurs in tissues, homing of the rejuvenated T cells to the tumor is via the circulation; thus, we hypothesized that they would be visible in blood. Informative patients were selected from two ongoing clinical trials of children with brain tumors treated with the IDO-inhibitor drug indoximod: a Phase 2 trial (NCT04049669) of indoximod plus chemotherapy; and a Phase 1 trial (NCT05106296) of indoximod, chemotherapy and the BTK-inhibitor ibrutinib, which synergistically destabilizes IDO (<i>Immunity<\/i> 54:2354-2371, 2021). Patient selection criteria included either (i) massive clonal expansion of activated CD8+ T cells on therapy (expanded clones reaching 16-25% of total CD8+ T cells); or (ii) complete radiographic tumor response (CR) on treatment; or (iii) both. Longitudinal blood samples (4-10 samples per patient) were obtained over a period of 6-24 months and analyzed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) with paired single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq). TCR clonotypes of interest were identified based on robust clonal expansion on-treatment; then each clonotype was traced back through earlier samples to the pre-treatment baseline, or the earliest sample in which that clone could be detected. Clones were pooled, subjected to UMAP clustering, and differential gene-expression and trajectory analysis performed. At earliest appearance, each clonotype was enriched for a phenotype dominated by early transcription factors <i>TCF7<\/i> and <i>IKZF2<\/i> (Helios). These cells expressed little <i>PDCD1<\/i> (PD&#8209;1) but showed a &#8220;hybrid&#8221; combination of genes associated with immaturity\/arrest (<i>BACH2, DUSP2, LTB, IL7R, CD160<\/i>) and effector\/memory (<i>NKG7, GZMK, GZMA<\/i>). Within each responding clone, this &#8220;precursor&#8221; phenotype could be observed to progressively transition into a mature cytotoxic\/effector phenotype (<i>PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, FGFBP2, KLRB1, IFNG<\/i>). Trajectory analysis of this maturation sequence allowed us to analyze key gene-regulatory networks and transcription factor profiles at each stage. To our knowledge, this is the first study in humans to identify this key stem-like precursor population in circulation, allowing us to sequentially follow the molecular changes in these cells during rejuvenation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IDO,Immunotherapy,T cell,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Theodore S.

Currently, various strategies are being investigated to sensitize MSS-CRC tumors by converting them to immunologically &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors and improve responsiveness to immunotherapy. In this study, we demonstrate a novel strategy of combining a repurposed FDA-approved compound, Pimavanserin tartrate (PVT), with a <i>Listeria monocytogenes <\/i>(Lm)-based vaccine targeting Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15(ISG15), Lm-LLO-ISG15, against MSS-CRC tumors. Our findings demonstrate that both agents synergize to produce CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-dependent therapeutic efficacy in immunotherapy-resistant MSS-CRC tumors.<br \/>Methods: The direct killing effect of PVT <i>in vitro<\/i> was confirmed by cytotoxic SRB assay. BALB\/c mice bearing CT26, a murine model of MSS-CRC, were randomly assigned to receive either PBS, PVT, Lm-LLO-ISG15, or PVT+Lm-LLO-ISG15. Mice were monitored for tumor growth kinetics to study the anti-cancer effect of each monotherapy and the combination therapy. Changes in immune-related gene and protein expression were analyzed by qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Various immune cell subsets in the tumors and spleens were evaluated by multi-color flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In addition, organs such as the liver, kidney, heart, lungs, spleen, brain, and pancreas were collected for safety analysis.<br \/>Results: PVT efficiently induced apoptosis and directly killed both human and mouse MSS-CRC cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>. Further, PVT treatment enhanced T-cell activation and induced ISG15 expression, thus, sensitizing the tumor cells to targeting by the CTL-mediated immunotherapy, Lm-LLO-ISG15. While each monotherapy failed to demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy, treatment with the combination therapy (PVT + Lm-LLO-ISG15) significantly controlled tumor burden and extended the median survival. The therapeutic efficacy of the combination approach was associated with a higher infiltration of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the TME and an increased population of effector memory T cells (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>CD44<sup>hi<\/sup>CD62L<sup>lo<\/sup>) in the spleen. The anti-tumor efficacy of combination therapy on subcutaneous CT26 tumor growth was completely abrogated after the depletion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Moreover, the safety profile of dual therapy was comparable to that of each monotherapy and PBS.<br \/>Conclusions: MSS-CRCs are considered &#8220;immunologically cold&#8221; tumors that represent great challenges for any standalone therapies. In this study, we evaluated, for the first time, the therapeutic efficacy of a novel combination of PVT and Lm-LLO-ISG15 in an aggressive MSS-CRC mouse model. Combination therapy demonstrated a synergistic effect that led to a significant reduction of tumor burden and an extension of median survival. While the underlying mechanism for synergism requires further examination, our findings strongly suggest that combining PVT and Lm-LLO-ISG15 could be a promising approach for MSS-CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Colorectal cancer,Vaccines,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shreyas Ramchandra Gaikwad<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong My Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjay K.

Here we provide the detailed cellular atlases of mouse mammary fat pad and tumor at single-cell resolution in lean and obese mice. By leveraging scRNA-seq, we found that high-fat feeding causes a marked increase of macrophage in adipose tissue. &#65279;Interestingly, a subset of macrophages expressing high levels of C1q complex genes is accumulated in obese subjects. We found that glucocorticoid may as a key regulator of C1q<sup>+<\/sup> macrophage identity. Synthetic glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone, triggers C1q expression in macrophages. We found that C1q<sup>+<\/sup> macrophage derived C1q complex could suppress CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell response, thus fueling breast cancer progression. In mouse TNBC tumor, we uncovered a specific inflammatory responsive tumor subset in obese tumors with high CCR2 ligand expression. Obesity-induced TNF&#945; exposure triggers of breast cancer cells reprogramming and CCR2 ligand production. Consequently, CCR2 ligands promote macrophage into tumor. Moreover, depletion of macrophages by anti-CSF1R suppresses tumor growth in obese mice. Our findings define a novel fundamental mechanism of C1q+ macrophage involved in anti-tumor response in obesity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Macrophages,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tao Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shimeng Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Myles Brown<\/i><\/presenter>.

Melanoma is often responsive to therapy when present in peripheral tissue, but becomes recalcitrant when sequestered beyond the BBB. An estimated 40-60% of metastatic melanoma patients will develop a brain lesion, even while receiving treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the gold standard in intervention for metastatic brain melanoma (MBM), often given with anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). While this therapy is initially effective, resistance occurs rapidly and ~50% of patients will develop new brain lesions within a year. Treatments at this stage are limited, necessitating the discovery of new therapies. Recent studies have shown that myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) is activated in melanoma in tumor-associated myeloid cells where chronic myddosome signaling results in defective immunological responses. We have found that myddosome signaling is also prevalent in MBM, likely protecting brain metastases against effector immune detection. We recently identified that CA-4948, a small molecule inhibitor of interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-4) and rate-limiting step in the myddosome cascade, can reach therapeutic levels in the brain and demonstrates on-target inhibition in preclinical models of MBM. These data highlight a unique therapeutic opportunity where selective inhibition of pro-tumorigenic cells in the MBM tumor microenvironment (TME) via targeted IRAK-4 inhibition may recondition the immunological landscape of these tumors, sensitizing these difficult-to-treat tumors to immunotherapy.<br \/>Hypothesis: Selective inhibition of pro-tumorigenic cells via targeted inhibition of IRAK-4 with CA-4948 will recondition the immunological landscape of MBM, improving anti-tumor response to anti-PD-1 ICB.<br \/>Methods: Patient MBM samples were assessed by IHC to define the distribution of myddosome signaling. Preclinical syngeneic MBM tumor models were treated with CA-4948 alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 ICB. Tumors were examined by flow cytometry and IHC to characterize the composition of the immune TME and evaluate the distribution of T lymphocytes. Overall survival was compared between control, single agent, and combination treated animals.<br \/>Results: Tumor-associated immune cells and astrocytes comprise the majority of active myddosome signaling in patient MBM. Preclinical models corroborate these findings, with targeted inhibition of IRAK-4 through CA-4948 treatment effective at reducing activation and validating anti-tumor activity in the CNS. Analysis of treated tumors reveal decreased expression of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), and increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes. Combination CA-4948 with anti-PD-1 ICB resulted in reduced tumor growth, and improved survival over single agent therapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Therapeutic inhibition of IRAK-4 in MBM mitigates immune suppression mediated by tumor-associated cells, allowing for improved immune surveillance and tumor infiltration by effector T lymphocytes, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor activity. Thus, CA-4948 may be an effective treatment alongside anti-PD-1 ICB for patients with MBM. <b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Brain tumors,Metastasis,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christina A.

Current treatments achieve high rates of initial success through surgery and adjuvant chemo\/radiotherapy, but patients (pts) remain at high risk of relapse in both indications. Immune stimulation using a vaccine is a promising strategy to a clinically meaningful improvement. Herein we report phase I data of TG4050, a vaccine engineered to carry a pt tailored antigen payload, in pts with HNSCC (NCT04183166) or OC (NCT03839524).<br \/>Methods: Tumor specific variants are identified using next generation sequencing of tumor and normal samples whereby immune relevant mutations are predicted using a machine learning algorithm factoring in parameters known to affect immunogenicity including MHC binding, level of expression, prevalence across clones, and antigen processing. DNA sequences of the mutations of interest, typically 30 per pt, are cloned in a viral vector (Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara). Following curative intent treatment, HNSCC pts in complete remission were randomized to an immediate vaccination arm to receive weekly doses of TG4050 for 6 weeks followed by a maintenance period of one dose every 3 weeks for up to 20 doses or to a delayed vaccination arm where the same vaccination regimen is initiated at relapse. OC pts received the vaccine upon onset of signs of relapse. PBMC were collected at Baseline and after 6 doses of vaccine. Primary endpoint was vaccine safety and secondary endpoints included feasibility, immunogenicity.<br \/>Results: 18 pts received TG4050 (5 OC and 13 HNSCC) treatment with no related grade &#8805; 3 adverse events. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was on average 3.00&#177;0.98 and 2.43&#177;0.69 mutations per megabase for HNSCC and OC respectively. Despite this low TMB, all pts had sufficient cancer specific neoantigens to design a vaccine. Ex-vivo ELISPOT was completed for 7 pts at the time of submission. A mean of 44% of selected mutations were associated with a reactive T cell responses either spontaneously or after TG4050 stimulation ranging from 6 to 22 mutations per pt. Vaccination induced a stimulation of T cell response in all tested pts on an average of 10 targeted mutations, induction of <i>de novo<\/i> responses was seen in all 7 tested pts and amplification of pre-existing response in 6\/7 pts. None of the evaluable HNSCC pts receiving TG4050 immediately after first line treatment had relapse after a median follow-up of 7 months while 2 pts had relapse in the delayed vaccination arm. Furthermore, in OC pts treated at early relapse, TG4050 has normalized disease markers (ctDNA and\/or CA-125) for 2\/4 pts with stable disease for 9 and 11 months.<br \/>Conclusion: TG4050 treatment is feasible and immunogenic in pts with low to moderate TMB. It is effective in inducing T cell responses and first signs of antitumor activity are encouraging for the continuation of development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Cancer vaccine,Ovarian cancer,Head and neck cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ana Lalanne<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camille Jamet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian H.
