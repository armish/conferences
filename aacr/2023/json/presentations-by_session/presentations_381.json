[{"Abstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive, highly invasive tumor that has a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%, with median survival of approximately 15 months. Treatment options for patients with GBM are relatively unchanged over the past two decades. We present results from our early-stage GBM drug discovery program enabled by <i>Symphony<\/i>&#8482;, Aria Pharmaceutical&#8217;s artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Using patient-derived, unconnected multimodal data and a select chemical library of over 2 million characterized molecules as input, our AI platform built an interpretable <i>in silico<\/i> model of GBM disease biology and identified novel, high-value drug discovery hits with known pharmacological properties. Nine molecules with unique and novel MOAs (not clinically evaluated for GBM) were identified as drug discovery hits and evaluated in preclinical efficacy studies. Six out of the nine molecules showed anti-proliferative activity in 4 different GBM cell lines (U87MG, LN18, A172, and U118MG) (Table 1). The MOAs showing efficacy in this initial study were validated in a colony formation assay. Three target classes, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitor (MK8245 and MF-438), dual tyrosine-regulated kinase 3 (DYRK3) inhibitor (GSK626616), and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor (XL-888) potently inhibited colony formation in a 3D cell culture system. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that MF-438 had good metabolic stability and lower predicted clearance in human and mouse liver microsome assays. Further, MF-438 showed good exposure in plasma and brain extract (brain-to-plasma ratio of 2.2). SCD is a lipogenic enzyme that plays a key role in tumor lipid metabolism and membrane architecture and is often up-regulated in cancer. These studies demonstrate that the SCD1 inhibitor MF-438 can serve as a valuable tool compound that warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for GBM.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{1A6D1560-DF58-43FA-9089-C4145A8A5053}\"><caption>Table 1: Molecules assessed in GBM cell lines<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Molecule<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Mechanism of Action (MOA)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Proliferation Assay<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>3D Colony Formation Assay<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AS-605240<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), Dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK), and CDC like kinase (CLK1) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not tested (GSK626616 selected to investigate DYRK inhibition)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GSK626616<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) 3 inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not tested<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Anilinopyrimidine1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Aurora A kinase (AURKA) and Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Entospletinib<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not tested<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">T0901317<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Liver X receptor (LXR) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MK-8245<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MK-438<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not tested<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Nedocromil<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CYSLTR1) and 2 (CYSLTR2) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not tested<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DB07268<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PF-670462<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Casein kinase 1-e (CSNK1E) and 1-d (CSNK1D) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not tested<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">XL888<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Small molecule drugs,Drug discovery,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hyekyoung Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Aaron  C.

Although no soluble ligand for CDCP1 is known, CDCP1 transduces signals resulting in cancer cell motility, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and metastasis by activating downstream signaling via homodimerization or heterodimerization with other cell surface molecules such as EGFR, HER2, and ITGB1. Owing to its important roles in cancer, CDCP1 has been reported as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of solid cancers. While it is overexpressed in many of the abovementioned solid cancer types, several normal tissues such as esophagus, skin, and bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) also express CDCP1. To minimize the risk of toxicity, we generated novel anti-CDCP1 antibodies that bind weakly to bone marrow HSCs. Three isolated anti-CDCP1 monoclonal antibodies and their humanized versions showed weak binding to HSCs compared to other anti-CDCP1 antibodies reported from other groups. Although they only showed moderate binding activity to cancer cell lines, rapid internalization and efficient lysosomal trafficking was observed following CDCP1 binding. Subsequently, we generated antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) of the 3 anti-CDCP1 antibodies using PBD, MMAE, and MMAF as a cytotoxic payload with both a cleavable and non-cleavable linker. All constructed ADCs showed strong anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>. The cytotoxic activities of these ADCs were correlated to CDCP1 surface expression levels and internalization activity. The anti-CDCP1 ADCs showed strong anti-tumor efficacy in multiple cell line xenograft models. We selected the clone h14A043 for further evaluation owing to its observed potent anti-tumor activity both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We then constructed h14A043-ATAC (Antibody Targeted Amanitin Conjugate), which has a site-specifically conjugated amanitin derivative with DAR 2 and an Fc domain mutation that reduces the effector function of human IgG1. h14A043-ATAC showed good anti-tumor potency both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In human prostate cancer PC3 cell line xenograft model, we observed significant tumor growth delay following treatment by h14A043-ATAC with a single administration of 0.1 mg\/kg. Furthermore, we observed complete tumor remission in 3 out of 8 mice at 40 days after a single administration of 1 mg\/kg. In the non-GLP single dose toxicity study using cynomolgus monkeys, h14A043-ATAC showed good serum stability and no hematological toxicity. Our results suggest that ADC using an anti-CDCP1 mAb with weak binding to bone marrow HSC and sufficient internalization activity could provide a new treatment option for refractory solid cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shu-ichi Hashimoto<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Shiori Miyamoyo<sup><\/sup>, Aki Takaiwa<sup><\/sup>, Koji Nakamura<sup><\/sup>, Yukihito Tsukumo<sup><\/sup>, Yoshinori Yamashita<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Laboratories for drug discovery, Chiome Bioscience, Inc., Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cba40158-a213-466b-99d2-6d2e2fd829c2","ControlNumber":"432","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Macrophage plasticity and diversity allows classification along a M1-M2 polarization axis, where TAMs have a M2-like polarization, associated with a pro-tumoral phenotype, whereas M1 macrophages exhibit anti-tumor functions. Reprogramming TAMs to a M1-like anti-cancer phenotype is an increasingly coveted therapeutic strategy in oncology. Here, we report TAMs can be favorably reprogrammed by modulating <i>N<\/i>-myristoyltransferase (NMT) activity using on-target, drug-like inhibitors (NMTi). We identified &#62;100 <i>N<\/i>-myristoylated proteins differentially expressed by macrophages along the M1-M2 polarization axis. In TAM-like M2 macrophages, 42 <i>N<\/i>-myristoylated proteins exhibited higher NMTi sensitivity as compared to other polarizations, and these NMT substrates significantly enriched in anti-inflammatory, immunity- and metabolism-related pathways. Unique to TAM-like M2 macrophages, NMT modulation by NMTi induces significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes, effectively switching the polarization towards a M1-like anti-cancer phenotype that is characterized by a M1-like spindle morphology, a M1-like glycolytic state, and induction of a pro-inflammatory secretome exhibiting potent anti-tumoral activity towards ovarian cancer spheroids in vitro. In vivo proof-of-principle was established in the syngeneic, macrophage-driven ID8 mouse model for human ovarian cancer, where NMTi treatment significantly reprogrammed murine M2-like TAMs into a M1-like anti-cancer phenotype, concomitantly reducing tumor burden without observable side-effects, and significantly extending median survival by 16 days. We are currently further investigating the intricacies that <i>N<\/i>-myristoylation plays in macrophage polarization, as well as further establishing the scope of NMTi-driven in vivo reprogramming of TAMs beyond ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Ovarian cancer,Multiomics,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wouter  W.

Although ECa mostly affects older women, both the mortality and incidence rates are rapidly rising in women under the age of 40. Response rates and progression free survival are still low for recurrent ECa treatments such as hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies like Bevacizumab and Everolimus. There is an unmet need for the development of novel targeted therapeutics to support current ECa-directed treatments. The progression of many cancers, including ECa, is linked to proto-oncogenic PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1). In this investigation, we evaluated the efficacy of the PELP1 inhibitor, SMIP34, both alone and in combination with mTOR inhibitors in ECa.<br \/>Methods: Using 13 distinct ECa cells, the effect of SMIP34 alone and in conjunction with mTOR inhibitors was assessed using the cell viability and colony formation assays. Using flow cytometry and Annexin-V\/PI labeling, the ability of SMIP34 to promote apoptosis was evaluated. The effect of SMIP34 on cell cycle progression was evaluated using FACS analyses. RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and global RNA-seq were used for mechanistic studies. ECa patient-derived organoids (PDO), explants (PDEX) and xenograft model were used to assess the impact of SMIP34. TNM and Dependency Map (DepMap) databases were used to profile the status of PELP1 in ECa. The status of PELP1 in ECa tissues was analyzed using IHC analyses of ECa tumor tissue Microarrays.<br \/>Results: Analysis of TNM plots showed that PELP1 expression was higher in ECa than in normal endometrium. Data from DepMap confirmed that PELP1 is required for the survival and expansion of ECa cells. SMIP34 treatment of established and primary patient-derived ECa cells significantly reduced cell viability and colony formation with an IC50 of 2-10&#181;M. PELP1 knockdown significantly reduced the effect of SMIP34. Further, SMIP34 treatment induced apoptosis and promoted S-phase arrest in ECa cells. RNA-seq analyses showed that SMIP34 regulated genes positively correlated with p53 and apoptosis pathways, while negatively correlated with ribosome and eukaryotic translation elongation pathways. Western blot analyses confirmed that SMIP34 treatment reduced the levels of PELP1 and its complex of proteins including TEX10, LAS1L, SENP3. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that SMIP34 treatment attenuated the activation of mTOR signaling in ECa cells. Accordingly, SMIP34 enhanced the effect of mTOR inhibitors on ECa cells. SMIP34 is effective in reducing cell viability in PDO and limited the cells proliferation of PDEX. Importantly, SMIP34 treatment significantly reduced of the growth of ECa cell line-derived xenografts.<br \/>Conclusions: Collectively, our results suggest that SMIP34 inhibits ECa growth <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>in vivo<\/i>, and <i>ex vivo<\/i> and combination of SMIP34 with mTOR inhibitor represents a novel therapeutic strategy for ECa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncogene,Targeted therapy,PELP1,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xue Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zexuan Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Weiwei Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Uday  P.

The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast cancer. African American women experience up to 2-fold higher incidence of TNBC as compared to White women. Moreover, African Americans die from breast cancer at up to 40% higher rate than White and Hispanic women. However, there is no therapeutic options are currently available to reduce survival disparity in breast cancer. To address this unmet medical need, we develop novel computational methods combined with experimental chemical biology and high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies. Using our specially designed bioinformatics workflow, we discovered that high expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) strongly correlates with worsened clinical outcomes in African American TNBC patients. The analysis of TNBC patient genomic profiles revealed that MKK3 promotes TNBC in part by activating the major tumor driver transcription factor MYC. MYC is a highly appealing therapeutic target in TNBC, however, no approved MYC inhibitors are available. We found that MKK3 binds and activates MYC through protein-protein interaction (PPI) in TNBC cells. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the MKK3\/MYC complex suppresses MYC activity and the viability of TNBC cells. Thus, MKK3\/MYC interaction represents a novel vulnerability for therapeutic intervention in TNBC. By combining computational modeling with experimental HTS, we have discovered the first small molecule MKK3\/MYC PPI inhibitors. For example, a quinoline derivative SGI-1027 disrupts the MKK3\/MYC complex in cells and in vitro, inhibits MYC transcriptional activity, and suppresses the viability of TNBC cells.

Despite therapeutic advances in androgen receptor (AR)-targeting agents, progression to lethal, drug-resistant, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains a major clinical problem. Thus, there is an unmet need for novel treatment approaches and novel, druggable therapeutic targets in metastatic CRPC. Profiling of PC patient samples shows increases in two master regulators of lipogenesis-sterol regulatory binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP1 and SREBP2)-and their transcriptional targets. Overexpression of SREBP1 and SREBP2 and their target genes has been associated with tumor aggressiveness, poor clinical outcomes, and drug resistance<sup> <\/sup>in PC. The activation and nuclear translocation of SREBPs is tightly regulated by SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). We propose targeting SCAP will simultaneously block the activation and subsequent activity of all three SREBPs and that this represents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat CRPC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To increase our understanding of SREBP biology in PC cells, we defined the cistrome of SREBPs across multiple PC cell lines via ChIP-Seq. We compared the transcriptomic profiles of genetic targeting of SREBP via siRNA and pharmacological targeting via the novel SCAP inhibitor, SCAPi. We evaluated the effect of SCAPi on cell viability, cell invasion, and AR-signaling in multiple<i> <\/i>PC cell lines using immunoblotting, luciferase reporters, flow cytometry, MTT, and invasion assays. Additionally, we will evaluate the anticancer activity and safety profile of our novel SCAPi using CDX mouse models.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found that inhibition of SCAP via siRNA and via SCAPi both yielded similar gene signatures, particularly the perturbation of cell cycle and lipogenesis genes. SCAPi dramatically reduces cell viability, migration, invasion, and expression of both AR- and SREBP-target genes in multiple PC cell lines. Through flow cytometry (Annexin V) and western blots (cleaved PARP) we found SCAPi induces apoptosis within 48 hours in PC cells. Pilot studies in tumor-bearing mice show SCAPi significantly increases survival without inducing animal weight loss.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> There is a critical need for novel targets in PC, and dysregulated lipogenesis is an untargeted oncogenic pathway. Our work furthers the field&#8217;s understanding of hijacked lipogenesis in PC and paves the way for a first-in-class inhibitor of lipogenesis to treat lethal PC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Lipid metabolism,Gene regulation,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dallin Lowder<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jin Na Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria  E.

While it is commonly accepted that Warburg Effect promotes the growth, survival, proliferation, and long-term maintenance of cancers, its precise function and its downstream mediators remain unclear. A key physiological consequence of the Warburg effect is lactate secretion, which acidifies the tumor milieu, thought to promote oncogenesis and confer tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers, characterized by cellular heterogeneity and plasticity, which are thought to drive extreme therapeutic resistance. Despite their heterogeneity, common hallmarks of GBM tumors are high levels of aerobic glycolysis (&#8220;Warburg Effect&#8221;) and a resultant acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor progression. In an in vivo zebrafish developmental screen, we identified ogremorphin (OGM), a small molecule inhibitor of GPR68\/OGR-1, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which is activated by extracellular protons. Using ogremorphin and pHluorin2-GPI, a novel sensor of extracellular acidification, we demonstrate that glioblastoma cells acidify their own environment in vitro and activate GPR68, and visualize, for the first time, the establishment of the acidic extracellular microenvironment during the formation of GBM spheroids in vitro. Selective inhibition of GPR68 causes robust cell death in all 12 glioblastoma cell lines tested to date, despite genetic and molecular heterogeneity, without toxicity on healthy cells in whole animals. Mechanistically, GPR68 inhibition activates ferroptosis, a programmed cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation, in an ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4)-dependent manner. Finally, in GBM cells, ogremorphin treatment demonstrates strong synergistic effects with the frontline therapeutics temozolomide and ionizing radiation. Our results indicate that GPR68 activation by extracellular acidification is a key cancer survival pathway downstream of the Warburg Effect, and that GPR68 inhibition, either alone or in combination with temozolomide and radiation therapy, is a promising therapeutic approach to selectively induce ferroptosis in GBM tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Warburg effect,ferroptosis,Microenvironment,ATF4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Charles  H.

A key physiological consequence of the Warburg effect is lactate secretion, which acidifies the tumor milieu, thought to confer tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Yet, the molecular mechanism of this resistance is not well understood. Ogremorphin, a small molecule inhibitor of an extracellular pH sensing receptor, GPR68, was found to inhibit the growth and survival of Glioblastomas. However, the consequences of GPR68 inhibition on carcinomas alone and in combination with radiation are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ogremorphin alone and in combination with radiation on multiple cancer cell lines.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 1) siRNA and CRISPR-interference knockdown of GPR68 in two carcinoma cell lines Panc02 (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) and A549 (lung cell carcinoma). 2) Treatment of pancreatic and lung carcinomas with GPR68 inhibitor ogremorphin alone and with ionizing radiation. 3) Cell viability (MTT), clonogenic assays, and cell cycle analysis via flow cytometry were performed. 4) Lipid peroxidation study for induction of ferroptosis. The interaction between ogremorphin and radiation was evaluated using the combination index.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Knockdown of GPR68 had significant effects on cell survival. Exposures of ogremorphin in clonogenic assays indicated a significant effect in reducing colony size, but not on the number of colonies, in both carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, ogremorphin significantly increased the efficacy of irradiation on the reduction of colony size. Although ogremorphin had no effect on cell cycle alone, it had a synergistic increase in G2 phase cells with radiation. Finally, GPR68 inhibition indicated synergistic activity with radiation for the induction of ferroptosis.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>. GPR68 inhibition induces ferroptosis in cancer cells on its own, but also synergistically with ionizing radiation. This study suggests that GPR68 is a key cancer survival pathway activated by the acidic tumor milieu\/Warburg effect, and that the ogremorphin class of molecules may be suitable candidates for combination therapy in lung and pancreatic carcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Warburg effect,Radiosensitivity,ferroptosis,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Leif  R.

The Hippo pathway is executed by the YAP1\/TAZ (WWTR1) co-activators and the TEAD family of transcription factors, which consists of four paralogs (TEAD1-4) with both redundant and unique functions. The transcriptional targets of TEADs include genes playing tumor-promoting roles, including pro-proliferative, immunosuppressive, and anti-apoptotic genes. A growing body of research points to the central importance of the Hippo pathway as a key driver of oncogenesis and as key resistance mechanism to inhibitors of the MAPK pathway or its upstream activators, such as receptor tyrosine kinases. Sporos BioDiscovery has developed novel inhibitors that reversibly bind to the palmitoylation site of TEAD transcription factors to block Hippo pathway activity. Sporos BioDiscovery&#8217;s internal bioinformatic insights were leveraged to fine tune the inhibitory activity against the four TEAD paralogs, to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. Key characteristics of the SPR1 TEAD inhibitors: (i) low nM, single-agent activity against multiple TEAD-dependent cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> in established Hippo-pathway hyperactive mesothelioma cell lines as well as in several non-mesothelioma, cell lines without any obvious lesions in the upstream components of the Hippo pathway. (ii) activity against multiple tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i> with tumor regression observed even in large established tumors, a feat not previously reported with any other TEAD inhibitor. (iii) strong interactions with inhibitors of the MAPK pathway and inhibitors of its upstream activators, such as RTKs. (iv) favorable ADME profile in rodents, dogs and NHPs, as well as a favorable safety profile. In sum, SPR1 presents monotherapy opportunities in ultra-responder populations based on internal bioinformatic insights, while broader potential exists as an adjuvant for precision oncology targeted therapies, particularly within the MAPK pathway and its upstream activators.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,YAP\/TAZ,Tumor targeting,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Florian Muller<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Erkan Baloglu<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew  D.

High rates of nuclear-encoded protein synthesis, supporting increased proliferation rates, render leukemic cells reliant on increased proteolytic systems to clear misfolded proteins. Compared to non-transformed blood cells, AML cells and stem cells exhibit a unique metabolic phenotype characterized by increased mitochondrial mass and greater reliance on oxidative metabolism for survival and proliferation. To identify novel biological vulnerabilities in the mitochondrial proteome, we analyzed the DepMap (depmap.org) for essential mitochondrial genes in AML. Through this analysis, we identified the mitochondrial protease LONP1 as essential for a subset of AML and in the top 10% of essential genes for this disease. LONP1 is a nuclear-encoded AAA+ serine protease that resides in the mitochondrial matrix and maintains the mitochondrial proteome, mainly via the clearance of misfolded, unassembled or oxidatively-damaged proteins. However, its importance and function in AML has not been previously reported. Compared to normal hematopoietic cells, LONP1 mRNA was overexpressed in AML across three publicly available datasets while LONP1 protein was increased &#62;2 fold in tested AML primary samples (N=16). Using shRNA and CRISPR gRNA, LONP1 knockdown and knockout reduced the growth and viability of OCI-AML2, OCI-M2, and NB4 cells. Mechanistically, genetic knockdown or knockout of LONP1 increased levels of insoluble, aggregated mitochondrial proteins including ClpP, TUFM, and NDUFA9 as measured by immunoblotting of soluble and insoluble protein fractions as well as by the fluorescence of the protein aggregation dye PROTEOSTAT by confocal microscopy. The accumulation of insoluble mitochondrial protein aggregates through LONP1 inhibition exploits an increased reliance on chaperone and protease systems due to abnormally high protein synthesis.

Regulation of RNA processing pathways can be mediated by a number of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and dysfunctional RNA processing has implications as a therapeutic target in leukemia and lymphoma. We performed genetic and pharmacological perturbation of the activity of terminal uridyltransferases TUT4\/7 (ZCCHC11\/6) in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A combination of catalytic inactivation and knockout by CRISPR\/Cas9 of TUT4 and TUT7, respectively, were used to abrogate uridylation in THP-1 cells, with enzyme function measured by a cellular miRNA uridylation assay. Inhibition of uridylation in THP-1 cells reduced proliferation, induced changes in cell cycle progression, and enhanced sensitivity to the BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, alone and in combination with azacitidine. BCL-2 expression was found to be reduced at the mRNA and protein levels, while increases in expression of BCL-2 regulating miRNAs miR139-5p and miR494-3p were observed. GSEA performed on uridylation deficient cells highlighted changes in cell cycle regulation, mitochondrial metabolism, and cell death pathways relative to unedited controls. These effects could be recapitulated with pharmacological inhibition using sub-inhibitory doses of a novel, selective inhibitor of TUT4\/7, TS-002266, while the weakly active enantiomer TS-002455 did not show combination activity. Treatment of primary AML with combination of TS-002266 and venetoclax improved activity over venetoclax alone in a number of primary AML samples. Thus, we propose that TUT4\/7 and BCL-2 inactivation may be a therapeutic strategy in leukemia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,Metabolism,Acute myeloid leukemia,Bcl-2 protein family,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Corey Fyfe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gabriella Fiorentino<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael  J.

Errors in the splicing process are common in cancer and lead to the production of tumor-specific mRNAs that often encode for neoantigen peptides. Such neoantigens cannot be discovered using conventional DNA-based tools; they require specialized software for alternative splicing analysis using RNA-seq data. Envisagenics has developed SpliceIO<sup>TM<\/sup>, a proprietary software platform for splicing-derived neoantigen discovery. SpliceIO uses RNA-seq data to uncover extracellular neoantigens encoded by transmembrane proteins or presented to immune cells through the MHC complex. Using SpliceIO, we have analyzed roughly 8,000 RNA-seq samples from 4 different cancers and 14 normal tissue types. Each dataset first undergoes an unsupervised clustering analysis using SpliceSlice<sup>TM<\/sup> to stratify patients into subpopulations based on similar aberrations in splicing machinery. We then leverage SpliceIO to identify splicing-derived, tumor-specific neoantigens enriched in these cohorts. SpliceIO<sup> <\/sup>incorporates features, such as protein localization, MHC binding affinity, epitope accessibility and cancer relevance of the gene to help select tumor specific targets with the highest therapeutic potential. Here, we summarize the discovery and validation of novel splicing-derived neoantigens identified using SpliceIO. To validate neoantigen candidates, we performed isoform expression quantification at the RNA and protein levels using PCR, RNA-FISH, western blot and mass spectrometry. Our experiments confirmed several neoantigen candidates encoded by tumor-specific RNA isoforms, that are translated and localized to the cellular membrane. Interestingly, one of the candidates is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that exhibits cassette exon skipping in approximately 24% of TNBC tumors. Fluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrate that the TNBC-specific isoform of the protein is localized to plasma membrane but not the ER, suggesting that alternative splicing can alter protein localization. Together, our results demonstrate the potential of RNA splicing analysis for the discovery of novel immunotherapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Splice variants,Neoantigens,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hasan Ekrem Zumrut<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kendall Anderson<sup><\/sup>, Miguel Manzanares<sup><\/sup>, Shaleigh Smith<sup><\/sup>, Sakshi Gera<sup><\/sup>, Nayab Habib<sup><\/sup>, Sanjana Shah<sup><\/sup>, Devon Trahan<sup><\/sup>, Martin Akerman<sup><\/sup>, Gayatri Arun<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Envisagenics Inc., Long Island City, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"87402d55-b832-45c6-ad8e-2696b27a89f6","ControlNumber":"2429","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Metabolic gene <i>MTAP (methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)<\/i> is localized at the 9p21 chromosome in the close proximity to <i>p16\/CDKN2A<\/i> tumor-suppressor locus. Co-deletion of <i>MTAP <\/i>may be observed in 80-90% of all tumors harboring homozygous deletion of <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, which represents 10 - 15% of all human tumors. Many of these tumor types, such as non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma or mesothelioma are associated with poor prognosis, representing a significant unmet medical need. <i>MTAP<\/i> deletion results in a massive accumulation of methylthioadenosine (MTA) in cells. MTA in high concentrations is a very selective inhibitor of PRMT5 methyltransferase, competitive for the substrate: S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Accumulation of MTA in cells with <i>MTAP<\/i> deletion causes partial inhibition of the methylation activity of PRMT5, which in turn reduces the level of symmetric arginine dimethylation of the whole proteome, and thus an increased sensitivity of cells to modulation of methylosome activity. Therapeutic targeting of PRMT5 in homozygous MTAP-deleted cancers constitute a promising strategy of selective killing of genetically defined cancer cells. Ryvu has identified a series of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors which have good drug-like physicochemical properties and block methyltransferase activity with nanomolar IC50 values. Structurally enabled hit generation and optimization allowed quick expansion and delivery of several generations of compounds with novel IP, high target engagement in cells and selective potency in <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted cell lines. Ryvu compounds selectively inhibit growth of <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted cancer cells in prolonged 3D culture, which strongly correlates with inhibition of PRMT5-dependent protein symmetric dimethylation (SDMA) in those cells. Selectivity between effects observed in <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted and WT cells exceeds 100-fold both for SDMA and growth inhibition. The DMPK profile of these compounds allows for oral administration, which enables testing antitumor activity in <i>MTAP<\/i> null tumor xenograft-bearing mice. Efficacy studies with our lead compound resulted in demonstration of tumor growth inhibition in <i>MTAP<\/i> -\/- model, accompanied by significant inhibition of target proximal PD biomarker.&#8239; Overall,&#8239;these studies provide a rationale for further optimization of our chemical series of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors towards a clinical candidate.&#8239;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,MTAP deletion,PRMT5,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Anna Bartosik<sup><\/sup>, Adam Radzimierski<sup><\/sup>, Aneta Bobowska<sup><\/sup>, Oleksandr Levenets<sup><\/sup>, Agata Stachowicz<sup><\/sup>, Kamil Ku&#347;<sup><\/sup>, Kinga Michalik<sup><\/sup>, Katarzyna Banaszak<sup><\/sup>, Monika Madej<sup><\/sup>, Marta Skoda<sup><\/sup>, Kamila Koz&#322;owska-Tomczyk<sup><\/sup>, Igor Tomczyk<sup><\/sup>, Karolina Pyziak<sup><\/sup>, Dobros&#322;awa Krzemie&#324;<sup><\/sup>, Miros&#322;awa G&#322;adysz<sup><\/sup>, Paulina Podkalicka<sup><\/sup>, Aniela Go&#322;as<sup><\/sup>, Karolina Gluza<sup><\/sup>, Grzegorz Sata&#322;a<sup><\/sup>, Andrzej Gondela<sup><\/sup>, Marta Sowi&#324;ska<sup><\/sup>, Nicolas Boutard<sup><\/sup>, Agata Ch&#322;opek<sup><\/sup>, Aleksandra Wi&#281;ckowska<sup><\/sup>, Daria Szukiel<sup><\/sup>, Grzegorz &#262;wiertnia<sup><\/sup>, Iana Levenets<sup><\/sup>, Karol Zuchowicz<sup><\/sup>, Klara Korta-Pi&#261;tek<sup><\/sup>, Marcin Nowogródzki<sup><\/sup>, Marek Wronowski<sup><\/sup>, Marianna Girardi<sup><\/sup>, Mateusz &#346;wirski<sup><\/sup>, Oleksandr Popika<sup><\/sup>, Paulina Niedziejko-&#262;wiertnia<sup><\/sup>, Pierpaolo Cordone<sup><\/sup>, Przemys&#322;aw Wyr&#281;bek<sup><\/sup>, Qu&#7923;nh V&#361;<sup><\/sup>, Sujit Sasmal<sup><\/sup>, Svitlana Sukhomlinova<sup><\/sup>, Magdalena Miodek<sup><\/sup>, Jacek Faber<sup><\/sup>, Anna Kowal-Chwast<sup><\/sup>, Ró&#380;a Starczak<sup><\/sup>, Sanja Novak Ratajczak<sup><\/sup>, Agnieszka &#346;wirska<sup><\/sup>, Dawid Gogola<sup><\/sup>, Pawe&#322; Guzik<sup><\/sup>, Martin Swarbrick<sup><\/sup>, <b>Mateusz Nowak<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ryvu Therapeutics, Krakow, Poland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fffe56ff-cd87-44d7-80df-f21d0f21d329","ControlNumber":"3338","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

In the context of cancer, it has been reported that lncRNAs can act as cancer oncogenes and are altered in various cancer types. Among them, MALAT1 is a lncRNA highly expressed in multiple cancer types and associated with disease progression in patients. MALAT1 is highly upregulated in metastatic lesions of breast cancer patients. Both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of MALAT1 suppressed tumor epithelial to mesenchymal transition, resulted in the differentiation of breast cancers and had a dramatic impact on tumor metastasis. MALAT1 is a nuclear retained lncRNA, and as such MALAT1 is highly sensitive to RNaseH1-dependant Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) degradation, because RNaseH1 is also predominantly localized to the nucleus. Thus, MALAT1 represents an attractive novel therapeutic target uniquely tractable to ASOs with the potential to impact metastatic cancer progression. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of FTX-001 leading to its selection as a clinical drug candidate for the treatment of human cancers. Preclinical pharmacology, tolerability, and toxicity studies conducted in rodents and non-human primates demonstrated the safety and potency of FTX-001. FTX-001 ASO contains constrained ethyl (cEt) chemistry Gen 2.5 and was identified by screening over 2700 ASOs against MALAT1. FTX-001 showed a consistent potent inhibition of MALAT1 RNA expression in human cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as in human xenograft tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i> upon systemic delivery. Good exposure, tissue distribution and tolerability profile were observed in mice, rats and non-human primates (NHP) after repeated subcutaneous (sc) administrations. Genotoxicity studies including the bacterial reverse mutation assay and <i>in vivo<\/i> micronucleus assays demonstrated that FTX-001 did not cause mutagenic or chromosome alterations at doses up to 2000 mg\/kg in mice. Preliminary results from 6-weeks nonclinical toxicity testing in mice (sc administration up to 45mg\/kg) and NHP (intravenous administration up to 24mg\/kg) revealed no significant adverse events observed during dosing and recovery phases. No major variation of blood markers or blood count were observed. Ongoing histopathological evaluation will complete the health hazard evaluation of FTX-001. Taken together, these results demonstrate the high potency and good preclinical safety profile of FTX-001 which supports the potential to achieve good target engagement (MALAT1 RNA knock down in human tumors) at well tolerated clinical doses in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Long noncoding RNA,Preclinical,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marie-Aline C.

Although a specific peptide against MUC1-CT has effectively blocked the MUC1 signaling pathway, intrinsic metabolites targeting MUC1 were not well studied. 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) is a purine biosynthesis intermediate and an analog of adenosine. Our study showed that high AICAR reduced lung tumor cell growth by increasing DNA damage and cell apoptosis. MUC1 was validated as one of the leading AICAR-binding proteins by virtual target screening and thermal stability assay. AICAR treatment dramatically degraded MUC1-CT at protein levels. Whole transcriptome analysis demonstrated that AICAR negatively regulated the Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway. Duolink proximity ligation assay revealed that JAK1 interacted with MUC1 directly, and AICAR treatment impaired this protein-protein interaction. Increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity was linked to upregulated expression of MUC1-CT in tissues from an <i>EGFR<\/i> transgenic mouse lung cancer model. AICAR treatment reduced phosphorylated EGFR, JAK1, and MUC1-CT in lung cancer cells. A mono-treatment with AICAR reduced tumor formation in a mouse lung xenograft model.

Classical chemotherapeutics including bortezomib, melphalan, lenalidomide and thalidomide have greatly enhanced survival times. Unfortunately, patients typically relapse and become refractory with an average survival of 5 years post-diagnosis. Our emerging studies demonstrate a novel role for ULK3 in regulating autophagy in MM, a key program that sustains cell survival under times of stress and has been implicated as a major mechanism of proteasome inhibitor (PI) resistance. MM is known to be highly dependent on autophagy and, currently, specific ULK3 inhibitors are lacking. We posit that by targeting this marker in chemotherapy resistant MM patients, we can circumvent alternative metabolic routes and resensitize to standard of care proapoptotic therapy. We performed RNASeq analysis of CD138+ MM cells derived from patients across the disease stages spectrum (n=815) to confirm the role of ULK3 in disease progression and resistance to chemotherapy. We developed novel inhibitors SG3014\/MA9060 that target multiple kinases including ULK3 (EC<sub>50<\/sub> 90nM) as well as BRD4. BRD4 is a known driver of MYC and its expression is increased in refractory MM. The BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, effectively impairs the tumorigenic potential of MM but resistance has also been noted. We determined the efficacy of MA9060 for the treatment of CD138+ MM isolated from naive and refractory patients using a novel ex vivo high throughput platform developed at Moffitt.ULK3 is highly associated with MM stage of the disease. Refractory MM patients have increased autophagy activity with significantly higher expression of ULK3 in refractory patients and in drug resistant cell lines (immunoblotting U266 vs U266-PSR; RPMI-8226 vs RPMI-8226-B25; ABNL vs V10 resistant cells).Genetic ablation of ULK3 by siRNA in U266 and 8226 cell lines results in rapid cessation of the downstream autophagy proteins (ULK1, ATG13, pATG13) and MM cell death within 72h of transduction. Increased concentrations of autophagy inhibitors MA9060\/SG3014 progressively decreased CMYC and ULK3 levels, as measured by immunoblotting in U266 cells. In vivo preclinical model of U266Luc tail vein injection proved our drugs are highly effective in reducing tumor dissemination and extending overall survival (CTRL untreated n=65 days vs MA9060 n=110). Importantly, we noted no overt toxicity and protected effect against myeloma-induced bone disease. This novel class of drug works synergistically with PI and can re-sensitize PI resistant disease to these effective therapies. We also show by EMMA ex vivo platform that MA9060 is highly effective for the treatment of CD138+ MM cells isolated from patients with refractory disease.ULK3 represents a novel target for treatment of MM refractory disease. Our dual inhibitors can increase overall survival in vivo and ex vivo, therefore we expect to quickly translate our novel molecules to the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Multiple myeloma,Drug resistance,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marilena Tauro<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tao Li<sup><\/sup>, Mark Meads<sup><\/sup>, Praneeth  R.

Environmental factors, such as poor diet and microbiota, as well as inflammatory conditions, are strongly associated with occurrence of digestive system cancers. Obesogenic diet combined with microbiotic metabolism can lead to high levels of secondary bile acids in the human gut. Secondary bile acids deoxy- and litho-cholic acid have been shown to have oncogenic potential and their levels are increased in the intestines of cancer patients relative to healthy controls. GPR35 is an orphan class A G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in digestive system epithelial tissues and cells of myeloid lineage. GPR35 polymorphisms are strongly associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. In particular, rs37947171, a missense variant that codes for a threonine to methionine substitution at position 108 (T108M) and has been shown to have hypermorphic function, is strongly associated with Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis. GPR35 is also overexpressed in adenocarcinomas of the digestive tract, including those of esophageal, hepatic\/bile ductal, pancreatic, gastric and colorectal origin, and high expression has been shown to confer poor prognosis in various digestive system cancers. Consistent with a proposed role in digestive tract cancers we now show that GPR35 is activated by lithocholic acid. Furthermore, we demonstrate through CRISPR-gene editing of cancer cells and RNAseq analysis that GPR35 can regulate transcriptional and cytoskeletal modules associated with hallmarks of cancer, including chemokine and growth factor expression and F-actin formation. GPR35 activates a transcriptional program that is enriched for genes containing pro-oncogenic serum response factor response element in their upstream promoters. High throughput screening and medicinal chemistry optimization has led to the discovery of potent antagonists of GPR35 signalling. Pharmacological characterisation of lead series has shown that they are able to prevent G&#945; and &#946;-arrestin protein binding, while also inhibiting phospho-ERK, calcium flux, receptor internalisation and serum response factor-induced gene transcription. Furthermore, the series are competitive with predicted orthosteric agonist, can block activation of receptor signalling by lithocholic acid and act as inverse agonists of constitutive receptor tone. Profiling these inhibitors in cancer models is currently ongoing. This work provides the basis for the pre-clinical development of GPR35 inverse agonists as anti-cancer drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Small molecule inhibitor,Serum Response Factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James Westcott<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher  A.

ADCs deliver potent cytotoxic payloads to tumour via cancer specific monoclonal antibodies. A few ADCs are currently evaluated in clinical trials for high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, most of them target FOLR1-alpha, a conventional HGSOC target which also expresses in vital organs including lungs. Thus, it is desirable to discover more specific antigen targets, and these new targets will be the foundation for the next-generation ADC for HGSOC.We propose that ovarian tumour specificity of an ADC target could contributed by three factors: 1. Lineage (e.g. fallopian tube marker FOLR1); 2. DNA amplification (e.g. ERBB2); 3. Other carcinogenesis process including epigenetic reprogramming. Then, by combining the GTEX, TCGA dataset with our own WES, long-reads RNA-sequencing and Mass spectrometry-based proteomics cohort, an array of differentially expressed genes in HGSOC tumours are identified.Out of over 50 candidates, two most promising targets are chosen for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) production and subsequent ADC development. First, the affinity and specificity of the mAbs were confirmed by ELISA, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. The cellular internalisation characteristics of these antibodies are confirmed by a fluorescence-based assay. Then, ADCs for these two targets are produced by conjugating monomethyl auristatin E payload to the mAbs via a cleavable linker. Finally, both ADCs show highly target-specific and sub-nanomolar cytotoxicity in model ovarian cancer cell lines. In conclusion, we identify a panel of HGSOC-specific ADC targets and develop two ADCs candidates for further pre-clinical and clinical investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Ovarian cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ruisi Fu<sup>1<\/sup>, Hantao Lou<sup>2<\/sup>, Ning Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Dongnan Yan<sup>1<\/sup>, Clara Tresserras-Segura<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Haonan Lu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Aboagye<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Nankai University, Tianjin, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"79bf4091-e90a-4be3-8f06-52db6856d49f","ControlNumber":"6422","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

These include a reduced volume of distribution with limited penetration into solid tumors, and an expensive, long and complicated production process, especially for large-scale manufacturing. These factors hinder the activity of these medications in certain tumors, and limit equitable access to all population segments. Use of aptamers as a therapeutic targeting moiety, holds the promise of building on the success of ADCs. Aptamers have several advantages over mAbs as a targeting moiety including: (i) smaller size that enables better tissue\/tumor penetration; (ii) chemical synthesis which allows rapid and affordable scale-up; (iii) superior safety profile from lack of immunogenicity and short half-life which reduces off-target adverse events; and (iv) room temperature stability. Therefore, the use of aptamers in conjunction with drugs (similar to ADCs) holds promise for tumor management. We have recently identified a novel therapeutic target for certain cancers (COF-01) using analysis of proteomics data and immunohistochemistry from patient-derived tumors. COF-01 was shown to have highly specific increases in protein and mRNA expression in several cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and pancreatic cancer. COF-01 expression correlated with poor overall survival. Here, we present a new therapeutic approach that targets COF-01-positive cells using next generation drug conjugated aptamers. We have generated novel next-generation base-modified ssDNA aptamers (Raptamers) against COF-01 using a cell- and protein-based selection that utilizes our proprietary bead-based oligonucleotide libraries. The binding affinities of these COF-01 Raptamer candidates were determined by concentration curves using biolayer interferometry. Dissociation constants for the COF-01 Raptamers ranged from 80 nM - 200 nM. Anti-COF-01 Raptamer-drug conjugates (Rap-DCs) were developed by conjugating the Raptamers to monomethyl auristatin F via a cleavable linker. <i>In vitro<\/i> efficacy data has shown that the COF-01 Rap-DCs can selectively induce cytotoxicity in COF-01-positive human cells.

NQO1 can catalyze repeated futile redox cycling of quinone to hydroxyquinone forms of certain quinones (e.g., beta-lapachone) consuming NADPH and generating rapid bursts of ROS preferentially in tumor tissues. However, the natural compound quinones have no clinical applications because of their insolubility and induction of hemolytic anemia. Therefore, we designed and synthesized specific NQO1- activated quinones, a spiroisoindolinone called GNQ-9 and a derivative of ES936 (a proven inhibitor of NQO1) that are bioactivated by purified NQO1 and in tumor cell cultures. The catalytic activity was inhibited by dicoumarol and the compounds triggered profound ROS generation and apoptosis in NQO1-proficient but not-deficient tumor cells. Evidence suggested the cell killing is mediated by ROS, ER stress, and abundant release of DAMP molecules indicative of immunogenic cell death in GNQ-9 treated cells. Normal cell counterparts were not affected by the NQO1 activators. Besides the pancreatic cancer MiaPaca2 xenografts, GNQ-9 also eliminated the U87 glioblastoma with great efficacy in intracranial xenograft models, thus verifying its BBB penetrability. A potent inactivation of the MGMT, a redox-sensitive DNA repair protein in GNQ-9 treated cells and a synergistic cell killing by Temozolomide was also noted. Since the tumor-restricted high levels of NQO1 provide excellent opportunities for imaging cancer biopsies and the extent of surgical resection, we have developed a near-infrared probe (NIR-ASM) that specifically detects NQO1 activity in live cells and cancer tissues (Sci. Reports 2019, 9:8577). This turn-on probe remains non-fluorescent until cleavage by NQO1 and the product fluoresces with a peak at 646 nm. In live nude mice bearing both NQO1-proficient A549 and NQO1-deficient MDAMB 231 xenografts on opposite flanks, injections of the NIR-ASM probe resulted in the A549 tumors developing an intense signal within 5 minutes, while the NQO1-negative tumors never developed any. Further, we have developed theranostic probes capable of generating a) intense fluorescence in the NIR range and b) ROS\/hydrogen peroxide following catalysis by NQO1 in situ. These probes have demonstrated a simultaneous reduction of NQO1 activity and tumor growth delay in mice with NQO1-rich tumors. Collectively, these efforts represent a new direction for the development of promising NQO1-directed drugs and cancer imaging associated therewith (supported by a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas [CPRIT] grant RP170207 to KSS).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nrf2,Imaging,Antioxidant,Theranostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kalkunte  S.

While combined CDK4\/6i treatment in combination with Estrogen modulation significantly extends Progression Free Survival (PFS) in metastatic HR+ breast cancer patients, those treated invariably develop aquired resistance, which results in only marginal improvement in Overall Survival (OS). The drug resistance seen in the presence of CDK4\/6i, such as palbociclib, has been shown to be attributed to activation and compensation by CDK2. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by aberrant activation of the CyclinD-CDK4\/6 signaling pathway and inactivation of the CDKN2A locus encoding the CDK4\/6 inhibitor, p16INK4A, and was initially thought to be a good candidate for CDK4\/6i use. Surprisingly, CDK4\/6i do not show response in most PDAC lines and have not been used clinically in this tumor type. We hypothesized that PDAC may be intrinsically resistant to CDK4\/6 inhibition due to activation of CDK2 and as such inhibition of both CDK4\/6 and CDK2 may be required. We have developed a novel strategy to kill drug-resistant tumor cells using a therapeutic liposomal:peptide formulation, IpY.1, to inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of p27Kip1(CDKN1B), which in turn inhibits both CDK4\/6 and CDK2. IpY.1 is specific for p27, and this reduces toxicity relative to that seen with the small molecule ATP-competitive CDK4\/6i or CDK2i. IpY.1 blocks DNA replication in HR+ breast cancer (BC) cells and mouse models, but unlike CDK4\/6i or CDK2i treatment, it induces ROS-dependent necroptosis to kill the tumor cells.<br \/>Palbociclib did not have a significative effect on ATP levels or proliferation of PDAC cell lines. In contrast, we found that IpY.1 was able to block proliferation and reduce viability in palbociclib-resistant PDAC lines, suggesting that dual CDK4\/6 and CDK2 inhibition via p27 targeting was required. Some PDAC lines were &#8220;super sensitive&#8221; and responded with IC50 values ~10X less than seen with the ER+ BC lines, and we are currently screening for biomarkers of response. CDK2 activity was reduced in IpY.1 treated lines and markers of necroptosis were detected. Immunoblot analysis showed decreased pY88 phosphorylation of p27 (the target of IpY) demonstrating target engagement. We have demonstrated that unlike palbociclib, IpY.1 blocks proliferation and viability in all PDAC lines tested, suggesting that targeting p27 may be a viable approach to treat PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,CDK4,CDK2,Palbociclib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carolina Guido<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Susan RS Gottesman<sup>2<\/sup>, Stacy  W.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enables cancer cells to acquire migratory and invasive characteristics, access the circulatory system, and metastasize. Moreover, EMT is associated with therapeutic resistance and CSC generation. Our previous research demonstrated a redistribution of the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) from the plasma membrane to the cytosol during EMT. Using super-resolution STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), we have recently identified increased interaction of such intracellular Cx43 with microtubules during EMT and in primary glioblastoma (GBM) CSCs (GSCs). We further report a tumorigenic function for cytosolic Cx43\/microtubule complexing in cancer cell and CSC proliferation, migration, and survival. Cx43 localization and activity is regulated by multiple sites for protein-protein interaction within the Cx43 carboxy-terminus (CT), including a tubulin binding domain. We employed a Cx43 mimetic peptide named JM2 (juxtamembrane 2) encompassing the microtubule binding sequence of the Cx43 CT. Following administration, JM2 efficiently and specifically disrupts the interaction of Cx43 with microtubules, inhibits GSC-derived neurosphere formation <i>in vitro<\/i>, and patient GBM-derived organoid growth <i>ex vivo<\/i>. Using an orthotopic GBM patient derived xenograft mouse model, we demonstrate <i>in vivo<\/i> that JM2 significantly decreases the number of GSCs within brain tumors, inhibits the formation of highly invasive GBM tumors, and increases mouse survival in combination with the chemotherapy alkylating agent temozolomide. Further examining the role of Cx43\/microtubule complexing in the context of metastatic disease, we observed JM2 also decreases mesenchymal marker expression and inhibits cell migration and invasion in EMT models. Using an <i>in vivo<\/i> orthotopic breast cancer mouse model we find that intratumoral administration of JM2 prevents metastasis, significantly decreasing cancer cell lung colonization. Our findings validate targeting Cx43 complexing with microtubules, with JM2, as a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment through inhibition of EMT-associated increases in invasion and metastasis, and elimination of CSCs. Modulation of non-junctional Cx43 functions therefore represents a viable therapeutic approach to target cellular plasticity with broad therapeutic implications for many cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Cancer stem cells,Peptides,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samy Lamouille<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Christina  E.

NSCLCs preferentially utilize glucose to support their rapid growth- a phenotype driven by several oncogenic alterations among which mutations of the oncoprotein Ras are frequently observed. Oncogenic Ras is shown to activate downstream effectors (<i>e.g.<\/i> HIF-1&#945;) that stimulate glycolysis - in part by activation of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase\/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase family of enzymes (PFKFB1-4). The PFKFBs produce fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP) which activates a key rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1). In preliminary studies, we found that the PFKFB4 family member was highly expressed relative to other PFKFB isoforms (by multiplex RT-PCR) in a series of patient-derived NSCLCs relative to paired normal lung tissue. We further explored PFKFB4 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in NSCLCs derived from a cohort of patients and found markedly elevated PFKFB4 in the majority of tumors relative to adjacent normal tissue. We then determined that silencing PFKFB4 markedly reduced F26BP, glycolysis and cell survival in NSCLC cell lines and inhibited xenograft lung tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. In order to target PFKFB4, we conducted a virtual screen of compounds that fit into the active site of PFKFB4 and discovered a first-in-class small molecule selective PFKFB4 inhibitor, termed 5MPN, that selectively inhibits recombinant PFKFB4 activity and decreases F26BP, glycolysis and proliferation in multiple NSCLC cell lines, with significantly higher anti-proliferative effects in Ras-driven cell lines. 5MPN also caused marked suppression of growth in established NSCLC xenograft tumors, importantly without systemic toxicity. We have developed an inducible, pan-tissue homozygous floxed <i>Pfkfb4<\/i> knockout mouse and crossed it with a Cre recombinase mouse driven by a tamoxifen-inducible &#946;-actin promoter to produce Cre\/<i>Pfkfb4<\/i><sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice.

GRC 54276 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a serine\/threonine kinase<sup>1,2<\/sup> that negatively regulates T and B cell receptor signaling<sup>3<\/sup>. Inhibition of HPK1 is an attractive therapeutic strategy for immuno-oncology based treatment of solid tumors<sup>3<\/sup>.<br \/>Methods: GRC 54276 was designed and developed using SAR based medicinal chemistry design supported by computational approaches. In vitro profiling was done using a battery of biochemical assays, functional read-outs and primary human in vitro T-cell activation assays. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in mouse colon tumor models of CT26 and MC38-hPD-L1. In vivo inhibition of biomarker pSLP76 Ser(376) by GRC 54276 was determined using CT26 tumor model. Detailed ADME-PK studies have been performed along with safety tolerability studies conducted in mice and monkeys.<br \/>Results: GRC 54276, demonstrated excellent in vitro immune profile of target engagement and anti-tumor immune response activity in both human and mouse systems. As a single agent, GRC 54276 demonstrated strong inhibition of tumor growth and biomarker pSLP76 Ser(376) in the CT26 tumor model. Enhanced efficacy was demonstrated by combining GRC 54276 with check-point blocking antibodies anti-CTLA4 and Atezolizumab in the CT26 and MC38-hPD-L1 models, respectively. GRC 54276 robustly enhanced complete tumor rejections when combined with Atezolizumab in the MC38-hPD-L1 model, correlating with increased immune effector memory T cells. Pharmacokinetic profile of GRC 54276 is characterized by high permeability, rapid absorption and moderate oral bioavailable across species. GRC 54276 is non-gentoxic with no observed adverse effects in mice and no treatment related cardiovascular or respiratory effects in repeat dose toxicity study in monkeys.<br \/>Conclusions: GRC 54276 is a novel HPK1 inhibtitor with acceptable pre-clincial profile and is currently undergoing a Phase 1\/2 clinical trial.<br \/>Acknowledgements: We thank Pooja S, Shital M, Rahul B, Ajit J, Sanjay G, Somesh K, Pramod S for their contributions to the project<br \/>References: 1.

Targeting these NOAs could therefore induce selective killing of cancer cells, opening several therapeutic opportunities. Recent data suggest that the stress-related scaffold protein AAC-11 (anti-apoptosis clone 11, also known as Api5) is critically involved in cancer cells resistance to chemotherapies, metastatic potential and escape from the immune system.<br \/>Methods: We have developed inactivating peptides based on the fusion of a cell penetrating sequence and portions of the leucine-zipper domain of AAC-11, which functions as a protein-protein interaction module. These peptides induce cancer cells death, through the inhibition of protein-protein interactions between AAC-11 and its partners, while sparing normal cells. We now describe further characterization of our lead peptide, JRT39, which contains residues 377 to 379 of AAC-11 linked to the cell-penetrating peptide &#8220;penetratin&#8221;.<br \/>Results: In vitro, JRT39 causes cell death in a wide spectrum of cancer cell lines with IC<sub>50<\/sub> ranging from 5 &#181;M to 30 &#181;M depending on tumor cell type. In particular, JRT39 showed selective efficacy towards primary cells from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) or S&#233;zary syndrome (SS) patients, while sparing normal hematopoietic cells, with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 5-15 &#181;M. Mechanistically, JRT39 induces membranolysis of cancer cells through binding to p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) in AML or SS cells plasma membrane, where PAK1 is overexpressed. In addition, JRT39 exerted potent anti-tumor activity in vivo in disseminated or subcutaneous AML, APL (Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia) and SS-patient derived preclinical murine models. Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies revealed that JRT39 is stable in human serum and has a plasma half-life of ~1.5-2.5 hours after intravenous (IV) administration to dogs or cynomolgus monkeys, with concentration-time data fitting 2-compartment model. Finally, JRT39 was well tolerated at 5 and 10 mg\/kg after single or repeated (daily) IV injections.<br \/>Conclusions: Combined, our preclinical data confirm that interfering with AAC-11-related survival pathways is a promising novel anticancer strategy and support the development of JRT39 for the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Therapeutic target,Cell penetrating peptides,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Louise Jeammet<sup>1<\/sup>, Emile Adicéam<sup>1<\/sup>, Justine Habault<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Kaci<sup>3<\/sup>, Jeannig Berrou<sup>3<\/sup>, Mélanie Dupont<sup>3<\/sup>, Nicolas Thonnart<sup>2<\/sup>, Ewa Pasquereau-Kotula<sup>2<\/sup>, Anne Marie-Cardine<sup>2<\/sup>, Armand Bensussan<sup>2<\/sup>, Marika Pla<sup>4<\/sup>, Hervé Dombret<sup>5<\/sup>, Claude Gardin<sup>6<\/sup>, Martine Bagot<sup>7<\/sup>, Jean-Christophe Rain<sup>8<\/sup>, Hélène Sicard<sup>1<\/sup>, Jérôme Tiollier<sup>1<\/sup>, Thorsten Braun<sup>6<\/sup>, <b>Jean-Luc Poyet<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Jalon Therapeutics, Paris, France,<sup>2<\/sup>INSERM UMRS976, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Université de Paris Cité, Paris, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Laboratoire de Transfert des Leucémies, URP3518, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, Hôpital Saint Louis, Université de Paris Cité, Paris, France,<sup>4<\/sup>INSERM UMRS1131, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Université de Paris Cité, Paris, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Service d'Hématologie adulte, Laboratoire de Transfert des Leucémies, URP3518, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, AP-HP, Hôpital Saint Louis, Université de Paris Cité, Paris, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Service d'Hématologie clinique, Laboratoire de Transfert des Leucémies, URP3518, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, AP-HP, H.

It is well known that tumors with mesenchymal phenotype have significantly poor prognosis and reduced response to checkpoint inhibitors. Targeting CAF becomes an increasingly attractive cancer therapeutic approach. Gremlin-1 is a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily, expressed by CAFs and tumor cells, and known to play a key role in EMT transition, cancer cell proliferation and stroma maintenance. Gremlin-1 overexpression in CAF or tumor cells often correlates with poor clinical prognosis in multiple cancers including prostate, pancreatic, gastric cancer etc. Here we describe the characterization of TST003 (14E3), a novel humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting Gremlin-1. TST003 bound to human Gremlin-1 with high affinity and high selectivity, and blocked Gremlin-1 binding to BMP2\/4 with an EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 3.68 nM to BMP2 and 4.53 nM to BMP4 respectively. TST003 could dose-dependently reverse Gremlin-1 inhibition of the BMP4-mediated Smad1\/5\/9 phosphorylation in tumor cells as measured by Western blot. In an <i>ex vivo<\/i> assay using prostate cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs), TST003 inhibited the growth of 9 out of 12 human PDOs significantly. TST003 also demonstrated its single agent tumor growth inhibition (TGI&#62;50%) at 10 mg\/kg in a human prostate cancer PC3 xenograft model on castrated male nude mice and a human colorectal cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model in the presence of human PBMC. Both tumor models expressed Gremlin-1 as detected by IHC analysis. In addition, a significantly better anti-tumor activity was observed when TST003 combined with an anti-VEGFR2 antibody in this CRC PDX (MSS, Kras G12D, PD-L1 negative) model. The safety profiles of TST003 were characterized in the single and repeated dose toxicology studies integrated with safety pharmacology, local tolerance, and in vitro hemolysis study, TCR study, and cytokine release study. TST003 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys without noteworthy abnormalities following a single dose or repeated doses. In summary, TST003 is a first-in-class therapeutic mAb targeting Gremlin-1 overexpressed by CAFs and tumor cells. Our preclinical characterization results provided the rationale for on-going clinical evaluation of TST003 in patients with advanced solid tumors with high unmet medical need either as monotherapy or in combination with SoC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Gremlin1,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Di Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Huanhuan Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Chaping Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Hongjun Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Xinlai Yao<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuang Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jie Ding<sup>1<\/sup>, Shenjie Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shijie Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Yi Gu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xueming Qian<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Suzhou Transcenta Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China,<sup>2<\/sup>State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med-X Stem Cell Research Center, and Depa, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"571abf6e-5746-4839-87c6-cba682df2369","ControlNumber":"4158","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

Melanoma metastasis and recurrence is associated with the existence of heterogeneous cell populations within tumors that have the ability to both initiate metastatic programs and bypass immune recognition. Tumor cells achieve immune evasion by interfering with immune signaling to limit immune cell infiltration, allowing tumor cell proliferation and growth. SERPINB4 (Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen 2 or SCCA2), a serine protease inhibitor, has been shown to regulate the host immune response against tumor cells by inhibiting immune cell activity. Interestingly, certain cancer cell types have been reported to overexpress SERPINB4. However, the expression profile and the functional significance of SERPINB4 in melanoma is not known. In this study, employing &#8216;The Cancer Genome Atlas&#8217; (TCGA), we found that SERPINB4 is overexpressed and significantly associated with lower overall survival in patients with melanoma. Next, employing a panel of human melanoma cell lines, we demonstrated that SERPINB4 is overexpressed in melanoma cells when compared to normal human melanocytes. In addition, CRISPR knockout of SERPINB4 in high-SERPINB4-expressing A375 melanoma cells resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation of melanoma cells in comparison to control cells. Conversely, forced overexpression of SERPINB4 in low-SERPINB4-expressing SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells significantly increased melanoma cell proliferation. Moreover, RT-qPCR analyses suggested that SERPINB4 overexpression significantly increased, while its knockout significantly decreased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (N-cadherin, &#946;-catenin, Snail and Zeb1) in melanoma cells. Additionally, SERPINB4 manipulation significantly modulated the expression of genes involved in antigen-presentation (MHC Class I molecules, HLA-A, -B, and &#8209;C) in melanoma cells. Taken together, our data suggested a potential oncogenic role of SERPINB4 in melanoma. Our study also suggested that SERPINB4 might be a promising therapeutic target for melanoma. Indeed, additional <i>in vitro<\/i> mechanistic and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies are needed to firmly establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of SERPINB4 for melanoma management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Oncogene,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gagan Chhabra<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Carl  A.
