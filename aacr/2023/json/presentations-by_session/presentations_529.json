The PIP study is combining pre-treatment clinical, molecular, and immunological profiles of melanoma patients to provide accurate prediction of response to ICI therapies.<br \/>Methods: 504 patients with advanced melanoma who received anti-PD-1&#177;CTLA-4 ICI were studied to develop predictive models of resistance to ICI. Resistance was defined as patients with progressive disease as best response, or partial response\/stable disease with &#60;6 months progression-free survival (RECIST 1.1). Machine learning models were developed using clinicopathological characteristics, tumor mutation burden (TMB, Qiaseq TMB IO), gene expression profiling ((GEP), Nanostring Pancancer 360 IO) and spatial quantitative pathology immune profiling (multiplex immunofluorescence, (MIF)) of baseline melanoma biopsies. Models were developed in a discovery cohort (n=247), validated in an independent cohort (n=97), with an accruing prospective cohort (n=160). Model predictive performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC).<br \/>Results: Models were developed and validated using sequential addition of omics features to relevant clinical factors. Baseline clinical data alone achieved an AUC of 68%. Clinical plus three-tier TMB (&#60;10, 10-20, &#62;20 mut\/mb) achieved an AUC of 78%. Clinical data plus GEP achieved 79% AUC, inclusive of tumor inflammation, antigen presentation and T-cell related signatures. Clinical and MIF spatial pathology achieved an 82% AUC including the distances between T-cells, CD16+ cells and melanoma cells as features in the model. Finally, the combination of TMB and GEP achieved an 83% AUC. Prospective validation of the models is awaiting follow-up milestones.<br \/>Conclusion: Multi-omic models using pre-treatment tissue and clinicopathology can significantly improve the accuracy of predicting patient outcomes to ICI treatments compared to baseline clinical data alone. Several models may be required based on different omic combinations to account for the reality of biopsy suitability and assay failures. These findings prove personalized precision treatment of patients with immunotherapies is possible in the clinical setting and such approaches should become routine care. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Malignant melanoma,Tumor mutational burden,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tuba  N.

The IMagyn050 trial (NCT03038100), which evaluated the efficacy of Atezo vs placebo (Pla) with carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab (CPB) in front line ovarian cancer patient (pts), did not meet its co-primary endpoints of PFS in ITT or PD-L1+ (Moore et al. JCO 2021). In the current IMagyn050 substudy we assessed potential predictive tumor immune biomarkers for Atezo clinical benefit.<br \/>Methods: FFPE tumors from the biomarker evaluable population were tested for PD-L1 IHC, CD8\/PanCK IHC (total CD8 T cells and immune location phenotypes [inflamed, excluded, desert]) and RNA-seq (to derive molecular subtypes, biological pathways and cellular components [xCELL]) in tissue from baseline (n=860), on-treatment (OT, 9 weeks, n=233), intra- (n=8) and inter-lesion (n=12) matched samples. Hazard ratio (HR) interaction test from multivariate adjusted Cox-regression analysis for PFS and OS was performed to test predictive biomarkers.<br \/>Results: While tumors with CD8 T cells, immunoreactive molecular subtypes or immune inflamed phenotype were enriched for PD-L1+, only pts with immune inflamed tumors showed improved OS Atezo benefit (HR 0.67). Improved Atezo PFS\/OS benefit was also observed in pts with whose tumors had high oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS, HR: 0.72\/0.65) and UV Response (UV, HR: 0.64\/0.58) but not IFN&#947; response. Plasma B cells were linked to improved OS Atezo benefit vs Pla (HR 0.53). We leveraged OT samples from pts in the neoadjuvant cohort to assess treatment effect on the tumor microenvironment. Analyses showed that CPB reduced tumor proliferation and increased tumor immune inflammation (CD8 T cells, PD-L1 and IFN&#945;\/IFN&#947; response), further increased by Atezo. Immune inflammation is challenging in ovarian cancer due to extensive tumor heterogeneity. Prevalence of tumor biomarkers varied by anatomic locations: total CD8, CD8 localization and molecular subtypes. Inter- and intra-lesion biomarker status within the same pt showed PD-L1 and plasma B cells as most consistent. Molecular subtypes and immune phenotypes had moderate intra-lesion agreement but discordant between lesions. PD-L1 and OXPHOS were the only biomarkers linked to Atezo benefit regardless of anatomical location.<br \/>Conclusion: This comprehensive exploratory study suggests that DNA damage, OXPHOS, plasma B cells and immune inflamed tumors, but not molecular subtypes or total CD8 T cells, may predict Atezo + CPB OS. This treatment promotes immune inflammation in OC tumors. Notably, we found that several biomarkers are highly heterogeneous. Our findings highlight the challenges of achieving durable clinical benefit from targeted immunotherapy in ovarian cancer pts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T-cells,B-cells,heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Venkatesh Krishnan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ching-Wei Chang<sup>2<\/sup>, Habib Hamidi<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael  A.

Gene expression data were deconvoluted for immune cell states using the Carcinoma EcoTyper software. We then conducted a series of survival analyses to test the association between survival outcomes and predicted cell types and states in five malignant tumors: Genitourinary (GU), Gastrointestinal (GI), Thoracic (THO), Cutaneous (CUT), Head &#38; Neck (H&#38;N). The regularized Cox regression model in R package &#8216;glmnet&#8217; was then applied to select the complementary pathway signatures (including gene ontology and KEGG pathways) to the immune cell states in predicting survival outcomes. We also explored the immune-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) as potential biomarkers for cell states and patient outcomes.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> EcoTyper analysis revealed that 692 (~80%) of patients were assigned to the 10 pre-identified Carcinoma Ecotypes (CE1 to CE10) or cell state atlas group. Overall, two immune deficiency ecotype patient groups (CE1 and CE2) pre-identified based on the independent training data were linked to worse survival, while two proinflammatory ecotype groups (CE9 and CE10) were associated with favorable surxvival. Those ecotype groups showed strong prognostic significance in predicting OS in melanoma and H&#38;N. Meanwhile, CE6, a non-neoplastic tissue enriched cell subtype, was also found to be highly associated with longer OS in H&#38;N and GU. CE7, an age-related mutation patient subgroup, contributed to shorter survival in both melanoma and GI. We also found that a subset of activated B cell state and the exhausted\/effector CD4 T cell state were significantly associated with patient survival in melanoma and GU, respectively. The penalized Cox regression model revealed that &#946;-catenin signaling pathway, P53 pathway and heme metabolism in the MSigDB Hallmark gene sets are the most complementary pathways to the ecotype scores in multiple cancer types. In additional, multiple pathways in KEGG such as endocytosis were found to jointly contribute to the ecotype-pathway composite prognostic model. In anazlying immune-related lncRNA biomarkers, we highlighted the prognostic role of NKILA in our dataset, which has been studied to promote tumor immune evasion.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our analysis has successfully established the utility of immune cell state atlas in predicting therapeutic benefits with ICIs.

Characterization of the pretreatment tumor immune biomarkers and clinical covariates may inform the likelihood of response to ipilimumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and guide future development of this and other modalities in this patient population.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We utilized PATH-SURVEIOR, a bioinformatics framework developed in-house for associating genes and pathway signatures with clinical endpoints, to perform survival analysis of gene expression levels of 31 candidate immune-related biomarkers based on previous preliminary data. We analyzed microarray gene expression data from 471 melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab (ipi) and 248 melanoma patients treated with IFN as part of E1609. We then developed a LASSO Cox regression model and validated our model in 22 patients treated with neoadjuvant ipi in a separate clinical trial.<br \/><b>Results <\/b> Using PATH-SURVEIOR, we evaluated 31 candidate immune biomarkers and their association with patient outcome by including treatment group (ipi and IFN) as a multiplicative covariate interaction in the Cox hazard model. Our analysis identified CXCL9, CD8A, CXCL10, and INPP5D as Tier 1 biomarkers (HR &#62; 1 and <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05) and IDO1, IGKC, and IL2RB as Tier 2 biomarkers (HR &#62; 1 and <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.1). Next, we developed an ipilimumab immune-based risk score using LASSO Cox regression (L-IPI7) based on these 7 aggregate biomarkers. We then split our 471 ipi-treated cohort into training (310, 66%) and testing (161, 33%) cohorts and assessed our model for its ability to predict overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). Our risk score was capable of stratifying ipi-treated patients into High-Risk and Low-Risk populations, which correlated with OS. As a negative control, we assessed our risk score in 248 IFN-treated patients and found no significant association with OS. As validation, we applied our L-IPI7 score to a cohort of 22 patients treated with neoadjuvant ipi and determined that the score was able to predict patients with a high risk of relapse. Interestingly, when we developed an interactive Cox-regression model with colitis status (grade 0-1 vs grade 2+), we found that neoadjuvant ipi patients with low-grade colitis were associated with a higher L-IPI7 risk score for disease relapse. In addition, we determined that: i) higher age and higher L-IPI7 risk score identified patients with the worst OS and RFS And ii) female patients with a low L-IPI7 risk scores had a better OS and RFS.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> We developed a broadly applicable model based on LASSO Cox Regression predictive of adjuvant ipi treatment outcomes in melanoma. Our L-IPI7 score based on expression of CXCL9, CD8A, CXCL10, INPP5D, IDO1, IGKC, IL2RB effectively predicts survival, with interactions with age, gender and on-treatment development of colitis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Alyssa  N.

We applied machine-learning algorithms on H&#38;E stained tissue to study the TME in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Our goal was to identify digital pathology (DP) features associated with outcome under combination treatment or monotherapy with atezolizumab (atezo), an anti-PD-L1 therapy, and relate those features to other data modalities. We analyzed patient data from two phase 3 clinical trials, OAK (docetaxel versus atezo in 2L+ NSCLC) and IMpower150 (bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel (BCP) versus BCP+atezo (ABCP) in advanced 1L non-squamous NSCLC).<br \/>Methods: As part of our effort to build a DP-based tumor-immune microenvironment atlas, digitized H&#38;E images were registered onto the PathAI research platform. Over 200K annotations from 90 pathologists were used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that classify slide-level human-interpretable features (HIFs) of cells and tissue structures from images and deployed on images from OAK and IMpower150. HIFs and PD-L1 status were associated with outcome in all samples in each arm in OAK and results were validated in IMpower150, using Cox proportional hazard models. Bulk RNAseq was run using samples extracted from the same area as the H&#38;E slide.<br \/>Results: We identified a composite feature capturing the ratio of immune cells to fibroblasts in the stroma predictive of both overall survival (OS) (HR=0.74 p=0.0046) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR=0.87 p=0.14). While patients primarily benefit from atezo if they are PD-L1 high, we found that even PD-L1 negative patients benefited from atezo when enriched for this feature (22C3 PD-L1 assay: OS HR=0.59 p=0.015, PFS HR=0.8 p=0.25; SP142 PD-L1 assay: OS HR=0.74 p=0.12, PFS HR=0.88 p=0.45). We thus recognized a DP feature that was predictive for positive outcome with atezo treatment, independent of PD-L1 levels. This association was then validated in IMpower150 comparing ABCP to BCP, both overall (OS HR=0.69 p=0.012) and in PD-L1 negative patients (SP263 assay OS HR=0.56 p=0.034). Integrating with RNAseq, patients enriched for this DP feature showed similar enrichment for B and T gene signatures and depletion in CAF-related gene signatures, thus showing the harmonization of TME between different data modalities.<br \/>Conclusions: Using a deep learning-based assay for quantifying pathology features of the TME from H&#38;E images in two NSCLC trials, we identified a novel biomarker predictive of outcome to PD-L1 targeting therapy, even in PD-L1 low &#38; negative patients. Importantly, our work shows how different data modalities (DP, gene expression) can be integrated to further our understanding of the TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,PD-L1,Tumor microenvironment,Digital pathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Aditi Qamra<sup>1<\/sup>, Minu  K.

These observations suggest that TILs may be general markers of patient outcomes, but evidence in support of this hypothesis has been limited by small cohorts.<br \/>We validated ImmunoPROFILE, a multiplexed immunofluorescence (MIF)-based assay coupled with machine-learning-based image analysis, to identify and quantify tumor cells (cytokeratin, PAX5, PAX8, SOX10), T cells (CD8), T-regulatory cells (FOXP3), exhausted cells (PD-1) and immunosuppressive tumor and immune cells (PD-L1). We applied the MIF panel to specimens from patients collected prospectively over three years and analyzed 2,023 cases across 27 tumor types. The association between biomarkers and overall survival (OS) was investigated using Cox models controlling for patient risk factors such as cancer type, metastatic vs. primary disease, age, and gender. Multivariable biomarker selection was based on likelihood ratios.<br \/>The assay was highly robust (success rate 97%), reproducible (inter-scanning and intra-staining density controls within 1 SD, inter-staining PD-L1 scores &#8804;11% CV), and operator-independent (R<sup>2<\/sup> &#62;0.7 to &#62;0.9 for each biomarker and 95% concordance in PD-L1 score-based interpretation between technicians). From whole slide images, a total of 11,932 individual regions of interest were analyzed across the cohort, resulting in &#62;50 million spatially-resolved single cells which were summarized into cell population densities and PD-L1 scores.<br \/>High densities of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> (&#62;64\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p&#60;0.0001), PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> (&#62;50\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p&#60;0.0001), and FOXP3<sup>+<\/sup> (&#62;30\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p&#60;0.0001) T cells were associated with longer overall survival (OS) irrespective of therapy and across all cancer types. PD-L1 metrics were not associated with OS (p=0.43). Compared to patients with low densities of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and PD-1<sup>+ <\/sup>cells, high densities of at least one of these cell types had better OS (Both high, HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.41 - 0.59; CD8<sup>+<\/sup> high, HR: 0.63, (0.48 - 0.82); PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> high, HR: 0.71, (0.54 - 0.93)).

Autologous anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are a promising new therapy, but determinants of response and resistance are not well known. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a useful tool to study MM as it allows for repeated, non-invasive tumor assessment. We apply a novel method for simultaneously tracking tumor mutations and CAR T-cells from cfDNA using Cancer Personalized Profiling by Deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq).<br \/>Methods: We designed a 480kb CAPP-Seq hybrid capture panel to identify mutations, track tumor burden and minimal residual disease, and detect cfDNA derived from the CAR transgene (CAR-cfDNA) in patients receiving idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel). Flow cytometry (FC) for enumeration of CAR T-cells was performed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) when available.<br \/>Results: We profiled 153 biologic samples, including plasma, PBMCs, and bone marrow mononuclear cells, from 15 patients receiving ide-cel and 18 healthy controls. We observed a median of 84 SNVs (range 30-277) prior to therapy. Patients with prolonged responses (&#62;90 days) had significantly lower circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at day 28 post-infusion than patients with early progression (&#60;90 days) (0.6 vs. 4.6 log haploid genome equivalents (hGE)\/mL; p=0.002). Additionally, higher ctDNA at D28 was prognostic for time to progression (TTP) (HR=1.67, p=0.019). We validated CAR-cfDNA detection by comparison with FC from PBMCs at matched timepoints (n=38), finding a significant correlation (rho=0.79, p=3E-09). CAR-cfDNA typically reached its peak level around D14 (median 332 hGE\/mL), with ctDNA declining at the same time-point. Thus, CAR-cfDNA levels and ctDNA burden were inversely correlated (rho= -0.3, p=0.019). Surprisingly, peak CAR expansion was not associated with TTP (HR=1, p=0.463). However, lower CAR-cfDNA at D28 was prognostic for inferior TTP (HR=2.68, p=0.011). This suggests CAR persistence may play a more important role in clinical outcomes. Furthermore, among progressors, time until loss of detectable CAR-cfDNA correlated with TTP (rho=0.81, p=0.02). Patients who progressed before day 90 had a median CAR persistence of 28 days. In contrast, patients who progressed after day 90 had a median of 137 days and often had emergent copy number alterations in ctDNA at relapse. This included one case with emergent loss of chr16, where <i>TNFRSF17 <\/i>(<i>BCMA<\/i>), resides. This event was detected 36 days prior to clinical relapse; BCMA loss was validated via whole-genome sequencing and immunohistochemistry staining of the tumor.<br \/>Conclusions: Cell-free DNA is a promising biomarker for mutational genotyping, disease monitoring, and tracking CAR T-cells in MM. The persistence of CAR-cfDNA has particular prognostic importance and novel strategies to increase CAR persistence should be explored.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,CAR T cells,Multiple myeloma,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mia Carleton<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hitomi Hosoya<sup>2<\/sup>, Kailee  L.
