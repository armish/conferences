[{"Abstract":"Introduction: As one of the fastest growing cancers globally, melanoma research generates a significant amount of interest. Metastatic melanoma, with roughly a 30% survival rate, drives the need for more diverse therapeutic approaches as surgery alone is often not enough. Targeted immunotherapies are increasing to combat these difficult to treat cancers and monoclonal antibody production is subsequently becoming more important. Additionally, spatial biology of human tissues has escalated in recent years to aid in understanding the tumor microenvironment. As human tissue is precious, the mouse has become the dominate disease model. However, available tools for multiplexing on mouse tissue have evolved at a slower pace, driving the need for diverse biomarkers. Tissue-specific mIF panels utilizing mouse biomarkers were designed and evaluated, demonstrating the interchangeability and specificity of these antibodies.<br \/>Methods: Multiplex immunofluorescent staining on melanoma and cardiac tissues was achieved using Bethyl Laboratories IHC-validated primary antibodies, Bethyl HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and Akoya Opal&#8482; Polaris 7-color IHC kit fluorophores (Akoya Biosciences [NEL861001KT]). The melanoma panel consisted of F4\/80, CD8a, CD31, SOX10, and CD4. Conversely, the cardiac panel included ASMA, CD31, F4\/80, MEF2A, and ATP5A1. Optimization of each antibody was achieved using FFPE mouse immune tissue microarray serial sections. The final optimized order was then tested on mouse melanoma primary tumors and cardiac cross-sections in seven-color mIF. Whole slide scans were generated using the Vectra Polaris&#174; and analyzed via InForm&#174; and R&#174; Studio.<br \/>Results: High expression of SOX10 and F4\/80 in melanoma is indicative of a poor prognosis clinically, making these markers significantly important in a diagnostic setting. Total cell counts of these markers were elevated (40%) in mouse melanoma tissue samples, as compared to normal mouse skin tissue. F4\/80 was then cross evaluated in mouse cardiac tissue samples and showed decreased levels (10%) as compared to normal tissue counterparts. CD31, an endothelial marker, expression was conserved across both tissue types.<br \/>Conclusions: The identification of unique biomarkers involved in cancer development and metastasis is of increasing importance. When examined with the tumor microenvironment in a spatial biology context, these novel targets can provide insight into general tumor composition, prognoses, and treatment options. Here we examined the ability of rabbit antibodies to detect mouse protein in multiplex IHC experiments. Rabbit antibodies, which are either designed for mouse targets or cross-react with mouse targets, are effective reagents to develop mouse multiplex panels. This also aids in closing the gap between human tissue spatial biology experiments and those conducted in mouse models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Mouse,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Danielle Fails<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michael Spencer<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Immunohistochemistry, Fortis Life Sciences, LLC, Montgomery, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bd9262c4-913c-40a7-913f-67b83b7012e6","ControlNumber":"468","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Results were subsequently validated by an external lung ADC cohort, including 108 never-smokers and 61 ever-smokers. Firstly, we showed that ever-smokers had an increased abundance of neutrophils and macrophage infiltration, an elevated antigen processing and presentation capacity, and activated T-cell-mediated immunity. Secondly, ever-smokers revealed elevated macrophages in acinar ADCs, decreased mast cells in lepidic ADCs, and increased neutrophils in papillary ADCs, suggesting the tumor-driven immune characteristic discrepancies among various pathologic subtypes of ADC. Thirdly, we identified mutational disparities in tumor mutation burdens, subclonal single nucleotide variants, and the predicted and expressed neoantigens between ever and never-smokers. The mutant gene KRAS preferably occurred in ever-smokers, further contributing to the infiltration of macrophages and expression of cytokines. The copy number variations of immune-related genes (NFIB, TNFAIP3) were identified as conferring to the dysregulated immune environment in ever-smokers. Moreover, a higher genomic instability index was observed in ever-smokers (p = 0.008). Fourthly, the neoantigen was significantly increased in ever-smoker lung ADCs without nodal disease. While DNA immunoediting preferably occurred in never-smokers. Notably, in lung ADC patients with nodal disease, ever-smokers exhibited slightly more homogenous mutations (p = 0.094), consistent with the evolutionary bottleneck during cancer progression. Finally, the lower immunoediting and higher microenvironment scores significantly determined the more prolonged progression-free survival in never-smokers (p &#60; 0.050). Our multiscale genomic and immune profiling analyses thus offer valuable knowledge of tumor-driven immune disparity arising from smoking and provide a robust solution to the rational design of immune therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Smoking,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaozheng Kang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Liyan Ji<sup>3<\/sup>, Bingfa Yan<sup>3<\/sup>, Xuan Gao<sup>3<\/sup>, Xuefeng Xia<sup>3<\/sup>, Xingsheng Hu<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Surgery, Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Geneplus, Beijing, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"89272b7f-9203-466a-87cc-169fbc74093f","ControlNumber":"2558","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Importantly, PDAC tumors are composed of up to 80% non-tumor cells and an extracellular matrix, yet no studies have been performed to determine whether PDAC EVs are imported preferentially by specific non-tumor cell types. To improve our understanding of this signaling, we aim to define the recipient cells of PDAC EVs and evaluate the functional importance of this internalization. Utilizing an in vitro live imaging system, we found that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) import more PDAC EVs than normal pancreas epithelial, endothelial, or PDAC cells, suggesting PDAC EV trafficking may be preferential to CAFs. We have generated human PDAC and mouse Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup> driven (KPC) PDAC cell lines to express an extracellular particle reporter labeling the inner leaflet of cell membranes with GFP-nLuc. We are currently using this model to characterize recipient cells of the GFP-nLuc-positive EVs in an immunocompetent orthotopic PDAC mouse model. We developed flow cytometry and immunofluorescence panels to assess PDAC EV import by CAFs, endothelial cells, macrophages, B cells, and T cells in developed tumors. Utilizing immunofluorescence staining for a panel of phenotypic markers, we will assess the functional importance of EV internalization. Future studies will begin to determine how EV mRNA cargoes are important for recipient cell phenotypic and functional changes. This study is the first to ascertain the fate of PDAC EVs within the tumor microenvironment in a physiologically relevant model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Post-transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jennifer M.

Mutated leukemic stem cells (LSCs) can remain dormant within the bone marrow (BM) for decades without disease, suggesting the possibility that LSCs could alter the normal crosstalk between HSCs and cells that comprise the BM niche. Therefore, remodeling of the BM niche, in addition to the acquisition of genetic mutations in HSPCs, may be required for full-blown leukemic transformation. Uncovering novel mechanisms by which LSCs remodel their microenvironment may be critical in the hopes of developing novel targeted therapies to completely eradicate the disease. Our lab has previously developed a murine model of AML (<i>Mll<\/i><sup>PTD\/WT<\/sup>; <i>Flt3<\/i><sup>ITD\/WT<\/sup> (PTD; ITD)) that recapitulates important hallmarks of the human disease. This model develops AML sporadically with a preleukemic phase in which they display normal white blood counts (WBCs) and absence of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow. Recently, we observed a persistent decline in red blood cells (RBCs) in these mice that preceded leukemia development without any increases in BM cellularity. Thus, this unique model provides us with an opportunity to evaluate changes in the BM niche that could correlate with LSC emergence. Using this model we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on preleukemic BM niche cells compared to wild-type (WT) controls. Upon performing unbiased clustering, we found 17 stromal cell clusters, with 5 clusters of Lepr+ mesenchymal stromal cells, 3 clusters of endothelial cells, 4 fibroblast clusters, 3 osteo-lineage cell clusters 1 pericyte cluster, and 1 chondrocytes cluster. There was an increase in pericytes, with a shift away from the normal niche regulatory populations including LepR+ mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells in the preleukemic mice. Interestingly, in contrast to other studies examining the BM niche after full blown AML, we found an increase in fibroblasts, specifically CD55+ fibroblasts, that was confirmed by immunohistochemical microscopy. This increase in CD55+ fibroblasts was found to be a result of increased proliferation of this subpopulation. Differential gene expression analysis in revealed down-regulation of several collagen genes including: <i>Col1a1<\/i>, <i>Col1a2<\/i>, <i>Col3a1<\/i>, <i>Col4a1<\/i>, and <i>Col6a1<\/i>. Alterations of ECM proteins in preleukemic BM were confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis, suggesting remodeling of the ECM is an important mechanism by which LSCs lead to alterations in the BM niche and contributes to disease progression. Overall, we have confirmed that LSCs remodel their BM niche leading to an increase in CD55+ fibroblasts expressing decreased levels of critical ECM proteins. These changes might support the maintenance\/generation of preleukemic clones at early stages that could ultimately evolve into leukemic transformation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Bone marrow,Single cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chinmayee Goda<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rohan Kulkarni<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander Rudich<sup>1<\/sup>, Malith Karunasiri<sup>1<\/sup>, Girish Rajgolikar<sup>1<\/sup>, Bethany Mundy-Bosse<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramiro Garzon<sup>1<\/sup>, Elaine Mardis<sup>2<\/sup>, Katherine Miller<sup>2<\/sup>, Adrienne  M.

Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of our primary glioblastoma patient samples identified a significant downregulation of immune response signatures in myeloid cells and lymphoid cells in functionally connected intratumoral regions characterized by upregulated <i>THBS1<\/i>. Understanding the biological significance of immunosuppression within functionally connected intratumoral regions may uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we investigate glioma-neuronal-immune crosstalk across clinical tumor specimens and preclinical syngeneic models through bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (13,670 cells), flow cytometry, and spatial transcriptomics. Using an SB28 murine glioma cell line that endogenously expresses <i>Thbs1<\/i> at high levels, we generated a CRISPR <i>Thbs1<\/i>-knock-out (KO) cell line. In bulk RNA-sequencing data performed on orthotopic tumor models, <i>Thbs1<\/i>-KO tumors were characterized by the downregulated expression of synapse-associated genes and synaptogenic factors and the recovered expression of genes related to immune response. It highlighted the important role of Thrombospondin-1 in synaptogenesis and immunosuppression consistent with the observation from our primary patient tumor samples. Flow cytometry revealed that tumor-associated macrophages isolated from <i>Thbs1<\/i>-KO tumors were more polarized toward the pro-inflammatory &#8220;M1-like&#8221; phenotype (median M1\/M2 ratio = 0.6 [WT] vs. 1.34 [KO], p &#60; 0.006). Unbiased gene expression program analysis using spatial transcriptomics for in vivo tumor-harboring mouse brains demonstrated a significant negative correlation between signatures of synaptogenesis (represented by <i>Ntng1<\/i> and <i>Nlgn3<\/i> genes) and those of immune response (represented by <i>Nfkb1<\/i> and <i>Cd83<\/i> genes). SB28-Thbs1-KO syngeneic models demonstrated slower tumor growth and significantly longer survival compared to Thbs1-WT counterparts (19 days [WT] vs. 25 days [KO], p &#60; 4.5E-5). The survival difference was abrogated in B6-SCID immunodeficient mice, indicating the critical role of adaptive immunity in the survival advantage associated with Thrombospondin-1 downregulation. Our results identify previously unknown immunosuppression mechanisms in the context of glioma-induced intratumoral connectivity via Thrombospondin-1.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms and the EV cargos responsible for mediating these effects are still partly unknown. In tumor microenvironment, macrophages are one of the most abundant cell types and they are composed of several distinct populations that share features of both pro-inflammatory (M1) and immunosuppressive (M2) macrophages. In this study, we investigated the effects of melanoma cell secreted EVs on macrophage polarization.<br \/>In several cancers hyaluronan synthesis is elevated and overexpression of its producing enzyme, hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3), induces EV shedding from the plasma membrane. These HAS3 induced EVs contain a hyaluronan coat around the vesicles. To elucidate the effects of HAS3-induced EVs on target cells, THP1 monocytes were treated with EVs derived from EGFP-HAS3 overexpression MV3 melanoma cells, or from parental MV3 cells, and the expression of cytokines and other factors related in cancer -induced immune modulation was studied.<br \/>EVs were isolated with ultracentrifugation and characterized with Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight NS300) and transmission electron microscopy. THP1 cells were activated with PMA for 48 h and thereafter cells were treated with either control EVs from MV3 cells or hyaluronan coated EVs from HAS3 overexpressing cells for 4-24 h. The expression of pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive markers was studied with qPCR, and the effects on cell morphology with confocal microscopy.<br \/>The size distribution of EVs derived from MV3 and HAS3-MV3 cells was relatively similar, being approximately 100-200 nm in range, while the particle concentration (\/ml) was higher in samples derived from HAS3-MV3 cells. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, like IL-1&#946; and IL-8, and immunosuppressive factors like TSG-6 and PD-L1 was elevated in macrophages treated with MV3 melanoma cell secreted EVs. The effect on expression of the studied factors was more obvious when cells were treated with hyaluronan coated EVs (HAS3-MV3 EVs). This indicates that either the hyaluronan coat around the EVs or their cargo is different compared to control EVs, which causes the effects. Inhibiting TLR4 receptor decreased the cytokine expression induced by HAS3-MV3 EVs, suggesting TLR4-mediated activation after HAS3-MV3 EV exposure. Our results suggest that melanoma cell derived EVs induce mixed M1\/M2 polarization of THP1 monocytes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Macrophages,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Hyaluronan,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sanna Marika Pasonen-Seppänen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Piia Takabe<sup><\/sup>, Kirsi Kainulainen<sup><\/sup>, Kaisa Mäki-Mantila<sup><\/sup>, Riku Korkiamäki<sup><\/sup>, Silvia Lopez Borrego<sup><\/sup>, Taija Hukkanen<sup><\/sup>, Niina Aaltonen<sup><\/sup>, Kirsi Rilla<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3e8e72ba-7a76-45d2-ad4e-d4dabbf82342","ControlNumber":"3442","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

The interaction between cancer cells and adipocytes induces genotypical and phenotypical changes favoring increased invasiveness and metastatic potential of OC cells. In this study we stablish a novel in-vitro direct co-culture model by using immortalized human visceral pre-adipocytes and OC cells to understand the genotypical and phenotypical changes that adipocytes coculture generates over OC cells.<br \/>Materials and Methods: OVCAR5 or OVCAR8 OC cells expressing either GFP or RFP were co-cultured with matured primary immortalized human visceral pre-adipocyte (VNPAD). The cells were seeded together in direct monolayer co-culture. After co-culture, OC cells were sorted by FACS and used to evaluate cell proliferation, resistance to cisplatin and transcriptomic changes.<br \/>Results: Direct co-culture (3 days) of adipocytes and OC cells increased proliferation (p &#60; 0.001), invasiveness (p &#60; 0.005), and induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OC cells relative to cells cultured alone. Co-culture with adipocytes also increased resistance to platinum (cisplatin IC50 from 3.90 &#181;M to 7.07 &#181;M for OVCAR5, and from 7.54 &#181;M to 9.35 &#181;M for OVCAR8 cells). RNAseq of co-cultured OVCAR5 cells detected 7783 differentially expressed genes (FDR&#60;0.05, fold change &#62;2). The most affected pathways included the <i>PI3K\/AKT pathway, inflammatory response, complement activation, and lipid localization<\/i>. Activation of the complement (C) system in cells co-cultured with adipocytes was associated with upregulation of both C3 and C5 which was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, western blot and ELISA. Treatment of primary OC cells with media conditioned by adipocytes increased the expression of C3 and C5 (P&#60;0.05). Similarly, treatment of OVCAR5 cells with a lipid mixture increased expression of C3 and C5 (mRNA and protein). The co-culture of OC cells with adipocytes and the treatment with lipids activated the PI3K pathway and the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway mediated by ATF4. shRNA knockdown of C3 and a chemical inhibitor for the C3 and C5 receptor (sb290157) reverted the increased proliferative phenotype and activation of PI3K in cocultured OC cells. Stable knockdown of C3 with shRNA in OVCAR5 cells reduced tumor volume and tumor weight in an intraperitoneal OC xenograft model (p&#60;0.05). IHC of paired primary tumors and metastatic implants in the omentum showed increased C3 expression adjacent to fat (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Co-culture of adipocytes and cancer cells drives changes in proliferation and cisplatin responsiveness in OC cells. These changes are induced by transfer of lipids from adipocytes to cancer cells and subsequent activation of the complement proteins C3 and C5 through the ISR pathway and ATF4.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Adipocytes Co-Culture,Complement System,Lipids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andres Felipe Valdivia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hao Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Horacio Cardenas<sup>1<\/sup>, Aloysius Klingelhutz<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniela Matei<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Northwestern Univ.

M2 macrophages in the NPC microenvironment are considered to associate with poorer prognosis and promote disease progression. How the tumor-derived EBV or viral products regulate macrophage polarization within NPC microenvironment remains to be explored. We demonstrated that EBV products can be transferred to uninfected cancer cells or stromal cells via exosomes. The exosome-mediated intercellular communications between EBV<sup>+<\/sup>-NPC cells and macrophages were further investigated. Results of mass spectrometry and western blotting showed that NPC cells deposited EBV-encoded latent protein 1 (LMP1) into exosomes. The uptake of these exosomes by human monocyte-derived macrophages led to a M2-dominant polarization. Specifically, multiple properties of M2 macrophages, including higher levels of CD206, CD163, CD209, and VEGF, as well as a reduced expression of iNOS were found in macrophages stimulated with LMP1-containing exosomes (LMP1_exosomes), compared to those treated with exosomes derived from EBV-negative NPC cells. The LMP1_exosome-treated macrophages also exhibited a reduced cytotoxicity towards primary cancer cells. RNA sequencing data revealed that LMP1_exosomes suppressed the function of antigen presentation while activating the macrophage stimulating 1 receptor (MST1R)-STAT3 signaling in macrophages. Results of mechanistic studies showed that LMP1-CTAR2 domain contributed to the activation of MST1R. Additionally, treating macrophages with LMP1_exosomes activated yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), the LMP1-mediated M2 phenotype and MST1R expression were partially suppressed by treating cells with the YAP1 inhibitor (verteporfin). It appears that YAP1 acts as a key regulator of MST1R. Clinically, higher expressions of MST1R and nuclear YAP1 were correlated with disease progression of NPC (p &#60; 0.001). The role of LMP1_exosomes in regulating macrophage immune responses was further investigated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique. Results showed that treating primary macrophages isolated from human head and neck tumors with LMP1_exosomes resulted in an increase in M2 proportion. Results of gene set variation analysis (GSVA) demonstrated enhanced signatures in IL10 and VEGF signalings. Collectively, our data suggest that LMP1-containing exosomes facilitate M2 macrophage polarization, which may assist cancer immune evasion in the NPC microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,Exosomes,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tzu-Tung Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yun-Hua Sui<sup>1<\/sup>, Fang-Yu Tsai<sup>2<\/sup>, Shih-Sheng Jiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Kai-Ping Chang<sup>3<\/sup>, Chen-Han Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shu-Chen Liu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Biomedical Sciences and Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f6765c32-ef5d-44dc-bd12-9e3578dd6a06","ControlNumber":"3582","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Currently, Temozolomide (TMZ) and Bevacizumab are the main approved agents for primary and recurrent GBM, respectively. However, TMZ resistance is frequent and Bevacizumab does not improve overall survival. The heterogeneity of GBM and the presence of a highly selectively permeable blood-brain barrier (BBB) preclude the use of chemotherapeutics approved for other malignancies. Meanwhile, new therapy development is limited in part because most pre-clinical models do not recapitulate the key features of GBM that are relevant to therapy resistance and drug delivery. This is particularly important when validating immunotherapies such as engineered T cell therapy, which has shown some promise in the clinics. We therefore developed an <i>in vitro <\/i>3D model that recapitulates the major features of the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) that are involved in therapy resistance, including the dense tumor core and infiltrating invasive front observed in clinical tumors, surrounded by a perfusable BBB with a physiological permeability. With this model, we investigate the angiogenic nature of GBM, and the role of tumor organization and the TME in TMZ resistance and immunosuppression. We find that TMZ sensitivity decreases as complexity of tumor cell 3D organization increases, and identify pathways potentially associated with TMZ resistance and immunosuppression using proteomics and genomics approaches. Additionally, we find that tumor-associated vasculature has a higher permeability due to VEGFA from GBM tumors, which leads to the downregulation of endothelial junction proteins. Using an IL13Ra2-targetting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell as a model for engineered T cell therapy, we find that tumor-associated vasculature acts as a physical barrier to CAR-T cell extravasation, significantly impeding CAR-T cell efficacy. We then use the model to screen a CAR library to identify novel CAR combinations that can improve CAR-T cell extravasation and cytotoxicity in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,3D models,Glioblastoma,Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maxine  S.

Among stromal cells in TME, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a central role and are involved in various signals through their interaction with cancer cells in most solid tumors, leading to cancer progression and acquisition of drug resistance. Under these TME conditions, tumor cell death such as necrosis occurs, which in turn, results in the ectopic release of bioactive molecules collectively termed as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which has been reported to play an important role in cancer progression. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of cancer cell-derived HMGB1, a representative DAMPs, on CAFs and to investigate whether it could be a potential therapeutic target.<br \/>Methods: We established CAFs from resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens and investigated the biological activity of HMGB1 on CAFs using in vitro co-culture models with NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of targeting cancer cell-derived HMGB1 using anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibody.<br \/>Results: Intracellular HMGB1 was expressed more in NSCLC cells than in normal bronchial epithelial cells and CAFs, and released from cancer cells extracellularly upon treatment with anticancer drugs. The stimulation with recombinant HMGB1 promoted the proliferation of CAFs in a dose-dependent manner, but not lung cancer cells. Co-culture with CAFs promoted cancer cells&#8217; migratory ability and drug resistance, and stimulation with recombinant HMGB1 further enhanced these promoting effects, while administration of anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibody suppressed these effects. On the other hand, these inhibitory effects were not observed in the absence of CAFs, suggestingHMGB1 has effect on CAFs, but not direct on cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusion: HMGB1 plays an important role in cancer progression and acquisition of therapeutic resistance by upregulating the CAFs&#8217; proliferation and activity and could be a therapeutic target in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,NSCLC,Cancer associated fibroblasts,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tomohiro Habu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Keiichi Date<sup><\/sup>, Ken Suzawa<sup><\/sup>, Mao Yoshikawa<sup><\/sup>, Masayoshi Ohki<sup><\/sup>, Kazuma Iwata<sup><\/sup>, Naoki Matsuda<sup><\/sup>, Yin Min Thu<sup><\/sup>, Kazuhiko Shien<sup><\/sup>, Hiromasa Yamamoto<sup><\/sup>, Shinichi Toyooka<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"13513440-470d-4ec8-9d6e-b17f5f05ca6d","ControlNumber":"4199","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Little is known about the relationship between intra-tumor immune and stromal composition and AGCT relapse.<br \/>Objective: To compare global gene expression profiles between primary and recurrent AGCTs, characterize the tumor microenvironment (TME), and identify correlates of disease recurrence.<br \/>Methods: Total RNA sequencing was performed on 24 pathologically confirmed, cryopreserved AGCT samples, including 8 primary and 16 recurrent tumors. Standard methods were applied for read alignment, quality control, and quantification of gene-specific read counts. DESeq2 was used to identify statistically significant (adjusted P-value &#38;lt; 0.05) differentially expressed genes between primary and recurrent tumors with fold change &#38;gt; 2. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using clusterProfiler. Integrative TME composition de-convolution was performed using multiple published algorithms including CIBERSORTx, quanTIseq, xCell, MCP-counter, and EPIC. TME analysis results were externally validated using data from smaller, previously published RNA sequencing datasets.<br \/>Results: Thirty-one genes were identified as differentially expressed between primary and recurrent AGCTs, including NELL2, GDF6, TUBB2B, AQP3. These included genes with known function in hormone signaling such as LHCGR (adjusted P-value = 0.002) and INSL3 (adjusted P-value = 0.017) which were highly expressed in primary tumors and CYP19A1 (adjusted P-value = 0.009) which was highly expressed in recurrent tumors. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed increased expression of hormone-regulated and immune-related gene sets in recurrent tumors. Integrative, multi-platform TME analysis showed recurrent AGCT to exhibit reduced fractions of cancer-associated fibroblasts and enrichment of myeloid lineages such as neutrophils and macrophages.<br \/>Conclusions: Recurrent AGCTs exhibit alterations in hormone pathway gene expression as well as decreased infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts, suggesting dual roles for hormonal signaling and TME remodeling underpinning disease relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Tumor microenvironment,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eleonora Khlebus<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Veena K.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to fuel prostate cancer (PCa) development and metastasis by mutually interacting with tumor cells. Comparative gene expression profile analysis of CAFs and normal fibroblasts, showed that CAFs are characterized by a positive enrichment of gene sets that regulate cytoskeleton remodeling and muscle contractility, including genes coding for calcium, potassium and sodium channels. Here, for the first time, we investigated the effects of cation channel inhibitors, currently used as antiarrhythmic drugs, on CAF-activated state and CAF-PCa cell interplay. Our results showed that antiarrhythmic drugs are able to interfere with crucial features of reactive prostate CAFs, as indicated by changes in cell morphology and modulation of specific fibroblast activation markers, such as &#945;-SMA, fibroblast activation protein and collagen type I. In addition, although to a variable extent, antiarrhythmics reduced CAF motility and hindered CAF capability to remodel extracellular matrix, as assessed by 3D gel contraction and scratch assays. Interestingly, conditioned medium and co-culture experiments reveled that CAFs were able to promote cell growth and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa cells, as indicated by E-cadherin and &#946;-catenin down-regulation and Snail and Vimentin up-regulation. Interestingly, antiarrhythmics partially reverted CAF-mediated protumoral effects, abrogating their ability to foster PCa cell proliferation and plasticity. Moreover, based on previous evidence indicating the involvement of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in CAF-induced EMT on PCa cells, we found that antiarrhythmics impaired the secretory phenotype of CAFs, as indicated by the reduction of MMP-2 releasing in the medium. Finally, gene expression analysis highlighted that antiarrhythmic-treated CAFs showed a gene expression pattern resembling that of normal fibroblasts. Consistent with our in vitro findings, in vivo experiments confirmed that intra-tumoral administration of medium form antiarrhythmic-treated CAF reduced tumor growth rate of PCa xenografts compared to medium form untreated CAFs. Overall, cation channels inhibition interferes with crucial features of prostate CAFs, affecting their activated state. Moreover, co-culture experiments indicate that antiarrhythmics are able to impair CAF-induced proliferative spur and EMT in PCa cells, and also induce tumor growth delay in vivo. Collectively, such data suggest new opportunities for the therapeutic repositioning of antiarrhythmic drugs with the aim of targeting CAFs and hence interrupting their supportive boost in PCa.<b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Valentina Doldi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Monica Tortoreto<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefano Percio<sup>1<\/sup>, Paolo Gandellini<sup>2<\/sup>, Nadia Zaffaroni<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Università degli studi di Milano, Milan, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9ca0d3e1-14f1-494e-a637-f4e33af1c84b","ControlNumber":"4367","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

It remains an incurable cancer due to drug resistance, wherein the bone marrow microenvironment plays a crucial role. We have previously shown that glutamine-to-proline conversion is upregulated in MM cells upon hypoxic culture. Moreover, inhibition of proline production by blocking its converting enzyme PYCR1 successfully reduced proliferation and viability in vitro. Importantly, PYCR1 inhibition combined with standard-of-care agent bortezomib decreased tumor load in vivo. As PYCR1 is also highly expressed in stromal cells and proline an important component of extracellular matrix proteins, we investigated whether PYCR1 targeting in stromal cells affects MM viability and its structural microenvironment.<br \/><u>Material and methods<\/u> PYCR1 expression was investigated by the use of microarray data from the Heidelberg\/Montpellier cohort. For in vitro experiments, the human MM cell line OPM-2 and human stromal cell line HS-5 were used. CD138+ and CD138- fractions from primary patient samples were separated by MACS. To obtain primary stromal cells, the CD138- fraction was plated out in fresh medium. After 48h, the medium was refreshed and all adherent cells were further cultured and used as primary stromal cells. PYCR1 expression in HS-5 cells was reduced through siRNA. Hypoxic culture (&#60;1% O<sub>2<\/sub>) was established through chambers. RNA expression was measured by RT-qPCR, while protein expression was measured by western blot. Viability was assessed by CellTiterGlo assay.<br \/><u>Results<\/u> Gene expression analysis shows high RNA expression of PYCR1 in healthy bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs), plasma cells from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM patients, but also in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). PYCR1 expression was low or absent in other cell types, including T cells, osteoclasts, monocytic and granulocytic cells. On protein level, we also confirmed PYCR1 expression in MM cells (CD138+), CD138- fraction (including stromal cells) and cultured primary stromal cells. Moreover, PYCR1 expression increased upon hypoxic culture in primary stromal cells and stromal cell line HS-5. PYCR1 knockdown in stromal cell line HS-5 did not affect viability of the stromal cells, but its conditioned medium did reduce its protective effects when OPM-2 MM cells were treated with standard-of-care agent bortezomib. Further investigation revealed that knockdown of PYCR1 in HS-5 reduces RNA expression of structural proteins col1a1, col1a2, col3a1, ctgf and acta2 in HS-5.<br \/><u>Conclusion<\/u> PYCR1 is highly expressed in myeloma cells and stromal cells. PYCR1 inhibition in stromal cells reduces its proliferative effect on myeloma cells when combined with bortezomib. Preliminary data indicates a link between PYCR expression in stromal cells and rearrangement of extracellular matrix proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Stroma,Collagen,Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Inge Oudaert<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Catharina Muylaert<sup>1<\/sup>, Hatice Satilmis<sup>1<\/sup>, Sylvia Faict<sup>2<\/sup>, Kim De Veirman<sup>1<\/sup>, Elke De Bruyne<sup>1<\/sup>, Karin Vanderkerken<sup>1<\/sup>, Eline Menu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hematology and Immunology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>Hematology, UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"09a967be-4896-49d3-88b9-fc1988e7c332","ControlNumber":"4796","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Males and females differ in their levels of sex hormones androgens and estrogens. These sex hormones have varying influences on immune cell populations, which in turn may affect disease progression. Thus, the sex of the patient and the levels of sex hormones are likely important for anticancer immunity. Here, we assessed the importance of sex hormone signaling in the immune cells (host) versus the tumor cells for defining the immune landscape associated with primary and metastatic tumors. We used flow cytometry to determine the immune profile of mammary tumors, spleens, and lungs, and histochemistry to evaluate metastasis in transgenic MMTV-PyMT and in mice orthotopically injected with sex-specific MMTV-PyMT-derived cell lines in male and female cohorts. In transgenic mice, males had greater proportions of CD4+ T-helper and total myeloid cells in all organs analyzed. The splenic and pulmonary immune profiles of tumor-bearing males were more similar to cancer-free littermates than in females. Interestingly, males trended towards increased metastatic colonization in the lungs. Sex-associated immune profiles differed between transgenic and orthotopic mice. In mice bearing male-derived R221a PyMT tumors, females had decreased intratumoral neutrophils and elevated natural killer cells with increased splenic B-cells in comparison to males. Overall, our data supports a sex-dependent immune response in mammary carcinoma that is, in part, regulated by the hormonal environment of the host. With emerging therapeutics targeting the tumor immune microenvironment, characterization of immune profiles is critical for optimizing their use in all breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Steroid hormones,Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ebony Hargrove-Wiley<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Barbara Fingleton<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"14a193bc-c711-4e55-97df-92f49ac1dcd8","ControlNumber":"4691","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

One important factor that contributes to poor treatment outcomes is the histologic heterogeneity of MIBC tumors, which limits the translational value of some rodent models. As opposed to mice, dogs with spontaneously occurring bladder cancer have been shown to present with similar clinical behavior as human MIBC. In addition, canines have an intact immune system, which could provide for an ideal pre-clinical study population to investigate the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this study, we evaluated canine MIBC tumor biopsies for their similarities to human MIBC with regards to histology and immune cell infiltration.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: Nine canine MIBC tumor samples were provided by the ISU pathology service and evaluated by a human uropathologist. Canine MIBC tumors were phenotypically characterized using either immunofluorescence (IF) or RNA <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization (RNA-ISH), including CD44, KRT7 and FOXA1, as well as specific markers characterizing the immune cell infiltrate, such as CD163 (tumor-associated macrophages), CD8a (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes), PD-L1 (immune-checkpoint protein) and TGF&#946;2 (cancer-associated fibroblasts).<br \/>Results: Histologically, all canine MIBCs were classified as invasive, high-grade urothelial carcinomas (UC) with identical morphology to human MIBC. Interestingly, previously described histological variants of human MIBC tumors were also observed within the canine MIBC samples, such as glandular differentiation in 3\/9 canine MIBC samples; epithelial-mesenchymal transition with sarcomatoid differentiation 1\/9, squamous differentiation in 2\/9 and micropapillary carcinoma in 1\/9, all of which have been associated with poor clinical outcomes in human patients. IF was strongly positive for KRT7, FOXA1 and CD44, and immune cell markers CD163 and TGF&#946;2. However, CD8a was only weakly expressed (5\/9) or negative, and PD-L1 was only positive in 4\/9 canine MIBC biopsies.<br \/>Conclusions: Canine MIBC tumors showed significant heterogeneity with highly similar histological variant morphologies to those reported in humans with MIBC. Furthermore, phenotypic characterization of immune cell infiltrates and checkpoint proteins suggest that the tumors were typically immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221;. These data further establish the utility of the spontaneous canine model of MIBC for pre-clinical investigation of novel therapeutic drug candidates, including immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Histopathology,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Karin Allenspach<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, John Cheville<sup>2<\/sup>, Hannah Wickham<sup>3<\/sup>, Christopher Zdyrski<sup>3<\/sup>, Vojtech Gabriel<sup>3<\/sup>, Basant Ahmed<sup>4<\/sup>, Mei-Jyun Ciou<sup>4<\/sup>, Fabrice Lucien<sup>2<\/sup>, Igor Frank<sup>2<\/sup>, Olufemi Fasina<sup>5<\/sup>, Pablo Pineyro<sup>5<\/sup>, Johnathan  P.

The glycoprotein pentraxin-3 (PTX3), a modulator of inflammation, is correlated with the severity of some cancers. However, the mechanism responsible for the oncogenic role of PTX3 in GBM malignancy remains unclear. Our previous study examined the role of PTX3 in GBM growth, angiogenesis, and invasion using in vitro glioblastoma cells and in vivo\/pre-clinical GBM models, proteomic profiling, molecular and biochemical approaches. Over-expression of PTX3 in U87 brain tumor cells correlated with cell cycle progression, increased migratory potential, and survival under hypoxic conditions. PTX3 over-expression increased blood vessel forming ability of endothelial cells. Importantly, PTX3 over-expression increased tumor growth, micro-vessel density, and invasion in brains of an orthotopic mouse model. To understand the molecular mechanisms associated with PTX3 mediated tumor aggressiveness, we further examined the effects of PTX3 on mRNA levels of genes involved in motility\/invasion, angiogenesis, and inflammation using pathway specific gene arrays. PTX3 over expression was associated with the 5-fold upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1&#945;, which in turn transactivates several genes essential for tumor growth and survival. Indeed, higher PTX3 expression led to increased mRNA levels of genes involved in motility, angiogenesis, and inflammation. The upregulated motility associated genes included ARHGEF7, RAC1, and PAK, a protein kinase involved in intracellular signaling pathways downstream of integrins. Inflammatory genes that were increased in expression included IL-1beta, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL5 that amplifies a proinflammatory cytokine response via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-NF-kappa B pathway. The upregulated pro-angiogenic genes included interleukin-8 (IL-8), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), expression of which correlates with GBM malignancy. Interestingly PTX3 decreased the levels of thrombospondin-1 that inhibits angiogenesis. Thus, PTX3 appears to trigger multiple signaling pathways that enhance the aggressive behavior of tumor cells. Taken together, our study indicates that targeted therapy such as blocking PTX3 may reduce the aggressiveness of glioblastomas through regulation of multiple molecular pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Angiogenesis,Invasion,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Umadevi V.

Recurrent endometrial cancers, which are mostly from high-grade endometrial cancers (HGEC), have limited treatment options and display extremely poor response rates upon chemotherapies, thus showing very poor prognosis. Immunotherapy revolutionized the field of cancer medicine, but the lack of scalable and sustainable pre-clinical models for HGEC poses a significant challenge in studying critical immunological aspects of HGEC. We therefore established a comprehensive endometrial cancer biobank comprising primary tissues, patient-derived organoids (PDO), and their matching immune cells from all existing HGEC types, enabling us to establish an autologous interaction between cancer and immune cells in vitro. The inactivation of antigen processing and presentation (APP) pathways is one of the major mechanisms for immune evasion in many cancer types including HGEC. Using a subset of our biobank, we performed bulk RNA-seq on 11 normal-cancer PDO pairs and found that genes involved in APP pathways are downregulated in HGEC organoids. qPCR assays confirmed that Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHCs) are downregulated in HGEC organoids. The suppression of MHC expression could be reverted by external stimuli such as IFNg and Tazemetostat, an EZH2 inhibitor. We then assessed the effects of enhanced MHC-I and -II expression mediated by the two molecules on cancer-immune cell interactions by setting up organoid-immune cell co-cultures using autologous PBMC, CD4, and CD8 T cells. Our data show that HGEC organoids that were pre-treated with IFNg or Tazemetostat display a greater immune cell co-localization and immune cell-mediated apoptosis during the co-culture period. Using our co-culture platform, we next evaluated the efficacy of different immunotherapeutic modalities such as NK cell transfer, bi-specific T-cell engagers, and CAR-T cells on HGEC. Our proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate the utility of our co-culture system in studying the autologous cancer-immune cell interactions from the same patient&nbsp;<i>ex vivo<\/i>. Our sustainable and scalable testing platform could be used to assess the safety and efficacy of current therapeutics or to identify new therapeutics that enhance immune responses against advanced cancers lacking effective treatment options such as HGEC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Immunomodulation,Immunotherapy,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Charlie Chung<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aaron Nizam<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian Yueh<sup>1<\/sup>, Santhilal Subhash<sup>1<\/sup>, Onur Eskiocak<sup>1<\/sup>, Marina Frimer<sup>2<\/sup>, Gary  L.

The mechanisms underpinning metastasis in PDAC have not been identified. The TMEM doorway is the sole portal of intravasation in breast cancer [2, 3]. Importantly, intravasation and dissemination via TMEM doorways is inhibited by Tie2 blockade in breast cancer [4]. We evaluated whether TMEM Doorways are a common targetable mechanism of dissemination in PDAC.<br \/>Methods: Tumor samples from treatment-na&#239;ve patients who underwent curative-intent resection of PDAC were stained for TMEM doorways using a triple immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain (tumor cells expressing the actin regulatory protein Mena, macrophages expressing CD68, and endothelial cells expressing CD31). TMEM doorways were manually counted in the highest TMEM doorway-bearing 400x field (hotspot) identified at 100x scanning magnification for each case. TMEM doorway function was assessed in a murine model of PDAC treated with or without rebastinib (an investigational oral Tie2 inhibitor [4]) by analyzing; (1) TMEM doorway mediated opening using high-molecular weight dextran (155kD-TMR dextran); (2) circulating tumor cells and (3) disseminated tumor cells in murine livers. The Wilcoxon Test was used for the human TMEM doorway scoring comparisons. A student t-test was used for the murine analyses.<br \/>Results: TMEM doorways were observed in all PDAC tumors from 50 unique treatment-na&#239;ve patients. The TMEM doorway score was &#8776;6x higher than observed in published breast cancer patient samples. Mean TMEM doorway score in &#8220;hotspots&#8221; from resected human PDAC was 19 and 34 in low- and high-grade tumors, respectively (p-value &#60; 0.01). TMEM doorway mediated opening was decreased by rebastinib treatment (159.8 &#181;m<sup>2<\/sup> &#177; sd26.5 vs 22.6 &#181;m<sup>2<\/sup> &#177; sd3.5, p&#60;0.01). PDAC tumor bearing mice treated with rebastinib had a 6.5-fold decrease in the number of circulating tumor cells compared to control (5554 &#177; sd1017 vs 852 &#177; sd412 cells\/mL blood, p&#60;0.01). PDAC tumor bearing mice treated with rebastinib had fewer disseminated tumor cells compared to untreated mice (11.6 vs 7.0 DTCs\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>).<br \/>Conclusions: TMEM doorways appear to be a common mechanism of dissemination in PDAC and breast cancer. TMEM doorway concentration is significantly associated with PDAC tumor grade. Inhibition of Tie2 with the selective inhibitor, rebastinib, preclinically leads to decreased TMEM doorway function and dissemination in PDAC. Tie2 is a promising therapeutic target for decreasing dissemination and potential metastasis in PDAC that warrants further clinical development in the PDAC space.<br \/>1.Siegel, R.L., et al<i>.<\/i> CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 2022. <b>72<\/b>(1): p. 7-33.2.Harney, A.S., et al.

Intra-tumoral nerves play critical roles in cancer initiation, progression, recurrence, treatment-resistance, metastasis, and mortality for many malignancies but the diverse molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-nerve crosstalk remain largely unknown&#8212;hindering the development of therapies targeting this key pathological process. To address this gap, we performed whole transcriptome digital spatial profiling on twelve custom tissue microarrays (n=288 cores) derived from intratumorally-matched regions with and without PNI in primary PDAC specimens (n=31 patients) and independently measured gene expression from cancer cells, fibroblasts, and nerves. We undertook a differential gene expression analysis comparing malignant cells in PNI-present and -absent regions. We quantified the growth kinetics of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons cultured with exogenous candidate proteins, which validated that some candidates augment (e.g., <i>Lgals1<\/i>) and others inhibit (e.g., <i>Sema3b<\/i>) neurite outgrowth. Next, we mapped our previously discovered malignant cell programs onto the epithelial segments and observed a significant enrichment of the mesenchymal, basal-like, and neural-like progenitor (NRP) programs versus depletion of the classical program in PNI-present regions. To determine the effects of malignant subtype on nerve outgrowth, we engineered isogenic <i>Kras<\/i><sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>;<i>Trp53<\/i><sup>FL\/FL<\/sup>;<i>Rosa26<\/i>-dCas9-VPR (KP;dCas9-VPR) organoids to overexpress the master transcription factors (TFs) for each malignant subtype (e.g., <i>Gata6 <\/i>for classical, <i>Glis3 <\/i>for NRP). We then performed the DRG neuronal outgrowth assay using conditioned media from each subtype-specific organoid line versus an off-target control and observed that the classical line suppressed neurite outgrowth, the mesenchymal and basal-like lines were neutral, and the NRP line enhanced neurite outgrowth dynamics comparable to the <i>Ngf <\/i>positive control. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying nerve recruitment\/outgrowth and perineural invasion may be partly decoupled. To further test this hypothesis, we are performing transwell invasion assays comparing KP;dCas9-VPR cancer cell lines that overexpress each of the candidate PNI-associated genes and malignant subtype TFs. We anticipate that this study will transform our understanding of how cancer cells and the peripheral nervous system collaborate and guide prioritization for therapeutic intervention in the burgeoning cancer neuroscience field.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Stromal-epithelial interactions,Tumor invasion,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>William L.

In addition, autophagy can protect cells from diverse types of cellular stress produced by amino acid starvation and hypoxia, providing energy to retain the function of organelles and cellular signaling pathways. In cancer, autophagy can play dual roles, inhibiting tumor cell growth and viability or sustaining cancer cells in hypoxic, nutrient poor microenvironments. DIRAS3 (ARHI), a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene, encodes a 26-kDa GTPase that has 60% homology to Ras and is downregulated in the majority of ovarian cancers. Re-expression of DIRAS3 inhibits growth of ovarian cancer cells, slows their motility and induces autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway. Previously, we have shown that DIRAS3-induced autophagy inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth and promotes autophagic cell death in culture while inducing tumor dormancy in vivo. We have demonstrated that growth factors and extracellular membrane components including fibronectin (FN) in the tumor microenvironment can rescue ovarian cancer cells from DIRAS3-induced autophagic death in cell culture and the use of antibodies against those growth factors or their receptors can eliminate dormant autophagic ovarian cancer cells in ovarian cancer xenografts. In the current study, we explored whether FN, a ubiquitous extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein also plays an important role in DIRAS3-induced tumor dormancy. We hypothesized that FN blocks DIRAS3-induced growth inhibition in ovarian cancer. We investigated the effect of FN on cultured ovarian cancer cells in the presence and absence of DIRAS3. We found that DIRAS3-induced autophagy was inhibited by FN in ovarian cancer cells, judged by decreased conversion of LC3I to LC3II on Western blots and reduced LC3 puncta detected by fluorescence staining. We also found that FN partially rescues ovarian cancer cells from DIRAS3-induced cell death in culture. Mechanistically, FN weakened the inhibitory effect of DIRAS3 on p-FAK and p-AKT, whereas addition of neutralizing antibody against integrin &#946;1 decreased p-FAK and p-AKT. In addition, FN and FN-mediated FAK\/AKT signaling is elevated in tumor xenograft tissue when compared to cancer cells in culture. Pharmacologic inhibition of FAK using defactinib, enhanced DIRAS3-induced autophagy, inducing cell death in ovarian cancer cells in the presence of FN. Together, our data demonstrate that factors such as FN, block DIRAS3-induced autophagic cell death, contributing to the survival of ovarian cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Ovarian cancer,Tumor suppressor gene,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Janice M.

There are limited methods to study the to study the contribution of the microenvironment. We have adapted a solid tumour microenvironment cell culture system that provides elements of the CLL microenvironment called Analysis of CLL Cellular Environment and Response (ACCER). We optimized the cell number for patient&#8217;s primary CLL cells and HS-5 human bone marrow stromal cell line that will give sufficient cell number and viability with the ACCER. We then determined the amount of collagen type 1 to give the best extracellular matrix to seed CLL cells to the membrane. Finally, we determined that ACCER provide CLL cell protection against cell death following treatment with fludarabine and ibrutinib compared to co-culture conditions. This describes novel microenvironment model to investigate factors that promote drug resistance and cell survival in CLL. In the future, this will further validate new treatment strategies to overcome microenvironmental CLL cell survival signals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Drug resistance,Targeted therapy,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Spencer Gibson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tricia Choquette<sup>2<\/sup>, Elizabeth S.

However, a large proportion of patients do not respond or develop acquired resistance. Tumors can activate multiple checkpoints and immunosuppressive pathways to evade immune surveillance, which are likely a cause of treatment failure. Therefore, inhibition of multiple checkpoints may be necessary for maximal efficacy of immunotherapies. The adenosine A2 receptor (A2aR), was shown to function as an immune checkpoint. Its blockade inhibited tumor growth and metastases and synergized with other checkpoint inhibitors. We propose that using AZD4635, a potent and selective A2aR antagonist, will enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1\/PD-L1. In addition, we propose that blocking tumor oxygen consumption using deferiprone (DFP), phenformin (Phen) and metformin (Met) will further enhance A2aR and PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade efficacy. We evaluated the effects of MET, Phen, DFP, and AZD4635 on tumor cells, T cell, and macrophage proliferation and effector function in vitro. IC50 measurements showed that T cells are the most sensitive to inhibition by these drugs, while 4T1 tumor cells appear to be the least sensitive. Na&#239;ve mouse T cells were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 coated dynabeads in the presence of titrating doses of all four drugs for 72 hours then analyzed by flow cytometry for proliferation and activation status. AZD4635 and DFP increased the expression of the activation marker CD25 (IL2Ra) on CD8 T cells. In addition, AZD4635 also increased expression of Granzyme B on both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Met appears to have little to no effect on T cell proliferation activation. We utilized the Seahorse XF Mito Stress Test assay to measure the mitochondrial respiratory activity of T cells in the presence these drugs. T cells were activated with dynabeads for 72 hours and then incubated with titrating doses of the drugs overnight before running on the Seahorse assay. DFP and Phen had the strongest effect on Maximal Respiration and Spare Respiratory Capacity at dilutions of 1uM followed by 16uM. A similar, albeit less profound effect was observed in groups treated with Met and AZD4635. Lastly, we obtained and generated two mouse breast cancer cell lines (4T1 and E0771) bearing HIF-1 reporter systems. We treated 4T1-HRE and E0771 cells with increasing doses of cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2<\/sub>) to chemically mimic hypoxia by inducing HIF1a expression. Both 4T1-HRE and E0771-HRE demonstrated increased luciferase activity that correlated with increasing doses of CoCl<sub>2<\/sub> in vitro. Future experiments will focus on characterizing the adenosine pathway in vivo in 4T1-HRE and E0771-HRE tumors and examine how drugs that target the adenosine A2AaR receptor (AZD4635), and oxygen consumption (DFP, Phen and Met) influence tumor oxygen consumption in vivo as well as the activation states of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Metabolism,Adenosine,Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sadna Budhu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mayuresh Mane<sup>2<\/sup>, Mamadou  A.

During the process of aging, cellular and molecular changes that occur in non-cancerous cells can alter responses to cancer therapy and immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeting senescent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) by means of removal, modulation of the SASP, or through cellular reprogramming represent therapeutic avenues for treating cancer. Heterogeneity of CAFs is emerging as an important area of investigation in cancer therapy. To better elucidate the interplay between cancer cells, immune cells, and senescent fibroblasts from different tissues and determine their impact on tumor growth and response to cancer therapy, we investigated the heterogeneity of cytokine secretion in senescent fibroblasts by a single cell cytokine assay. Control and treated proliferating and senescent fibroblasts were loaded onto IsoPlexis IsoCode chips coated with multiplexed antibodies which allows detection of 32 cytokines at a single-cell level for frequency and intensity. The Polyfunctional Strength Index (PSI) showed that stimulatory and chemo-attractant cytokines were dominant in the senescent fibroblasts. The Polyfunctional heat map showed that there are subpopulations of cells which have polyfunctional cytokine secretion (&#62;2 different cytokines) in live senescent IMR90 cells. Treatment with ONC201 reduced cytokine polyfunctionality in live senescent IMR90 cells. Although ABT-263 (small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) did not show a significant reduction of polyfunctionality in live senescent IMR90, the frequency showed that ABT-263 reduced the secretion frequency of live senescent IMR90 cells except for GM-CSF. Combining ONC201 and ABT-263 diminished polyfunctionality and secretion frequency of senescent IMR90 cells except for MIF which was detected in 1.5% of the cells. Single cell cytokine profiling of live cells in the complex tumor microenvironment is providing insights into tumor progression, therapy resistance, and the effects of senolytic drugs and drug combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Cytokines,Cancer associated fibroblasts,ONC201,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lanlan Zhou<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Shengliang Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Kelsey  E.

A pharmacological therapy for this atrophy does not exist, in part because of an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms which are causative in the condition. We recently identified that <i>Trim63<\/i>\/MuRF1 is elevated in skeletal myonuclei from cachectic mice and people with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) compared to non-cancer controls. MuRF1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, specific to striated muscle that targets proteins for degradation. Based on this finding, we investigated the requirement of MuRF1 for PDAC-induced muscle atrophy. Murine KPC cells (or saline) were injected orthotopically into the pancreas of WT and MuRF1 KO mice, and tissues harvested at several time points throughout tumor progression. WT KPC mice showed loss of tumor-free body mass and muscle mass by day 12, and reached experimental endpoint on day 16, defined by significant body wasting in combination with a body condition score &#8804;2. At endpoint, WT KPC mice showed significant muscle wasting (-8-17%), muscle weakness (-32-46%), fat wasting (-71%) and splenomegaly (+100%) and had a mean tumor mass of 1.9 &#177; 0.5 g. At this same timepoint (day 16), MuRF1 KO KPC mice were completely protected from body, muscle and fat wasting, with KPC tumors in MuRF1 KO mice 84% smaller than in WT mice. We therefore tracked an additional cohort of MuRF1 KO KPC mice until their tumors reached a comparable size to that of WT mice at their endpoint which, on average, was reached on day 32. Despite having comparable tumor mass at this time point, MuRF1 KO mice remained protected from body, muscle and fat wasting, and were spared from muscle weakness. Using ubiquitin proteomics in muscle, we found that MuRF1 was responsible for the ubiquitination of multiple cytoskeletal and contractile proteins&#8212;whose proteolytic degradation into amino acids may contribute to myofiber atrophy and help fuel tumor growth. To explore the impact of MuRF1 deletion on tumor metabolism we conducted global metabolomic profiling of KPC tumors from WT mice on day 16, and from MuRF1 KO mice on day 16 and at matched tumor size. Overall, these analyses revealed an accumulation of metabolites in tumors from MuRF1 KO mice, including glucose, amino acids and amino acid derivatives, suggesting that pancreatic tumors in mice spared from muscle wasting may be less metabolically active. In summary, these combined findings demonstrate that MuRF1 is required for KPC-induced skeletal muscle catabolism, whose deletion impinges on normal tumor metabolism and delays tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Systems biology,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Daria Neyroud<sup>1<\/sup>, Orlando Laitano<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Lopez<sup>1<\/sup>, David  W.
