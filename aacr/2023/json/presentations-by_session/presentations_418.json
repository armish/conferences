[{"Abstract":"Translational preclinical assessment of myeloid-targeting therapies is considered challenging due to the reduced availability of humanized mouse models expressing both lymphoid and myeloid compartments. Most of the humanized models harboring myeloid compartment overexpress human cytokines, leading to body weight loss, anemia and a short life span. Recent report described the BRGSF-HIS as an alternative model displaying all major human hematopoietic cell subsets, such as B, T, natural killer (NK), dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) and monocytes\/macrophages. Human myeloid cells developed in the BRGSF-HIS mice without side effects and human immune system engraftment is stable for over a year (Labarthe et al<\/i>., 2019), favoring long terms studies with agents requiring a wide therapeutic window. Here we report that myeloid compartment developed in BRGSF-HIS mice is recruited in the tumor microenvironment of tumor bearing mice, and are also capable of triggering effector mechanisms such as ADCP and ADCC. Myeloid cells developed in the BRGSF-HIS mice are functional as,<i> ex vivo<\/i> stimulation with TLR and STING agonists induce CD83 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, CCL2, &#8943;) by monocytes and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM). <i>In vivo<\/i>, myeloid cells are activated through LPS challenge, leading to increased CD83-expressing cDCs frequency and CD83 and CD86 expression levels. Furthermore, BMDM are efficiently skewed toward M1 and M2-like profiles in response to LPS and IL-4, respectively. Analyses of TME from MDA-MB-231, show the recruitment of human immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, cDC and activated M2 macrophages (expressing both CD86 and CD206). Expression of Fc&#947;R, essential for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activities, is found on human peritoneal macrophages and BMDM from BRGSF-HIS. ADCP activity mediated by macrophages was established as tumor cells are specifically phagocyted <i>ex vivo <\/i>in presence of a bispecific antibody (anti-human CD47 x tumor-associated antigen). Such findings were corroborated by B cell depletion <i>in vivo<\/i> induced by Rituximab (anti-CD20 mAb - hIgG1), which has been described to trigger CDC, ADCC and ADCP via Fc&#947;R (Teige <i>et al<\/i>., 2019). Finally, OKT3 induces cytokine release syndrome in these mice, evidenced by cytokine release, body weight and temperature drop. Treatment with Infliximab reduced these symptoms, suggesting that BRGSF-HIS mice enable assessment of safety and its clinical management. In summary, BRGSF-HIS mice develop myeloid cells without side effects and has a wide therapeutic window, enabling the assessment of effector mechanisms such as ADCP and ADCC, triggered by of myeloid-targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Myeloid directed therapy,humanized mice,BRGSF-HIS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Florence Renart-Depontieu<sup>1<\/sup>, Gaëlle Martin<sup>1<\/sup>, Valery Moine<sup>2<\/sup>, Coline Burnet-Merlin<sup>2<\/sup>, Florent Creusat<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexis Gonon<sup>1<\/sup>, Perrine Martin-Jeantet<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Fabiane Sônego<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lise Nouveau<sup>2<\/sup>, Yacine Cherifi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kader Thiam<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>genOway, Lyon, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Light Chain Bioscience, Plan-Les-Ouates Genève, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0ea4f385-c2b1-471b-85c2-0144bbd4efda","ControlNumber":"4402","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;F.

While this research suggests exercise may improve health in cancer patients, the specific mechanisms by which exercise influences tumor progression remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that exercise alters the gut microbiome and promotes immune cell activation in relevant immune sites. Therefore, we utilized BBN (N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine), a carcinogen that mimics human muscle invasive bladder cancer conditions, and voluntary exercise wheels to determine the effect of exercise on bladder carcinogenesis, gut microbiome, and the immune system. Ultrasound imaging revealed that the average tumor volume of female exercising mice was 11.9% of the total bladder volume at time of sacrifice, while the tumor volume of their non-exercising counterparts was 56.4%, a difference determined to be significant using a two-tailed t-test with p-value of 0.05. A similar trend was seen in male mice, though the difference between groups was not significant. Immune cell analysis did not show significant variation in cytotoxic T cell, helper T cell, macrophage, or dendritic cell populations between exercising and non-exercising mice in spleen, colon, or bladder tissues as measured by FACS. Standardization of the amount exercised, as evaluated by expression of myosin and actin levels in the tibialis anterior muscle, and sequencing of the gut microbiome are in progress and could better indicate the mechanism of exercise-induced tumor suppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exercise,Immune cells,Bladder cancer,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joseph P.

GD2 is expressed on many solid tumors, including most melanomas, and is not often expressed on immune cells. Mice cured with ISV of B78 tumors demonstrate long-term immune memory, with mice rejecting tumor rechallenge &#62;180 days post initial cure of tumor. Traditionally, immune effector memory is thought to be mediated via CD8 T cells, which require antigen presentation via MHC Class I (MHCI). However, B78s express little to no MHCI, but do express MHCII when stimulated with IFN&#947;. Expressed on 50-70% of melanomas in humans, the role of MHCII on response is unclear. We explored implications of MHCII and MHCI expression on response (initial response to ISV and memory response).<br \/>Mice bearing B78s depleted of NK cells or CD8 T cells during ISV respond to therapy, but mice depleted of CD4 T cells fail to respond to ISV. Likewise, B78-cured mice depleted of NK and CD8 T cells during rechallenge are able to reject the B78 tumor rechallenge, whereas those depleted of CD4 T cells failed to reject their B78 rechallenge. Together these data suggest that CD4 T cells are required for the initial antitumor response to ISV as well as for immune memory formation and function.<br \/>Tumors and tumor draining lymph nodes were harvested during ISV treatment in B78-bearing mice at D8 and assessed by scRNAseq, flow cytometry, IncuCyte and ImageStream (live-cell imaging assays), and IsoPlexis (cytokine profile). Though not required for initial or memory response, both CD8 and NK cells are activated and exhibit cytotoxic phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, a population of cells co-expressing both GD2 and CD45 was observed in the TME following ISV that was not observed in untreated mice. These GD2+\/CD45+ cells were predominantly CD4+ T cells incorporate patchy GD2 expression on their surface via trogocytosis. We hypothesize that the interaction between MHCII on tumor cells and CD4 T cell receptors mediates the trogocytosis, activating CD4 T cells to function as helper T cells, initiating a cascade of antitumor immunity, as well as causing direct CD4 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity.<br \/>MHCII is expressed on some melanoma tumors, and its expression has been correlated with a positive response to immunotherapies. MHCII expression on tumors can directly engage CD4 cytotoxic T cells, suggesting an important role in the response to immunotherapy for CD4 T cells in melanoma tumors that express MHCII. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the ISV-induced immune recognition and destruction of B78 may guide future improvements of this clinically-relevant immunotherapy regimen.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,MHC II,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amy K.

In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved treatment of solid tumors including HCC. However, due to low response rates with current standard of care immunotherapy and angiogenic inhibitors, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against HCC. Our lab has shown that 6-thio-2&#8217; deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG), a telomerase-mediated telomere targeting agent, is incorporated into newly synthesized telomeres by telomerase and causes rapid telomere uncapping, thereby inducing telomere-associated DNA damage in cancer cells. These damaged DNA fragments can then lead to enhanced adaptive immune responses. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of 6-thio-dG <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> together with ICIs in liver tumors to determine whether combining immunotherapy with a telomere-targeting agent could serve as an effective strategy for HCC. To explore whether 6-thio-dG is effective in killing liver cancer cells, we ran cell viability and telomere dysfunction induced foci (TIF) assays to assess DNA damage on telomeres <i>in vitro<\/i> and compared tumor volumes of mice following 6-thio-dG monotherapy, immunotherapy, and sequential treatment of 6-thio-dG and immunotherapy in syngeneic mouse models. We observed that 6-thio-dG reduced cell viability and induced telomere dysfunction in a panel of human and mouse liver cancer cells. In addition, 6-thio-dG enhanced the therapeutic effect of immunotherapies in liver syngeneic mouse models. Overall, our findings show that the telomere-targeting anticancer agent 6-thio-dG inhibits HCC as a single monotherapy and\/or sequential therapy together with immunotherapies. These results provide an experimental rationale for a potentially new immunochemotherapy strategy based on the administration of a telomere-targeting agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Immunotherapy,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Telomerase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ann Marie Flusche<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jerry Shay<sup>1<\/sup>, Ilgen Mender Ogunrinde<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>MAIA Biotechnology, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1abae3a3-f18f-4332-a17c-19eea56235d3","ControlNumber":"3889","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

PRX3 is a critical reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzyme localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Our group has characterized the mechanism of action of the PRX3 inhibitor and pro-oxidant therapeutic thiostrepton (TS). TS covalently crosslinks the peroxidatic and resolving cysteines of PRX3, leading to increased levels of mitochondrial ROS, resulting in tumor cell death. We have characterized the cellular and chemical composition of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) from patients with advanced cancer and evaluated cellular responses to TS. TS targets PRX3 in both adherent tumor cells and in non-adherent immune cell populations in a dose-dependent manner.

Sorafenib remains the globally accepted systemic first-line treatment for advanced HCC although acquired drug-resistance is becoming increasingly common. Hopefully, immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy has recently revolutionized the treatment for advanced HCC that have poor response to sorafenib, but the durable response rate remains low in most patients for unknown reasons. This fuels a wave of research into the molecular mechanisms of tumor-intrinsic resistance to both chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which may provide potential systemic treatment options for advanced HCC patients.<br \/><b>Methods and Results:<\/b> RNA sequencing of sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines was performed to identify Frizzled-4 (FZD4) as a critical gene for drug resistance that was further validated in animal models. Clinical implication of FZD4 overexpression was studied in HCC patients. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we found that FZD4 was sufficient to increase clonogenicity, migration and invasion, and prevent sorafenib-induced apoptosis. In addition, FZD4 could reduce secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) and interferon-gamma (IFN-&#947;), as well as intracellular levels of cytotoxic granzyme A and perforin in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, indicating significant suppression of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in HCC tumors. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies also revealed that FZD4 expression promoted tumorigenesis and accelerated HCC cell metastatic lung colonization. Combination therapy of FZD4 inhibitor FzM1 with sorafenib in HCC of <i>MYC<\/i>\/sg<i>p53<\/i>-induced model showed a tendency to significantly impede tumor growth and improve mice survival. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified the cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid metabolism signaling signatures as the top activated pathways in FZD4-high HCC cells. This evidence suggests a crucial role of FZD4-involved lipid metabolism linked to the development of therapeutic resistance.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study demonstrates that FZD4 expression plays a pivotal role in HCC progression and holds the potential for expanding the scope of targeted\/ICB therapies to tumors that are currently unresponsive, especially in advanced HCC. The resistance mechanisms will be addressed in further work.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,sorafenib resistance,immune response,tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jie Luo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lanqi Gong<sup><\/sup>, Yuma Yang<sup><\/sup>, Qin Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jiao Huang<sup><\/sup>, Xiaona Fang<sup><\/sup>, Xin-Yuan Guan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b6d03e8a-4fcc-48dd-8640-23035726414e","ControlNumber":"5493","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

However, the potential of many IO drugs as well as mechanisms of resistance in different indications remain to be uncovered. With the development of organoid technology, it is now possible to grow tumor objects in 3D scaffolds with a high resemblance to the original patient tumor in terms of genetics, transcriptomics and morphology. This technology is highly suited for pre-clinical screens and of great translational value. Here we present a high throughput platform using this organoid technology to study IO drug candidates in different indications.<br \/>Material and methods<br \/>Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from different origins, including colorectal, lung, breast, melanoma and ovarian cancers, were cultured in protein hydrogels. Allogenic PBMCs were isolated from two healthy donors and were activated with superantigens or CD3\/CD28 beads. PDOs and PBMCs were then co-cultured together in presence of IO drugs, such as monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, and analyzed for immune cell migration, infiltration and PDO killing. This was assessed by 3D high content imaging (HCI) and quantified with an automated image segmentation pipeline, which segments tumor objects and immune cells in the 3D reconstituted stack.<br \/>Results and discussion<br \/>Image-based analysis on PBMC numbers, migration and infiltration, and PDO volumes was performed. Data analysis showed that the activation status of the PBMCs induced different levels of infiltration and killing, as measured by the number of infiltrated immune cells and PDO volumes respectively. In addition, different PDOs showed different sensitivities for immune cell-mediated killing and compound effects.<br \/>Conclusion<br \/>Our PDO - immune cell co-culture system in combination with HCI allows the detection and quantification of migration towards, infiltration into and killing effects of immune cells on PDOs in a single assay. This 3D assay allows the identification of IO drug mode of action, specificity, resistance and sensitivity and immune cell activation. Here, we observed a broad spectrum of responses based on the specific characteristics (e.g. morphology and gene expression) of different PDOs and differential activation of PBMCs. The broad range of PDOs available from our biobanks empowers IO drug developers to explore their candidates in multiple cancer indications or in multiple models of a single indication with a range of different genetics, target expression and morphology. Ultimately this allows for the testing of IO drugs, such as engineered T Cells, tumor targeting antibodies, bispecific T Cell engagers, and immune cell modulators in clinically relevant models, bringing the promise of IO therapies to more indications and patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Organoids,Imaging,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Saskia de Man<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chiara Foini<sup><\/sup>, Tomas Veenendaal<sup><\/sup>, Michelle Kop<sup><\/sup>, Christos Santaris<sup><\/sup>, Sergei Chavez Abiega<sup><\/sup>, Nataliia Beztsinna<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Okkes<sup><\/sup>, Ashgard Weterings<sup><\/sup>, Leo Price<sup><\/sup>, Gera Goverse<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Crown Bioscience Netherlands B.V., Leiden, Netherlands","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"89a63789-d5ae-48d7-8066-2919c5c2d14c","ControlNumber":"6297","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S. de Man, <\/b> None..<br><b>C.

However, 60%-70% of patients showed primary resistance to ICIs, and the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. Pyroptosis is a programmed cell death accompanied by a robust inflammatory response with the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules, and thus it has the potential to be a promising biomarker for immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: A dataset with the clinical and transcriptomic profiles was derived from 16 randomized controlled trials and studies on ICIs treatment in multiple solid tumors, including melanoma, urothelial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, breast cancer, and esophageal cancer. The responder was defined as patients achieving complete or partial response, while the non-responder was defined as patients with stable or progressive disease. According to previous studies, we generated a cytotoxic pyroptosis-related gene set, including <i>CASP1, CASP3, CASP4, CASP5, CASP8, GSDMB, GSMDC, GSDMD, GSDME, GZMA, GZMB, <\/i>to explore the association of cytotoxic pyroptosis with response to ICIs. In addition, the previously defined gene set from the Gene Ontology working group that contains a pyroptosis-related gene set was also included to represent the level of total pyroptosis. Single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was performed, and the fold-changes and p-values of gene sets were merged with the R package &#8220;MetaVolcanoR&#8221;. Patients in each subset were split by the median of the ssGSEA score of pyroptosis-related genes and identified as with relatively activated and inhibited pyroptosis, respectively. A <i>P<\/i>-value &#60; 0.05 was considered significant.<br \/>Results: A total of 1,407 patients were analyzed, including 475 responders and 932 non-responders. The ssGSEA revealed that both the pyroptosis and the cytotoxic pyroptosis gene sets were enriched in responders, while the cytotoxic pyroptosis-related gene set was one of the top five ones among the 545 enriched in responders. Moreover, the survival analysis showed that in urothelial and non-small cell lung cancer, patients with activated pyroptosis prior to treatment had better progression-free survival and overall survival after ICIs therapies. These results suggested that an activated status of pyroptosis, especially the pyroptotic process related to cytotoxic events, is a marker for better response to ICIs.<br \/>Conclusions: The transcriptomic analysis of universal immunotherapy biomarkers identifies an pre-existing activated status of pyroptosis within the tumor microenvironment was associated with a better ICIs response across different cancer types, and thus these pyroptosis-related genes may serve as valuable immunotherapy markers and in silico fundamental tool for exploring pyroptosis in tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Pyroptosis,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yumo Xie<sup><\/sup>, Xiaolin Wang<sup><\/sup>, Meijin Huang<sup><\/sup>, Yanxin Luo<sup><\/sup>, <b>Huichuan Yu<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7809414c-83a1-401d-8092-2b9db776b80d","ControlNumber":"1572","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Multiparametric flow cytometry is a robust and powerful tool to evaluate the frequency and activation status of a large variety of immune cells. However, for flow cytometric analysis tumor, tissue must be digested into a single cell suspension, and thereby the information on the tumor architecture as well as the spatial distribution of immune cells is lost. The distribution of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is often heterogeneous and a favorable immune cell distribution is crucial for an efficacious anti-tumor immunotherapy. The recent advances in multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) allows the analysis of multiple parameters simultaneously so that the frequency as well as the spatial distribution of multiple immune cells can be analyzed.<br \/>In this study, immunotherapy-responsive tumor cell lines (colon carcinoma cell lines MC38-CEA and CT26wt as well as melanoma cell line Clone M3) were implanted in the mammary fat pad (subQperiorTM), which leads to reduce ulceration rate and homogenous tumor growth compared to subcutaneous implantation. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy reduced the tumor growth in all three tumor models significantly. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples were collected from control and anti-PD-1 treated animals. Murine specific InSituPlex&#174; (ISP) technology (Ultivue) was used to perform multiplex immune profiling of the markers CD3, CD4, CD8 and FOXP3 on mouse whole slide FFPE tumor serial sections. Slides were then imaged for high quality images of the four targets and downstream analysis performed. The evaluated T cell frequency and spatial distribution was compared to flow cytometric data of anti-PD-1 treatment in these models.<br \/>In summary, flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) are valuable tools in the evaluation of immune responses in pre-clinical tumor models. Both technologies enable an improved understanding of treatment responses and facilitate the development of novel treatment modalities as well as the identification of potential predictive biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Flow cytometry,Immunotherapy,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Philipp Metzger<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Carla Castro<sup><\/sup>, Cynthia Obodozie<sup><\/sup>, Holger Weber<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Reaction Biology Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"19994c21-23f7-4aea-a6df-3a49df9e1c8a","ControlNumber":"6333","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

However, it remains unclear how these immunotherapies affect memory T-cell response. Here we address whether anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 have different effects on memory T-cells. We used anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with irradiated cancer vaccine in mice. After re-challenge, we observed that in murine tumor models, anti-CTLA-4 generates a more robust memory antitumor response than anti-PD-1 as demonstrated by smaller tumor volumes at all time points. We have traced and profiled antigen-specific CD8 T-cells throughout priming, memory phase, and re-challenge. We observed the memory responses generated by anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 diverge at priming; where anti-CTLA-4 generates more TCF-1+ memory-like T-cells than anti-PD-1, and remains apparent throughout activation and expansion as anti-PD-1 results in a higher percentage of TOX1+ terminally-differentiated T cells. During re-challenge, the memory T-cells generated by anti-CTLA-4 1) expand in greater frequency, 2) have greater cytokine production and antitumor activity, and 3) more frequently differentiate into the population of KLRG1+ effector CD8 T-cells than those generated with anti-PD-1.

Bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) are fusion proteins that are generated by linking the targeting region of two antibodies: one arm binds to the tumor-associated antigen, and the other arm binds to T cells to promote T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in an MHC-independent manner. A CD19xCD3 BiTE has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of CD19-positive B-cell lymphoma. Despite having great clinical efficacy, CRS remains a major concern for BiTE therapy. This necessitates the development of a translational model that could predict CRS toxicity more accurately. Various <i>in-vitro<\/i> models proposed to assess BiTE-related CRS have several shortcomings as they do not provide details about the systemic immune response, off-target effects, neurotoxicity, tissue damage, and organ failure. Here we propose an <i>in-vivo<\/i> approach to concomitantly assess the efficacy and CRS toxicity of CD19xCD3 BiTE either alone or in combination with Rituximab (monoclonal antibody targeting CD20) in the Raji luciferase xenograft model of Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma in PBMC humanized NSG-MHC Class I\/II knockout mice. Five days post human PBMC engraftment (Study Day- SD 5), the mice were injected with Raji-luciferase cells. On SD 6, the mice were treated with BiTE, Rituximab, or the combination of BiTE and Rituximab. Additional control groups included OKT3 and Anti-CD28, the anti-T cell antibodies that failed clinically due to severe CRS. Efficacy was assessed through in-vivo imaging on SD5, SD8, and SD11. We observed tumor growth inhibition with BiTE, Rituximab, and the combination treatment. Clinical observations were recorded daily post treatment.

One of the main obstacles to the use of this class of low molecular weight molecules in cancer treatment is the toxicity associated with systemic immune activation after intravenous administration. We developed a novel immune stimulant ADC by conjugating the anti-CEACAM5 (carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 5) tusamitamab antibody with a resiquimod (R848) TLR7\/8 agonist payload. This tumor-targeted compound administered systemically and locally active, is expected to eradicate CEACAM5-positive (+) tumors by recruiting and activating immune cells in tumor microenvironment to promote anti-tumor immune response. Tusamitamab R848 ADC, evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i>, binds to CEACAM5+ tumor cells via its Fab moiety, and to myeloid cells via its Fc part at nanomolar (nM) concentrations. TLR7\/8 pathway activation was evaluated on myeloid THP1 reporter cells. The conjugate elicits a potent and FcyR-dependent activity at low nM concentration. In co-culture of human blood cells and human CEACAM5+ gastric cancer cells, it was shown to induce phagocytosis activity, associated with increased activation\/maturation of both monocytes and dendritic cells. Tusamitamab R848 ADC evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> in CEACAM5+ pancreatic human tumor model, HPAFII, leads to robust antitumor activity with complete regressions (CR) after single administration at 5 mg\/kg. In a pharmacodynamic study using lung tumor patient-derived xenograft mouse model, this ADC triggers murine cytokine inductions, innate immune cell enrollment at tumor site, and tumor necrosis in a dose-dependent manner. Based on preclinical <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> data, the tusamitamab R848 ADC is an innovative ADC approach with the potential to eradicate CEACAM5+ tumors in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TLR7,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Immune response,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stephanie Decary<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lydia Blot<sup><\/sup>, Charlotte Lahoute<sup><\/sup>, Sandrine Benoist<sup><\/sup>, Anne Caron<sup><\/sup>, Francesca Graziano<sup><\/sup>, Marc Trombe<sup><\/sup>, Loreley Calvet<sup><\/sup>, Alexandra Ferrier<sup><\/sup>, Marc Frederic<sup><\/sup>, Sukhvinder Sidhu<sup><\/sup>, Marie-Priscille Brun<sup><\/sup>, Marielle Chiron<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Oncology, Sanofi, Vitry-sur-Seine, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ced6b618-1d85-4929-8d84-82ba23a51191","ControlNumber":"6020","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

ICIs activate anti-tumor immunity by overriding the inhibition of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Clinical trials in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, who harbor TILs within tumor stroma, have demonstrated increased survival (IMpassion130) and pathologic complete response (KEYNOTE-522) to ICI leading to FDA-approval of ICI and chemotherapy combinations in metastatic TNBC. However, ICI benefit is heterogeneous among patients. We sought to model ICI response in vivo to evaluate therapeutic resistance and response heterogeneity and to ascertain predictive biomarkers for favorable ICI outcomes. An immunocompetent EMT6 orthotopic mammary tumor model was used to investigate the efficacy of anti-PD-L1. Matched longitudinal samples of the tumor microenvironment (TME) (collected by fine-needle aspiration) and peripheral blood (PBMC) from mice were profiled by bulk RNA and T-cell receptor sequencing.<br \/>Anti-PD-L1 robustly suppressed primary tumor growth and extended survival beyond the control group. The addition of chemotherapy demonstrated moderate therapeutic efficacy but failed to enhance ICI benefit. Phenotypic profiling of the TME revealed increased T cells, DCs, and NK cells in anti-PD-L1 only and chemotherapy combination groups. Despite using a genetically identical tumor model and host, PD-L1 blockade induced heterogeneous responses, like clinical outcomes in TNBC patients, ranging from complete response (CR) to intrinsic resistance (IR). The primary TME showed upregulated signatures of cytotoxic T cell response and activation, specifically inflammatory interferon signaling (both prior to and post ICI administration) that corresponded to favorable outcomes to anti-PD-L1 in individual mice. Longitudinal analysis of the peripheral blood identified modest changes among mice at baseline that progressively deviated by response type (IR-vs-CR). Mice harbored enriched myeloid signatures and clonal T cell expansion during therapy corresponding to ICI resistance and response, respectively. Further investigations of matched peripheral blood and the primary TME signatures may identify systemic biomarkers and tumor antigen-specific T cell clones to accurately predict ICI response in patients and uncover mechanisms for sensitizing tumors refractory to ICI.<br \/>Thus, we identify an in vivo model that emulates TNBC patient heterogeneous outcomes to ICI combinatorial approaches. We describe host-specific signatures, specifically from myeloid cells, that correlate with differential responses to ICI, which may serve as a basis for peripheral blood tracking of breast cancer patient responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,Longitudinal sampling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ann Hanna<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaopeng Sun<sup>2<\/sup>, Emily Tran<sup>2<\/sup>, Quanhu Sheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Brandie  C.

Identifying molecular features that determine response and developing approaches to enhance the response remain an urgent clinical need. Targeting S phase DNA damage repair (S-DDR) network has been reported to activate cGAS signaling and convert a non-immunogenic tumor microenvironment to an immunogenic tumor microenvironment, thus improving immunotherapy response in breast cancer and small cell lung cancer. SETD2 has been known to be required for ATM-mediated DNA damage response, and we hypothesize that <i>SETD2<\/i> loss confers greater dependence on ATR activity and provides vulnerability to ATR inhibitors, which may further potentiate the response to immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: Applying molecular, cellular, and bioinformatic approaches, we comprehensively investigated the effects of <i>SEDT2<\/i>\/<i>Setd2<\/i> loss on the cytosolic DNA damage response pathway, the cGAS-mediated cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the tumor immune microenvironment, and immunotherapy response in RCC cell lines, in the Renca-BALB\/c immune competent murine model, and in RCC patients cohorts with or without ICB therapy.<br \/>Results: We found that, in multiple RCC cell lines, pharmacological inhibition of the ATR-CHK1 axis activated the cGAS-IRF3-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, resulting in inflammatory cytokine expression. <i>SETD2<\/i> mutated RCC cell lines or tumor samples were associated with preferential ATR-CHK1 activation over ATM-CHK2 activation. <i>SETD2<\/i> knockdown promoted the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and conferred greater sensitivity to ATR inhibition.

Its use in the form of recombinant protein and\/or DNA plasmid has been hampered by issues with systemic toxicity or protein bioavailability within the tumor. To overcome these roadblocks, we developed a novel secreted single chain IL-12p70 mRNA. Intra-tumoral dosing of this mRNA induced tumor regression in a syngeneic and orthotopic mouse model of TNBC. Almost all cervical cancers are HPV (human papilloma virus) associated. We have developed a therapeutic vaccine, based on a single mRNA coding for two de-risked antigens, that is able to induce a T cell response against the oncogenic proteins E6 and E7 of the most common serotype (HPV16). When injected intramuscularly in mice bearing C3.43 masses, this vaccine suppressed tumor growth and generated immunological memory.Currently, these women&#8217;s cancers do not have a cure or an effective standard of care.

Although RAS, RAF and MEK have been validated as anticancer targets with approval of KRAS G12C, BRAF and MEK inhibitors, combination strategies with chemotherapy, targeted therapies and\/or immune checkpoint inhibitors may be optimal for deep and durable response. Avutometinib (avuto, VS-6766) is a unique RAF\/MEK clamp that potently inhibits MEK kinase activity and induces a dominant negative RAF\/MEK complex preventing phosphorylation of MEK by ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. Preclinically, avuto has shown strong anti-proliferative potency across tumor cell lines carrying various MAPK pathway alterations. Clinically, avuto monotherapy has shown responses in gynecological cancers and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Here, we tested the immune modulatory effects of avuto on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and assessed anti-tumor efficacy in mice treated with avuto in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody. In a panel of KRAS and BRAF mutant human tumor cell lines, avuto treatment increased the expression of MHC-I complex genes, including B2M<\/i>, HLA-A<\/i> and TAP1<\/i>. In the CT26 KRAS G12D syngeneic colorectal cancer model, upregulation of B2M<\/i> and TAP1<\/i> by avuto was confirmed in vivo<\/i>, suggesting that avuto may increase antigen presentation. Furthermore, avuto upregulated the expression of markers of T cells (CD8, PDCD1<\/i>), NK cell activation (NCR1<\/i>) and interferon response (IFNG<\/i>, IRF7, IL12<\/i>) in the CT26 model. Interestingly, all these pro-immune changes observed with avuto were stronger than those observed with an equivalent dose level of the MEK-only inhibitor trametinib. Avuto also increased expression of B2M, CD8A, PDCD1, NCR1<\/i> and IRF7<\/i> in a KPARG12C<\/sup> orthotopic lung cancer model. Flow cytometry analysis showed that avuto also significantly increased MHC-II expression by tumor cells and the numbers of CD8 T cells and M1 macrophages, and significantly decreased monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs. These immune changes indicate that avuto induces an immunogenic tumor microenvironment that may potentiate the efficacy of immuno-oncology agents such as anti-PD-1. Accordingly, in the CT26 model, whereas avuto and anti-PD-1 each delayed tumor growth, combination of avuto with anti-PD-1 increased antitumor efficacy and prolonged survival. Furthermore, all complete responders in the avuto + anti-PD-1 group were able to reject a re-challenge with CT26 tumor cells and showed increased CD8 and CD4 effector memory T cells relative to untreated na&#239;ve control mice, indicating that avuto + anti-PD-1 treatment induces durable immune memory. These results support clinical evaluation of avutometinib in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody for treatment of patients with solid tumors harboring MAPK pathway alterations such as KRAS or BRAF mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,avutometinib,VS-6766,RAF\/MEK clamp,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Silvia Coma<sup>1<\/sup>, Miriam Molina Arcas<sup>2<\/sup>, Julian Downward<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Jonathan  A.

A subcutaneous flank tumor implant provides a convenient and accessible location to monitor the tumor growth and response to therapy. However, the tumor microenvironment, and therefore, the responsiveness to immuno-oncology therapies, is greatly impacted by the location in which the tumor develops (Ho 2021, Oliver 2018). Given the potential of different immuno-suppressive features driven by the specific tumor location, we wanted to compare the tumor infiltrating leukocyte populations in the subcutaneous flank and orthotopic pancreatic Pan02 syngeneic models, as well as the response to standard of care therapies. Pan02 cells were either implanted orthotopically in the pancreas or subcutaneously in the flank and allowed to establish before dosing with either vehicle, oxaliplatin, anti-CTLA-4 or the combination of therapies. Established tumors from untreated orthotopic and flank models were sampled for flow cytometry to assess infiltration by a broad range of immune cell populations. Response to therapy was clearly dependent on tumor location with flank tumors being resistant to both monotherapy and combination therapy, while the orthotopic tumors responded modestly to monotherapy but displayed synergy with the combination therapy. The results suggest that for a given syngeneic tumor cell line with identical mutational load and antigenicity, we can generate unique tumor microenvironments dependent on implant location leading to different outcomes when testing novel immune-oncology therapies. These types of models can help define the context in which novel immune-oncology therapeutics can be expected to drive an effective immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Tumor microenvironment,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Andrew Wong<sup><\/sup>, <b>Patrick Fadden<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Cara Clouse<sup><\/sup>, Patrick Wood<sup><\/sup>, Marianna Brown-Augustine<sup><\/sup>, Fei Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Elliot Ser<sup><\/sup>, Joseph Kolb<sup><\/sup>, Chassidy Hall<sup><\/sup>, Elizabeth Rainbolt<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Durham, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c9746fe8-87ab-40aa-ac27-d7593e19be03","ControlNumber":"4820","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

However, recent findings indicate that the dependance on TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> stem-like T cells for ICB efficacy may not be equal across patients or in different tumor contexts. Here we leveraged TCF1 conditional knock-out (TCF1 cKO) mice to investigate how TCF1 instructs the early fate and functions of CD8 T cells upon ICB therapy in tumors that differ for immunogenicity and levels of tumor antigen expression. Strikingly, we discovered that TCF1 expression in CD8 T cells is required for ICB efficacy in poorly immunogenic B16OVA melanomas but is dispensable in highly immunogenic MC38OVA colorectal tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping in the tumor draining lymph node (TDLN) revealed defective priming and expansion of tumor-specific TCF1 cKO T cells in B16OVA- but not MC38OVA-bearing mice treated with ICB. Conversely, ICB therapy efficiently expanded tumor-specific TCF1 WT T cells in the TDLN of both tumor models. In vitro, we found defective proliferation, reduced PD1 and CD28 up-regulation and reduced phosphorylation of key molecules downstream the T cell receptor pathway in TCF1 cKO T cells stimulated with low but not high TCR signals. These data indicate that TCF1 poises T cells for optimal responsiveness in suboptimal priming conditions such as those found in low antigen expressing tumors. Furthermore, in the absence of TCF1 we found the accumulation in the TDLN of a subset of tumor-specific na&#239;ve T cells poised to give rise to short-lived effectors, which are less suited to sustain anti-tumor responses in poorly immunogenic tumors where expansion of T cells retaining memory potential is required for durable responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping within the tumor microenvironment showed that in MC38OVA tumors both WT and TCF1 cKO mice expanded a CD8 subset sharing a signature with transitory effectors, which were shown to mediate ICB efficacy in chronic viral infection models. Expansion of cytotoxic CD8 T cells likely accounted for the strong anti-tumor response observed in both WT and TCF1 cKO mice. Conversely, B16OVA tumors failed to expand transitory effectors and accumulated Tox<sup>+<\/sup> dysfunctional CD8 T cells. Importantly, in the absence of TCF1 dysfunctional T cells became destabilized, failed to persist and shared features with CD8 T cells found in patients that fail ICB. Altogether, the reduced priming of stem-like T cells in the TDLN combined with a destabilized dysfunctional T cell state in the tumor contributed to the failure of TCF1 cKO mice to sustain effective ICB responses in poorly immunogenic tumors. Our study highlights a role for TCF1 during the priming and early stages of the anti-tumor CD8 T cell response with important implications for guiding optimal therapeutic interventions in cancers with low frequency of TCF1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cells and low neoantigen expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,T cell,Stem cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giulia Escobar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Katherine Tooley<sup>1<\/sup>, Joan Pages Oliveras<sup>1<\/sup>, Linglin Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hanning Cheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Chang Xue<sup>1<\/sup>, Davide Mangani<sup>1<\/sup>, Natanael Hazel<sup>1<\/sup>, Carola Rutigliani<sup>1<\/sup>, Luca Biasco<sup>2<\/sup>, Ana C.

This revelation has prompted investigation in alternative targets to invigorate anti-tumor immunity. IL-2 signaling governs the survival and functionality of lymphocytes, thus making IL-2 receptor signaling an attractive target for new immunotherapies. However, therapies to enhance IL-2 signaling are often limited in their efficacy by modulating the activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which preferentially binds IL-2 via the high affinity receptor IL-2R&#945; (CD25). Selectively targeting IL2R&#946; (CD122), the intermediate affinity receptor, can be leveraged to induce anti-tumor immune responses in effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells while limiting negative regulation conferred by Tregs. The novel bispecific immunocytokine PD1-IL2v preferentially activates IL-2 signaling through CD122 on PD-1 expressing cells, activating immune effectors, and preventing immune exhaustion by blockade of PD-1. However, PD-1 blockade can amplify immunosuppression by Tregs, necessitating their depletion using &#945;CD25. Here, we observe that radiation therapy and combination of PD1-IL2v with an Fc-optimized &#945;CD25 antibody induces systemic activation of effector CD4 and CD8 T cells, reducing overall tumor burden. Concordant with improved local tumor control, we also observed a decrease in metastatic spread using a newly developed Kras\/smad4\/p53 mutated metastatic tumor model. NK cells, which are known to play a central role in the control of tumor<br \/>cell dissemination though direct cytotoxicity, displayed a phenotypic shift towards an activated state upon treatment with PD1-IL2v, highlighted by enhanced cytotoxicity, NK receptor diversity, and metabolic activity. Although relatively uncommon in comparison to other cancer types, those patients who present with metastases display a substantially poorer outcome, demonstrating the need for therapies which target this axis of cancer disease progression. In summary, we find that radiation therapy and PD1-IL2v imparts potent anti-tumor immunity, reducing local tumor growth and distant tumor spread, which taken together contribute to increased overall survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Radioimmunotherapy,Natural killer cells,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jacob Gadwa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Amann<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas  E.

To investigate a potential role for COX-2\/PGE2 in anti-PD-1 resistance, we studied PGE2-mediated effects on human myeloid and T cells and their dependence on prostaglandin (EP) receptor signaling.<br \/>Methods: Monocytes (Monos) and T cells were enriched from normal donor peripheral blood by negative selection. PGE2 effects were tested on Monos activated with IFN-g (PD-L1 expression; FACS) or LPS (cytokine secretion; ELISA). PGE2 effects on monocytic dendritic cells (DCs) generated with GM-CSF+IL-4 and matured with CD40L were assessed by phenotyping for costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) and subpopulation markers (CD14, CD16, CD83). T cells activated with anti-CD3\/CD28 +\/- PGE2 for 2-6 days were assessed for expression of CD25, CD69, CD107a, CD137, OX40, GITR, LAG-3, PD-1, PD-1, PD-L1 and TIM3 (FACS); proliferation markers (Ki67, CFSE; FACS); cytokine secretion (IFN-g, IL-2, IL-10, TGF-b; ELISA); and metabolic function (Seahorse assay). In some experiments, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitors of EP2 (PF-04418948), EP4 (ONO-AE3-208), or the dual inhibitor TPST-1495 (Tempest Therapeutics).<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>Myeloid cell functions were suppressed by PGE2, which reduced IFNg-induced PD-L1 expression and modulated LPS-induced cytokine secretion. Furthermore, PGE2 inhibited DC maturation, evidenced by persistent CD14 and CD16 expression and a decreased CD83+ subset. In CD4 and CD8 T cells activated with anti-CD3\/CD28, PGE2 reduced expression of CD25 and CD69 (early activation markers), CD107a (cytolytic potential), Ki67 (cell proliferation), co-stimulatory molecules (CD137, OX40, GITR) and checkpoint molecules (LAG-3, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3) in a dose-dependent manner. PGE2 also reduced the CFSE-low (proliferating) population in activated CD4, CD8 and Treg cells. Secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-g and IL-2, and inhibitory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-b from activated T cells was also suppressed by PGE2. These effects were specifically reversed by chemical inhibitors of EP2 and\/or EP4. PGE2 exposure at the time of T cell activation was associated with depressed mitochondrial oxidation and cellular glycolysis, suggesting global effects on T cell metabolism.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>Understanding and preventing anti-PD-1 resistance is a critical goal in oncology. Our results suggest that the COX-2\/PGE2 pathway exerts immunosuppressive effects on myeloid and T cells via the EP2 and EP4 receptors. COX-2 and PD-L1 are distinct immune checkpoints, providing a rationale to test anti-PD-1 in conjunction with COX-2 pathway inhibitors such as IL-1B antagonists and highly specific EP2 and EP4 inhibitors in patients with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"COX-2,Immune checkpoint blockade resistance,Tumor microenvironment,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shuming Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Seoho Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Tracee L.

Determining and understanding metabolic profiles of cells can aid in overall insight of cell health and improvement of cell therapeutics, especially for immune interventions. T-cells actively regulate their metabolic profile from quiescent to a highly metabolically active state after activation. Activation rewires the cell to drive glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation for production of reducing power and ATP for cell growth and proliferation. A small population of these cells then transition to a more quiescent state and persist as memory cells to aid in secondary responses. Although the trend of T-cell metabolism after activation has been studied, the method of investigation is cumbersome and lacks depth of information of overall cell health. To address this, we developed a bioluminescence NAD(P)H core technology and applied it to build a set of cell-based assays covering diverse metabolic pathways including glucose, glycogen, and amino acid metabolism, and the TCA cycle. Here we utilize those assays to investigate changes in metabolic profiles of na&#239;ve, effector, and memory T-cells as they transition from a state of oxidative phosphorylation to increased glycolytic rates, dependence on different fuel consumption and storage, including an increase in fatty acid oxidation and glycogen accumulation. We demonstrate flexibility of the assays for detecting multiple metabolites from the same sample and monitoring metabolite changes over time by assaying multiple samples. We show that the assays are amenable to various volumes (96-,384-well plates) and low cell numbers. For example, activity of dehydrogenases involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate and TCA cycles can be detected with less than 400 cells\/well. In conclusion, understanding the processes governing dynamic metabolic changes of T-cells during their transition from na&#239;ve to activated to memory phenotypes is required for next-generation cell therapy development. The developed bioluminescence cell-based assays provide the sensitivity, throughput and robustness required for rapid evaluation of such changes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Metabolism,CAR T cells,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maggie Bach<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Natasha Karassina<sup><\/sup>, Julia Gilden<sup><\/sup>, Donna Leippe<sup><\/sup>, Mike Valley<sup><\/sup>, Kayla Sylvester<sup><\/sup>, Jolanta Vidugiriene<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Promega, Fitchburg, WI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"76476036-0c54-48ab-8795-f4386511db42","ControlNumber":"6816","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Immunotherapy is a new strategy with systemic effect, and several combinations with other treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy in various sequences are evaluated. After irradiation, there is immunogenic changes in the tumor microenvironment, which is expected to improve the response of the added immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in immune response according to the radiation fractionation schedules after irradiation in various colon cancer cell lines.<br \/>Materials and Methods: The human colorectal cancer cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT116, were cultured and irradiated with total 1.8 Gy of X-rays in 10 fractions and 5 Gy of X-rays in 3 fractions using linear accelerator for 10 and 3 consecutive days. The mRNA expression levels of immune related genes including <i>CD274<\/i>, <i>T<\/i><i>REX<\/i><i>1<\/i>, <i>CD74<\/i>, <i>IFN<\/i><i>G<\/i>, <i>CALR<\/i>, <i>HMGB<\/i><i>1<\/i>, <i>TGF<\/i><i>B1<\/i> were evaluated using real-time PCR in 0, 3, and 7 days after irradiation.<br \/>Result: The mRNA expression levels of <i>CD74<\/i>,<i> HMGB1<\/i> and <i>CD274<\/i> were increased in both DLD-1 and HCT116 cell lines, and <i>IFNG<\/i><i> <\/i>increased only in DLD-1. However, there was a difference in the increasing patterns over time between the two radiation fractionations. According to the radiation fractionation, increasement of the mRNA expression levels was more prominent in 1.8 Gy in 10 fractions than 5 Gy in 3 fractions. In addition, the radiation-resistant DLD-1 cell line showed a more marked increase in the levels of CD274 mRNA as well as other genes associated with CD274 than the radiation-sensitive HCT116 cells. Moreover, DLD-1 cell line, which is more resistant to radiation, showed more prominent elevation in <i>CD274<\/i> mRNA level than HCT-116.<br \/>Conclusions: We could find that more fractionated irradiation schedule with smaller dose per fraction further increases the immune response. Even in radio-resistant tumor cells, better immune response could be expected after irradiation than radio-sensitive cells. It would be needed to verify the results in real tumor conditions, such as the tumor microenvironment containing immune cells and cancer-associate fibroblasts. It is also thought that studies on the appropriate time to use immunotherapeutic agent are needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Radiation therapy,Immune response,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sang Jun Byun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shin Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Incheol Seo<sup>3<\/sup>, Hye Won Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Sung Uk Bae<sup>5<\/sup>, Seong Kyu Baek<sup>5<\/sup>, Woon Kyung Jeong<sup>5<\/sup>, Seung Gyu Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Euncheol Choi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Immunology, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Immunology, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"80a2422f-d22f-4410-bc6e-fe9ee9889673","ControlNumber":"4086","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

While treatment of metastatic cancers with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) offers promise for many, early results from clinical trials evaluating ICIs in TNBC showed benefit for only a subset of patients. Preclinical data indicate that infiltrating macrophages foster tumor progression by limiting CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration, activation and cytotoxicity in tumor microenvironments. We hypothesized that response to ICI therapy could be enhanced by sequentially combining a microtubule poison (paclitaxel; PTX) that enhances tumor immunogenicity, with a macrophage-depleting\/reprograming agent, e.g. colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor blocking antibody (aCSF1R), in addition to an ICI targeting the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis. Immune-competent mammary tumor-bearing MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice were randomized at day 80, and enrolled into experimental groups evaluating PTX, aCSF1R mAb, &#945;PD-1 mAb, as monotherapy and in combinations. Cohorts were analyzed at distinct time points for primary and metastatic tumor burden, in addition to immunophenotyping (flow cytometry), transcriptional (RNA-Seq), epigenetic (sciATAC-Seq), and T cell receptor (TCR) changes correlating with outcomes. These studies revealed tumor regression and improved outcome for 60% of mice receiving PTX\/aCSF1R\/aPD-1, associated with localized CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T effector and resident memory cell expansion, increased antigen-specific clonal expansion at the primary tumor site. To address epigenetic plasticity as a limiting factor for long-term T cell memory, a class 1 benzamide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (e.g., entinostat) was sequentially added to PTX\/aCSF1R\/aPD-1 triple therapy resulting in primary tumor stasis in 100% of mice, and significantly enhanced overall survival. Improved outcome and tumor stasis were associated with an increased presence of long-lived central and stem-like memory CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cell infiltration, associated with increased intra-tumoral B memory cell and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T follicular helper cell infiltration. Improved outcomes were CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-dependent; depletion of CD19<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD20<sup>+<\/sup> B cells resulted in complete loss of granzyme B <sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration into primary tumors, and rapid tumor expansion. These preclinical studies indicate that therapies targeting myeloid-mediated T cell suppression can be leveraged to improve anti-tumor T cell memory, and that durable long-term T cell memory can be instated upon addition of an epigenetic modulator.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amanda Poissonnier<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eivind Valen Egeland<sup>2<\/sup>, Rossin Erbe<sup>3<\/sup>, Wesley Horton<sup>4<\/sup>, Ana Howells-Ferreira<sup>4<\/sup>, Shamilene Sivagnanam<sup>5<\/sup>, Nell Kirchberger<sup>1<\/sup>, Dhaarini Murugan<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Fields<sup>6<\/sup>, Peter Ordentlich<sup>7<\/sup>, Andrew  C.

Attempts to use single receptor agonists for advanced cancers have not produced approved products. Limitations include insufficient immune activation and dose-limiting toxicities associated with continuous exposure. Gram-negative bacteria (G-NB) contain multiple TLR, NOD and STING agonists. Potential utility of G-NB for cancer immunotherapy is supported by observation of tumor regression in the setting of infection and Coley&#8217;s Toxins. Coley reported that i.v. administration was likely most effective but produced toxicity. The discovery of TLRs, particularly the broad\/potent activities of the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) suggest that it may be both a critical active ingredient and a dose-limiting feature of i.v. G-NB.<br \/>Non-pathogenic <i>E. coli<\/i> were treated with polymyxin to achieve ~90% reduction of LPS activity without lysis and were then killed and stabilized with glutaraldehyde. The resulting product, Decoy10, was shown to contain multiple TLR, NOD and STING agonists and exhibited reduced i.v. toxicity (mice, rabbits) relative to unprocessed cells. Surprisingly, despite reduction in LPS activity and toxicity, Decoy10 induced secretion of similar or higher levels of most cytokines\/chemokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compared to unprocessed bacteria. Higher cytokine\/chemokine induction was also observed compared to monospecific TLR agonists.<br \/>Administration of 4 to 8 weekly or twice a week i.v. doses of Decoy10 to mice with established s.c., orthotopic or metastatic syngeneic breast, colorectal, hepatocellular, pancreatic carcinomas or syngeneic or human non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma was well-tolerated and produced single agent anti-tumor activity and\/or combination-mediated durable tumor regressions, with induction of immunological memory. Regressions were observed, without significantly increased toxicity, when Decoy10 was combined with chemotherapy, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, anti-PD-1 therapy or rituximab. Tumor regressions were associated with activation of innate and adaptive immune pathways in tumors after one dose of Decoy10 and were mediated by NK, CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.<br \/>Published studies have demonstrated that systemic bacteria are engulfed by and activate immune cells in the liver and spleen, with rapid clearance in mice, rabbits, and humans. Systemic bacteria have also been shown to accumulate in or around tumors. We have taken advantage of these phenomena to produce a detoxified but potent multiple immune agonist that induces systemic innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune activation without requirement for continuous systemic exposure.

The previous study suggested that cancer cells undergo immunoevasion due to epigenetic silencing of NKG2DL, in which NKG2D-NKG2DL interaction induced natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that NK-mediated cytotoxicity can be reactivated by restoring the expression of NKG2DL on tumor cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that cyproheptadine (CPH) is a novel HDAC inhibitor exhibiting antitumor activity by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To understand the mechanism behind, RNA-seq showed an upregulation of ULBP2, a NKG2DL, in bladder cancer cells treated with CPH. Interestingly, upregulation of ULBP2, was accompanied with the enrichment of H3K27Ac and H3K4me3 at ULBP2 promoter, was observed in cells treated with CPH. Increased NK-specific lysis was observed in CPH-treated cells co-cultured with NK-92 cells. More importantly, treatment of CPH enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor in a syngeneic mice bladder cancer model.

We also assessed the effect of silvestrol on tumor microenvironment in the BP syngeneic melanoma tumor model.<b><i><\/i><\/b><br \/><b><i>Results<\/i><\/b>: Silvestrol decreased the translation of multiple ICs in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including TOX, NFAT1, NFAT2, LAG3, and TIM3 (the two latter being also transcriptionally regulated). FACS analysis confirmed the dose-dependent decrease of protein expression of exhaustion-associated transcription factors TOX, NFATc1, TCF1 and T-bet in activated lymphocytes. This effect was more prominent in more exhausted T cells. Silvestrol decreased T cell proliferation but, in co-culture experiments, it increased immune cell killing of melanoma cells by T-lymphocytes. In the BP murine model, the antitumor effect of silvestrol was associated with denser T cell infiltration and less exhausted TILs than control tumors.<br \/><b><i><\/i><\/b> <b><i>Conclusion : <\/i><\/b>Our findings demonstrate the role of eIF4F in the orchestrated regulation of functionally related proteins involved in T cell exhaustion. They highlight the drugability of eIF4A for the cancer treatment and suggest that eIF4A inhibitors could be useful with IC inhibitors in combination or sequentially.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Translation,Immune checkpoint,T lymphocytes,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Samad Muhammadnejad<sup>1<\/sup>, Biswendu Biswas<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramdane Guemiri<sup>1<\/sup>, Naima Benannoune<sup>2<\/sup>, Jérémy Lavigne<sup>1<\/sup>, Virginie Quidville<sup>1<\/sup>, Jean-Yves Scoazec<sup>3<\/sup>, Stephan Vagner<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Caroline Robert<\/b><sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>INSERM U981, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>2<\/sup>INSERM U981 & Department of Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>3<\/sup>INSERM U981, Gustave Roussy & University Paris Saclay, Villejuif, France,<sup>4<\/sup>CNRS UMR3348 & INSERM U1278, Curie Institute, Orsay, France,<sup>5<\/sup>INSERM U981 & Department of Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy & Paris Saclay University, Villejuif, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3ffd3159-e29a-4742-9e6a-386bed43cef9","ControlNumber":"5846","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

CD3 complex, composed of CD3&#949;, CD3&#948; and CD3&#947; chains, is an essential component of TCR-CD3 complex mediating TCR signaling. Targeting CD3 complex has therefore become a popular strategy for manipulation of T cell function. Clinically relevant animal models for proper evaluation of human CD3 antibodies is in great demand in the field. Currently, adoptive transfer of human CD3+ T cells or transplantation of human hematopoietic stem\/precursor cells to immunodeficient mice are usually employed. However, these mouse models are not fully immunocompetent. In this study we have evaluated in vitro CD3 EDG functionality and in vivo therapeutic efficacy, in BALB\/c-hCD3EDG knock-in mouse in which all the three components of the CD3 complex &#8212; Cd3&#949;, Cd3&#948;, and Cd3&#947;&#8212; are replaced by their human counterparts, CD3E, CD3D, and CD3G.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A humanized CD3EDG mouse model (Hu<b>GEMM<\/b>) on BALB\/c background was generated by replacing the entire mouse CD3EDG with its human counterpart through ES cell-based gene targeting. The cell surface expression of CD3E and intracellular expression of CD3D and CD3G were confirmed by FACS. Na&#239;ve CD3+ T cells were isolated from the splenocytes of homozygous CD3EDG Hu<b>GEMM<\/b> and activated by anti-hCD3 antibody. T cell proliferation was demonstrated by CFSE dilution assay. To validate the TCR functionality of humanized CD3EDG <i>in vivo<\/i>, we evaluated bispecific antibody anti-hCD3\/hEpCAM5 in BALB\/c-CD3EDG Hu<b>GEMM<\/b> bearing CT26-hEpCAM5.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The expression of human CD3E, CD3D and CD3G were confirmed by flow cytometry. hEpCAM5 antigen expression was confirmed in CT26 cell line in vitro and tumor in vivo by flow cytometry. The TCR functionality was detected by <i>in vitro<\/i> T cell activation assays using anti-hCD3 antibody. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy was demonstrated using a bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds to human CD3 and human tumor associated antigen EpCAM5 in human <i>CD3 EDG <\/i>knock-in mice engrafted with CT26-hEpCAM5 tumor. The therapeutic efficacy of the bispecific antibody showed 32% tumor growth inhibition compared to control treatment. No significant body weight loss was recorded in any of the animals.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This study showed the successful establishment of humanized CD3 knock-in BALB\/c mouse models providing a full immunocompetent model for human CD3-targeted tumor immunotherapies evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CD3EDG,Bispecific antibody,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Demi Xiaojuan Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kaixia Lian<sup><\/sup>, Xuefei Yan<sup><\/sup>, Jie Lin<sup><\/sup>, Lei Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Annie Xiaoyu An<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoxi Xu<sup><\/sup>, Ludovic Bourre<sup><\/sup>, Jingjing Wang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Crown Bioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7b810c85-b500-4aab-b5c5-4b29b52415f3","ControlNumber":"5758","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.
