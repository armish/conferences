[{"Abstract":"Background: Estimated lifetime ovulatory years (LOY) is the difference between ages at menopause and menarche subtracting time for events interrupting ovulation. We tested whether LOY influence sex-hormone levels in postmenopausal women not using hormone therapy.<br \/>Methods: Hormones, including estradiol and testosterone, were measured in 1976 postmenopausal women from the Nurses&#8217; Health Study in plasma collected in 1990. Effects of age, years since menopause, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and hysterectomy on hormone levels were assessed by t-tests and ANOVA. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess associations between LOY and hormones adjusted for potential confounders and the trend in hormone levels per 5-year increases in LOY estimated.<br \/>Results: Women in the sample averaged: 61.4 years old at blood draw, 11.0 years since menopause, with a BMI of 25.8 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>. 17.5% had a hysterectomy and 13.8% were current smokers. These characteristics were associated with one or more hormone levels and included as adjustment variables. Each 5-year increase in LOY was associated with a 6.0% increase in testosterone (95% CI 3.3%, 8.7%) in all women. In women with above-average BMI, each 5-year increase in LOY was associated with a 7.3% (3.5%, 11.2%) increase in testosterone, a 6.9% (2.7%,11.3%) increase in estradiol, and a 6.9% (2.9%,10.9%) increase in estrone.<br \/>Conclusion: Greater LOY is associated with higher testosterone in postmenopausal women as well as greater estradiol in those with above-average BMI. This may be due to an accumulation of functioning stromal and thecal cells from repeated ovulation and peripheral conversion of testosterone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estradiol,Testosterone,Menopause,Ovulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel W.

Following a diagnosis of cancer, outcomes have been documented to be significantly worse for autistic individuals. Autistic individuals experience numerous barriers to care across healthcare settings, including a lack of appropriate communication with providers, a lack of accommodating healthcare environments, lack of mental health support, and too few providers who are trained in working with individuals with autism or IDD. This leads to numerous negative health outcomes, including lower likelihood of having a regular source of care, lower satisfaction with healthcare, reduced screening utilization, delays in recognizing early symptoms of disease, higher ED utilization, and anxiety and stress associated with healthcare visits.<br \/>We report on the results of a recent Medical Oncology provider survey conducted from 10\/31\/22 - 12\/16\/22 to evaluate for opportunities to address barriers to care facing individuals with autism and\/or IDD. Of the 49 respondents comprised of physicians and nurse practitioners, 93.9% (46) noted receiving five or fewer hours of specific training or education regarding caring for populations with IDD. Additionally, providers cited the following barriers most commonly related to delivery care to patient with IDD: Lack of strategies to enhance communication on site (32, 65.3%), Inadequate time allotted for visits (28, 57.1%), Inadequate staff training and education related to this group (27, 55.1%), Limited resources to support vulnerable or lower socio-economic status populations (22, 44.9%), and Fragmentation of care (19, 38.8%).<br \/>The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center and the Jefferson Center for Autism &#38; Neurodiversity have collaborated to develop a culturally competent care design aimed at understanding the needs of our neurodiverse population through a joint research effort. The results of our Medical Oncology provider survey identified the need for training of providers and staff to optimize the patient experience, creation of accessible cancer screenings, and the adoption of an environment that supports the sensory and communication abilities and needs of neurodivergent patients. Providers that adopt best practices in the care of autistic and\/or IDD individuals have noted that patients and families report marked improvement in the rating of their patient experience in the visit. The desired product is care plans, appropriate medical settings, and trained providers that will meet the needs of this population and improve overall health outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,neurodiversity,autism,IDD,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Avnish K.

Crowdfunding, a type of online fundraising, is increasingly used for cancer-related financial support, but the extent to which LGBTQ+ inequities exist in crowdfunding success has not previously been studied.<br \/>Methods: In December 2022, we extracted 494,242 publicly available crowdfunding campaigns from GoFundMe using web-scraping. We then applied two textual dictionaries to categorize the sample for analysis. The first dictionary identified health campaigns that were in English and contained cancer terms (n=196,038). The second dictionary used a list of terms from prior research that were supplemented by an LGBTQ+ study advisory board to stratify the cancer campaigns by LGBTQ+ identity (yes vs. no) of the campaign creator and\/or beneficiary. Outliers in the fifth and ninety-fifth percentile for fundraising goal amount were dropped resulting in a final sample of N=179,793 campaigns for analysis. Summary statistics and regression models were calculated using Stata 17 to describe differences in funding goals, amount raised, and number of donors by LGBTQ+ identity, adjusting for year of the campaign and geographic location.<br \/>Results: In total, the average campaign goal was $15,891 (Standard Deviation (SD): $13,816), average amount raised was $6,281 (SD: $5,409), and average number of donors was 61 (SD: 47). There were n=1,280 LGBTQ+ cancer campaigns (0.65%). In multivariable models, LGBTQ+ cancer campaigns had goals that were on average $2,009 lower than non-LGBTQ+ cancer campaigns (95% Confidence Interval (CI): -$2,798 - -$1,220, p&#60;0.001), when controlling for year of campaign and geographic location. Similarly, LGBTQ+ cancer campaigns raised $500 less than non-LGBTQ+ cancer campaigns (95% CI -$821 - -$178; p=0.002) when controlling for year of campaign and geographic location. LGBTQ+ campaigns had on average 2.81 more donors than non-LGBTQ+ campaigns (95% CI: 0.05 - 5.56, p=0.046), adjusting for year of campaign and geographic location.<br \/>Conclusions: When controlling for year of campaign and geographic location we observed significant disparities in goal amount and funds raised between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ cancer campaigns. However, LGBTQ+ campaigns on average had more donors. Our findings suggest that while there may be stronger community among LGBTQ+ populations (i.e., higher number of donors), LGBTQ+ cancer survivors may face substantial financial burden inequities. LGBTQ+ specific supportive services and interventions may help improve economic equity among cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Sexual and gender minorities,financial hardship,crowdfunding,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Echo L.

An earlier study analyzed metabolically defined body size phenotypes in relation to colorectal cancer risk, using combinations of C-peptide (a marker of insulin resistance) and body mass index (BMI). Higher serum C-peptide concentrations were associated with higher colorectal cancer risk in both overweight and normal weight individuals compared to individuals with low levels of C-peptide and normal weight. The aim of the present study was to see if these results could be replicated and to further explore the role of metabolism and body size phenotypes in colorectal cancer subtypes. We conducted a nested case-control study of 1010 individuals with colorectal cancer and 1010 individually matched (age, sex, cohort, year of blood sampling and data collection, number of freeze-thaw cycles of plasma samples and fasting status at blood sampling) control participants from the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. The blood samples and data used in our analyses were collected at a mean of 9.7 years prior to case diagnosis. Participants were categorized as (1) metabolically healthy\/normal weight (BMI &#60; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), (2) metabolically healthy\/overweight (BMI &#8805; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), (3) metabolically unhealthy\/normal weight (BMI &#60; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), or (4) metabolically unhealthy\/overweight (BMI &#8805; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), where metabolically healthy was defined as C-peptide in the lowest tertile, as in the previous study. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals and adjusted for tobacco smoking, recreational physical activity and alcohol consumption as potential confounders. In our preliminary results, metabolically unhealthy\/overweight individuals had a significantly higher risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to metabolically healthy\/normal weight individuals (adjusted odds ratio =1.44, 95% CI 1.13-1.85). The odds ratio for metabolically unhealthy\/normal weight individuals was 1.23 (95% CI 0.92-1.65) and for metabolically healthy\/overweight individuals 1.23 (95% CI 0.89-1.70). These results support the potential of a more nuanced analysis of metabolism and body size to better understand their etiological contribution to colorectal cancer development. To gain more knowledge about how the role of metabolism and body size might differ between tumor subtypes, we will also analyze body size phenotypes in relation to subtypes of colorectal cancer based on anatomical tumor site, <i>KRAS<\/i> and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations and microsatellite instability status of the tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Body mass index,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Linda Vidman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Knekta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Björn Gylling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carl Zingmark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Löfgren-Burström<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Palmqvist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophia Harlid<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bethany Van Guelpen<\/i><\/presenter>.

Disorders caused by IMDs are a group of diseases caused by abnormal activities of immune cells, which overreact or attack the body to show extreme inflammatory reactions or lose the ability to recognize and counter tumor cells. There is increasing evidence that IMDs play an important role in carcinogenesis and associated with the higher risk of cancers. To provide nation-wide evidence on the link between IMDs and cancer, this study evaluated the association between IMD and risk of cancer using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) in Korea.<br \/>Method: Among a total of 1,137,861 cohorts registered between 2002 and 2019 from the NHIS-NSC , the cohorts with first cancer diagnosis at the time of death were excluded and 1,056,170 cohorts were included in the analysis. IMD and cancer cases were identified as at least one hospitalization or two outpatient visits using the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases-8 (KCD-8) codes. We required the IMD diagnosis to be present at least 12 months before the cancer diagnosis. The associations of overall and 47 specific IMDs with overall and 75 specific cancer risk were estimated by relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using a log-binomial regression model adjusted for sex and age.<br \/>Results: Total 44,329 (4.20%) IMD cases were identified. A total of 3,094 (6.97%) cancer cases were documented in IMDs and 51,056 (5.09%) cancer cases in non-IMDs. Overall IMD was significantly associated with the 1.38-fold higher risk of cancer (95% CI=1.33-1.43). Specifically, 32 out of 47 (68.09%) IMDs showed the statistically significant association with the increased risk including relatively strong or moderate associations; psoriatic (RR=9.75; 95% CI=2.43-38.99), rheumatic heart disease (RR=6.71; 95% CI=4.07-11.10), primary biliary cholangitis (RR=5.00; 95% CI=4.35-5.75), systemic scleroderma (RR=4.18; 95% CI=2.34-7.45), giant cell arteritis (RR=4.17; 95% CI,1.53-11.39), sarcoidosis (RR=3.61; 95% CI=1.63-7.96), aplastic anemia (RR=3.54; 95% CI=1.01-12.43), Wegener&#8217;s granulomatosis (RR=3.07; 95% CI=1.09-8.69), polymyositis (RR=2.92; 95% CI=1.91-4.48), polymyalgia rheumatica (RR=2.84; 95% CI=2.18-3.72), systemic lupus erythematosus (RR=2.84; 95% CI=1.77-4.53). When cancers were classified by body system, the more prominent associations between overall IMD and cancers in respiratory-intrathoracic organs (RR=3.73; 95% CI=2.85-4.88), urinary tract (RR=1.62; 95% CI=1.23-2.14), thyroid and other endocrine glands (RR=1.58; 95% CI=1.46-1.71), and lip-oral-cavity-pharynx (RR=1.55; 95% CI=1.12-2.15) were observed.<br \/>Conclusion: This retrospective cohort study provides the nation-wide population-based evidence that IMDs are associated with the increased risk of cancers supporting the immunomodulation in carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-14 Infection and immune factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,immune-mediated disease,Cohort study,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiyeong Youn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jihoon Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yujin Kwak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soyoun Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minju Yuk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nan Song<\/i><\/presenter>.

The identified socio-behavioral factors could give directions for development of unique intervention components that are tailored to a specific population in needs.<br \/>Purpose: This study examined the relationship of multiple socio-behavioral factors including attitudes, perceived barriers, social influences, and self-efficacy to the symptom experiences of Asian American breast cancer survivors.<br \/>Methods: This secondary analysis was conducted using data collected from 195 Asian American female breast cancer survivors. Subjects were recruited from January 2017 to June 2020 through online and offline communities and groups. The study variables were measured using validated instruments such as the Questions on Attitudes, Self-Efficacy, Perceived Barriers, and Social Influences (QASPS); the Cancer Behavior Inventory (CBI); and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF). The hypothetical model was built based on Bandura&#8217;s self-efficacy theory. Mediation analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling with SPSS version 26.0 and Amos 28.<br \/>Results: The overall fitness of the hypothetical model to the data was acceptable (&#967;2=51.36, p&#60;.001, the goodness of fit index [GFI] = .95, adjusted GFI [AGFI] = .89, comparative fit index [CFI] = .96, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] = .94, normed fit index [NFI] = .94, and root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .08 Attitude and perceived barrier and social influence had a significant direct effect on self-efficacy (direct effect, &#946; = 0.247, p =.003; &#946; = -0.552, p =.003; &#946; = 0.241, p =.002, respectively). Attitudes indirectly influenced symptom distress scores through self-efficacy (&#946; =-0.054, p = .019). Perceived barriers had a significant direct effect (&#946; = 0.605, p=.003), indirect effect (indirect effect, &#946; = 0.121, p =.024), and a total effect on symptom distress scores (total effect, &#946; = 0.726, p =.004). In addition, social influence had an indirect effect on symptom distress scores through self-efficacy (&#946; = -0.053, p = .017)<br \/>Conclusions: The findings supported that the self-efficacy for coping had a mediating effect on their symptom experience among Asian American breast cancer survivors as well as<br \/>identified meaningful associations with attitudes, perceived barriers and social influences and symptom experience.

We aimed to evaluate adherence to guideline recommended imaging surveillance and factors associated with either adherence or non-adherence.<br \/>Methods: We utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare Program for the years 2003-2016. Participants were included if they were diagnosed with stage I\/II NSCLC, survived for more than 2 years following completion of treatment, between the ages of 65-85, and received either surgical resection or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as their primary treatment. Participants were considered to have received guideline-recommended imaging surveillance if there was record of receiving at least one computed tomography (CT) or chest x-ray (CXR) during the following four time windows following completion of curative intent treatment: 90-270 days, 360-450 days, 540-630 days, and 720-810 days. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate whether race\/ethnicity, sex, age group, treatment type, stage of disease, histology, insurance status, marital status, and comorbidity burden were associated with adherence to guideline-recommended imaging surveillance. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.<br \/>Results: A total of 14,296 NSCLC patients were included in the present analysis. Most participants were male (57.9%) and Non-Hispanic (NH) white (85.8%). Notably, only 21.9% of patients received guideline-recommended imaging surveillance during the entire 2-year follow-up period. When evaluating adherence within the first year of follow up only, 51.1% of participants met adherence criteria. Factors associated with receipt of guideline-recommended surveillance during the 2-year surveillance period include being married (OR: 1.17; 95% CI:1.06-1.29), receipt of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.12-2.76), and a Charlson comorbidity score of &#62;=3 (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03-1.33). Factors associated with not receiving guideline-recommended imaging surveillance included NH Black race (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59-0.91) and receipt of adjuvant systemic therapy (OR: 0.68, 95% CI:0.57-0.81), adjuvant radiotherapy (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.40-0.61), or SBRT only (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63-0.87).<br \/>Conclusion: Adherence to guideline-recommended imaging surveillance is low in this population.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, technology-based programs are increasingly popular because of their high flexibility and accessibility in delivering information and coaching\/support to address the current needs for help among cancer survivors. Yet, little is known about how socio-behavioral factors influence the effects of a technology-based intervention on the needs for help of racial\/ethnic minority breast cancer survivors, especially Asian American breast cancer survivors.<br \/>Purpose: The purpose of this secondary analysis was to examine the multiple socio-behavioral factors (including attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived barriers, and social influences related to breast cancer survivorship) mediated the effects of a technology-based intervention on the needs for help among Asian American breast cancer survivors.<br \/>Methods: This analysis was conducted with the data from 199 Asian American breast cancer survivor women who were recruited from January 2017 to June 2020 through online and offline communities\/groups. The needs for help were measured using the Support Care Needs Survey-34 Short Form (SCNS) with five domains on psychological, information, physical, support, and communication needs. Mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro within SPSS. The analysis determined the mediating effects of four socio-behavioral mediators on the needs for help at pre-test [T<sub>0<\/sub>], post 1-month [T<sub>1<\/sub>], and post 3-months [T<sub>2<\/sub>] of a technology-based intervention.<br \/>Results: Overall, all the mediators had statistically significant mediation effects on all types of needs for help (p &#60; .05) at different points. Attitudes and social influence presented statistically significant mediation effects on the total needs for help score over 3 months (T<sub>0<\/sub>, T<sub>1<\/sub>, and T<sub>2<\/sub>). Perceived Barriers had mediation effects on all types of needs for help over 1 month (T<sub>0<\/sub>, T<sub>1<\/sub>).
