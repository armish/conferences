[{"Abstract":"Cell states are established by small sets of lineage-restricted transcription factors (TFs). A generally accepted model posits that core regulatory TFs positively regulate their own and each other&#8217;s genes, forming a network of interconnected feed-forward loops termed core regulatory circuitry (CRC). Here, we sought to test the CRC concept by defining the direct gene-regulatory programs of the critical oncogenic TFs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . We employed a targeted protein degradation (dTag) strategy with a homozygous knock-in of the FKBP12<sup>F36V<\/sup>-coding DNA sequence into the endogenous TF-coding loci of 7 core myeloid TFs and 1 cofactor (MYB, PU.1\/SPI1, GFI1, RUNX1, RUNX2, MEF2D, IRF8, IRF2BP2), all of which represent selective AML dependencies and display the canonical pattern of feed-forward CRC binding. Following complete degradation of TFs for 1-2 hours, we measured the genome-wide rates of nascent mRNA synthesis by SLAM-seq. Genes whose transcription rates change significantly and immediately after a TF&#8217;s degradation represent its direct transcriptional targets. Strikingly, each TF directly regulates only between 100-450 target genes. Furthermore, rather than forming a core regulatory circuit with fully interconnected feed-forward loops, the core TFs form a very sparsely interconnected hierarchy with a cascading regulatory structure. Each evaluated TF is capable of both direct gene activation and repression. For instance, MYB directly inhibits 135 genes, most of which are associated with myeloid differentiation and inflammation. Feed-forward loops appear to be much less common than previously anticipated. Indeed, we detected only 336 feed-forward loops formed by any combination of the 8 TFs genome-wide. GFI1 and IRF2BP2 negatively regulate their own expression, and the rest of the TFs show no evidence of direct self-regulation. The entire regulatory network converges on MYC and immune signaling. A time-course SLAM-seq experiment after MYB degradation highlighted the secondary nature of eventual global transcriptional collapse and revealed bi-phasic kinetic behavior of feed-forward loops that MYB forms with GFI1 and IRF2BP2. A pseudo-steady state of cellular transcription, ensuing 8-12 hours after MYB degradation, accurately predicts MYB-dependent gene expression patterns in human AML samples. Indeed, a much higher expression of inflammatory mediators and cytokines is observed in patients with low MYB expression, consistent with the observation that MYB directly regulates inflammatory pathways and potentially explaining the known survival benefit of high MYB expression in human AML. Accordingly, MYB degradation results in immediate release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and CCL2. Our data represent the first example of systematic elucidation of direct regulatory functions of multiple core regulatory TFs in a single cellular context and support a new model of core regulatory circuitry organization in human cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Gene expression,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Taku Harada<sup>1<\/sup>, Monika Perez<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremie Kalfon<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenneth Eagle<sup>2<\/sup>, Flora Dievenich Braes<sup>3<\/sup>, Rashad Batley<sup>3<\/sup>, Kimberly Stegmaier<sup>2<\/sup>, Stuart Orkin<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Maxim Pimkin<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>DFCI\/BCH, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>DFCI\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>BCH, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"565e4175-2612-4aa9-939e-7e7f91d8f30b","ControlNumber":"5456","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Most UCEs are located in non-coding regions of the genome; however, some UCEs overlap with coding exons. In addition, some UCEs have been found to be transcriptionally active as long non-coding RNAs and are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cellular proliferation. Although a few UCE sequence variations were reported to be associated with human diseases, the molecular functions of somatic mutations in UCEs remain largely unexplained in human cancers. In this study, we characterized the distribution of somatic UCE mutations throughout a spectrum of cancers and investigated the biological functions of cancer associated UCEs.<br \/><b><i><u>Methods:<\/u><\/i><\/b> We examined somatic UCE mutations in 2,449 cases of 22 cancer types using the PCAWG and ICGC platforms. To validate these mutation patterns, UCE sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform for MD Anderson patient cohorts. A custom AsCpf1 guide library was built to identify potential regulatory UCE functions in colorectal cancer models, and 3 guides were designed to target 2,247 UCEs. The proliferation ratio of knockout UCEs was analyzed. We then generated stable mutated UCE clones using the CRISPR AsCpf1 technology in colorectal cancer cells. We conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of mutated UCE cells. The expression of target proteins and genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. To address the effects of the mutated UCE_11311 tumor growth, DLD1 cells were injected in athymic nude mice.<br \/><b><i><u>Results:<\/u><\/i><\/b> We analyzed the WGS data on 2,449 cases of 22 cancer types and identified 24,039 somatic mutations in 10,090 (73.46%) UCEs. These were mostly located in non-coding DNAs, mainly in introns.Based on the RNA-seq data, one of the strongest impacts of mutated UCEs was on ARID1B. We confirmed that specific mutated UCE decreased ARID1B mRNA and protein levels. Our <i>in vivo<\/i> results demonstrated that UCE mutations enhanced the tumorigenicity of DLD1 xenograft tumors. As a summary, UCE_11311 has a transcriptional enhancer activity on the ARID1B gene and UCE_11311 mutations are actively participating in the tumorigenesis at least in part through regulating ARID1B expression.<br \/><b><i><u>Discussion:<\/u><\/i><\/b> We identified hundreds of unexplored tumorigenic UCEs that need to be further characterized functionally and clinically, and proved one of them to be a transcriptional enhancer of the tumor suppressor ARID1B.

However, adult acinar cells, a probable origin of PDAC, are largely refractory to Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>-mediated oncogenic transformation in mouse models. With the concomitant loss of transcription factors that regulate acinar cell differentiation, such as Pdx1 (Pancreatic and Duodenal Homeobox 1), acinar cells undergo a rapid cell identity switch, known as acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). Consequently, Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;Pdx1<sup>f\/f<\/sup> (Pdx1 knockout) mice present with massively accelerated tumor formation. How loss of cell identity cooperates with oncogenic Kras to induce pancreatic transformation is largely unclear.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> To elucidate mechanisms responsible for the cellular reprogramming in Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;Pdx1<sup>f\/f<\/sup> animals, single-cell ATAC-seq from pancreatic bulk tissue was performed. Chromatin accessibility states were captured at early stages of carcinogenesis and correlated to RNA-seq data. Expression of differentially regulated genes was validated by RNAscope and immunohistochemistry staining. The role of identified target genes was studied in pancreatic cancer cell lines.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Single-cell ATAC-seq proved as a powerful tool for defining cell-type identity, cellular reprogramming and target genes in early metaplastic transformation of pancreatic tissue. While sole expression of oncogenic Kras lead to reduced accessibility of acinar differentiation genes in acinar cells, these changes were much more prominent in Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;Pdx1<sup>f\/f <\/sup>mice, promoting metaplastic conversion. Notably, acinar cells of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;Pdx1<sup>f\/f <\/sup>animals as well as a proportion of metaplastic lesions in both, Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> and Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;Pdx1<sup>f\/f <\/sup>mice, showed elevated accessibility and expression of the <i>Ror2 <\/i>gene. As a receptor protein tyrosine kinase, Ror2 controls essential signaling pathways, such as Ras-MAPK signaling. By analyzing Ror2 knockout mice, we found that the receptor kinase regulates the identity of metaplastic epithelia. Immunostaining of pancreatic cancer tissues from Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>;p53<sup>mut <\/sup>(KPC) mice and human PDAC specimens also revealed ROR2 expression in a subset of cancer cells. Knockdown of ROR2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines significantly decreased cell proliferation, while overexpression induced a profound increase in proliferation and in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition based on the downregulation of multiple epithelial markers and an upregulation of an array of mesenchymal genes.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Our in-depth sequencing data revealed that expression of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> with the concomitant loss of Pdx1 leads to vast alterations of acinar cell identity and significantly accelerated transformation.

NKX2-1 (also known as TTF-1, TITF-1) is a lineage defining transcription factor for normal lung development. In LUAD, NKX2-1 is a highly specific and sensitive marker for both primary and metastatic LUADs, with 85-90% expressing NKX2-1. We and others identified that NKX2-1 as the most significantly amplified gene in LUAD, with 22.5% of primary LUADs exhibiting copy number gains. NKX2-1 is amplified as the earliest stages of LUAD development, and NKX2-1 amplification is a truncal event in multi-region LUAD evolution. Despite strong evidence for an oncogenic role for NKX2-1, little is known about the mechanisms of NKX2-1 activation, or how its oncogenic regulation drives LUAD.<br \/>Here, we identify recurrent focal amplification targeting a super-enhancer (SE) of NKX2-1 as a driving event in LUAD. Using epigenomic data from LUAD cell lines and tumors, we identify this region as a alveolar lineage super-enhancer (NKX2-1 SE) that is specifically active in NKX2-1(+) LUAD cell lines and primary tumors. Notably, this region is co-amplified with NKX2-1 in 96-100% of NKX2-1-amplified samples, suggesting this region a critical component of the NKX2-1 amplicon. Using endogenous ChIP-seq and exogenous luciferase assays, we show the enhancer activity of the NKX2-1 SE is comprised of three constituent enhancers, and demonstrate that the key enhancer elements can activate transcription of the NKX2-1 promoter. Using CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) in LUAD cell lines expressing high or low levels of NKX2-1, we show that activity of the NKX2-1 SE defines endogenous NKX2-1 expression.<br \/>Using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq, we find that NKX2-1 controls the transcriptional and epigenomic landscape of lung adenocarcinoma. NKX2-1 knockdown activates an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signature and downregulates an alveolar differentiation signature, including critical markers of LUAD differentiation, such as NAPSA, SFTPA1\/2, and HOPX, at which NKX2-1 mediates lineage enhancer accessibility to regulate target gene expression. Global clustering of LUAD cell lines by RNA-seq or H3K27ac ChIP-seq identifies a distinct NKX2-1(+) cluster, and we find that NKX2-1 directly regulates the genes (57\/97) and enhancers that distinguish this subpopulation. Using genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR screens, we identify a NKX2-1 dependency in NKX2-1(+) LUAD cell lines, and find that the majority of NKX2-1(+) LUAD cell lines (11\/14) assayed are dependent on NKX2-1.<br \/>Our data demonstrates that enhancer amplification is a hallmark of oncogenic NKX2-1 activation in LUAD, through which NKX2-1 drives a lineage addicted state and oncogenic cell proliferation. This suggests that NKX2-1 is a critical defining oncogene for LUAD, and that targeting of NKX2-1 or its enhancer may suppress LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Amplification,Transcription factor,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>John Louis Pulice<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew Meyerson<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"366f3f4b-15c5-4325-96aa-6b91e66f904a","ControlNumber":"7086","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

We therefore propose that RUNX3 is a gatekeeper of cancer development (1).<br \/>In our recent study on how RUNX3 inhibits early-stage cancer development in multiple tissues, we uncovered a previously unknown mode of MYC destabilization by RUNX3. From RNA sequencing, knockdown experiments, tumorigenic assays, protein interaction and ubiquitination studies, we show that the strong inhibitory effects of RUNX3 on proliferation and tumor growth may, in part, be attributed to its ability to promote MYC degradation. The evolutionarily conserved Runt domain of RUNX3 interacts directly with the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper of MYC, resulting in the disruption of MYC\/MAX interaction, enhanced GSK3&#946;-mediated phosphorylation of MYC protein at threonine-58 and its subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (4). MYC inhibitor Omomyc, a short peptide comprising the b HLH LZ domain of MYC with 4 amino acid substitutions, is extremely effective in disrupting MYC\/MAX interaction (5).

Thus, deconvoluting the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to oncogenic gene expression in cancer cells is key to understanding tumor biology. To this end, we have charted the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of breast cancer at single-cell resolution to quantitatively link variation in chromatin accessibility to gene expression across malignant and non-malignant cell types. Our comprehensive dataset profiles the chromatin landscape (scATAC-seq) in concert with the transcriptional profiles (scRNA-seq) of 4 breast cancer cell lines, 12 primary breast tumors, and 4 normal mammary reduction tissue specimens collected and processed immediately after surgical resection. This dataset, encompassing over 250,000 individual cells, allowed us to define the regulatory logic of cancer cells by 1) revealing how the epigenome underlies cellular heterogeneity of these tumors in comparison to normal mammary tissue, 2) defining how malignant cells hijack enhancer elements to drive key transcriptional programs in a subtype-specific manner, and 3) annotating which cancer-specific enhancer-to-gene connections portend a worse outcome in patients. Notably, we discovered that cancer cells acquire <i>de novo<\/i> non-coding enhancer elements to modulate hallmark cancer pathways that were previously hidden using bulk genomics approaches. This highlights the potential for cancer-specific enhancers to serve as markers with diagnostic and prognostic potential, or even serve as tractable targets for therapeutic intervention. Together these data enable the annotation of the cellular composition, transcriptional, and epigenetic landscape of breast tumors to help pinpoint clinically relevant mechanisms of tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Breast cancer,Gene expression,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Matthew  J.

The <i>TP53<\/i> analog <i>TP63<\/i> is rearranged in 5-10% of diverse subtypes of both aggressive T- and B-cell lymphomas. Patients with <i>TP63<\/i>-rearranged lymphomas have dismal outcomes, with 5-year overall survival rates between 0-17%, depending on cohorts. The function and mechanisms of <i>TP63<\/i> rearrangements and TP63 fusion proteins in tumorigenesis are poorly understood. As a result, attempts to treat these patients to date have been largely empiric. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how TP63 fusions contribute to tumorigenesis and to translate the findings into novel therapeutic options for these patients.<br \/>Here, we demonstrated that TP63 fusions are essential for the propagation of T-cell lymphomas (TCLs). Knockdown of TP63 fusions with specific shRNAs in TCL cell lines harboring TP63 fusions suppressed both cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Retroviral expression of TBL1XR1-TP63, the most common TP63 fusion, conferred cytokine independence in Ba\/F3 cells, consistent with its role as an oncogene. To investigate the role of TP63 fusions in T- and B-cell lymphomagenesis, we engineered a CAG-Loxp-Stop-Loxp-<i>TBL1XR1-TP63<\/i> conditional knock-in mouse model and crossed with h<i>CD2<\/i>-Cre mice. This results in expression beginning during early lymphoid development. As observed in patients, transgenic mice developed multiple subtypes of both T- and B-cell lymphoma. To define the effects and mechanisms of TP63 fusions within T cells, we performed CRISPR scanning, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses. Our data showed that domains within both the N-terminal TBL1XR1 and C-terminal TP63 portions contribute to the function of this fusion. We found that the N-terminal component of TP63 fusions interacts with components of the NCOR\/SMRT complex. At the same time, the C-terminal portion of TP63 (which recapitulates the deltaN-p63 isoform expressed in some carcinomas) interacts with the enhancer modifier KMT2D and its complex members. TBL1XR1-TP63 binds to a novel distal enhancer to drive <i>MYC<\/i> expression, and thus upregulates the expression of the histone H3K27 methylase<i> EZH2<\/i>. Finally, we assessed whether EZH2 is a vulnerability of <i>TP63<\/i>-rearranged lymphomas. We found that knockdown of EZH2 in <i>TP63<\/i>-rearranged lines significantly impaired cell growth, as did treatment with the EZH2 and 1 dual inhibitor valemetostat. Valemetostat, which is now being tested in patients with lymphoma, counteracted the oncogenic effects of TP63 fusions in multiple preclinical models <i>in vivo<\/i>. Together, our results identify the TP63 fusion as a highly unique oncogenic driver in lymphomagenesis capable of recruiting multiple epigenetic modifier complexes and inducing a targetable dependence on EZH2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,Oncogene,EZH2,TP63,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gongwei Wu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Noriaki Yoshida<sup>1<\/sup>, Jihe Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoyang Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuan Xiong<sup>1<\/sup>, Tayla Heavican-Foral<sup>1<\/sup>, Huiyun Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Geoffrey Nelson<sup>4<\/sup>, Lu Yang<sup>5<\/sup>, Renee Chen<sup>5<\/sup>, Katherine Donovan<sup>1<\/sup>, Marcus Jones<sup>1<\/sup>, Mikhail Roshal<sup>6<\/sup>, Yanming Zhang<sup>6<\/sup>, Ran Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ajit Nirmal<sup>1<\/sup>, Salvia Jain<sup>7<\/sup>, Catharine Leahy<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristen Jones<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristen Stevenson<sup>1<\/sup>, Natasha Galasso<sup>8<\/sup>, Nivetha Ganesan<sup>8<\/sup>, Tiffany Chang<sup>8<\/sup>, Wen-Chao Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Abner Louissaint<sup>7<\/sup>, Lydie Debaize<sup>1<\/sup>, Hojong Yoon<sup>1<\/sup>, Paola Dal Cin<sup>9<\/sup>, Wing Chan Chan<sup>10<\/sup>, Shannan Ho Sui Ho Sui<sup>2<\/sup>, Samuel Ng<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Feldman<sup>11<\/sup>, Steven M.
