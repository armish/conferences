At diagnosis, most present with hundreds of intraabdominal nodules composed of malignant cells that harbor a EWSR1-WT1 chromosomal translocation and resultant fusion protein (FP). It was shown that subset of DSRCT cells (mostly of epithelial histotype) highly express the androgen receptor (AR), a key epigenetic driver of prostate cancer (PC). To assess the role of AR more comprehensively in DSRCT, we tested if AR antagonists curb cell proliferation and tumor growth. Both enzalutamide and AR-antisense therapy blocked DHT-induced cell proliferation and reduce xenograft tumor burden. Next, to mechanistically interrogate AR&#8217;s oncogenic effects, we performed single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-eq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on frozen patient specimens. Those studies revealed a surprising epigenetic similarity between DSRCT to PC. Though overlap exists in the DNA binding MOTIFs of AR in DSRCT and PC, our ChIP-seq results, interestingly, revealed DSRCT-specific AR DNA binding sites adjacent to key oncogenic regulators, including FOXF1 and WT1 (the C-terminal partner of the pathognomonic FP).To our surprise, we identified a subset of DSRCT samples that underwent partial neuroendocrine (NE) epigenetic reprogramming, akin to what occurs in ~1\/3 of castrate-resistant PC (CRPC). Since androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) isn&#8217;t yet a standard treatment yet for DSRCT, it remains an enigma why DSRCT would spontaneously undergo NE reprogramming or how this might affect ADT sensitivity. To address this, nine DSRCT patient samples were profiled using snRNA-seq. Sub-clustering revealed epithelial, mesenchymal, or NE signatures and marked inter-patient and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Notably, five of nine patients exhibited NE markers (SYP, ENO2, CHG, FOXA2, ASCL1, and SOX2), while three expressed epithelial markers (MUC1, MUC6, KRT18, KRT23, CDH1). One patient exhibited a hybrid AR indifferent phenotype. While strikingly different from PC morphologically and phenotypically, our data suggest that DSRCT is a second androgen-stimulated malignancy. Shared dependence upon AR for tumor growth and survival provides an exciting opportunity to prospectively study AR signaling in a different cancer type and younger DSRCT-stricken patient population. Ongoing work will determine if DSRCT undergoes dedifferentiation towards a more stem-like cell as an intermediary step before undergoing neural lineage commitment or transdifferentiation directly from an epithelial cell type towards a neuroendocrine cell fate. We are also exploring whether the FP acts as a Pioneer factor to direct AR towards DSRCT-specific androgen response elements that explain this sarcoma subtype&#8217;s unique clinical presentation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Microenvironment,Biomarkers,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Danh Truong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Salah-Eddine Lamhamedi-Cherradi<sup>2<\/sup>, Mayinuer Maitituoheti<sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah  C.

CAR T cell therapy (CAR T) is a promising approach to improve outcomes for patients with this disease. However, progress is hindered by a lack of targetable surface antigens and limited availability of relevant preclinical models. B7-H3 is a promising immunotherapeutic target but little is known about its expression in pediatric ACC. Thus, we sought to i) evaluate B7-H3 expression in primary pediatric ACC samples and ii) assess B7-H3-CAR T activity in two novel pediatric patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. First, we assessed B7-H3 expression in 44 pediatric adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) using a CLIA-approved immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. ACTs had a range of B7-H3 positivity, including 24 (55%) with expression above the threshold for eligibility on our active B7-H3-CAR T clinical trial (H-score &#8805; 100; NCT04897321). Univariate analyses demonstrated B7-H3 expression was correlated with the presence of germline <i>TP53<\/i> mutations and poor prognostic factors including the inability to achieve complete resection, Cushing phenotype, and the absence of TP53 by IHC. Given a dearth of in vivo models, we next established two clinically relevant pediatric ACC PDX models. SJ-ACC4 was derived from a metastatic tumor and had somatic mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> (p.C135Lfs*14) and <i>CTNNB1 <\/i>(p.S45F). SJACT030812_X1 (www.stjude.org\/cstn) was derived from a primary tumor and had a germline <i>TP53<\/i> mutation (p.R110Pfs*39). Both had partial <i>ATRX<\/i> deletions (exons 11-30; 3-28), uniparental disomy at chromosome 11p15, and were B7-H3-positive. Notably, SJ-ACC4 was resistant to a battery of chemotherapeutic agents. To evaluate B7-H3-CAR T anti-ACC activity in vivo, SJ-ACC4 tumor fragments were implanted subcutaneously in NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice and treated with B7-H3-CAR or control T cells. Strikingly, B7-H3-CAR T eradicated 100% of SJ-ACC4 tumors and mice survived long term compared to controls that met endpoints within 35 days (n=8 per group, p&#60; 0.0001). Finally, we asked if B7-H3-CAR T had antitumor activity in an orthotopic pediatric ACC PDX model. SJACT030812_X1 cells were injected into the para-adrenal region of NSG mice under ultrasound guidance and monitored by serial volumetric ultrasonography. B7-H3-CAR T again had significant antitumor activity, and mice survived long-term compared to controls that met endpoints within 42 days (n=5 per group, p&#60; 0.01). In conclusion, B7-H3 is expressed in a majority of pediatric ACTs and B7-H3-CAR T have potent anti-ACC activity. These findings provide a strong rationale for clinically evaluating B7-H3-CAR T for pediatric patients with chemotherapy-resistant ACC. Additionally, the newly established pediatric ACC PDX models provide a valuable resource for investigating different aspects of this rare and aggressive disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Pediatric cancers,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rebecca Epperly<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emilia M.

Characterization of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) is key to understand MHC-restricted anti-tumor immunity and for developing T cell-centered immunotherapies such as adoptive cell therapy and tumor vaccines. In the current work, we investigated RNA-Seq data from 997 pediatric brain tumor patients and performed a large-scale comprehensive examination of the immunogenomic and TCR landscape of TILs across the entire spectrum of pediatric brain tumors. We show that the relative ratio between T cell clonal diversity and T cell abundance within each sample, represented by the clonal expansion index (CEI), is a strong predictor of prognosis both within and between tumor types. Interestingly, we show that CEI is strongly associated with molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma but not with known genomic features of these subgroups. Investigation of TCR clonotypes recognizing a common recurrent tumor-antigen across patients based on CDR3 homology and characteristics, reveals 9 TCR clusters which are tumor-type restricted with defined prognoses and HLA dominance. Using computational immunogenomics and machine learning-based investigations of these clusters we identified novel putative HLA-restricted tumor antigens which could bind and activate the clusters&#8217; specific TCRs. Importantly, our framework grounded the foundations for developing a precision medicine approach of T cell-centered immunotherapies. These findings have major implications for understanding the interplay between T cell and tumor genomics, and for developing new immunotherapies for children with brain tumors and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Immunotherapy ,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Itay Raphael<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michal Nisnboym<sup>2<\/sup>, Rebecca  A.

Recently, immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies targeting GD2 have improved survival rates for some patients with NB. Unfortunately, this response is not uniform, suggesting an incomplete understanding of the underlying immune biology. Large-scale sequencing of patient tumors have suggested that NB has diverse immune microenvironments (TMEs), which are associated with <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplification (A) and patient outcomes. These results need to be further validated, specifically to determine whether the infiltrating immune cells can interact with tumor cells and if the TME is impacted by therapeutic pressures. We hypothesized the TME is dynamic, changing with therapy, influenced by molecular subtype, and associated with patient outcomes.<br \/>Methods: To better understand the NB TME, we obtained 93 clinically annotated tumors from 72 pediatric patients with NB, consisting of high-risk primary and metastatic tumors both pre- and post- chemotherapy. We designed multiplexed antibody panels targeting immune cells and performed either imaging mass cytometry (IMC) (<i>n <\/i>= 46) or NanoString GeoMx DSP (<i>n<\/i> = 47).<br \/>Results: We identified 4 different immune cell types (CD8, CD4, myeloid, and NK cells) and confirmed that <i>MYCN<\/i>-non amplified (NA) tumors display higher frequencies of lymphocytes<i> <\/i>including CD4 (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.003) and CD8 (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.005) T-cells. Using nearest neighbors&#8217; analysis, we found that CD4 cells are closer to tumor (<i>p<\/i> = 6.24E-16) and CD8 T-cells (<i>p<\/i> = 7.55E-11) in <i>MYCN<\/i>-NA tumors compared to <i>MYCN<\/i>-A. However, in <i>MYCN<\/i>-NA tumors, myeloid cells are also closer to tumor, (<i>p<\/i> = 1.71E-68), CD4 (<i>p<\/i> = 4.72E-58), and CD8 T-cells (<i>p<\/i> = 1.27E-70). Furthermore, we find that all immune cell subsets are further away from tumor cells independently of subtype following exposure to chemotherapy, and that there is a decrease (<i>p<\/i> = 0.0091) in the number of myeloid cells in <i>MYCN<\/i>-NA tumors, but not <i>MYCN<\/i>-A. Interestingly, we also observed an increased expression of the immune checkpoints CTLA-4 (<i>p <\/i>= 0.043) and the exhaustion marker TIM-3 (<i>p <\/i>= 2.05E-5), but not PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2, post chemotherapy, suggesting blockade of CTLA-4 or TIM-3 could improve response to therapy in these patients. Notably, high expression of CD56, a marker for both NK cells and NB, was associated with increased overall survival, indicating a potential role of NK cells in improving outcomes.<br \/>Conclusions: Using two independent protein-based profiling methods, we investigated the TME in clinically annotated patient NBs.

RB has a near-perfect prognosis in developed countries, but a significant dip in patient survival is observed in low and middle-income nations, with an overall survival rate of around 40%. Chemotherapy is a primary treatment modality in RB. However, the immediate and long-term side effects of conventional and intra-arterial chemotherapies necessitate the need for additional treatment options. Aurora kinases are serine\/threonine kinases that play a pivotal role in mitosis. In recent years, Aurora kinase A (AURKA) has gained prominence as a drug target in various tumors and several small molecule inhibitors of AURKA are currently in clinical development. In this study, we have shown that AURKA is overexpressed in RB patient specimens and cell lines using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Moreover, induced expression of AURKA significantly correlated with optic nerve invasion of the tumor suggesting a role of AURKA in RB progression. Inhibition of AURKA in RB cell lines and patient specimens using small molecule inhibitors or selective silencing with lentivirus-mediated shRNA knockdown led to decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at G2\/M phase and subsequent induction of polyploidy. To further investigate the deleterious effects of AURKA inhibition within the tumor microenvironment, chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) xenografts with RB cells were performed. The <i>in-ovo<\/i> data revealed a delay in tumor growth when treated with AURKA inhibitors. MYCN is an essential oncogene in RB progression immediately to RB1 mutations. Notably, an in-silico promoter analysis predicted the presence of MYCN binding sites upstream of the transcription start site of <i>AURKA<\/i>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation - qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) confirmed the binding of MYCN to the promoter region of <i>AURKA<\/i>. Besides, immunoblots corroborated that AURKA was downregulated in MYCN knockdown RB cells. Overall, our findings show that elevated AURKA levels in RB could be targeted <i>in-vitro<\/i> and <i>in-ovo<\/i>, and its expression is transcriptionally regulated by the MYCN oncogene. These data not only shed light on the role of AURKA in RB tumorigenesis but also unravel its potential as a therapeutic target, in isolation or through MYCN-driven downstream pathways.

There is an urgent need to identify new surface targets in osteosarcoma and develop novel therapies to increase cure rates. Antibody-drug conjugates, due to their targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads to specific targets, are an attractive class of agents for potential use in osteosarcoma.<br \/>Methods: We used an integrated proteomic and transcriptomic surfaceome profiling approach to identify cell-surface proteins that are highly expressed in osteosarcoma but minimally expressed on normal tissues. Cell-surface expression of the identified target antigen was validated by IHC and flow cytometry in osteosarcoma cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and a patient tumor tissue microarray. As a proof of concept, humanized CADM1 antibody (clone PTA021-A1) was conjugated with tesirine (SG3249), a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer payload. The antitumor activity of this antibody-drug conjugate was tested in vitro and in vivo in osteosarcoma cell lines and PDX models.<br \/>Results: Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (CADM1) was found to be enriched in osteosarcoma at both protein and mRNA levels, while minimally expressed in normal tissues. Flow cytometry validated the cell-surface localization and expression levels of CADM1 in 7 osteosarcoma cell lines. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using an osteosarcoma tissue microarray from 37 patients and 19 PDX models. CADM1 was expressed in 100% of the patient samples and PDXs. The newly developed ADC induced cytotoxic effects in 100% (5\/5) of osteosarcoma cell lines, with IC 50 at 120h ranging from 0.009 to 0.1 ug\/ml. In vivo testing is ongoing. Preliminary data shows objective response and prolonged survival in selected osteosarcoma PDX models. The mice tolerated the ADC well with minimal toxicity.<br \/>Conclusions: CADM1 is highly expressed in most osteosarcoma samples and minimally expressed in normal human tissue, which makes it an attractive target for respective antigen-targeting ADC therapies. The CADM1 targeting ADC showed antitumor activities in osteosarcoma preclinical models which may warrant further investigation of CADM1 targeted therapies for osteosarcoma.<br \/>Acknowledgments: This work was funded by Swim Across America, the Foster Foundation, the Osteosarcoma Institute Translational and Preclinical Grant, and the Barbara Epstein Foundation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yifei Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zhongting Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Wendong Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xiangjun Tian<sup><\/sup>, Rossana Lazcano<sup><\/sup>, Michael Roth<sup><\/sup>, Jonathan Gill<sup><\/sup>, Douglas Harrison<sup><\/sup>, Zhaohui Xu<sup><\/sup>, Yizheng Tu<sup><\/sup>, Sylvester Jusu<sup><\/sup>, Giuseppe Longo<sup><\/sup>, Xin Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Jing Wang<sup><\/sup>, Richard Gorlick<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"61d32c94-c750-4228-b12e-42bbcc812c98","ControlNumber":"3554","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.
