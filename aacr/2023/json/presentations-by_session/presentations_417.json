[{"Abstract":"Background: High dose acetaminophen (AAP) with n-acetylcysteine (NAC) rescue is among the few treatments that has shown a signal of activity in phase I trials (21% response rate, 3\/14 assessable patients) without achieving dose limiting toxicity that has not progressed to evaluation in later line studies. We have previously shown that high dose AAP selectively depletes glutathione in the liver but not the tumor, suggesting that NAC, the FDA-approved antidote for AAP toxicity and a glutathione precursor, may selectively rescue the normal liver but not the tumor from high dose AAP. While the anti-tumor effects of AAP\/NAC appear to not be mediated by glutathione depletion and free radical injury, the mechanism of anti-tumor effects of AAP\/NAC has not been definitively characterized.<br \/>Methods: In vitro the effects of Vehicle, AAP, or AAP\/NAC was evaluated on bone marrow derived macrophages polarized to M2 and M1 phenotypes using IL-4 or IFN\/LPS, respectively. Tumor cell viability was assessed with MTT assay. Effects of AAP on IL-4\/STAT6 (M2) or IFN\/LPS\/STAT1 (M1) signaling, and downstream gene and protein expression was studied. In vivo, effects of AAP\/NAC on tumor size and tumor associated macrophage polarization were characterized in orthotopic triple negative breast tumor models 4T1 and EF43.fgf4 using cytokine elisa of tumor lysate and flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: NAC reversed AAP toxicity in the normal liver but did not reverse AAP cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro. AAP\/NAC selectively inhibited IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation but not IFN\/LPS-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. Downstream, AAP\/NAC inhibited IL-4 induction of M2-associated genes (such as CCL24, YM1 and arginase) and proteins (arginase, PD-L2, and CD206). However, AAP\/NAC did not inhibit IFN\/LPS induction of M1-associated genes (IL-6, TNF, IL-12) and proteins (INOS, PD-L1, MHC I, and CD64). In vivo, AAP\/NAC inhibited tumor growth in EF43.fgf4 and 4T1 triple negative breast tumors. Flow cytometry of tumor associated macrophages revealed that AAP\/NAC selectively inhibited M2 but not M1 polarization. ELISA of tumor lysate demonstrated relatively stable expression of IFN gamma but markedly suppressed expression of IL-10 in the tumor immune microenvironment.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study is the first to show that at high doses AAP\/NAC has profound effects on the tumor immune microenvironment that may facilitate immune-mediated inhibition of tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,JAK,STAT,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexander Neuwelt<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Allyn Bryan<sup><\/sup>, Won Lee<sup><\/sup>, Pavani Pingali<sup><\/sup>, Howard Li<sup><\/sup>, Bhaumik Patel<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Veterans Affairs, Richmond, VA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"45770e1b-56d4-4b9b-a3cb-061c86ca7c6a","ControlNumber":"679","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Drug-induced dead tumor cells have been reported to enhance anti-tumor immunity, but results are conflicting, possibly due to the immunosuppressive effects of the cytotoxic drugs. To investigate whether apoptotic tumor cells trigger anti-tumor immunity independent of anti-cancer treatment, local immune responses were evaluated after direct induction of tumor cell apoptosis using a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk)\/ganciclovir (GCV) system. The inflammatory cytokines IFN&#947; and IL-12&#946; and anti-inflammatory factor PD-1 and TGF&#946;1 were upregulated at the tumor site after apoptosis induction. HSV-tk\/GCV-induced tumor cell apoptosis resulted in suppression of tumor growth in vivo and promoted the infiltration of CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes in tumor. To explore the role of T cells after induction of tumor cell death, GCV was administered together with anti-CD8 or anti-CD4 depleting antibodies to syngeneic HSV-tk transfected tumor-bearing mice. CD8 T cell depletion abrogated the anti-tumor efficacy of GCV, indicating that tumor regression was mainly dependent on CD8 T cells. This anti-tumor immunity was enhanced by anti-PD-1 antibody injection. On the contrary, CD4 T cell depletion further inhibited tumor growth than GCV alone, suggesting the potential role of CD4 T cells in suppressive tumor immunity. To elucidate this immunological mechanism, tumor tissues were evaluated after tumor cell apoptosis and CD4 T cell depletion. Foxp3, a regulatory T cell marker, was decreased after CD4 T cell depletion. In addition, Arg1, a marker of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, was significantly downregulated, which was expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mMDSCs). Collectively, these findings indicate that tumor cell apoptosis accelerates CD8 T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity and CD4 T cell-mediated Arg1 production from TAMs and mMDSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,T cell,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sho Umegaki<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hidekazu Shirota<sup><\/sup>, Tomoyuki Iwasaki<sup><\/sup>, Yuki Kasahara<sup><\/sup>, Chikashi Ishioka<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Medical Oncology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"54c41969-e4eb-4fce-8a2f-0cec1f100836","ControlNumber":"3421","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Overcoming this variability while sparing normal cells has stymied broad-acting therapy development. Our innate immune system evolved to clear genetically diverse pathogens and limit host toxicity, raising the possibility that it can produce similar effects in cancer. Previous studies showed that neutrophil elastase (ELANE) - a neutrophil-derived serine protease - killed a wide range of cancer cells without harming non-cancer cells by cleaving CD95, the FAS receptor (Cui et al.,Cell, 2021). ELANE attenuated primary tumor growth and produced a CD8+T cell-mediated abscopal effect to attack metastases. Here we leveraged this ELANE-mediated pathway to produce an optimized N17350 biologic and tested its effects on tumor development, both as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Our findings underscore the viability of N17350 as a new therapeutic modality leveraging innate immunity.<br \/>METHODS: Anti-cancer effects of N17350 were examined in vitro and in vivo and compared with standard of care (SoC) agents. For in vitro studies, cells were treated with N17350 and viability was quantified by calcein-AM and immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers. Cancer\/non-cancer cells included human\/murine cell lines and primary cells isolated from healthy donors and ovarian cancer patients. We further tested the ability of cancer cells to develop resistance to N17350 and FAS-L. For in vivo studies, a single dose of N17350 was delivered intratumorally into CT26 (colon) and 4T1 (metastatic breast) tumors. Effects on primary and metastatic tumor growth, immunology, and survival were assessed in comparison to SoC agents (oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide) or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA4).<br \/>RESULTS: N17350 killed and induced ICD markers in all cancer cell types tested without harming non-cancer cells, while SoC agents were similarly toxic to both cell types. Repeatedly killing E0771 cancer cells with N17350 did not produce resistance, which was observed with a FAS-L that targets CD95 via a distinct mechanism. A single intra-tumoral dose of N17350 produced durable effects in the 4T1 and CT26 models (CT26:75%-100% tumor-free). N17350 induced a robust innate\/adaptive immune profile, abscopal effect to limit 4T1 lung metastasis, and synergized with anti-CTLA4 in cold (4T1) and hot (CT26) tumors. Finally, N17350 showed markedly improved efficacy over SoC agents in both models.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that N17350 selectively kills cancer cells, produces complete responses in a subset of mice, induces favorable innate and adaptive immunology, and combines with checkpoint inhibitors in cold and hot tumors. Its ability to escape resistance, produce abscopal effects, and outperform SoC chemotherapies warrants further studies of this unique therapeutic modality in a clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Anticancer therapy,Therapeutics,Immunogenic cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ravindra Gujar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chang Cui<sup>1<\/sup>, Lilibet Valdovinos<sup>1<\/sup>, Christine Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Arezoo Arjmand<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole Grigaitis<sup>1<\/sup>, Asna Khalid<sup>1<\/sup>, Catherine  A.

Previous studies have demonstrated that PEF induces immunogenic cell death by activating inflammatory signaling pathways and stimulation of antigen presenting cells withing the tumor micro-environment. PEF ablation provides a tumor focused <i>in situ<\/i> vaccination strategy that combines with checkpoint blockade. We hypothesized that PEF ablation should synergize with chemotherapy and anti-PD1 in a model where checkpoint inhibitors are inactive.<br \/>Experimental Design: To test this hypothesis, we utilized a highly aggressive syngeneic orthotopic triple negative breast cancer 4T1 mouse model that is non-responsive to anti-PD1 and only marginally responsive to cisplatin to determine if this combination treatment could prolong survival. Thirty-two Balb\/c mice were inoculated in the mammary fat pad with 200,000 4T1 cells. Once tumors were established (5mm in diameter), animals were randomized to the following groups: (A) Sham\/IgG control (n=8; needle inserted but no PEF), (B) PEF only (n=8), (C) cisplatin + anti-PD-1 (n=8) and (D) PEF + cisplatin + anti PD-1 (n=8). Tumors in groups B and D were treated once with PEF. Anti-PD1 and isotype matched control IgG was administered once per week (200&#956;g, i.p injections) starting on the day of PEF (Group D) for four weeks. Cisplatin was administered (2mg\/kg, i.v) once per week for four weeks starting on the day of PEF (d=0) for four weeks. All the mammary fat pad tumors were resected when they achieved a tumor volume of ~200 mm<sup>3<\/sup> to recapitulate post-resection metastatic relapse (See Schematic 1).<br \/>Results and Conclusions: All mice in the Sham-control IgG group needed to be euthanized by day 43 due to metastases in multiple organs including lungs, bones, liver and brain. All mice in the cisplatin + anti PD-1 group had to be euthanized by day 74. Interestingly, all groups that were treated with PEF survived much longer. On day 90, 28% of mice in the PEF alone group were alive and 43% were alive in the PEF + anti-PD1 + Cisplatin (see Figure 1). The rank-log p-value for the Kaplan-Meier survival curve was statistically significant.<br \/>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PEF treatment in combination with anti-PD1 and Cisplatin significantly prolongs survival in a highly aggressive triple negative breast tumor mouse model that is non-responsive to immunotherapy. These findings support evaluation of PEF in cancer patients that are receiving combination of checkpoint blockade and chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune response,Chemotherapy,Tumor-associated antigen (TAA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chiara Pastori<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mukta Wagh<sup>1<\/sup>, Ebtesam Nafie<sup>1<\/sup>, Fatima Murad<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohit Trikha<sup>2<\/sup>, Robert Neal<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Galvanize Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Apple Tree Partners, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d4b179ac-4202-418d-b36f-1f286aaeb2bb","ControlNumber":"3894","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

Most patients are diagnosed with EOC at advanced stages and have limited treatment options. Developing new therapies that are effective against localized and disseminated disease is imperative. Unfortunately, clinical trials evaluating immunotherapies in EOC have not been consistently effective. Preclinical data have shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy can help increase antigen presentation and T cell infiltration, as well as decrease immunosuppressive effectors, suggesting that combining cytotoxic chemotherapy with immunotherapies can be a powerful approach to potentiate antitumor responses in EOC. However, studies looking at the combination of immunotherapies with carboplatin and paclitaxel, which are the mainstay chemotherapies for EOC, have not improved progression-free survival rates. We propose a novel combination approach using the well-tolerated, FDA-approved, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitor atovaquone as a sensitizer to cellular immunotherapies for EOC. OXPHOS inhibition leads to oxidative stress, which in turn leads to DNA and protein damage, activation of stress response pathways, and ultimately cell death. During cell injury and death, Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) can be released into the extracellular environments, activate the innate immune system, and lead to immunogenic cell death. We have previously shown that atovaquone leads to increased reactive oxygen species levels and DNA damage. Thus, we hypothesized that atovaquone treatment would lead to release of DAMPs, including HMGB1 and TFAM, from EOC cells. Following treatment with atovaquone, we collected the supernatant of EOC cell cultures at different timepoints and measured HMGB1 and TFAM concentrations via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We observed that both HMGB1 and TFAM concentrations were elevated at 24 and 48 hours following atovaquone treatment. This suggests that atovaquone can facilitate immune detection and attack by promoting DAMPs release. When DAMPs are released into the extracellular environment, they are recognized by innate immune cells, which become activated to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase antigen presentation to T cells. Given our results showing increased release of DAMPs following exposure to atovaquone, we are developing an in vitro culture system to study immune cell responses to atovaquone-treated EOC cells. We are also monitoring transcriptomic responses of EOC cells treated with atovaquone to identify changes in expression of DAMPs and other immune-activating pathways through RNA sequencing. Our ultimate goal is to test T cell recognition and responses toward atovaquone-treated EOC cells with the intention of utilizing this chemotherapeutic agent as an adjunct to immunotherapeutic efforts for EOC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immunostimulation,Immunogenic cell death,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mayra  A.

Yet, redundant TME immunosuppressive mechanisms and epigenetic maintenance of T-cell exhaustion limit the efficacy of T-cell targeted therapies in CLL. Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins regulate key pathways contributing to CLL pathogenesis and TME interactions, including T-cell function and differentiation. We hypothesize that blocking BET protein function can reverse T-cell exhaustion to yield durable tumor elimination in CLL.<br \/>Methods: WT C57BL\/6 mice were engrafted with E&#956;-TCL1 spleen-derived lymphocytes, then treated daily with the novel pan-BET inhibitor, OPN-51107 (OPN5; 20mg\/kg PO) for up to 4 weeks. Splenic gene expression was evaluated with the NanoString PanCancer iO360 panel. T-cell differentiation status, immune inhibitory receptor (IR) expression, proliferation (72 h ex vivo &#945;-CD3\/&#945;-CD28 stimulation), and cytokine production (6 h ex vivo PMA\/ionomycin stimulation) was measured via flow cytometry. CLL patient and healthy donor PBMCs were used for validation studies and to assess T-cell transcription factor (TF) expression via flow cytometry. Evaluation of BRD4 occupancy at select T-cell TFs via ChIP qPCR is ongoing.<br \/>Results: OPN5 significantly increased cytotoxic cell signatures and reduced exhaustion-associated cell signatures in leukemic mice through inhibition of T-cell exhaustion signaling, as well as activation of Th1, natural killer cell, and IL-7 signaling pathways. Correspondingly, T-cells from OPN5-treated mice demonstrated greater ex vivo proliferative capacity and effector response to stimuli. A greater proportion of CD8+ T-cells from OPN5-treated mice were classified as na&#239;ve, and OPN5 significantly reduced KLRG1 expression on antigen-experienced CD8+ T-cells. Importantly, OPN5 curtailed IR co-expression (PD-1, PD-L1, VISTA, CD244, CD160, and LAG3) on splenic T-cells. These findings were confirmed with primary CLL cells ex vivo. OPN5 also impaired expression of terminal differentiation-associated TFs in CLL patient-derived T-cells, enriching for a TCF1+ progenitor T-cell population. While BTK inhibitors are known to similarly improve T-cell function in CLL, ibrutinib treatment was inadequate to revert CLL T-cell terminal differentiation. Future ATAC-sequencing analysis will inform how BET inhibition alleviates exhaustion-associated chromatin organization in CLL T-cells.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>BET inhibition dismantles immunosuppressive mechanisms in the CLL TME, alleviating CLL-induced T-cell dysfunction and terminal differentiation. These findings suggest that BET inhibition may be a useful component of combination strategies for the treatment of CLL to yield lasting anti-cancer immune memory and prevent relapsed\/refractory disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BET inhibitor,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,T cell,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Audrey  L.

However, TNBC typically has a higher mutational burden and greater degree of immunogenicity than other breast tumors, making immunotherapy a viable strategy for effective treatment. Strategies to improve the response of TNBC patients to immunotherapy include the upregulation of the cGAS-STING innate immune sensing pathway and STING agonists are in clinical development. We previously showed that eribulin, a microtubule destabilizer used in the treatment of TNBC, functions as an indirect STING agonist because it promotes the release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm. In separate studies, we demonstrated that eribulin also significantly enhances type I interferon expression induced by STING agonists through a second TBK1-dependent mechanism downstream of STING activation. Both mechanisms of eribulin-mediated activation of interferon expression occur in immune and TNBC cells and are shared with other microtubule destabilizers but not with the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel. Our current studies demonstrate the in vivo immunological effects of the microtubule destabilizer eribulin with the STING agonist ADU-S100 that lead to a significant decrease in tumor growth in the spontaneous MMTV-PyVT mammary tumor model upon combination treatment. The immunostimulatory effects of eribulin with or without concurrent administration of a STING agonist were determined in the spleen, tumor draining lymph nodes, and tumors with distinct effects observed in the activation of innate and adaptive responses. We further demonstrate the immunological and antitumor efficacy of combinations of eribulin and ADU-S100 in the syngeneic 4T1 model that is resistant to the antimitotic effects of eribulin as a single agent. Even in the absence of direct antimitotic effects on the tumor, eribulin was sufficient to promote activation of CD4<sup>+<\/sup>CD25<sup>-<\/sup> effector T-cells in the spleen and lymph nodes specifically in tumored animals but not untumored controls. Additionally, eribulin was able to promote a similar increase in the activation of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> effector T-cells even in untumored animals when administered in combination with a STING agonist. Together, these data contribute to accumulating evidence that there are important mechanistic differences between the microtubule targeted chemotherapeutics currently used in the treatment of TNBC that could inform on their more rational use in the clinic as single agents or as chemotherapeutic backbones in combination with targeted therapy, including immunotherapeutics. More specifically, our data demonstrate that eribulin can act as an immune adjuvant to promote STING signaling and T-cell activation in multiple in vivo TNBC models in addition to its well established anti-mitotic effects to enhance antitumor efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Chemotherapy,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leila Takahashi-Ruiz<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Charles  S.

Preclinical studies in BRCA1-deficient tumor models have demonstrated that the immune compartment is required for PARPi efficacy through the ability of PARPi to cause micronuclei formation and activate cGAS in tumors cells. The production of the 2&#8217;3&#8217;-cGAMP secondary intermediate stimulates STING in neighboring tumor-infiltrating immune cells to promote an anti-tumor response. Despite this evidence of immune stimulation, PARPi does not extend overall survival in TNBC patients, suggesting that immune suppression remains a significant barrier for efficacy.

The combinatorial therapy approach has emerged as a useful treatment option for various types of cancer to target tumor heterogeneity and overcome the limitations of existing treatment modalities. Here, we explored the combination of NCX 4040, a nitric oxide-releasing aspirin derivative and Napabucasin, a recently developed STAT3 and cancer stemness inhibitor as a potential treatment for PCa. Two cellular models were used namely BPH-Cd, a cadmium-transformed carcinogenic cell line and DU145, a brain metastatic PCa cell line. Cell viability assay indicated reduced cell viability in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and more so in combination as opposed to individual treatments, with an IC<sub>5<\/sub><sub>0<\/sub> of 5 &#181;M for NCX 4040 and 250 nM for Napabucasin. Notably, treatment with catalase prevented the synergistic activity of NCX 4040 and Napabucasin in reducing the viability of these cells. This suggested that NCX 4040 and Napabucasin might be inducing oxidative stress related cellular death. In addition, the combination of NCX 4040 and Napabucasin robustly impeded the <i>in-vitro<\/i> tumorigenic potential in both cell lines in colony formation assay and decreased the size of spheroids with increasing doses in <i>in-vitr<\/i><i>o<\/i> 3D spheroid assay in BPH-Cd. Western blot analysis revealed that in addition to the downregulation of STAT3, NCX 4040 and Napabucasin treatment showed upregulation in cGAS-STING immunogenic activation pathway related markers (pSTING, cGAS, pTBK1 in DU145 and STING, TBK1 in BPH-Cd). This data demonstrated that combination drug treatment might be inducing cell death via immunogenic activation. Additional markers related to this pathway are being tested in both cellular models. Interestingly, thioredoxin (TRX)-interacting protein was highly upregulated in both cell lines following combination treatment indicating that the synergistic effects are mediated via targeting TRX-regulated cellular redox signaling. Subsequently, TRX and thioredoxin reductase 1 were also downregulated in both cell lines. Furthermore, confocal imaging analysis indicated that NCX 4040 and Napabucasin together might be causing DNA damage and mitochondrial stress as DNA release was clearly evident. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the drug combination shows a synergistic effect in producing excess mitochondrial and cellular ROS, causing apoptosis and in inducing cell cycle arrest in both BPH-Cd and DU145 cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates that NCX 4040 and Napabucasin in combination could be a potential anti-PCa therapy which warrants further evaluation for its clinical application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,STAT3,Immunomodulation,Oxidative stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nishtha Pathak<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gnanasekar Munirathinam<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biomedical Sciences, University of Illinois College of Medicine (Rockford), Rockford, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c39df8ae-0c79-4fa3-b466-983363d8f0b0","ControlNumber":"3056","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

However, it remains unclear why paclitaxel is necessary for response to TIM-3 blockade. Here we demonstrate that the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel induce the loss of HMGB1 from breast cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Interestingly, this does not occur through loss of cellular integrity, but rather through an active secretion process involving ADP-ribosylation of HMGB1 by PARP1. PARP1 was activated by docetaxel treatment, as measured by detection of its cleaved form in the cytoplasm, and HMGB1 release was prevented by the use of the PARP inhibitor niraparib. Both PARP1 activation and ADP-ribosylation of HMGB1 were dependent upon the activity of TLR4, a known receptor for paclitaxel, as demonstrated with CRISPR\/Cas9-generated knockout cells and TLR4 inhibitors. However, TLR4 stimulation alone was insufficient to induce HMGB1 release. By understanding how taxanes promote the release of HMGB1 we may be able to develop biomarkers for the selection of patients most likely to respond to the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy with TIM-3 blocking antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexis Onimus<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jessica Mandula<sup><\/sup>, Paulo Rodriguez<sup><\/sup>, Brian Ruffell<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Immunology, H.

This feature, present in only 4-5% of metastatic CRCs, causes a significant increase of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and tumor neoantigens, ultimately leading to immune rejection. On the other hand, for the majority of MMR proficient (MMRp) CRCs, cytotoxic chemotherapy &#177; targeted agents still constitute the mainstay of the treatment.<sup> <\/sup>Interestingly, even though it is known that cytotoxic agents induce mutations, their immunogenic potential is still not fully understood. The aim of this work is to systematically investigate the immunogenicity of chemotherapy-induced mutations in CRC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed a two-step experiment: first, murine CRC models were exposed to chemotherapy agents in an immune-free context (priming phase) and then challenged in immune-deficient and -proficient contexts (editing phase). Chemotherapy agents included the commonly used cytotoxic drugs 5-fluorouracil (5FU), oxaliplatin, SN38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), cisplatin, and temozolomide, used as single drugs or combinations, in a pulsatile schedule using weekly &#8216;cycles&#8217; (2 days on\/5 days off) in order to mimic drug exposure in clinical settings. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed at baseline, and after both the priming and the editing phases.<br \/><b>Results and discussion: <\/b>WES analysis showed that cisplatin-based treatment is associated with the highest increase in TMB and predicted neoantigens when compared to 5FU-based combinations. Multiple mutational processes contribute to the accumulation of mutations upon exposure to chemotherapy, as revealed by analysis of mutational signatures. A statistically significant growth delay and increased survival was reported for tumors primed with cisplatin\/temozolomide and 5FU\/Oxaliplatin\/SN38 (FOLFOXIRI) combinations compared to unprimed tumors in immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient mice, suggesting the active involvement of the immune system in controlling tumor growth. Sequencing data of residual (escaped) tumors at the end of the editing phase revealed a preferential loss of mutations etiologically linked to chemotherapy in the immunocompetent models, pinpointing an active immune-editing of chemotherapy-induced mutations.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Cisplatin\/temozolomide and FOLFOXIRI treatment effectively prime murine CRC models for subsequent immune rejection. These results suggest that the anticancer effect of chemotherapy treatment may be in part mediated by the immune-editing of chemotherapy-induced mutant cancer subclones.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Chemotherapy,Tumor mutational burden,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pietro Paolo Vitiello<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rosaria Chilà<sup>2<\/sup>, Giuseppe Rospo<sup>3<\/sup>, Gaia Grasso<sup>3<\/sup>, Giovanni Crisafulli<sup>2<\/sup>, Alice Bartolini<sup>4<\/sup>, Vito Amodio<sup>2<\/sup>, Federica Di Nicolantonio<sup>3<\/sup>, Giovanni Germano<sup>3<\/sup>, Alberto Bardelli<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Università degli Studi di Torino; IFOM - AIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology ETS, Milan, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>IFOM - AIRC Istitute of Molecular Oncology - ETS, Milan, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Università degli Studi di Torino, Torino, Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>Candiolo Cancer Center, Candiolo (Torino), Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6f207b7c-db2b-4247-880e-9e9c48a25217","ControlNumber":"6018","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

Current oncology precision medicine approaches rely on targeting known acquired resistance mutations, such as EGFR T790M or ALK\/ROS mutations in NSCLC with 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation molecules designed to overcome or prevent resistance. These next generation targeted therapeutic approaches have increasingly long and complex drug development timelines and burdensome toxicities from off target effects (e.g. wild-type receptor targeting) or drug-drug interactions (DDI). The toxicities limit tolerability, compliance and combinability of different targeted therapeutics. RNA-based immunotherapy approaches offer an increasingly attractive alternative to next generation small molecule targeted therapeutics approaches: (1) RNA-based approaches only require a known acquired resistance sequence, (2) drug development timelines, cost and complexity can be meaningfully condensed, and (3) multiple acquired resistance mutations can be targeted with the same candidate. RBI-1000 is a candidate using a novel type of self-replicating RNA (srRNA) to generate robust immunity directed against acquired resistance mutations that develop in ER+ breast cancer (ER+ BC) in response to endocrine therapy. RBI-1000 includes on-target mutations within the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain, and bypass mutations either in the form of activating mutations in the PI3K kinase domain or amplifications of HER2\/HER3. Here, we demonstrate that this srRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle primes polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells leading to tumor growth inhibition and improved survival in a mouse model expressing the targeted acquired resistance mutation. Priming of T cells against acquired mutations is also confirmed in human HLA-transgenic mice. The immune cell-mediated elimination of clones expressing the acquired resistance mutations is predicted to prolong endocrine control of ER+BC, in an analogous manner to small molecule or monoclonal antibody targeted therapies, but with a more favorable dosing and adverse event profile due to precise immunologic targeting and no DDI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Breast cancer,RNA,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zelanna Goldberg<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Maine<sup>2<\/sup>, Gabrielle  P.

Recently, cancer immunotherapy especially immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) had a rapid progress in cancer patient management. We try to clarify the clinical scenario of immune-related parameters in metastatic NPC. We had check 81 metastatic tissue PD-L1 expression without ICI treatment from the tissue bank of CGMH, Linkou, during 2005~2019. Using anti-PD-L1 antibody, 22C3 Dako, tumor proportional score (TPS) was positive in 43.2% (35\/81) checked tissue and combine positive score (CPS) was positive in 58.0% (47\/81) tissue respectively. For overall survival (OS) combined with PD-L1 expression in metastatic tissue analysis, positive CPS but not TPS correlated with longer survival with statistical significance (TPS: &#62;0% vs =0%, median survival, 24m vs 22.5m, <i>p<\/i>=0.615186; CPS: &#62;0% vs =0%, median survival, 28m vs 16m, <i>p<\/i>=0.003709). Retrospectively analysis of metastatic NPC treatment of combination of chemotherapy, ICIs, and local treatment in our institute in the past 6 years, total 40 patients was enrolled with median overall survival of 34.1 months. Objective response rate by RECIST criteria for immunotherapy-based regimen was 75% (CR:40%; PR:35%) and disease control rate was 85%. According to response by RECIST criteria, median overall survival were 34.1 months vs. 16.7 months respectively for responders and non-responders. With pre-treated NLR as cutoff value of 1.6, difference of median overall survival between two groups (responder vs nonresponder) was statistically significant (p=0.021). We also found that lower median post-treatment NLR in responders than in non-responders (1.4 vs. 3.2, p=0.013). Using rapid lymphocyte amplification protocol via IL-2 stimulation, the PBMC from most of the patient received ICIs treatment can be amplified 1~10 folds and positively correlated with total lymphocyte count. Through flowcytometry analysis, we found these amplified PBMC was lymphocyte dominant and rich in CD8+. We also found these amplified PBMC can kill the NPC EBV-positive cell line and xenograft in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrated that combination of chemotherapy, ICIs, and local treatment will benefit metastatic NPC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,PD-L1,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cheng-Lung Hsu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yung-Chia Kuo<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chang Gung Memorial Hospital - Linkou branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"21868f73-56b2-4428-80d1-ce131cc085f4","ControlNumber":"5827","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

The impact of radiation, immune response, and STING pathway activation on tumor development in this model is not well understood. In this study, we examined the effect of radiation and the STING agonist, DMXAA (Vadimezan), on the development of urethane-induced lung cancer.A\/J mice were treated with urethane (i.p.) to induce the development of lung tumors. Three days after urethane treatment, mice received 13 Gy thorax radiation treatment (RT)\/ mock RT, DMXAA (20 mg\/kg i.p.)\/ vehicle, or a combination treatment (n = 5). Mice were euthanized after 6 hours to 7 days after treatment to assess early events in the lung with RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, or 5 months after treatment to assess tumor growth and long-term changes to the immune microenvironment with multiplex immunofluorescence.Mice treated with urethane followed by RT had fewer lung surface tumors (p &#60; 0.01) and reduced tumor area (p = 0.0732) compared to their mock RT controls. In parallel, mice that received urethane pre-treatment and RT had high numbers of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs; these contained T-cells, B-cells, MHCII+ APCs and CXCL13) compared to the mock RT control mice (p &#60; 0.001). Analysis of immune cell contents of the TLS revealed a notable increase in CD4, CD8 and regulatory T-cells in the RT condition (with urethane pretreatment). Important early events in the lung following RT of urethane pre-treated mice included a transient increase in type I and type II interferons, CD4 and CD8 T-cell infiltration (p &#60; 0.001) and a strong downregulation of cell cycle events. In contrast to these findings, DMXAA treatment after urethane resulted in fewer tumors (p &#60; 0.05), but larger tumors compared to the vehicle-treated group. An increase in immune cells was observed in the lung, however, without clear structures that resembled TLSs. Early events following DMXAA treatment with urethane pre-treatment included dampened levels of type I IFN and TNF-&#945; in circulation and a decrease in T-cell infiltration into the lungs. Interestingly, RT and DMXAA combination treatment (with urethane pre-treatment) drove a synergistic anti-tumor effect, further reducing tumor numbers compared to the RT or DMXAA controls 5 months after treatment.RT and STING agonist treatment of pre-neoplastic lesions have differential impacts on tumor growth in the A\/J mouse model, and work synergistically when combined. The different outcomes of RT and DMXAA on tumor growth may be driven by their distinctive mechanism of action on immune responses and capacities to form TLSs. These findings may have future implications for strategies for the early treatment of lung and other cancers, and they suggest that immune responses, including modulation of the STING pathway, may be an important aspect of early tumor development that could be targeted therapeutically.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Radiation,Tumorigenesis,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kay Shigemori<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yanyan Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Bruno Beernaert<sup>1<\/sup>, Anderson  J.

Radiotherapy have been reported to release endogenous tumor antigens and enhanced the adjuvanticity from dying cancer cells via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, known as immunogenic cell death. We developed a novel radiotherapy using radiosensitizer (TiOxNPs) that could drive effective anti-tumor responses. The TiOxNPs were robustly radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This burst therapy could enhance to release and presentation of endogenous tumor antigens, subsequently cross-presentation of antigens by Dendritic cells (DCs) for T-cell activation in secondary lymphoid organs (SLO).<br \/>Methods: B16-F10 murine melanoma cells (5x10<sup>5<\/sup>) were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of C57BL\/6J respectively. Mice were divided into five treatment groups: 1) untreated; 2) XRT; 3) XRT+ TiOxNPs; 4) XRT+anti-PD-1Ab; and 5) XRT+ TiOxNPs +anti-PD-1Ab. B16-F10 tumors were intratumorally injected with TiOxNPs (8mg\/kg) on days 10 and received 5Gy or 10Gy X-ray radiation approximately 1 hour after the injection. Anti-PD-1 antibody (200&#181;g) intraperitoneally administered to the mice on the first day of X-ray irradiation, days 13 and 16. The tumor volume were assessed every 2-3 days after treatment. Mice were sacrificed after days 17 and isolated spleen and tumor.<br \/>Results: TiOxNPs acted as a potent radiosensitizer, which enhanced cytotoxic ROS-mediated cell death. This combination effect could not only a local treatment that directly kills cancer cells but also could enhance the adjuvanticity from dying cancer cells by DAMPs, and significantly upregulate expression of MHC class I on tumor cells. Treatment of B16-F10 melanoma tumor model with burst therapy resulted in tumor shrinkage and extended overall survival. Burst therapy facilitated the recruitment and maturation of DCs into SLO, and improved antigen presentation to naive T cells. Infiltration into the tumor site of CTL were correlated with increasing of migration DCs into SLO.<br \/>Conclusion: A novel radiotherapy combining with TiOxNPs played an important role in release of endogenous tumor antigens and DAMPs. The upregulation of MHC class I expression on tumor cells after X-ray irradiation facilitated the recognition of the tumor cells by T cells, leading to significantly enhanced antitumor immune response compared to exisiting immunoradiotherapy. This novel nanoparticles exposed to X-ray irradiation could trigger of antigen-specific immune responses and transform a tumor into a site for activation of antitumor immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioimmunotherapy,Radiosensitization,Nanoparticles,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoshiko Fujita<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hikaru Kubota<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiaki Ogino<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryohei Sasaki<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Division of Radiation Oncology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Chemical Science and Engineering, Kobe University Graduate School of Engineering, Kobe, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bd07d05e-9f59-4507-beab-c11d7f230c3f","ControlNumber":"1741","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

To better understand this discordance, we hypothesized that there are non-redundant inhibitory immune pathways that restrain the efficacy of RT beyond T-cell oriented immune checkpoints. To this end, we performed scRNA-seq and CITE-seq analysis of the EO771 syngeneic murine model of breast cancer to characterize the immune landscape following RT&#177;ICB. We found that ICB reprograms the immune response to RT by shifting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from a lipid-associated phenotype (APOE, FABP5) to an M1-like interferon-stimulated state (CXCL10, ISG15). However, ICB also promoted the late recruitment of intratumoral neutrophils, which drive resistance to RT in other contexts. To evaluate whether neutrophils may be limiting antitumor immunity to RT\/ICB, we depleted intratumoral neutrophils using two separate antibodies, anti-Ly6G and anti-Gr-1. Compared to RT\/ICB alone, both neutrophil depletion strategies enhanced tumor control and prolonged survival in advanced EO771 tumors (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). Given that indiscriminate neutrophil depletion is not a viable therapeutic strategy, we tested alternative immune targeting approaches to alter the TAM response to RT\/ICB. By scRNA-seq, we found that RT strongly upregulated several innate immune checkpoints on TAMs (e.g., SIRP&#945;, SLAMF3\/7, LRP1). Accordingly, we disrupted the SIRP&#945;-CD47 interaction with anti-CD47 antibodies and characterized the impact on response to RT\/ICB. Anti-CD47 significantly improved tumor regression and survival when combined with RT\/ICB (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). We then used scRNA-seq and CITE-seq to understand why disruption of SIRP&#945;-CD47 improved antitumor responses to RT\/ICB. We found that anti-CD47 depleted an entire cluster of chronically inflamed TAMs, expressing pro-inflammatory markers (IL1A, NOS2) and chemokines (CCL3, CXCL1\/2\/3). Furthermore, anti-CD47 reduced the recruitment of intratumoral neutrophils and depleted a cluster of pathologically activated neutrophils (PMNs), termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), expressing WFDC17, PTGS2, S100A8\/9. Lastly, anti-CD47 enhanced the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes including central memory TCF7<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and CD19<sup>+<\/sup> B cells. By inference and analysis of cell-cell communication (CellChat), we found that anti-CD47 strengthened the interactions between myeloid cells and T cells compared to RT\/ICB alone. Collectively, our data indicate that innate immune cells, in particular neutrophils and chronically inflamed TAMs, promote resistance to RT\/ICB in the EO771 model. These data suggest that inhibition of CD47-SIRP&#945; is a promising therapeutic strategy to overcoming immune resistance through the elimination of PMN-MDSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,Radioimmunotherapy,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anthony  T.

While innate stimuli can cause inflammation that supports adaptive immunity, cancer myeloid cells can be pre-polarized such that the same inflammatory signals cause myeloid cells to suppress adaptive immune responses. We aim to investigate the signals regulating type I IFN secretion by innate immune cells in tumors in order to improve type I IFN secretion, activation of innate immune cells, direct macrophage polarization and improve CD8+ T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity. To better understand the role of MyD88-mediated signaling in driving response to innate adjuvants released following RT in solid tumors, we developed MyD88 conditional knockout mouse models. MyD88 was deleted specifically in CD11c expressing dendritic cells (DC), Lck expressing T cells, or Lyz2 expressing myeloid cells that include macrophages, monocytes and granulocytes. Mice bearing pancreatic tumors (Panc02-SIY or PK5L1940) were randomized to no treatment or 16 Gy CT-guided RT and followed for treatment responses. Lyz2-Cre\/MyD88<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice demonstrated improved responses to RT in pancreatic tumors as compared to control MyD88<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> mice, or Lck-Cre mice. The improved responses in Lyz2-Cre\/MyD88<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice were shown to be dependent on CD8+ T cells as well as on type I IFN signaling. To analyze mechanisms of response, tumors were digested into a single cell suspension and CD45+ cells were isolated for single cell sequencing three days post-RT. Lyz2-Cre\/MyD88<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice showed diminished Th1 and Th2-type T cells and had a higher M1\/TAM ratio compared to MyD88<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice. Loss of MyD88 in myeloid cells resulted in increased activation of IFN-dependent transcriptional responses in multiple immune cell populations in the tumor. To model responses ex vivo, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or a synthetic cyclic dinucleotide (CDA) for analysis of cytokine secretion in either monolayer or 3D spheroid culture conditions. BMDM derived from Lyz2-Cre\/MyD88<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> cultured as a monolayer showed significantly altered secretion of TNF-&#945;, IL-10 and IL-6 on activation with LPS as compared to controls. Preliminary data obtained from 3D spheroid culture systems demonstrated that 3D interactions between cancer cells and macrophages resulted in a significant increase in BMDM co-stimulatory phenotype following activation with innate stimuli compared to 2D cultures. These data suggest that conventional innate signaling through MyD88 in myeloid populations suppresses IFN production and adaptive immune control of irradiated tumors. 3D cultures are an effective tool to study cellular interactions ex vivo and screen novel interventions prior to in vivo translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Macrophages,Interferons,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aanchal Preet Kaur<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Terry R.
