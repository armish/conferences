[{"Abstract":"Background: The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma faces many challenges. The development of new therapeutic approaches and the exploration of biomarkers of therapeutic effectiveness will provide a basis for better tumor control and individualized diagnosis and treatment. TTFields therapy, bevacizumab and second-line chemotherapy are the alternative treatment methods for recurrent gliomas. Especially, the introduction of TTFields has prolonged the tumor control of patients. Clinical studies have shown that bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy can improve the prognosis of patients. In this study, the randomized controlled principle was used to compare TTFields plus second-line chemotherapy and combined chemotherapy on the basis of both, and to explore the safety and effectiveness of combined treatment for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.<br \/>Objectives: 1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of TTFields, bevacizumab, and second-line chemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed GBM. 2. To evaluate the effects of TTFields, bevacizumab and their combination on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. 3. To explore the correlation between serum VEGF, plasma MMP-2, MMP-3 and other factors and the efficacy of combination therapy.<br \/>Methods: A total of 40 patients who met the inclusion criteria were planned to be recruited and randomly assigned to two experimental groups, with 20 patients in each group. On the basis of second-line chemotherapy, patients in each group were treated with TTFields alone, TTFields combined with BEV, respectively. The 6-month survival rate was used as the primary outcome, and the median OS and median PFS were used as the secondary outcomes. The effectiveness and safety of each regimen was evaluated and compared. Krans, CBV, CBF, MTT and other imaging indicators were used to evaluate vascular permeability and blood flow. To compare the differences between BEV alone and BEV combined with TTFields, and to evaluate the efficacy prediction of these hematologic molecules in the combined regimen. Moreover, imaging and hematological indicators were combined to construct a prognostic model that could predict the efficacy of the combined regimen.<br \/>Key Issues to be Resolved: 1. To evaluate the comprehensive effect of TTFields combined with BEV treatment on blood-brain barrier permeability and blood perfusion. 2. A prognostic prediction model will be established by combining imaging features and hematological indicators. 3. Preliminarily determine the direction of optimization of the combined treatment program.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL01-05 Placeholder Abstracts: Clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Recurrence,Glioblastoma multiforme,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xun Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zehao Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Botao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bo Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Wenbin Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

A completed healthy volunteer (HV) first-in-human (FIH) study is now being followed by the IGNITE Phase 1\/2 trial in patients, which includes the retrospective study of an adenosine-specific patient enrichment biomarker strategy.<br \/>Methods: A 3-part Phase 1 FIH study in 60 HV was completed (NCT04727138). Parts 1 and 2 were double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies investigating EXS21546 safety, tolerability, PK and PD. Part 3 was a 3-period, open label, randomized, sequential study evaluating bioavailability of oral EXS21546 as a granule in capsule vs reference powder suspension. The ongoing Phase 1\/2 IGNITE trial will study EXS21546 in patients with immunotherapy relapsed or refractory RCC or NSCLC directly in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. This combination aims to leverage the properties of A2AR antagonism in the tumor microenvironment, to drive the immune system through PD-1 inhibition. IGNITE will also provide clinical data to support the validation of our adenosine signature to identify patients with adenosine rich tumor microenvironments who may benefit from treatment (Alt et al, 2022). Data will be continually reassessed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. A dose escalation phase will be followed by an expansion phase.<br \/>Results: PK\/PD modeling of Phase 1 study results, along with the EXS21546 safety profile, allowed identification of a potential therapeutic starting dose. PK results aligned with design specifications, based upon predictive preclinical modeling, and support twice-daily (BID) dosing for continuous A2AR antagonism. EXS21546 induced dose-dependent inhibition of CREB phosphorylation in CD8-positive cells, with the PD profile mirroring plasma exposure. Inhibition of A2AR signaling was sustained over the BID dosing period, demonstrating a level of lasting target engagement. PoP PK\/PD simulations informed the starting dose and dosing regimen for the Phase 1\/2 trial.<br \/>EXS21546 was well-tolerated with no CNS adverse events reported in the SAD at all doses and in the MAD at 150 mg BID. The majority of adverse events were considered mild and unrelated to EXS21546, with the exception of one Grade 3 Serious Adverse Event of elevated ALT\/AST.<br \/>Conclusions: Safety and tolerability of our A2AR antagonist EXS21546 were confirmed in a HV study, allowing selection of a starting dose for the ongoing IGNITE Phase 1\/2 study. IGNITE trial design was based on extensive simulations to enable the most efficient continuous reassessment method settings, and will allow further verification of the patient enrichment biomarker strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,Immunotherapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nieves Diaz<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Holly Garratt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Zemla-Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Dominguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Helmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabella Alt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Sehlke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norbert Hieger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Winkler-Penz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Boudesco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gregory Vladimer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tom Wilde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip Evans<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Italiano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Krams<\/i><\/presenter>.

Another potential approach to immunotherapy is the targeted intratumoral administration of interleukin 12 (IL -12), a cytokine with proven anti-tumor activity. Due to its immunomodulatory effect, it can be used as an immunostimulatory component for in situ vaccination of local ablative therapies. We have developed a phIL12 plasmid without antibiotic resistance markers using a transgene for the human IL -12 p70 protein. The plasmid can be introduced intratumorally by gene electrotransfer. In gene electrotransfer, electrical pulses are applied to the tumor to deliver the plasmid DNA into the cells. Based on nonclinical studies of safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability, and immunogenicity, a phase I clinical trial of phIL12 gene electrotransfer was conducted (ISRCTN15479959, ClinicalTrials NCT05077033). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of phIL12 gene electrotransfer in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma in patients with operable tumors of the head and neck. The study, an exploratory, dose-escalating Phase I study, will enroll 9 patients in three dose-escalating cohorts. Treatment consists of plasmid injection followed by application of electrical pulses to the tumors. Patients are monitored for 30 days, with tumors removed if a complete response is not achieved. To date, two cohorts of patients have completed the study. No adverse effects or treatment-related toxicities have been observed, and treatment has been well tolerated by patients. The results of this study will provide the basis for the use of phIL12 gene electrotransfer as adjuvant therapy to local ablative therapies to enhance their local effect and elicit a systemic response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Skin cancer,gene electrotransfer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gregor Sersa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maja Cemazar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Crt Jamsek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Primoz Strojan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanja Jesenko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masa Bosnjak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ales Groselj<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, many patients do not benefit from these inhibitors due to primary or acquired resistance. In colorectal cancer (CRC), resistance to inhibitors of the MAPK pathway is especially prominent, reflected by low response and short survival. Reactivation of MAPK signaling is a common mechanism of acquired resistance in CRC. WNT pathway is hyperactivated in the majority of CRC patients due to genetic alterations of several genes involved in WNT signaling, e.g., <i>APC, CTNNB1, RSPO<\/i> and <i>RNF43<\/i>. Cooperation between RAS-RAF and WNT signaling drives the carcinogenesis of CRC. Concomitant blockade of WNT signaling has been shown to impede the emergence of BRAF inhibitor-resistant clones, thus offering the possibility to overcome acquired resistance.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>To prove the concept that simultaneous inhibition of the WNT pathway and the MAPK pathway reduces primary or acquired resistance to CRC treatment, we have tested combinations of various inhibitors of both pathways in CRC models, including <i>BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i>;<i>RSPO<\/i>3 PDX models, <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>;<i>RSPO<\/i>3 cell lines and <i>APC-<\/i>mutated cell lines with or without <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations, including <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>;<i>APC<\/i> CRC cell lines. We tested MAPK pathway inhibitors, such as cetuximab, selumetinib and cobimetinib (MEK1\/2 inhibitors), encorafenib (BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> inhibitor), and AMG510\/sotorasib (KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor). Inhibitors of the WNT pathway included a porcupine inhibitor, CGX1321, that blocks the secretion of WNT ligands, currently in clinical development, and a tankyrase inhibitor, CGX11071, that stabilizes AXIN-1\/2 and degrades &#946;-catenin. Synergistic effects between inhibitors of the MAPK pathway and the WNT pathway were observed in CRC models <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Notably, when CGX1321 was added to encorafenib and cetuximab in CRC PDX models with<i> BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i> and<i> RSPO<\/i> fusions, a decrease in tumor size (&#62;50%) occurred in two weeks, compared with tumor progression with encorafenib and cetuximab or CGX1321 treatment alone. Notable is the synergy between tankyrase inhibitor CGX11071 and KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor AMG510\/sotorasib in CRC cell lines with<i> KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> and <i>RSPO<\/i> fusion (or <i>APC<\/i> mutations). We launched a phase 1b clinical trial to study the efficacy of CGX1321 in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab in CRC patients with <i>RSPO<\/i> fusions and <i>BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i> mutations. (NCT02675946). Primary endpoint included safety and RP2D. Secondary endpoints included PK, overall response rate, CR and PR rate, and duration of response by RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST 1.1.

This occurs via KRAS repression of interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) resulting in upregulation of CXCL3 chemokines, which bind CXCR2 and recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (<i>MDSC; Liao et al, Cancer Cell 2019<\/i>). MDSCs also accelerate metastases by &#8216;priming&#8217; the premetastatic niche via promoting egress of tumors cells into the circulation, inhibiting killing by immune cells and promoting extravasation into the tissues (<i>Veglia et al. Nature 2021<\/i>). SX-682 is a novel oral small-molecule inhibitor of CXCR1\/2 chemokine receptors involved in MDSC-recruitment to TME. This proof-of-concept study investigates whether a CXCR1\/2 antagonist in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy can overcome de novo immunotherapy resistance in MSS <i>RAS<\/i> mutated mCRC and eradicate micrometastatic disease in ctDNA positive CRC post definitive therapy.<br \/>Methods: STOPTRAFFIC-1 is a phase I\/II, open-label, dose-escalation\/dose expansion study of SX-682 plus nivolumab for patients (pts) with <i>RAS<\/i> mutated MSS mCRC or ctDNA positive CRC. Key eligibility criteria - Arm A: pts with MSS mCRC with progression or intolerance to 2 prior lines of therapy, ECOG 0\/1; Arm B: ctDNA positive post completion of definitive therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III or metastasectomy for stage IV CRC). Pts will receive SX-682 (5 dose levels: 25 mg, 50 mg, 100mg, 200mg, or 400 mg PO twice daily) in an 8-week cycle with intravenous nivolumab (480 mg) on days 1 and 29. Adverse events per CTCAE v5.0. RECIST assessments every 8 weeks. In dose escalation, pts enter a 3-week monotherapy safety run-in of SX-682 followed by 3-week combination with nivolumab for a six-week dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period. Cohorts 1-4 have been completed without DLT. Enrollment to Cohort 5 is completed with expansion arms to open February 2023. Dose expansion is a Simon's optimal two-stage design for Arm A. Efficacy will be assessed in the first 15 pts with a requirement of 2 responses in order to enroll 14 additional pts (N=29). Pre- and on-treatment tissue biopsies will be collected. Arm B will enroll 15 pts with positive ctDNA post definitive therapy. Pts will be screened with CLIA certified ctDNA test for minimal residual disease (MRD) and if positive, enrolled for treatment for up to 6 months (m). Pts will undergo radiographic evaluation at 3 and 6m and then every 3-6m for at least 3 years. The primary objectives are to determine safety profile, recommended phase 2 dose, clinical activity &#38; 6m ctDNA clearance rate in CRC pts with MRD following 6m of SX-682 + Nivolumab on Arm B.

Available pan-FGFR inhibitors target all 4 isoforms of FGFR (FGFR1 - 4) and consequently their efficacy can be limited by off-target toxicity (i.e. inhibition of other non-altered FGFR isoforms) including gastrointestinal, oral mucositis, and cutaneous\/nail disorders, as well as FGFR1-mediated hyperphosphatemia. Moreover, clinical studies of pan-FGFR inhibitors have reported the development of drug resistance through acquired gatekeeper mutations (e.g. V555M and V565F) at the time of disease progression. LOXO-435 is a potent, highly isoform-selective FGFR3 inhibitor that is designed to preserve activity in the setting of gatekeeper resistance mutations. Preclinically, LOXO-435 has demonstrated potent <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> activity as a selective inhibitor of both wild-type and oncogenically activated <i>FGFR3<\/i>, including <i>FGFR3<\/i> fusions, point mutations, and acquired gatekeeper resistance mutations without evidence of FGFR1-mediated hyperphosphatemia.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> LOXO-FG3-22001 is a multicenter, open-label, first-in-human phase 1a\/b study of LOXO-435 in patients (pts) with <i>FGFR3<\/i>-altered advanced solid tumors, including metastatic UC (mUC) (NCT05614739). Eligible pts (&#8805; 18 years) must have an advanced or metastatic solid tumor with an <i>FGFR3<\/i> alteration detected in tumor or ctDNA, ECOG PS of 0-1, and have received all standard therapy or have no known available options to provide benefit. The study will be conducted in 2 phases: phase 1a dose escalation and phase 1b dose expansion. Dose escalation (cohort A) will begin as a single-patient accelerated design, allowing intra-patient dose escalation, followed by the modified toxicity probability interval-2 method. Additional pts will be allowed to backfill to previously cleared dose levels that demonstrate therapeutically relevant exposures or direct evidence of clinical activity. Dose escalation will assess safety, PK\/PD, and antitumor activity of LOXO-435 as monotherapy to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Dose expansion will include 4 cohorts of pts with prespecified activating <i>FGFR3<\/i> alterations. Cohort B will enroll pts with mUC and include 2 cohorts to evaluate LOXO-435 as monotherapy (B1, B2) and 1 cohort to evaluate LOXO-435 in combination with pembrolizumab (B3). Cohort C will enroll pts with non-UC advanced solid tumors and will evaluate LOXO-435 as monotherapy (C1). Pts in cohort B1 must have progressed on or were intolerant to a prior FGFR inhibitor, and pts in cohorts B2, B3, and C1 must be FGFR inhibitor treatment naive. Dose expansion will evaluate the safety, PK\/PD, and antitumor activity (per RECIST v1.1) of LOXO-435 at the RP2D.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3  (FGFR-3),Urothelial Carcinoma,LOXO-435,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gopa Iyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arlene Siefker-Radtke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Milowsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neal Shore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xin Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa A.

Many patients (pts) develop resistance to first-line treatment and effective second-line and beyond options are needed. The von Hippel-Lindau (<i>VHL<\/i>) gene is inactivated in approximately 90% of RCC cases, which results in the constitutive activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2&#945; (HIF-2&#945;), a key oncogenic driver in RCC. The first-in-class HIF-2&#945; inhibitor belzutifan has demonstrated promising antitumor activity with manageable safety in previously treated pts with advanced RCC. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) pathway has also been implicated in RCC and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. In RCC cell lines, the CDK 4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib inhibited cell growth. The addition of CDK 4\/6 inhibition had synergistic antiproliferative effects with HIF-2&#945; inhibition in HIF-2&#945;-dependent <i>VHL<\/i> -\/- RCC cell lines. Palbociclib could therefore potentially enhance the efficacy of belzutifan as combination therapy for previously treated pts with advanced RCC.<br \/>Methods: The two-part, open-label, multicenter, phase 1\/2 randomized LITESPARK-024 study (NCT05468697) is intended to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of belzutifan + palbociclib in combination with a modified toxicity probability interval design (Part 1), followed by a direct comparison of belzutifan monotherapy to the combination with respect to safety and efficacy in pts with advanced RCC (Part 2). Pts with histologically confirmed unresectable stage IV RCC with a clear cell component, whose disease progressed on or after having received at least 2 systemic treatments (both an anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody and a VEGF receptor-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in sequence or in combination), have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review, and have KPS score of &#8805;70% will be enrolled. Up to 30 pts will be enrolled into 3 dose groups in Part 1 and will receive belzutifan 120 mg once daily + palbociclib (75, 100, or 125 mg) daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off. In part 2, approximately 150 pts will be randomly assigned 2:1 to receive belzutifan 120 mg once daily + palbociclib RP2D (21 consecutive days\/7 days off) or belzutifan 120 mg once daily. Pts will be stratified by IMDC risk (0 vs 1-2 vs 3-6) and sarcomatoid histology (yes vs no) at randomization in part 2. The primary end point for part 1 is to assess dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events to determine the RP2D of belzutifan + palbociclib. The primary end point for part 2 is ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment. Secondary end points for part 2 are CBR, DOR, PFS, OS, and safety and tolerability.

With the FDA&#8217;s approval of (177) Lu-PSMA-617, PSMA has been validated as a target to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). ARX517 is an antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) composed of a fully humanized anti-PSMA mAb site-specifically conjugated to AS269, a potent tubulin inhibitor, yielding a drug-to-antibody (DAR) ratio of 2. After binding to PSMA on the surface of cancer cells, ARX517 is internalized and delivers a cytotoxic payload which inhibits tubulin polymerization and induces cellular apoptosis. ARX517&#8217;s site-specific linkage, stable conjugation chemistry, and non-cleavable linker exhibit a homogenous drug-antibody-ratio, mAb-like biophysical properties, and exceptional stability. Therefore, ARX517 promotes highly specific tumor cell apoptosis with minimal off-target bystander activity.<br \/>Trial Design: The Phase 1 study&#8217;s dose escalation and dose expansion evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of ARX517 in adults with mCRPC. Patients must have mCRPC which is resistant or refractory to standard therapies, including androgen receptor signaling inhibitors, and show disease progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. All patients must have adequate organ function and brain metastases must be radiographically stable. Ascending dose levels of ARX517 administered as a single agent will use an i3+3 design in the dose escalation phase. During the dose expansion phase, ARX517 will be administered at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Exploratory pharmacodynamic assessment includes PSMA-PET\/CT imaging. The total number of subjects is dependent on the number of ascending doses and cohort size before dose expansion.<br \/>Status: ARX517-2011 began enrolling patients in July 2021. With no dose limiting toxicities through dose level 6 (2.0 mg\/kg Q3W), dose escalation remains ongoing. As of January 2023, the APEX-01 study is currently enrolling in cohort 7 (2.4 mg\/kg) of dose-escalation. Dose expansion will start after RP2D or MTD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Genitourinary cancers: prostate,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>John Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Pachynski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luke Nordquist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nabil Adra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mehmet Bilen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Aggarwal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary Reichert,<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Schweizer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manan Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenge Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Darryl Z.

Many strategies are being explored to overcome these limitations. A locoregional delivery approach to achieve high sustained local concentrations in the tumor microenvironment with minimal systemic exposure could widen the therapeutic window. Early experience with free recombinant human IL2 (rhIL-2) given intraperitoneally (IP) showed meaningful clinical activity in relapsed ovarian cancer. Still, the cumbersome delivery procedure requiring indwelling catheters and need for high volume IP infusions leading to frequent complications and poor patient compliance limited the utility of this approach. To overcome these shortcomings, we developed a clinically translatable localized delivery LOCOcyte<sup>TM<\/sup> platform composed of polymer encapsulated allogeneic epithelial cells engineered to produce immune effector molecules for local delivery with temporal regulation. The first product, AVB-001, produces native hIL-2, for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other peritoneal malignancies. IP AVB-001 inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in an <i>in vivo<\/i> ID8 ovarian cancer murine model. Sustained IL-2 production with well tolerated high IP concentrations were achieved, with &#62;100x differential concentration vs. systemic blood levels in both mice and non-human primates. Strong local and systemic immune activating effects, optimized T cell profile and immune memory were observed without concomitant increase of T regs. The first in human study of AVB-001 in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (NCT05538624) is described here.<br \/>Methods: Part 1 dose escalation exploring 4 ascending dose levels (capsules target production of 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, and 3.6 ug hIL2\/kg\/d) with a Bayesian Optimal Interval 3+3 design, in patients with recurrent high grade serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, primary peritoneum, or fallopian tube. A minimum of 12 and up to 24 patients will be enrolled to receive one dose of AVB-001 administered IP. The primary objective is to evaluate safety (Incidence and severity of adverse events per NCI CTCAE v5.0), tolerability, and feasibility of delivering AVB-001 IP, and establish the RP2D. Secondary objectives include assessment of antitumor activity (RECIST v1.1, iRECIST), pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic correlates of immune activation. Part 2 will enroll 20 patients at the RP2D with efficacy as the primary objective. This multicenter study will be conducted at 5 sites, currently one site is open.

Preclinical models identified significant synergy between anti-GITR agonist therapy and cancer vaccines to generate stronger tumor specific CD8 T cell responses. DPV-001 is an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; multivalent autophagosome vaccine generated by in vitro manipulation of the autophagy pathway in human cancer cell lines. The vaccine delivers short-lived proteins (SLiPs) and defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) which are likely the dominant epitopes directly presented by MHC class I of tumor cells; but because of proteosomal degradation, are normally unavailable for cross-presentation, hence the delivery via vaccine. We hypothesize that addition of aGITR to DPV-001 vaccine will augment expansion of reactive CD4 and CD8 T cells, attenuate contraction of this response, and improve the therapeutic effect of treatment, and will result in the development of a coordinated T and B cell response to some of the same proteins, detectable using a cutting-edge seromics approach, as a window to TCR target identification for immunodynamic tracking of induced anti-cancer responses at an advanced level.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patient recruitment began in August 2022, for this first-in-human immunotherapy-trio study of DPV-001, with sequenced checkpoint inhibition (aPD-1 mAb; retifanlimab), with or without aGITR agonist mAb (INCAGN-1949), in recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (NCT04470024).

Depending on age and genetic disposition, as many as 40% to 60% of patients may have disease that is refractory to primary treatment, and of those who achieve initial complete response, more than 40% will experience relapse. In the relapsed\/refractory setting, median survival is limited and therefore represents an unmet medical need. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is the key adaptor molecule in the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway, which mediates the sensing of cytosolic DNA, and its activation generates type I interferons (IFN&#945; and IFN&#946;) and pro-inflammatory cytokines instigating T-cell-dependent antitumor immunity. In addition to their immune stimulatory activity, STING agonists have demonstrated direct cytotoxic activity against AML cells in preclinical studies. STING is expressed at a higher level in AML cells than in other tumor types (The Cancer Genome Atlas, National Cancer Institute), which may lead to the observed cytotoxicity upon STING activation (Gulen MF, et al. <i>Nat Commun<\/i> 2017.8:427). The high level of STING expression combined with preclinical evidence of antitumor activity makes AML a suitable indication in which to establish proof of mechanism and evaluate the clinical activity of GSK3745417, a novel STING agonist that has so far only been studied in solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: This phase 1 study (NCT05424380) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and cytotoxicity of GSK3745417 administered as an intravenous infusion. Eligible patients will be 18 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML (World Health Organization criteria) or high-\/very high-risk MDS by (Revised International Prognostic Scoring System) that has relapsed after or been refractory to prior therapy with a hypomethylating agent. Patients are currently being enrolled in part 1 dose escalation, which incorporates intrapatient dose escalation within cohorts, to determine a cohort-level maximum tolerated dose. Dosing in part 1 will include 3 initial induction cycles of GSK3745417 followed by a maintenance schedule. Part 2 involves an expansion cohort receiving the recommended induction regimen from part 1, followed by<br \/>Montesinos, et al. AACR 2023maintenance dose escalation. Approximately 72 patients will be enrolled: approximately 22 patients in part 1 and 50 patients in part 2. Peripheral blood and bone marrow sampling will allow response assessment and biomarker analysis to understand the mechanism of GSK3745417 activity in AML and MDS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ,STING,GSK3745417,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Pau Montesinos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haifa Al-Ali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan M.

However, compromised T cell effector function, proliferation, and persistence can limit CAR T from reaching their full curative potential. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent stimulator of T cells, however therapeutic use of IL-2 is limited by systemic toxicity due its pleiotropy. Therefore, to provide a selective IL-2 signal to engineered T cells, we have developed a human orthogonal ligand\/receptor system consisting of a half-life extended pegylated IL-2 mutein (STK-009) and a mutated IL-2 Receptor Beta (hoRb) that responds to STK-009 but not wild type IL-2. SYNCAR-001 is an autologous CAR T co-expressing a CD19 CAR and hoRb on the T cell surface. In mouse models of refractory lymphoma, STK-009 treatment led to expansion and activation of SYNCAR-001 cells with a maintenance of stem cell memory and effector T cell phenotypes. When added to SYNCAR-001, STK-009 increased complete response rate and durable responses in a dose dependent manner. In non-human primate studies, STK-009 alone demonstrated no significant biological activity in IL-2 sensitive populations (T cells or NK cells) and was tolerable without toxicity.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This is a first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation study of combination SYNCAR-001 + STK-009 in adults with relapsed or refractory (r\/r) CD19+ hematologic malignancies<b>. <\/b>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics of SYNCAR-001 + STK-009. Dose escalation follows a standard 3+3 design with STK-009 being escalated while SYNCAR-001 is held at a single fixed dose. A dose extension will enroll a cohort of patients treated at a selected dose level and indication based on dose escalation findings. SYNCAR-001 is dosed intravenously (IV) once at Day 0 and STK-009 is dosed subcutaneously (SC) over the course of the study. Participants receive a single safety lead-in dose of STK-009 prior to lymphodepletion and subsequent SYNCAR-001 infusion. After SYNCAR-001 initiation, STK-009 is dosed SC weekly for 12 weeks and then monthly for 3 months. Eligible participants include individuals with r\/r chronic lymphocytic leukemia\/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL\/SLL) and selected r\/r B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL subtypes of large B cell, mantle cell, and indolent lymphoma). Prior CD19 CAR use is excluded. The primary endpoint of safety includes outcomes such as adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary endpoints include assessments of response, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Exploratory endpoints include assessment of immune cell populations, and relevant gene\/protein expression, as well as persistence, phenotype, and functionality of SYNCAR-001 in the peripheral blood and\/or bone marrow in response to STK-009.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cytokines,CD19,Interleukin-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Maria Lia Palomba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew G.

In addition, BAY2927088 retains potent antiproliferative activity in the presence of EGFR C797S acquired resistance (AR) mutation due to its non-covalent binding mode. In preclinical studies, BAY2927088 demonstrated strong dose-dependent <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth inhibition in NSCLC EGFR ex20ins mutant patient-derived xenograft models and models carrying the AR mutation C797S (Siegel et al, ENA 2022).

The study comprises dose escalation, backfill, and dose expansion. The dose escalation is enrolling patients with EGFR or HER2 driver mutations and follows a modified continual reassessment method, allowing for concurrent backfill to previously cleared dose levels that demonstrated therapeutically relevant exposures or direct evidence of clinical activity in patients harboring ex20ins or EGFR C797S mutations. Dose-limiting toxicities are evaluated for 21 days. The primary objective of dose escalation is to determine BAY2927088 safety, tolerability, PK, and maximum tolerated dose. Dose expansion will enroll patients based on specific EGFR\/HER2 mutations and previous treatment, including those with ex20ins mutation either na&#239;ve or pretreated with ex20ins-targeted agents and those with AR EGFR C797S mutation. Key objectives of dose expansion are to further characterize BAY2927088 safety, tolerability, and to characterize PK of the optimal dose(s) selected during dose escalation and backfill. Key secondary objectives include determining antitumor activity based on overall response rate per RECIST v1.1 and the recommended Phase II dose of BAY2927088. Eligible patients must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, have a documented EGFR or HER2 mutation in tumor tissue or plasma, have disease progression after treatment with &#8805;1 systemic therapy for advanced disease, be appropriate candidates for experimental therapy, be aged &#8805;18 years, have ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and have adequate organ function.

EGFR tyrosine kinase activity driven by common EGFR mutations can be inhibited by small molecules, however, resistance to available agents may be driven by mutations in the EGFR active kinase site or other regions. BDTX-1535 is an orally available, highly potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of EGFR mutations, including extracellular variants and amplifications commonly expressed in GBM and inhibits the uncommon EGFR mutations found in NSCLC, including the C797S mutation acquired following 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation EGFR inhibitor therapy. Preclinical data demonstrated the ability of BDTX-1535 to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce sustained inhibition of EGFR signaling. Preclinical studies suggest that BDTX-1535 has potential to be clinically active in suppressing tumor growth in patients with GBM and NSCLC with or without CNS metastases, including a potential survival benefit.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> BDTX-1535-101 (NCT05256290) is Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, CNS penetrance, and preliminary antitumor activity of BDTX-1535 in recurrent GBM (rGBM) or locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with or without CNS disease. The Monotherapy Dose Escalation portion will evaluate BDTX-1535 in patients with either rGBM expressing EGFR alterations or locally advanced\/metastatic NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations with or without CNS disease. Patients with rGBM must have previously received available standard therapy of surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy and\/or temozolomide (TMZ). Eligible NSCLC patients must have EGFR mutated NSCLC that has progressed following standard of care EGFR inhibitor therapy. Once a provisional recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been established, BDTX-1535 monotherapy will be explored in the following Dose Expansion cohorts to further evaluate safety, PK, and preliminary assessment of efficacy: 1) rGBM with confirmed EGFR alterations, 2) NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations following EGFR inhibitor therapy; 3) NSCLC with acquired EGFR resistance mutation following a 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor in 1L setting. NSCLC patients may enroll with or without CNS metastases and must not be known to express excluded resistance mutations such as EGFR T790M or MET. BDTX-1535 will also be studied in combination with TMZ to assess safety, tolerability, and a recommended combination dose for the treatment of patients with rGBM harboring EGFR mutations or variants. Enrollment was initiated in 2022 and dose escalation is ongoing. Dose Expansion cohorts are expected to open in 2023.

BTK is critical for malignant B-cell survival. Oral BTK inhibitors (BTKis), standard treatments for patients (pts) with B-cell malignancies, prevent proliferation and induce apoptosis of B cells. Currently approved BTKis covalently bind to BTK residue C481, irreversibly inhibiting phosphorylation of downstream kinases and blocking B-cell activation. Because these agents are often given continuously, their use may lead to clinical resistance and unacceptable toxicities. Indeed, acquired resistance to covalent BTKis is common and caused by the expansion of clones with a cysteine-to-serine mutation at residue 481.<br \/>A novel strategy being developed to overcome BTKi resistance, is PROTAC-induced degradation of BTK. PROTACs are small molecules with one domain that binds the target protein linked to another domain that binds to ubiquitin E3 ligase, resulting in ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of the target protein. HSK29116 is a small BTK PROTAC molecule that is currently undergoing clinical investigation for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. In preclinical studies, HSK29116 overcame drug resistance caused by the C481S BTK mutation. Also, HSK29116 has demonstrated inhibition of B-cell proliferation without measurable loss of other BTK-family kinase activities. This kinase selectivity may limit some of the off-target toxicities seen with currently available BTKis.<br \/>METHODS: This first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study (NCT04861779) began recruiting in 2021 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of oral HSK29116. Eligible pts are &#8805;18 years old with diagnosis of a B-cell malignancy that has relapsed or become refractory to standard therapy (&#8805;2 prior systemic therapies, which may have included a BTKi) and for which no other treatments known to provide clinical benefit exist. Pts must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &#8804;2 and life expectancy &#62;3 months.

Odronextamab (REGN1979) is a hinge-stabilized, human CD20&#215;CD3 IgG4-based bispecific antibody that elicits T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity of malignant B cells. In a Phase 1 study, odronextamab monotherapy showed a manageable safety profile with encouraging preliminary activity in heavily pre-treated patients with R\/R B-NHL (Bannerji R, et al. <i>Lancet Haematol.<\/i> 2022;9(5):e327-39). REGN5837 is a hinge-stabilized, human CD28&#215;CD22 IgG4-based bispecific antibody that provides a co-stimulatory signal (signal 2). When combined with odronextamab (signal 1), REGN5837 improved anti-tumor efficacy and survival in in vivo<i> <\/i>diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumor models via enhanced T-cell expansion. We hypothesize that combining REGN5837 with odronextamab may deepen and extend anti-tumor activity in patients with aggressive lymphoma.<br \/>Methods<b>:<\/b> ATHENA-1 (NCT05685173) is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study of REGN5837 in combination with odronextamab in patients with R\/R aggressive B-NHL. During induction, odronextamab and REGN5837 will be administered weekly over 21-day cycles. To mitigate potential CRS events, odronextamab will be introduced with step-up dosing as a monotherapy, followed by introduction of REGN5837 on C2 D15 with step-up dosing. Maintenance will consist of 28-day cycles (odronextamab and REGN5837 administration on D1, 15). Patients who achieve a sustained complete response (&#8805;9 months) will have study drug(s) administration changed to once every 4 weeks. Patients must be aged &#8805;18 years, have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &#8804;1, with adequate organ function, and have CD20+ aggressive B-NHL that progressed after &#8805;2 lines of systemic therapy containing at least an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylating agent, with or without prior chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Exclusion criteria include prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, organ transplant, or CD20xCD3 bispecific antibodies, or mantle cell lymphoma or central nervous system lymphoma. Primary endpoints are incidence of dose-limiting toxicities and the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics of odronextamab and REGN5837, anti-drug antibody incidence, objective response rate, complete response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.

While these CART19 products are very effective in the clinic, the majority of patients still do not respond or eventually relapse due to several mechanisms of resistance, including T cell dysfunction and epitope CD19-negative escape. Novel strategies to enhance the activity of CART cells and reduce escape are critically needed. We recently demonstrated that modifications of the binding region of the CAR (scFv) (<i>Singh N., Nat Med, 2021<\/i>) can drastically change the interaction between the CAR T cell and the cancer cells, potentially improving the anti-tumor effect. To this goal, we developed a novel anti-CD19 antibody clone (1218) that binds to a membrane-proximal epitope of CD19 (exon 2 region K59-K63) thereby not competing with FMC63. We developed a novel CART19, called AT101, using a humanized 1218 scFv along with 4-1BB costimulatory and CD3zeta domain in a lentiviral backbone. In preclinical models, AT101 showed more potent <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity against CD19-positive B lymphoma cells in a long-term killing assay and in a B-ALL (NALM6) <i>in vivo<\/i> model as compared to the control of FMC63 based CAR-T cells. In addition, differently than FMC63-based CART, AT101 could target tumor cells expressing point mutations of CD19 that are associated with relapse post-CART19 (FMC63) (<i>Zhang Z, JITC, 2020<\/i>) and leukemic blasts aberrantly expressing FMC63 CAR19 on their surface (<i>Ruella M, Nat Med, 2018<\/i>). Based on the preclinical efficacy and safety, a phase 1 clinical trial testing autologous AT101 was started for patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<br \/>Trial Design and Methods: This open-label, multi-center, first-in-human Phase 1 study will assess the safety and feasibility of AT101 in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Key eligibility criteria include patients aged &#8805;19 years of age with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this phase 1 trial, patients (n=3 per dose level; up to n=18 in total) are treated with AT101 in 3 dose-escalation cohorts based on a standard 3 + 3 design. CART doses are 2.0 x 10<sup>5<\/sup>, 1.0 x 10<sup>6<\/sup>, or 5.0 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR+T cells\/kg. The primary objective is to determine the safety, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AT101 in participants following lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (250 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> and 25 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>). The secondary objective is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy assessments (overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and pharmacokinetics of AT101. Exploratory objectives include assessment of CD19 expression and cytokines in the blood. Patients will be followed for safety for at least 60 months post AT101 infusion. Clinical trial registry number: NCT05338931. As of January 11, 2023, AT101 has been infused to six patients in cohort 1 and three patients in cohort 2.

Myeloid cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, readily accumulate in tumors, whereby they support tumor progression. The ability to harness the capability of myeloid cells to penetrate into tumors, and to subsequently program them to activate and elicit broad anti-tumor immunity has the potential to transform cancer therapies. With this goal we developed the first engineered monocyte cell product, by manipulating autologous monocytes to express a novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). This CAR contains a tumor recognition domain fused to a CD8 hinge domain, Fc&#947; and PI3K intracellular signaling domains. In addition to imparting tumor specificity, the Fc&#947; and PI3K signaling domains promote phagocytosis, cytokine production and antigen presentation upon activation. In a rodent model of melanoma (gp75<sup>+<\/sup> B16\/F10-OVA), Ly6C+ monocytes engineered with this receptor were able to phagocytose tumor cells and cross present antigen <i>in vitro. In vivo<\/i> infusion of engineered monocytes was associated with significant suppression of tumor growth. FACS analysis of tumor-infiltrates demonstrated that engineered monocytes preferentially infiltrated tumors and differentiated into antigen presenting cells. Adoptive T cell transfer of CFSE-labeled OT-I CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells confirmed that treatment was also associated with increased accumulation of tumor specific T cells in tumor and spleen. Based on these promising data, MT-101 is being assessed in humans in the Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human trial in patients with refractory or relapsed T cell lymphoma, IMAGINE trial (NCT05138458). The primary objective is the assessment of safety and tolerability at Day 28, following 3 weekly cycles of 2 infusions. Secondary objectives include assessment of correlative markers of response, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. In the first 3 subjects, MT-101 has been well-tolerated, with no evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), or infusion reactions. Examination of biomarkers by CyTOF in one subject shows changes in circulating leukocytes, including B cells. In this subject, survival has been greater than 10 months, while the median overall survival of patients with R\/R PTCL is 5.5 months. Continued patient enrollment and data collection is ongoing to confirm these observations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Monocyte,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michele Gerber<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Prod'homme<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuxiao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyong-Rim Kieffer-Kwon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neha Diwanji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josephine D'Alessandro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xing Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edward Cochran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Gorgievski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zheng Ling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas King<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siddhartha Mukherjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Getts<\/i><\/presenter>.

Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) is a large family of mammalian isoenzymes that catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid. Even when PD-1 is blocked by anti-PD-1 antibodies, there may be partial inactivation of T cells by DGK. ASP1570 is a novel inhibitor against DGK&#950; and has the potential to enhance DAG downstream signaling which can activate T cells regardless of PD-1 signaling and lead to tumor killing. ASP1570 restored T-cell functions suppressed by multiple immunosuppressive signals and induced tumor growth inhibition in mice models of MC38 (anti-PD-1 sensitive) and B16-F1 (tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte [TIL] poor, anti-PD-1 insensitive). Taken together, ASP1570 treatment as a single agent and\/or in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy for locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors may provide clinical benefit.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This is a phase 1\/2, open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose, dose-escalation\/expansion study of ASP1570 in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will enroll approximately 168 participants into 2 phases. Part 1 consists of dose escalation cohorts of 3-12 patients receiving oral administration of ASP1570 in 21-day cycles; 8 total cohorts are planned with doses of 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 mg administered daily with the final cohort receiving 100 mg administered twice daily. Part 2 consists of ~20 participants per cohort in a two-stage evaluation of safety and efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose and cohort expansion of an additional ~20 participants each based on expansion criteria. Cohorts are designated for NSCLC and melanoma but may be expanded based on response in other tumor types. Primary endpoints will assess safety and tolerability through dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events, changes in laboratory tests, electrocardiogram results, and vitals. Secondary endpoints will assess efficacy through overall response rate, duration of response, and disease control rate per iRECIST and RECIST v1.1, pharmacokinetics, and influence on TILs. Study periods will consist of screening, treatment with ASP1570 oral dosing in 21-day cycles, end of treatment, follow-up (safety: 45 days after last dose and every 9 weeks thereafter and survival follow-up every 12 weeks), and end of study. The study is actively recruiting and has enrolled 13 participants as of January 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Phase I,Melanoma\/skin cancers,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Manish R.

However, the clinical benefit of HD IL-2 is counterbalanced by life-threatening toxicities such as capillary leak syndrome. WTX-124 is an engineered cytokine prodrug composed of a wild-type IL-2 fused via proprietary cleavable linkers to an inactivation domain and to a half-life extension domain. In the circulation and in normal tissues, WTX-124 is designed to remain inactive and not bind to high- (&#945;&#946;&#947;) and intermediate-affinity (&#946;&#947;) IL-2 receptors. In contrast, proteolytic activation of WTX-124 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is expected to liberate the IL-2 cytokine to stimulate antitumor immune responses. Preclinical data show that WTX-124 is activated by a range of dissociated human tumors <i>in vitro<\/i> but not by normal human cells or by patient serum. Moreover, WTX-124 demonstrates potent antitumor activity in multiple murine syngeneic tumor models with substantial expansion and activation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In the MC38 model, WTX-124 has a large therapeutic window of &#62;19-fold compared to ~3-fold for recombinant human IL-2.<br \/>Methods: This first-in-human, open-label phase 1\/1b trial is investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of WTX-124 administered as a monotherapy or in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NCT05479812). All patients must have &#8805; 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 and a tumor type for which immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is indicated. Dose escalation uses a modified toxicity probability interval-2 study design with WTX-124 administered intravenously (IV) every two weeks in 28-day cycles. If the safety of WTX-124 as a monotherapy is established in the first three cohorts, the study will then initiate dose escalation of WTX-124 in combination with pembrolizumab 400mg IV every six weeks. Dose expansion is anticipated to include four arms that will enroll patients with either advanced or metastatic cutaneous melanoma or renal cell carcinoma to receive WTX-124 monotherapy or combination therapy (N=20 patients per arm). Patients with melanoma assigned to the WTX-124\/pembrolizumab combination arm may be na&#239;ve to all prior systemic therapy for advanced disease, but all other patients in expansion must have previously received a standard of care ICI regimen. Pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies, archival tumor tissue, and blood samples will be used to investigate multiple exploratory biomarkers. As of January 12, 2023, WTX-124 monotherapy dose escalation is proceeding.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Renal cell carcinoma,Pembrolizumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ildefonso Ismael Rodriguez-Rivera<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justin C.

Patients who fail the standard therapy often survive less than 1 year, so it is urgent to develop new effective therapies for MPM patients. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have been applied in MPM, but the efficacy was still limited due to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome these obstacles, we developed armored CAR-T cells with nanobody targeting mesothelin (MSLN) and IFN-&#947;-activated secretion of PD-1 nanobody in a non-viral transposon system, named as BZDS1901. Preclinical studies have demonstrated cytotoxicity of the BZDS1901 in NCI-H226 lung\/mesothelioma xenograft mouse model. To verify the safety and efficacy of BZDS1901, we conducted a single-arm, open label, dose-escalating clinical trials (NCT04503980, 05089266, 03615313) in solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients were those who failed prior standard therapies with MSLN expression (&#8805;50%) and PD-L1 positive in tumor specimen and voluntarily signed the informed consent. After apheresis and lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. BZDS1901 was administered intravenously in dose cohorts (1&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup>-2&#215;10<sup>7<\/sup>\/kg) and the second infusion was given if no disease progression. After infusion, safety was evaluated during 28 days by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, efficacy was assessed by RECIST 1.1 or mRECIST with CT scan. Blood CAR copies were measured by qPCR, PD-1 nanobodies and cytokines by Meso Scale Discovery method, and T cell subtypes by flow cytometry. Patients&#8217; progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were measured from the day of infusion to progression or death.<br \/>Results: From July 20, 2020 to December 31, 2022, 11 MPM patients were enrolled and completed the assessment, while most patients received two infusions. BZDS1901 was safe, demonstrated by 54% grade 3 and 15% grade adverse events (AEs) that were hematological side effects due to lymphodepletion and reversible with supportive care. No on-target, off-tumor toxicity and dose-limiting toxicity were observed. All patients showed expansion of CAR-T cells and increased PD-1 nanobodies in circulation. CAR-T Cmax (cp\/&#956;g) copies number was 20062, and continually detectable in blood over 4 months. PD-1 Cmax (pg\/ml) was 82841, and continually detectable in blood for up to 9 months. IFN- &#947; and IL-6 also increased at day 4 or Day 7. All patients obtained objective tumor response, one with complete response, six with partial response, and four with stable disease. The total objective response rate was 63.64%. All enrolled patients are still alive, and mPFS and mOS are not reached. The longest PFS was up to 26 months. Median follow-up was four months.<br \/>Conclusions: PD-1 nanobody secreted and MSLN targeting CAR-T cells have demonstrated promising efficacy on MPM patients. Besides CAR-T direct tumor killing activity, secreted PD-1 nanobodies may provide additional clinical benefit by invigorating CAR-T from PD-L1 inhibition, activating TILs and relieving local immunosuppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Mesothelioma,Mesothelin,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Zhuqing Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yong Xia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linlin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhicai Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lijie Rong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhongzheng Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zongchang Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Xue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianchun Duan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shujing Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linjie Lv<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaping Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xue Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liping Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Wenfeng Xu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weimin Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xingya Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jinxing Lou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qing Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qijun Qian<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previously, a regimen of IRN-IV administered as a 60-min i.v. infusion daily for 5 days in combination with other agents such as temozolomide has been recommended use in treating children with solid tumors (Blaney. ClinCanRes, 2001). Protracted administration schedule of intravenous irinotecan is inconvenient for patients, so oral regimens utilizing IRN-IV have been developed (Wagner. ClinSarcRes, 2015). Unfortunately, the palatability of the intravenous preparation is poor, leading to reduced compliance especially in younger pediatric patients. Development of an advanced formulation to improve tolerability and patient compliance is an important unmet need. VAL-413 is a novel formulation developed to improve palatability of oral irinotecan.<br \/>Methods: Eligibility: Up to 20 patients &#8805; 1 year of age or &#8804; 30 years of age with recurrent pediatric solid tumors and adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function, for whom irinotecan therapy is a treatment option will be enrolled.<br \/>Trial Design: Two different dose levels of VAL-413, 90mg\/m2\/day or 110mg\/m2\/day will be studied in combination with fixed-dose temozolomide using a standard 3 + 3 phase I design. In the event the starting dose of 90 mg\/m2\/day is not tolerable due to toxicity, a lower dose of 75 mg\/m2\/day may be implemented.<br \/>Treatment: During the first cycle of treatment, each patient will receive 4 daily doses of VAL-413 and one daily dose of the intravenous preparation of irinotecan taken orally (IRN-IVPO). During all subsequent cycles, only VAL-413 will be given with temozolomide in 5-day courses administered every 21 days, as tolerated.<u><\/u><br \/>Outcome Measures: Toxicity is assessed by NCI CCTCAEv5; tumor response is assessed by RECIST 1.1. A palatability survey instrument will assess palatability of VAL-413 vs. IRN-IVPO; comparative intrapatient pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites will be assessed.<i><\/i> This trial is ongoing (CT.gov: NCT04337177), with no DLT observed to date.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Ewing sarcoma,Therapeutics,Neuroblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jeffrey Bacha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarath Kanekal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neil Sankar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorena Lopez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noymi Yam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Wagner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Geller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markos Leggas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Osterheld<\/i><\/presenter>.

In pre-clinical studies inobrodib potently inhibited cell proliferation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines. Inobrodib demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in corresponding xenograft models, eliciting tumor regression at the highest doses. These effects were accompanied by significant reductions in expression of <i>MYC<\/i>, <i>MYB<\/i> and <i>IRF4<\/i>. Low doses of inobrodib also demonstrated good efficacy when added to standard-of-care treatments, providing a strong rationale for combination treatment in patients.<br \/>Inobrodib represents a novel and differentiated approach and offers a potential new therapeutic option for patients who have relapsed or are refractory to current standard of care therapies in AML, higher risk MDS, MM or NHL.<br \/><b>Study Design and Methods <\/b><br \/>NCT04068597 is an adaptive multi-arm\/multi-stage trial allowing exploration of p300\/CBP inhibition as monotherapy or in combination with different agents across multiple indications including AML\/higher risk MDS, MM, and NHL.<br \/>The trial was initiated as a dose escalation rolling 6 design separately in AML\/MDS and MM\/NHL to ensure tolerability is explored separately across groups of indications, with the possibility to expand in monotherapy across different indications. Key inclusion criteria include patients with confirmed relapsed or refractory disease, with patients having received standard therapy (typically at least two prior lines of therapy). Response criteria are assessed using standard methodologies for the different indications. Blood and tumor samples are collected for exploratory biomarker analysis to understand mechanisms of response to treatment or disease progression.

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy involves the adoptive transfer of T-lymphocytes that have been engineered to recognize tumor-specific antigens, resulting in targeted lysis of malignant cells. Folate receptors (FR) are membrane-bound surface proteins that bind folates with high affinity. FRs are overexpressed in OS and have very limited expression in normal tissue. UB-TT170 (Umoja Biopharma) is a small molecule bispecific &#8220;adapter&#8221; consisting of folate conjugated to fluorescein (FL). It penetrates tumors in minutes and is retained for long periods of time due to high affinity for the FR, while unbound UB-TT170 rapidly clears from the blood and from FR- tissues. We hypothesize that administration of fixed dosing anti-FL(FITC-E2) CAR T cells followed by escalating doses of UB-TT170 will deliver personalized immunotherapy to OS patients. In addition, this approach offers an attractive safety mechanism since administration of NaFL should reverse CAR T cell reactivity.<br \/>Methods: We designed a Phase I study for young adult (15-30 yr) patients with recurrent\/refractory OS to examine the safety and feasibility of administering autologous, peripheral blood-derived T cells that have been genetically modified to express a 2nd generation FL-specific CAR in combination with intra-subject dose escalation of UB-TT170. The primary objective is to identify a recommended dose escalation sequence of UB-TT170 to move forward in clinical development. A 3+3 design will be used to investigate 3 possible dosing sequences. The trial opened in July 2022. As of January 5, 2023, 5 subjects have enrolled and one subject has been treated on dose regimen 1.
