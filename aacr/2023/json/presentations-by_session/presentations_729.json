[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Analyses of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have shown promise in capturing tumor burden dynamics during immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), with the potential to allow patients with primary resistance to be rapidly identified and redirected to alternative therapies.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> BR.36 is an international multicenter, open label, biomarker-directed, phase II trial of molecular response-adaptive immuno-chemotherapy for patients with treatment-na&#239;ve non-small cell lung cancer-NSCLC (NCT04093167). The trial consists of two stages; stage 1 was a single-arm study to validate the ctDNA approach, with stage 2 focusing on ctDNA guided treatment selection. Key eligibility criteria included <i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>ALK<\/i> mutation negative, ICB and chemotherapy-na&#239;ve metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 expression &#8805;1%. Primary objectives were to ascertain ctDNA molecular response, determine its timing and concordance with radiologic RECIST\/iRECIST response. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of time to ctDNA molecular response and its correlation with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Liquid biopsy analyses utilized a validated tumor-agnostic white blood cell (WBC) DNA-informed 33-gene panel approach. Ultra-sensitive error-correction ctDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed at baseline\/cycle 1 (C1D1), cycle 2 (C2D1) and cycle 3 (C3D1) of pembrolizumab (200mg IV q3 weeks). The maximum variant allele fraction (maxVAF) of tumor-derived variants was tracked from the pre-treatment to on-therapy timepoints.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Activated October 17, 2019, stage 1 completed accrual of 50 patients on April 5, 2022; data lock date was September 20, 2022. Most patients were ever-smokers (98%), had no prior systemic therapy (92%), stage IV NSCLC (98%), adenocarcinoma (76%) with PD-L1 tumor proportion score of &#8805; 50% (96%); cohort consisted of 82% white, 52% female, 56% age&#62;65 and 76% ECOG PS 1 participants. Median follow-up was 13.5 months (range 2.5-23.0). Best overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST was 32% with a median duration of 10.1 months. Matched WBC DNA analyses allowed for effective removal of germline and clonal hematopoiesis variants, followed by evaluation of ctDNA response. MaxVAF clearance signified molecular response (mR), while maxVAF persistence indicated molecular disease progression (mPD). Among 35 evaluable patients (77.8%), 15 were classified in the mR category, with an evaluable mR rate of 43% (90% CI: 0.29-0.58). The median time to molecular response was 2.1 months (90% CI: 1.5-2.6). The sensitivity of ctDNA molecular response for RECIST and iRECIST response was 82% (90% CI: 52%-97%) and 83% (90% CI: 56%-97%), with a specificity of 75% (90% CI: 56.5%-88.5%) and 78% (90% CI: 60%-91%) respectively. Patients with mR attained longer PFS (5.03 vs 2.6 months,) and OS (not reached vs 7.23 months); ctDNA response also provided prognostic information for patients with RECIST stable disease.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>ctDNA molecular responses were concordant with radiologic response assessments, but importantly better predicted PFS and OS for patients with stable disease or better. These findings are now incorporated into the interventional second stage of the trial. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Immune checkpoint blockade,non-small cell lung cancer,precision oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Valsamo K.

A Phase 1\/2 study (NCT02187848) showed tusamitamab ravtansine antitumor activity in pretreated patients (pts) with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC and high CEACAM5 expression. Here, we explore biomarker associations with tumor CEACAM5 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and whether biomarkers predict objective response rate (ORR).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We assessed CEACAM5 expression by IHC, RNA sequencing, and whole exome sequencing (WES) on latest archival tumor samples; and circulating CEACAM5 (cCEACAM5) and CEA (cCEA). We enrolled 2 cohorts of pts with IHC CEACAM5 membrane expression at &#8805;2+ intensity: in &#8805;50% of tumor cells (high expressors, HEs, n = 64); and in &#8805;1% to &#60;50% of tumor cells (moderate expressors, MEs, n = 28). Pts received tusamitamab ravtansine 100 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV every 2 weeks.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> cCEA and cCEACAM5 were strongly associated (Spearman rho, 0.9), with weak associations between IHC CEACAM5 and cCEA or cCEACAM5 (Spearman rho, 0.3 and 0.4, respectively).

Here we report efficacy and safety from the adj phase.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Eligible pts aged &#8805;18 y had resectable stage IB-IIIA or select IIIB NSCLC and ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Pts received neoadj atezo 1200 mg IV for &#8804;2 cycles (Days 1 and 22) followed by surgery (Day 40&#177;10). Pts deemed to have clinical benefit were offered the option to receive adj atezo every 3 weeks for up to 12 months. The primary endpoint was MPR rate (&#8804;10% viable tumor cells at surgery) in pts without <i>EGFR\/ALK<\/i> mutations. Exploratory endpoints included DFS and OS. Safety was assessed during the adj phase.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Data cutoff was Oct 21, 2022. The primary efficacy population (PEP) was 137 pts without <i>EGFR\/ALK<\/i> alterations who had surgery and MPR assessment. In the PEP, 53 pts (39%) received adj atezo and 84 (61%) did not. The 3-y DFS rate was 83% with adj atezo vs 64% without (HR, 0.43; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.90; <i>P<\/i>=0.025). 3-y OS and results by MPR status are provided in the table. In the adj atezo safety population (n=57), treatment-related (TR) AEs after adj atezo occurred in 55 pts (97%; Gr 3\/4, 40%), including 11 TRAEs (19%; Gr 3\/4, 16%) leading to discontinuation of adj atezo. No Gr 5 TRAEs were seen in the adj phase. Multivariate analysis also showed a trend toward better DFS for pts receiving adj atezo vs those with no adj atezo (HR, 0.52; 95% CI: 0.22, 1.21; <i>P<\/i>=0.126).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> This exploratory analysis revealed that LCMC3 pts with resectable stage IB-IIIA or select IIIB NSCLC who received adj atezo had improved DFS and showed a trend toward improved OS vs pts who did not receive adj atezo. Furthermore, the non-MPR subgroup had the same trend toward improved DFS and OS with adj atezo vs pts who did not receive adj atezo.

The single-arm, phase 2 KEYNOTE-782 study (NCT03664024) evaluated the correlation of bTMB with efficacy of 1L pembro + chemo in nonsquamous NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients (pts) had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC with measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and were not eligible for EGFR-, BRAF-, ROS1-, or ALK-directed therapy. Pts were not previously treated for advanced or metastatic disease, had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and had an evaluable biopsy sample for biomarker analysis. All pts received intravenous pembro 200 mg Q3W + platinum chemo doublet Q3W (pemetrexed 500 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> + 4 cycles of carboplatin AUC 5 mg\/mL\/min or cisplatin 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>). The primary objective was to evaluate the association of baseline bTMB with ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment. Secondary objectives were to determine safety and the association of baseline bTMB with PFS per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment and OS. A study-specific next-generation sequencing-based assay using a 1.9 Mb\/654-gene cancer panel, which includes specific lung cancer-associated gene targets, was used to measure bTMB (continuous scale) in cell-free DNA extracted from baseline plasma samples. Paired white blood cell DNA sequencing was also performed to eliminate potential clonal hematopoiesis-derived somatic mutations. Database cutoff: November 5, 2021.<br \/>Results: 117 pts were enrolled; median age was 64.0 years (range, 37-85), and the majority were male (60.7%), had an ECOG PS of 1 (69.2%), and no brain metastases at baseline (92.3%). Median time from first dose to data cutoff was 19.3 months (range, 1.0-35.5). ORR was 40.2% (95% CI, 31.2-49.6; 6 CRs, 41 PRs), median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.6-9.8), and median OS was 18.1 months (95% CI, 13.5-25.6). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 113 pts (96.6%) and grade 3-5 TRAEs occurred in 56 (47.9%). Eight pts (6.8%) died due to a TRAE (febrile neutropenia and pneumonitis [n = 2 each], and septic shock, pulmonary sepsis, general physical health deterioration, and neutropenia [n = 1 each]). bTMB data were available for 101 pts. The area under the receiver operating curve for bTMB as a continuous variable to discriminate response was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.36-0.59). The posterior probabilities for a positive association of bTMB with PFS and OS were 16.8% and 7.8%, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Baseline bTMB showed no evidence of an association with ORR, PFS, or OS in pts with nonsquamous NSCLC treated with 1L pembro + chemo. These findings indicate no clinical utility of bTMB in this patient population and treatment setting. No new safety signals were observed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor mutational burden,Pembrolizumab,ctDNA,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jair Bar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emilio Esteban<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Delvys RodrÃ­guez-Abreu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Santiago Ponce Aix<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zsuzsanna Szalai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enriqueta Felip<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maya Gottfried<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mariano Provencio Pulla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Robinson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea FÃ¼lÃ¶p<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suman B.

Here, we present outcomes after 3 years of follow-up from the first reported study of neoadjuvant immunotherapy + chemotherapy in this population.<br \/>Methods: This open-label, multi-center single-arm investigator-initiated phase II study was conducted at three hospitals in the USA. Neoadjuvant atezolizumab, carboplatin, and nab-paclitaxel were administered for up to 4 cycles prior to surgical resection. The primary endpoint of major pathologic response (MPR) has been previously reported; here we report mature disease-free survival (DFS) and OS as well as clinical characteristics of patients with recurrent brain metastases (BM) with integrated data from tumor genomics, gene expression, and quantitative immunofluorescent (QIF) measurement of immune markers.<br \/>Results: Of 30 enrolled patients, 29 were taken to the operating room with 26 completing successful R0 resection. 17 patients experienced MPR, of whom 10 had pathological complete response (pCR). The median follow-up time was 39.5 months (95% CI: 30.9-49.4). Median OS was 55.8 months (95% CI: 43.6-NA); median DFS was 34.5 months (95% CI: 18.4-NA). Landmark OS at 12, 24, and 36 months were 97%, 80%, and 77%, respectively; DFS: 80%, 60%, and 49%. Radiographic and pathologic measures of response, as well as baseline PD-L1 levels, did not statistically significantly associate with DFS or OS. The strongest trends were observed with pCR (OS: HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03-1.83; DFS: HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.12-1.65). Percent decrease of radiographic response correlated inversely with percent pathological regression (Pearson correlation -0.44, 95% CI: -0.71&#8212;-0.08). Of 14 patients evaluable for site of recurrence, 6 developed BM. 5\/6 patients with BM died, with median time to recurrence of 12.4 months (95% CI: 9.9-32.6) and time to death of 45.3 months (95% CI: 22.7-55.8). 3\/6 patients who developed BM experienced MPR (2 achieved pCR). Radiographic response and PD-L1 level did not significantly associate with development of BM. Patients whose tumors had mutations in <i>STK11 <\/i>and<i> KEAP1 <\/i>did not experience statistically worse DFS\/OS, though incidence of BM trended higher. Reduced copy number of <i>STK11 <\/i>and <i>KEAP1<\/i>, which both reside on chromosome 19p, was observed in about 1\/3 of tumors. Deletion of either gene was significantly associated with worse pathologic response, lower levels of PD-L1+ cells by QIF, and BM.<br \/>Conclusions: Mature OS data reveal sustained clinical benefit of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy with atezolizumab. Predictivity of radiographic and pathologic surrogates for survival was limited. Further study is warranted to establish the associations between <i>STK11 <\/i>and <i>KEAP1 <\/i>genomic alterations and key clinical outcomes in early-stage NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,Surgical resection,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian S.

However, preclinical data suggest synergistic response with combined ICI and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in SCLC models. This single-institution, phase II trial (NCT04701307) assessed the efficacy of a combination of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, dostarlimab, with the selective PARPi, niraparib, in patients with relapsed SCLC or NECs.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients with SCLC (Cohort 1) or NECs (Cohort 2) had received at least one prior line of therapy and were treated with niraparib 300 mg (or 200 mg if &#60;77kg or platelets &#60; 150,000\/&#181;L) PO daily, and dostarlimab 500 mg IV q21d (1000mg IV q42d starting with Cycle 5). Co-primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) by RECISTv1.1 and 6-month progression free-survival (PFS6). Using a Bayesian Optimal Phase 2 (BOP2) design, interim futility analyses were planned after enrolling up to 15 SCLC and 9 NEC patients (NEC), respectively. Adverse events (AE) were monitored continuously. Patients underwent biopsies, if feasible, at Cycle 1 and Cycle 3, as well as longitudinal plasma collection for translational studies.<br \/>Results: From Feb 2021 to Aug 2021, 14 and 9 patients enrolled with SCLC and NEC, respectively. NECs included tumors from gynecological, head\/neck, and gastrointestinal sites. In Cohort 1 (SCLC), 12 of 14 patients were evaluable by RECISTv1.1, including 1 complete response (CR), while 4 patients not achieving partial response (PR) had minor responses (-2%, -14%, -19%, and -24% from baseline). Only 1 patient in this cohort achieved PFS6, though 2 additional patients progressed between 5 and 6 months. In Cohort 2 (NEC), 6 of 9 patients were evaluable by RECISTv1.1 and no CR\/PRs were observed. One patient did experience durable minor response (-21%), but no patients achieved PFS6. Dose-limiting, niraparib-related hematological AEs, typically thrombocytopenia, occurred in 12 of 23 patients. Non-hematological, treatment-related serious AEs occurred in only 1 patient (Grade 3 inflammatory arthritis), while 1 additional patient experienced brief dose-interruption due to Grade 2 pneumonitis. Preliminary translational data, including bulk and single-cell RNAseq, indicate molecular features, such as transcriptional subtype, are shared across SCLC and NECs and may predict response to this combination.<br \/>Conclusions: In heavily pre-treated patients across SCLC and NEC cohorts, combined niraparib and dostarlimab failed to exceed interim futility criteria. However, multiple SCLC patients experienced durable disease control, including one patient with sustained CR and associated translational studies point to potential biomarker-driven approaches in the future.<br \/>Trial supported by GlaxoSmithKline.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Neuroendocrine tumors,Immune checkpoint blockade,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carl M.

However, there are still unmet needs for ES-SCLC treatment. LDRT could play a key role in the priming effect of immune system by acting as an immune adjuvant and having sensitive cytotoxic activity to SCLC. The interim analysis of MATCH study after stage I showed promising benefit and tolerability of combination of Atezo + chemotherapy + LDRT in pts with ES-SCLC. Here we report the primary efficacy and safety results of this study.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The MATCH study was a single-arm phase II trial conducted in 8 centers across China. Previously untreated ES-SCLC pts with measureable disease per RECIST v1.1 at baseline, age&#8805;18, ECOG 0-1 were eligible. Atezo (1200 mg IV, D1) + Cisplatin (75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV, D1)\/Carboplatin (AUC = 5 IV, D1) +Etoposide (100 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV, D1-D3) were administrated on a 21-day cycle for four cycles. Concurrent LDRT (15 Gy\/5f) were conducted from D1-D5 in the first cycle. Then pts received Atezo maintenance until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response on two consecutive occasions &#8805; 4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. The secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. A Simon&#8217;s minimax 2-stage design was adopted.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As the cutoff date of 30<sup>th<\/sup> Nov. 2022, 56 pts have been enrolled. 49 (87.5%) were males; mean age was 58.9 years with 78.6% pts had ECOG PS of 1. 80.4% pts had smoking history. Most pts were staged T4 (n = 33, 58.9%), N3 (n = 37, 66.1%) and M1(n = 40, 71.4%). Median follow-up was 14.8 months (range: 11.6-17.8 m). The confirmed ORR was 87.5% (95% CI: 75.9%-94.8%), all partial response. DCR was 94.6% (95% CI: 85.1%-98.9%). Median PFS was 6.9 m (95% CI: 5.4-9.3 m). The 6-month and 12-month PFS rate were 56.5% and 27.7%. Median OS was not reached (NR, 95% CI: 13.3m, NR). The 12-month OS rate was 71.9%. The safety profile, analyzed in all 56 pts, was consistent with the previous reports. Neutrophil count decreased (60.7%), white blood cell count decreased (58.9%) and platelet count decreased (23.2%) were the most common grade (G) 3-4 adverse events (AE). G5 AE occurred in 1 pt (pneumonia and pulmonary embolism). 4 pts experienced AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. IrAEs were reported in 21 (37.5%) pts, most common irAEs were hyperthyroidism (5.4%) and rash (5.4%).

However, overall survival benefit of addition of ICI maintenance to frontline ES SCLC treatment is modest and further improvement is needed. We hypothesized that addition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition to ICI maintenance therapy for patients with platinum sensitive ES SCLC could improve antitumor efficacy of ICI.<br \/>Methods: A single-arm, investigator-initiated phase II trial (NCT03958045) enrolled patients with platinum sensitive ES SCLC who received frontline maintenance nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks, and rucaparib, 600 mg PO twice a day after completion of 4-6 cycles of platinum doublet. The primary outcome was median progression free survival. Secondary endpoints included assessment of objective response and adverse effects (AEs) per CTCAE 5.0. Correlative studies included pretreatment and during-treatment immune assays and circulating tumor DNA TP53 mutation status.<br \/>Results: A total of 42 patients were consented and 33 met eligibility criteria and were treated. All patients received 4-6 cycles of frontline platinum doublet and had at least a partial response by RECIST at the time of enrollment. In the 33 participants, the most common grade 3 and 4 AEs (at least possibly related) were hypokalemia (3%), hyponatremia (3%) , elevated alanine aminotransferase (3%), neutropenia (3%) and leukocytopenia (3%). No grade 5 AE was noted. The median PFS (mPFS) was 3 months from time of enrollment on frontline maintenance (post platinum doublet). The mPFS was 11 months from cycle 1 of platinum doublet. Overall, 89.8% patients were alive at 12 months and 54.4 % patients were alive at 24 months from the start of platinum doublet. Currently 2 patients are on active treatment and other two have completed study treatment and are on observation with stable disease.<br \/>Conclusions: Maintenance rucaparib combined with immune checkpoint inhibition was tolerable and showed promising activity after completion of frontline chemotherapy in platinum sensitive extensive stage small cell lung cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,PARP,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Aman Chauhan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jill Kolesar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donglin Yan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhonglin Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ronald McGarry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Villano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ralph Zinner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashish Maskey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jordan Miller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timothy Mullett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aman Khurana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xitong Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Garima Gupta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Flora<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colleen Darnell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard O'Neil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Kunos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark B.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that elraglusib downregulates PD-1, TIGIT and LAG-3, upregulates expression of MHC class I proteins in tumor cells from &#8220;cold tumors&#8221;, and shows synergy when combined with PD-1 blockade in mouse xenografts. Clinical activity has been observed both as a single agent and in combination with standard of care chemotherapies in several advanced cancer histologies. Here we present initial &#8216;omics data from our phase 1\/2 study (NCT03678883; ACT1801) spanning &#62;100 pts with advanced cancer evaluating both single agent and chemotherapy combinations. The patients (pts) included in this study received elraglusib as a &#8805;3rd line therapy for advanced disease. Most pts with melanoma treated with elraglusib monotherapy (8\/9; 89%) stayed on study for &#62;2 cycles. One patient with melanoma refractory to checkpoint inhibitors achieved a confirmed and durable CR. Clinical benefit was also observed among pts with colorectal cancer with 4\/12 (33.3%) pts treated with monotherapy and 12\/15 (80%) that received elraglusib plus irinotecan rechallenge stayed on study &#62;2 cycles reaching median overall survival of 106 and 211 days, respectively. Based on emerging <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> results demonstrating that elraglusib activates T and NK cells promoting anti-tumor immune responses, we hypothesize immunomodulation by elraglusib may be contributing to anti-tumor immune response in the 1801 trial. We have acquired TCRseq and RNAseq profiles of PBMC samples from seven patients in 1801 during the first two weeks of treatment with elraglusib monotherapy. In these pts, reduced TCR clonality was observed and specific TCR clonotypes expanded after treatment, indicating T cell activation and expansion. These pts also showed changes in PBMC populations during elraglusib therapy as measured by immune deconvolution of PBMC RNAseq. Taken together, these data support a novel, previously unrecognized immunomodulatory mechanism of action for elraglusib and could provide rationale for future clinical development of elraglusib in pts with advanced malignancies. Additional analysis from TCRseq, immune profiling and cytokine analysis from expanded cohort of pts is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Bioinformatics,Phase I,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Taylor Weiskittel<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph McDermott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Billadeau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hu Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anwaar Saeed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Devalingam Mahalingam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Solmaz Sahebjam<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pamela Munster<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ludimila Cavalcante<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank J.

Tumor immunogenicity provides a favorable landscape for inflammatory processes associated with clinical benefit to checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been shown to be an independent predictor of treatment outcomes in patients treated with ICI therapy. mRNA-4157 is a novel mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccine which encodes up to 34 patient-specific tumor neoantigens. Here we report analyses of baseline biopsies from the trial to explore the novel mechanism of action hypothesized to augment endogenous anti-tumor responses and generate immunity to additional tumor neoantigens.<br \/>Methods: Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed baseline tumor core biopsies underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing. According to the established WES genomic score for pembrolizumab, the TMB high threshold utilized for analysis was 175\/exome (10 mutations\/megabase per F1CDx). The distribution of TMB expression in baseline tumor samples across study arms and their association with the primary RFS endpoint was evaluated. The association with RFS of other markers of inflamed tumors, including those established for pembrolizumab (e.g. gene expression profile (GEP) and PD-L1 expression) was also assessed.<br \/>Results: The RFS benefit of mRNA-4157 and pembrolizumab combination compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy observed in the intention-to-treat population was maintained with a similar treatment effect magnitude across both high (HR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.5) and low (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.3,1.4) TMB subpopulations. In line with observations from historical data for pembrolizumab, improved RFS was observed in high TMB compared to low TMB patient subgroups in the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm. The trend for increased RFS benefit in the high TMB subpopulation was maintained in the mRNA-4157 and pembrolizumab study arm. Additional subgroup analyses (e.g. GEP and PD-L1) were assessed and will be discussed.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results indicate that mRNA-4157 demonstrates improvements in RFS irrespective of TMB status when administered in combination with pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with resected high-risk cutaneous melanoma. The novel mechanism of action of mRNA-4157 may both deepen the activity of pembrolizumab and broaden the population of patients that can benefit from immune therapy. The association between TMB and mRNA-4157 treatment effect will be further explored in upcoming planned studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Cancer vaccine,Tumor mutational burden,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan J.

Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is the established biomarker for 1L immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy in advanced NSCLC. We conducted an open-label, multi-cohort, single-arm phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S+T in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. Here, we reported the results of advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 positive expression cohort.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Eligible pts had histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC with no prior systemic chemotherapy, PD-L1 positive (defined as PD-L1 TPS expression &#8805;1% [sp263]), and without EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genetic alteration if non-sq-NSCLC. Enrolled pts received 21-day cycles of S (250 mg orally QD) plus T (240 mg IV, Q3W) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or the maximum duration of treatment with toripalimab is 24 months. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>From July 2020 to September 2021, 55 pts were screened, of whom 23 pts were enrolled and received the treatment of S+T. Median age was 66 years (range: 49-73), 16 (69.6%) were male and 12 (52.2%) had squamous histology. Pts with PD-L1 TPS &#8805;50% and &#60;50% were 10 and 13 respectively. At the data cutoff (Aug 31, 2022), the median follow-up duration was 13.1 mos. Among 21 pts with at least one post-baseline tumor assessment, the confirmed ORR was 57.1%, the median DOR was 8.31 mos, and DCR was 100%. Median PFS (mPFS) (95% CI) was 9.63 mos (5.49, -), median OS (mOS) (95% CI) was not reached (10.78, -), 12m-OS rate was 64%. According to PD-L1 level, the confirmed ORR were 66.7% and 50% for pts with PD-L1 TPS &#8805;50% and &#60;50%, respectively; mPFS were 9.66 (0.69, -) and 6.93 mos (1.64, -), respectively; and the 12m-OS rate were 70% and 62%, respectively. mPFS did not differ with histology: 9.66 mos (5.49, -) for squamous cell carcinoma and 9.63 mos (0.69, -) for adenocarcinoma. All pts experienced &#8805;1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). The most common Gr &#8805;3 TEAEs (&#8805;5% pts) were aspartate aminotransferase increased (17.4%), malignant neoplasm progression (17.4%), hypokalemia (13.0%), hepatic function abnormal (13.0%), lymphocyte count decreased (8.7%), hypertension (8.7%) and pneumonitis (8.7%).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Surufatinib and toripalimab combination showed a promising antitumor activity in 1L therapy for advanced PD-L1 positive NSCLC with manageable toxicity.

ADG126 is designed to be preferentially activated in the tumor microenvironment (TME), with the goal of limiting on-target off-tumor toxicities and promoting prolonged exposure to active drug in the TME. Activated ADG126 binds to a unique and conserved epitope of CTLA-4 with species cross-reactivity. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that activated ADG126 potentiates T cell activation and depletes immunosuppressive Tregs through strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) specifically in the TME. We present interim results from our ongoing Phase 1b\/2 study (ADG126-1001, NCT04645069) on dose escalation and expansion of ADG126 monotherapy as well as dose escalation of ADG126 + toripalimab (Tori).<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>Pts with advanced solid tumors received ADG126 monotherapy (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 20 mg\/kg) Q3W IV or ADG126 (6 or 10 mg\/kg) + Tori (240mg) Q3W IV. Primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are PK, anti-drug antibody (ADA), as well as ORR, DCR, DOR and PFS per RECIST 1.1.<br \/><b>Result: <\/b>As of Dec. 26, 2022, 30 pts have received ADG126 monotherapy. The median number of treatment cycles was 2 (range: 1-24). The median age was 63.5 (39-84) years. 43% of pts had &#8805; 3 prior lines of therapies, and 47% had been previously treated with anti-PD-(L)1 and\/or anti-CTLA-4 therapies. ADG126 was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed, nor was the MTD reached. Only Grade (G) 1-2 TRAEs were reported; TRAEs &#8805;10% included diarrhea (17%), fatigue (17%), pruritus (13%), and rash (10%). Among 27 evaluable pts, DCR = 37%. One pt with ovarian serous carcinoma had a major CA125 response (90% reduction) and her disease was stable with ongoing treatment of ADG126 1 mg\/kg at Cycle 24 (~16 months). In addition, 14 pts have received ADG126 + Tori in the dose escalation cohorts. The median age was 60 (36-85) years; 50% had &#8805; 3 prior lines of therapies, and 43% received prior anti-PD-1 therapies. Both dose levels were well tolerated with no DLT. TRAEs (&#62; 10%) included diarrhea (21%), fatigue (14%), pruritus (14%), rash (14%) and nausea (14%). After multiple cycles at 6 or 10 mg\/kg Q3W, G3 TRAEs were observed in 21% (3\/14) pts, including elevated liver function test\/ hepatitis, elevated lipase and diarrhea, which are immune-related, and sepsis. No G4\/5 TRAEs have been reported. Among 12 evaluable pts, DCR = 58%, including 2 partial responses. Early efficacy signals were observed with continuous tumor shrinkage and stabilization in IO-resistant and cold tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody ADG126 shows favorable safety profiles in monotherapy up to 20 mg\/kg and in combination with Tori up to 10 mg\/kg. Furthermore, promising anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated patients was observed in the dose escalation phase. By enabling higher dose levels in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, ADG126 may unleash the full therapeutic potential for proven and novel indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CTLA-4,PD-1,Solid tumors,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mihitha Ariyapperuma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John J.

Laro, a highly selective and central nervous system (CNS)-active tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of patients (pts) with TRK fusion cancer. Laro demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 69% in 244 pts with solid (non-primary CNS) tumors (Drilon et al. ASCO 2022). Here, we report on the concordance between baseline local tissue-based testing with central tissue-based and liquid biopsy-based ctDNA testing to identify <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Pts with non-primary CNS TRK fusion cancer who underwent independent review committee assessments by July 15, 2019, in three laro clinical trials (NCT02122913, NCT02576431, and NCT02637687) were included. Tumor <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusion status was determined locally by a variety of methods, and centrally by next-generation sequencing in both tissue (using Illumina TruSight&#8482; Oncology Comprehensive) and ctDNA (using Guardant360<sup>&#174;<\/sup> or GuardantOMNI<sup>&#174;<\/sup>) at baseline. Data cut-off: July 20, 2021.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of the 164 pts with <i>NTRK<\/i> fusions identified by local testing, 117 had evaluable tissue samples for central testing, and 99 had evaluable liquid biopsy samples. In total, 81.2% (95\/117) of tumors had the fusion confirmed by central tissue testing. ctDNA testing detected <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions in 33.3% (33\/99) of patients. Positive predictive values for each <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusion are shown in the Table. The ORR for pts with <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions determined by local and central testing will be presented.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>A high proportion of tumors with locally identified <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions were confirmed centrally. At present, analysis of ctDNA is significantly less sensitive at detecting <i>NTRK<\/i> gene fusions. A negative ctDNA result requires next-generation sequencing testing of a tissue biopsy.

Seribantumab is a fully human anti-HER3 IgG2 monoclonal antibody that blocks aberrant NRG1 fusion protein binding to HER3 thereby preventing ligand-dependent activation and dimerization resulting in complete inhibition of the PI3K\/AKT and MAPK downstream signaling pathways. Seribantumab has shown significant anti-tumor activity in PDX models and in patients (pts) with solid tumors harboring NRG1 fusions.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>CRESTONE (NCT04383210) is a phase 2 study of seribantumab in adult pts with solid tumors harboring NRG1 fusions who received at least one prior therapy and were na&#239;ve to ERBB-targeted therapy (Cohort 1); pts previously treated with ERBB-targeted therapies (exploratory Cohort 2) and pts with tumors harboring additional molecular alterations (exploratory Cohort 3). Here, we present updated efficacy results for pts in Cohort 1 dosed at 3 g IV QW. Safety data are evaluated for pts enrolled in Cohort 1 and exploratory Cohorts 2 and 3.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of Dec 2, 2022, 51 pts were enrolled across all cohorts with 30 pts in Cohort 1 dosed at 3 g IV QW. Median age was 62 years (range 19-84); median prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 1-7); tumor types included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=30), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=6), biliary tract\/cholangiocarcinoma (CCA, n=6), breast (n=4), and others (n=5); 15 different NRG1 fusion partners were identified with CD74 (22%) and SLC3A2 (16%) as the most frequently reported. In the overall safety population, 41 pts (80%) reported at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). The most common TRAEs (occurring in &#8805;20% of pts) were diarrhea (41%), fatigue (29%), rash (24%), and nausea (22%). Four pts (8%) experienced Gr 3\/4 TRAEs; no Gr 5 TRAEs. The safety profile for Cohort 1 was similar to the overall safety population. Among the 30 pts in Cohort 1, 22 were evaluable for investigator assessed (INV) response per RECIST v1.1; 2 pts (9%) had confirmed complete response (CR), 6 pts (27%) had confirmed partial response (PR), and 13 pts (59%) had stable disease (SD) as their best overall response (BOR). The INV objective response rate (ORR, confirmed PR + CR) was 36% and disease control rate (DCR, confirmed PR+CR+SD) was 95%. The overall duration of response ranged from 1.4 to 17.2 months. In pts with NSCLC, the INV-ORR was 39% and DCR was 94%.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Seribantumab has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile as a single agent in pts with solid tumors harboring NRG1 fusions. Updated efficacy data indicate seribantumab has robust and durable clinical activity, including CRs, across different tumor types harboring an NRG1 fusion and is a promising treatment option.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,NRG1 fusion,seribantumab,Gene fusion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tejas Patil<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel R.

Results in a cohort of pts with solid tumors with PTEN mut treated with T are reported.<br \/>Methods: Eligible pts had no standard treatment (tx) options, measurable disease, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function. Genomic testing was performed in CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited site selected labs. After antihistamine pre-tx, 25 mg T was infused over 30-60 minutes once weekly until disease progression. Low accruing histology-specific cohorts with PTEN mut were collapsed into 1 histology-pooled cohort for analysis. Primary end point was disease control (DC), defined as complete or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) of at least 16+ weeks (wks) duration (SD16+) per RECIST v1.1. The primary end point was summarized as a proportion and the hypothesized null DC rate of 15% was evaluated by a 1-sided exact binomial test with alpha 0.10. Other end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), duration of SD and safety. DOR is defined as time from pt&#8217;s first documented objective response (OR) until progressive disease (PD). Duration of SD is defined as time from tx start to PD.<br \/>Results: 34 pts with solid tumors (10 tumor types; 20\/34 pts had prostate, soft tissue sarcoma [STS] or lung) with PTEN mut were enrolled. 6 pts were unevaluable for efficacy, 1 was ineligible.

This design enables ADG126 to be preferentially activated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to afford prolonged on-tumor drug exposure and limited off-tumor toxicity. The activated ADG126 binds to a unique and highly conserved epitope of CTLA-4, enabling seamless translational studies. ADG126 is activated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, which primes T cells via partial blockade of CTLA-4 interaction with its ligands. ADG126 depletes immunosuppressive Tregs through strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) specifically in the TME, and it synergizes with anti-PD-1 antibody to induce potent anti-tumor efficacy. In a Phase 1b\/2 study, ADG126 monotherapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile and clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients (pts). Here we present preliminary results from dose escalation of ADG126 in combination with pembrolizumab (Pembro) in pts with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors (NCT05405595).<br \/>Method: This is a Phase 1b\/2, open-label, multicenter dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of ADG126\/Pembro combination regimen. Pts received ADG126 (6 or 10 mg\/kg, Q3W or Q6W, IV) plus Pembro (200mg, Q3W, IV). Primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are PK, ADA, ORR, DCR, DOR and PFS per RECIST 1.1.<br \/>Results: As of Jan 20, 2023, 11 pts have been treated with ADG126\/Pembro combination in dose escalation cohorts. The median age was 61 yo (26-75); 82% pts had at least 3 prior therapies, 18% pts received prior IO therapies. A majority of pts (82%) have what are considered immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors (MSS CRC, PDAC, ovarian cancer, etc.). ADG126 was dosed at 6 mg\/kg Q3W (5 pts), 10 mg\/kg Q3W (3 pts) and 10 mg\/kg Q6W (3 pts); Pembro was dosed at 200 mg Q3W. Both 6 and 10 mg\/kg dose levels on either Q3W or Q6W were well tolerated with no DLT, and no Grade 3 and higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported. Clinical efficacy has been observed in 10 evaluable pts of different tumor types, including 1 confirmed partial response (PR) and 1 stable disease (SD) at 10 mg\/kg (5 evaluable pts), and 1 SD at 6 mg\/kg (5 evaluable pts). Additional safety and efficacy data with repeat dosing will be presented.<br \/>Conclusions: The anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody ADG126 in combination with Pembro is well-tolerated up to 10 mg\/kg Q3W or Q6W in the dose escalation cohorts with repeat dosing. The safety profile of this combination appears to be more favorable than other anti-CTLA-4\/ anti-PD-1 combination therapies reported to date, with no &#8805; G3 TRAEs in the dose escalation phase. Clinical efficacy, including one confirmed PR, have been observed in multiple tumor types. Taken together, ADG126\/Pembro combination may unleash the full therapeutic benefit of anti-CTLA-4\/anti-PD-1 combination in advanced cancer pts beyond immune-sensitive tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL03-01  Placeholder Abstracts: Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CTLA-4,PD-1,Solid tumors,Pembrolizumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Daneng Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sunil Sharma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristine She<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenda Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ai Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Songmao Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guizhong Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ogon Ndukwo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dana Hu-Lowe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Chisamore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jiping Zha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manish R.

The T cell antigen coupler (TAC) technology is a novel approach to modifying T cells, allowing them to recognize and treat HER2+ solid tumors. The TAC receptor redirects T cells to tumor cells, and upon tumor cell recognition, co&#8209;opts the natural T cell receptor (TCR) to yield safer anti-tumor responses versus chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. In preclinical studies, TAC T cells led to complete tumor clearance in mouse models of human cancer, without any TAC-related toxicities. In the ongoing clinical trial (NCT04727151), TAC01-HER2 treatment of HER2+ solid tumors is hypothesized to result in safe and effective anti-tumor responses. Subjects undergo leukapheresis, bridging therapy (if needed) while their TAC01-HER2 are engineered, lymphodepletion chemotherapy (LDC), and finally TAC01-HER2 infusion.<br \/>Trial Design and Early Results: In phase I dose escalation, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety of TAC01-HER2 at increasing doses of 0.3, 0.8, 3, and 8 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/kg in HER2+ solid tumors (1+, 2+ or 3+ as identified by immunohistochemistry) in adult subjects who have progressed after &#8805;2 lines of systemic therapy. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are assessed up to 28 days from cell infusion. In Phase II, dose expansion groups will further evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of the optimal TAC01-HER2 dose in HER2+ breast and other solid tumor types. As of 12 Dec 2022, 12 patients have been treated in Cohorts 1-4 with breast, colorectal, gall bladder, gastro&#8209;esophageal junction, gastric and ovarian tumors. No DLTs or neurotoxicity events have been reported. All patients treated so far at Cohorts 3 and 4 (3 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> and 8 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/kg, respectively) experienced Grade &#8804;2 CRS which were resolved with standard of care treatments. Eight subjects have reported a total of 15 serious adverse events, all unrelated to TAC01-HER2 except for a Grade 1 and a Grade 2 CRS, both resolved with standard of care. Most adverse events were related to LDC or the underlying neoplasm. At Cohort 2, a partial response was observed in a subject with refractory metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (3+ HER2) at 1<sup>st<\/sup> scan, with a 36.5% reduction in measurable disease and clinical benefit was maintained for 6 months. A 71% disease control rate was observed at Cohorts 2 and 3 at 1<sup>st<\/sup> scan (0.8 x 10<sup>6 <\/sup>and 3 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/kg, respectively)). Dose escalation of TAC01-HER2 is ongoing, with the first subject treated at Cohort 4. These results in a heavily pre-treated cancer population show manageable safety and promising clinical activity with a novel T cell therapy that may have broad clinical applicability in HER+ cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,T cell engager,Solid tumors,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ecaterina Elena Dumbrava<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Olson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Saibil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brooke Pieke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mridula A.

In this first completed part of LOKON002, a phase I\/II (NCT03225989) clinical study, the safety and clinical response to LOAd703 in combination with standard-of-care (SoC), or conditioning gemcitabine chemotherapy, was investigated. LOAd703 is an oncolytic adenovirus of serotype 5\/35 modified to express two immunostimulatory transgenes, trimerized membrane-bound CD40L and 4-1BBL.<br \/>In the completed part I (phase I and IIa) of the study, eligible patients with advanced pancreatic-, colorectal-, biliary- and ovarian cancer, were treated with increasing doses of LOAd703 (5x10<sup>10<\/sup>, 1x10<sup>11 <\/sup>and 5x10<sup>11<\/sup> viral particles) using a standard 3+3 design. LOAd703 was administered intratumorally (ultrasound-guided) for up to 8 bi-weekly injections. The maximum tolerated dose tested was further evaluated in an extended dose cohort to confirm safety and assess preliminary clinical activity, and to select the best two indications for the part II of the study.<br \/>Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in part I presented herein. Fifteen of these received LOAd703 combined with SoC, and thirteen in combination with conditioning gemcitabine. The most frequently reported treatment- or procedure-related adverse events were fever (82% of patients), chills (54%) and fatigue (43%). Four patients developed transient cytokine release syndrome. Twenty-five patients fulfilled the criteria to be evaluable for efficacy, which required receiving at least 3 doses of LOAd703 and results from a CT scan week 9. Partial response (PR) was achieved in two patients with pancreatic cancer treated at the highest LOAd703 dose level in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. One of the PRs was achieved at week 25, and the patient received one additional month of chemotherapy per protocol. This patient remained treatment-free for 17 months before chemotherapy was restarted due to progression, and was still alive at last follow-up 34 months after the study registration date. The other PR was achieved at week 17, two weeks after the last LOAd703 injection; disease progression was evident at week 33 and OS was 21 months. Three patients experienced stable disease for a minimum of 25 weeks. This included a patient with advanced ovarian cancer who showed SD at least until week 40, and had an OS of 40 months. No association between adverse events and response was identified. Anti-adenoviral antibody levels (IgG), which increased in all patients, could not be related to indices of clinical benefit.<br \/>Based on the safety of LOAd703 at all dose levels studied, as well as evidence of objective clinical activity in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, further disease-directed studies of intratumoral administration of LOAd703 are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Immunotherapy,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda Hahn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Irenaeus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Wenthe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emma Eriksson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aglaia Schiza<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanna Dahlstrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulla Olsson-StrÃ¶mberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johan Krause<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anders Sundin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linda Sandin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justyna Leja Jarblad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Gustafsson Liljefors<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Rowinsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelica Loskog<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gustav J.
