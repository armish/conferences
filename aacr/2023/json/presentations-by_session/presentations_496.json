[{"Abstract":"Immunotherapy has brought hope for cancer treatment, but its clinical success remains limited. Recently, overexpression of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 (PIB) was shown to induce direct reprogramming of tumor cells into antigen-presenting type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), a rare subset of immune cells with pivotal role in anti-cancer immunity. This strategy might open avenues to enhance cancer cell recognition and elimination by the immune system. However, currently existing in-vitro and in-vivo testing platforms do not qualify to reproduce all complex cell interactions essential for the approbation of this hypothesis. Here, we report the development of the InSphero 3D InSight&#8482; Oncology Platform for in-vitro assessment of efficacy and immune-stimulatory effects of this novel cancer immunotherapy approach. The feasibility of 3D spheroid formation for several GFP-expressing tumor cell lines was evaluated by varying seeding conditions in AKURA 96 well plate. We have measured the growth (ATP content) and GFP signal overtime and analyzed the morphology of the spheroids by IHC. With this, we have established spheroid models of T98G (glioblastoma), PK59 (pancreatic cancer), and A375 (melanoma) cell lines that are growing and viable for at least 10 days. In parallel, using 2D cultures, we have identified the optimal multiplicity of infection of a lentiviral vector encoding for PIB and mCherry to enable high transduction (mCherry+ cells), reprogramming efficiency (mCherry+CD45+HLA-DR+ cells), and cell viability, quantified by flow cytometry and IHC. Then, we have demonstrated that cDC1 reprogramming progresses in the context of 3D cancer spheroids and tumor cells acquire expression of CD45+ and HLA-DR+ cells using IHC and confocal microscopy analysis. We developed an algorithm enabling automated analysis of confocal images and quantification of cDC1 reprogramming efficiency from individual image stacks calculated as a ratio of mCherry+, CD45+ and HLA-DR+ cells versus the number of DAPI+ nuclei. Using the new algorithm we have evaluated the reprogramming efficacy of the different virus dosages in all three types of 3D tumor spheroids. Lastly, we have cocultured tumor spheroids transduced with PIB with na&#239;ve or activated HLA-matched PBMCs and evaluated cytokine secretion as a readout of immune cell activation. We observed that reprogramming induces activation of T cells and correlated it to the number of reprogrammed cells in the tumor spheroid, evaluated by the HC imaging. In summary, we developed the InSphero 3D InSight&#8482; Oncology Platform that allowed us to demonstrate the effects of direct reprogramming of tumor cells into immunogenic dendritic cells. Combined with high-content imaging analysis, this platform offers a powerful solution for preclinical translational research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor,Spheroids,Cancer immunotherapy,Dendritic cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Irina Agarkova<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nadezhda Rotankova<sup>1<\/sup>, Michal Rudnik<sup>1<\/sup>, Silvan Strebel<sup>1<\/sup>, Olga Zimmermannova<sup>2<\/sup>, Andre Rosa<sup>3<\/sup>, Fabio F.

In this study, we used these 3D in vitro human models to study how malignant cells influence the surrounding TME. Using patient-derived primary adipocytes, fibroblasts and mesothelial cells isolated from macroscopically normal omentum (the primary site of metastasis in HGSOC) from women undergoing gynaeco-oncology surgery, we built multicellular models combining those cells with different high grade serous malignant cell lines and monocytes isolated from healthy individuals. We found that peripheral blood monocytes were able to differentiate and polarize to macrophages in our pentacultures (i.e., five different cell types) with phenotypes also found in HGSOC omental metastases. In addition, the cells in our pentaculture models self-rearranged in ways that were dependent on the HGSOC malignant cell lines used in the culture. Macrophage phenotype and cytokine secretion from the multicellular cultures was also influenced by the different malignant HGSOC cell lines used in the model. RNAseq analysis of the pentacultures showed that the cultures clustered according to the malignant cell line used. In addition, we were able to identify some gene expression clusters in the macrophages and fibroblasts of the pentacultures that matched those found by single cell RNAseq analysis of human HGSOC biopsies. These human 3D in vitro multicellular models allow us to define the contribution of each cell type to tumor growth and spread, and also provide us a semi-high throughput platform to investigate antibody or drug targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Ovarian cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Beatrice Malacrida<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Samar Elorbany<sup><\/sup>, Eleni Maniati<sup><\/sup>, Florian Laforets<sup><\/sup>, Ranjit Manchanda<sup><\/sup>, Frances  R.

However, the right preparation and effective usage of the mushrooms for cancers are unclear, yet. Thus, we screened various extractions of the two mushrooms and combinations of the extracts, using a high throughput screening of 3D cell culture system on 384-pillar plates with various cancer cells and Cell Titer-Glo 3D cell viability assay kit (Promega). We also quantified the beta-glucans in all extractions with the Megazyme Mushroom and Yeast Beta-Glucan kit (K-YBGL) by excluding the alpha-glucans content from the total-glucans. As results, most of the extracts showed cytotoxicity on the lung cancer cells, A549 cells, rather than on the other cells, such as HepG2 (N=9 for each treatment). The extracts of reishi mushroom in 60% of methanol (dose range, 0.21-2.3 mg\/ml) showed the strongest cytotoxicity on the lung cells, IC50=0.90 +\/- 0.01 mg\/ml, among the extracts of different methanol contents (10-60%) or different temperatures (50-90 &#176;C) of hot water. However, the 60 % of methanol reishi extracts included relatively low levels of beta-glucans, compared to other extracts (18.57 +\/- 0.31 vs. 22.42 +\/- 5.56 % w\/w). In addition, the levels of beta-glucans in all of reishi mushroom extracts were lower than those in all of the shiitake extracts (17.70 +\/- 1.89 % vs. 27.05 +\/- 4.21 % w\/w: p&#60;0.01). Moreover, there was no association between the levels of beta-glucans and IC50 in A549 cells. Interestingly, the combination (1:1) of the above 60% of methanol extracts of reishi mushroom and the 30% methanol extracts of shiitake (dose range, 0.30-3.26 mg\/ml) showed synergic effects, i.e., 2-7 fold stronger effects (average of IC50=0.40 mg\/ml) than every single treatment (average of IC50=0.90-2.63 mg\/ml). Taken together, the reishi mushroom may have other strong chemopreventive materials rather than beta-glucans, while the shiitake may have a potentiation effect, when combined with the reishi mushroom. In conclusion, our 3D cell culture system showed high throughput performance to find the right preparation and effective usage of the two mushrooms and provided useful information for the next clinical studies for lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoprevention,Antitumor agents,Natural products,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mihi Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hee-Kyung Jang<sup>2<\/sup>, Huiwon Kang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sookmyung Women's University, College of Pharmacy, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Natural Dream, Goesan, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"73ce1eb4-e1bf-4ba3-8cf8-190a1a9f98a7","ControlNumber":"5763","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Developing a rapid, robust and predictive therapeutic testing system could support clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. We developed a Patient Therapy Evaluation System (PTES) that employs a three-dimensional (3D) fully human microtumor drug testing assay using tissue specimens collected during surgery of HN cancers. Remnant fresh tumor tissue from patients is dissociated into single-cell suspension that is embedded using a novel HuBiogel-cell encapsulation technology (3D microtumors). This high-throughput assay platform allows morphologic, functional, and molecular evaluations in parallel by real-time imaging, cell proliferation, and biomarker protocols. Microtumor viability, growth profiles, and drug screening data are captured at multiple time points up to 14 days. Our initial cohort included 57 patient specimens (53 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 verrucous carcinoma, 1 osteosarcoma, 1 ameloblastoma, and 1 non-cancerous lichenoid mucositis). HuBiogel-embedded tumor cells formed numerous multicellular colonies exhibiting distinct organization and growth patterns in 14-day microtumor cultures. Interestingly, epithelial, stromal and stem-cell like populations were preserved in HN microtumor models based on marker expression. Treatment with single (cisplatin, 5FU, docetaxel) drugs and their combinations resulted in tumor inhibitory responses (IC50) evaluated by CellTiter-Glo assay, and residual surviving cells were also recorded by Calcein-AM staining of 3D Microtumors. While patient-derived HN microtumors were produced with high success rates, factors associated with lower microtumor yield included smaller tumor specimens and low viability after dissociation. In conclusion, our new all human microtumor assay models replicating phenotypic, functional, and molecular properties ex vivo provide a potential theranostic tool for rapidly predicting drug sensitivity and improving treatment strategy for HN cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy response,Ex vivo,High-throughput assay,3D Microtumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher D.

The tumor cell lines were from the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR) collection (https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov\/models\/database.htm). The AhR is a ligand-activated helix-loop-helix transcription factor of the bHLH-PAS family. It is involved in the regulation of responses to planar aromatic hydrocarbons by activating the transcription of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 or by acting as an E3 ligase. Thus, the AhR activates detoxification pathways that dispose of small molecule toxins and damaged proteins. In the absence of xenobiotics, the AhR is located within the cytoplasm in complex with two Hsp90 molecules and co-chaperones. Upon xenobiotic binding, the AhR translocates to the nucleus and binds to the AhR nuclear translocator protein to form an active transcription factor complex and promote gene transcription. As single agents, the three AhR inhibitors showed little cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 10 &#181;M. Combinations of AhR inhibitors with anticancer agents including doxorubicin, cisplatin, SN38, venetoclax, selinexor, and etoposide (https:\/\/dtp.cancer.gov\/organization\/dscb\/obtaining\/default.htm) produced primarily additive cytotoxicity in complex spheroids after a 7-day exposure. However, unexpected greater-than-additive effects were observed with AhR inhibitors in combination with proteasome pathway inhibitors. Bortezomib, a direct inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like protease of the 26S proteasome, and pevonedistat, a NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor, produced additive or greater-than-additive cytotoxicity in some complex spheroids. However, the combination of BAY-2416964 with TAK-243, a ubiquitin activating enzyme inhibitor, produced profound greater-than-additive cytotoxicity in more than half of the 28 PDMR cell lines tested as complex spheroids.

The current cancer spheroid generation utilizes low-adhesion plates or forced aggregation of single cells. However, certain cancers do not form stable spheroids in these protocols, nor do pre-formed tumor spheroids recapitulate in vivo development and progression. This project aims to overcome this limitation with the use of a biomimetic hydrogel system to mimic in vivo cancer cell growth and tumor development and use it as an in vitro platform for 3D cancer drug screening. The biocompatible and tunable hydrogel permits independent control of key biochemical and biophysical cues such as matrix degradation, cell adhesion, and stiffness; leading to systematic investigation of matrix parameter contribution to regulating in vitro tumor growth and treatment response. We modified a homo-polysaccharide dextran with methacrylate groups and generated dextran macromers (Dex-MA) containing ample reactive methacrylates per polymer. Cell adhesion is mediated by thiol-terminated RGD peptide added to the methacrylates, followed by crosslinking with di-thiolated MMP-labile peptides through Michael-type addition reaction. Varying the sequence of the crosslinker furthermore gives access to a range of degradability, independent of matrix stiffness. Our experiments showed that Dex-MA supported robust growth of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells from single cell to 3D tumor spheroids, whereas the cell line failed to form tumor aggregates in low-adhesion plates. Alteration of hydrogel stiffness further revealed stiffness dependence of tumor growth, invasion, and response to treatment, suggesting the importance of matrix properties on regulating cell behavior. This dextran-based tunable hydrogel system provides key insights into how engineered matrix properties control tumor growth, critical for screening novel therapy compounds, and may reveal mechanisms for 3D tumor development, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Spheroids,Matrix metalloprotease,3D models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jaxson  R.

CD47-SIRP&#945; axis is the best studied example of the &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal, frequently overexpressed on cancer cell. Targeting of CD47 protein has shown impressive results in clinical trials in hematologic malignancies but remained challenging for solid tumors therapy. Therefore, tools facilitating the development of novel innate immune checkpoint inhibitors are of great interest. To address that unmet need, we established a high-throughput, 384-well-format assay for efficacy assessment of compounds inducing macrophage phagocytosis. As a model of solid tumor, we employed 3D spheroids aggregated of human cancer cell lines (A375, HCT116, MCF7, SKOV3) expressing GFP or PDX material (LXFA1647 lung adenocarcinoma, MEXF2106 melanoma) and cancer associated fibroblasts, as well as Monocyte-Derived Macrophages (MDMs) which altogether were co-aggregated to form spheroids mimicking the tumor microenvironment and immune-competence. In parallel MDMs were co-cultured with matured spheroid to emulate tumor infiltration. Both models were cultured in automation and High Content imaging compatible Akura&#8482; 384-well plate. To evaluate our system, we targeted CD47-SIRP&#945; axis by treatment of 3D spheroid models with &#945;CD47 antibody (H6D12) in combination with atezolizumab (&#945;PD-L1 antibody). Tumor viability and growth were assessed by fluorescence measurements and ATP level. Phagocytosis of fluorescently labeled tumor cells was imaged by confocal microscopy and quantified by inhouse developed analysis pipeline. Immune cell activation was evaluated by a cytokine bead array. The treatment of cell line-based 3D models with &#945;CD47 antibody resulted in an increased number of phagocytic macrophages followed by a decrease of fluorescence and size of tumor spheroids in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed an induced secretion of TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-RA after 48h. Similarly, in PDX-based models, we observed decreased spheroid size and ATP level at day 7. Notably, &#945;CD47 antibody-induced level of cytokines was further increased in combination with atezolizumab. To conclude, we have developed a human disease relevant, high-throughput assay for the evaluation of novel therapeutic modalities targeting phagocytosis. Due to compatibility with microscopy and most of the biochemical assays, it represents a powerful tool for clinical candidate development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phagocytosis,3D models,High-throughput assay,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michal Rudnik<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Özlem Yava&#351; Grining<sup><\/sup>, Nadezhda Rotankova<sup><\/sup>, Silvan Strebel<sup><\/sup>, Francesca Chiovaro<sup><\/sup>, Olivier Frey<sup><\/sup>, Irina Agarkova<sup><\/sup>, Wolfgang Moritz<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>InSphero AG, Schlieren, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"38c846bd-3ce7-48f3-90cc-4eabb6d4f137","ControlNumber":"2813","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

However, the objective response rates for most solid tumors are low (below 30%). Accumulating evidence has shown that chemotherapy can increase the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and improve cancer outcomes. We have investigated if chemotherapy can modulate anti-PDL1 enhanced T cell cytotoxicity in breast cancer using novel <i>in vitro<\/i> 3D co-culture assay system. 3D co-culture of cancer and immune cells is a powerful platform for disease modeling and therapies testing because it can mimic the tumor micro-environment and complex cellular interactions. In this study we evaluated the immunomodulatory effect of chemotherapy on spheroid-T cells interactions in response to PD-L1 inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer. MCF7 and MDA231 cell lines with differential PD-L1 status were formed into spheroids and used as a tumor model. T cells were activated from PBMCs using ImmunoCult CD3\/CD28 T cell Activator. Co-culture assays were performed over 72 hr in a Pu&#183;MA System. The Pu&#183;MA System is an automated microfluidic platform that enables phenotypic and functional assays using physiologically relevant 3D cell models. Cancer spheroids and T cells were cultured, manipulated, and measured in a single well of a microfluidic flowchip. The platform integrates 1) 3D cell model with delivery of immune cells, 2) drug delivery, 3) imaging of phenotypic features and 4) functional profiling for cytokine secretion and viability. T cells-spheroid interaction, invasion and cell viability was assessed using high-content fluorescence imaging CellVoyager CQ1 system. IL2, IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; secretion was measured in collected supernatants using Lumit immunoassays. After viability determination, co-cultures were fixed and stained for cancer and T cell markers (E-Cadherin, F-Actin, CD3, CD8) using automated IF staining protocol and then imaged. Image analysis revealed colocalization and infiltration of the T cells into the spheroids. Disintegration of spheroid, loss of circular shape, and increased number of dead cancer cells indicated T cell mediated cancer cell death. To evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of chemotherapy on spheroid-T cells interactions in response to PD-L1 inhibition, co-cultures were exposed to PD-L1 inhibitor Atezolizumab in the presence or absence of Cisplatin\/Pemetrexed. We have analyzed a shift in T cell-mediated killing activity and function in the presence or absence of chemotherapeutics. The proposed co-culture platform can be further extended to a more complex patient-derived 3D models using different cell types. Our functional immune-oncology 3D platform allows to study the crosstalk between immune, cancer and other cell interactions, evaluate new drug candidates and assess individual therapeutic approaches to advance precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Spheroids,Assay development,Microfluidics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ekaterina Moroz Nikolov<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony Thai<sup>1<\/sup>, Lila Cooper<sup>1<\/sup>, Mahomi Suzuki<sup>2<\/sup>, Arvonn Tully<sup>3<\/sup>, Rashmi Rajendra<sup>1<\/sup>, Evan  F.

For this purpose, 3D cancer spheroids have been established as more effective than 2D models. Current commercial techniques, however, rely heavily on self-aggregation of dissociated cells and cannot replicate key features of the native tumor microenvironment, particularly due to a lack of control over extracellular matrix components and heterogeneity in size and aggregate-forming tendencies. Also, current spheroidal techniques are typically limited to one spheroid per well, therefore providing a narrow range of cell numbers per well, disadvantageous for assay development in drug screening. Here, we overcome these challenges by coupling tissue engineering toolsets with microfluidic technologies to create engineered cancer microspheres and sorting desired numbers of microspheres into assay-ready well-plate format. To form the engineered cancer microspheres, MCF7 (non-metastatic) and MDA-MB-231 (metastatic) breast cancer cells were encapsulated within poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen hydrogels using our previously developed microfluidic platform. Highly uniform cancer microspheres (intra and inter-batch coefficient of variation &#8804; 5%) with high cell densities (over 20&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/ml) were produced rapidly, which is critical for use in drug testing. The microspheres supported the 3D culture of both breast cancer cell lines over at least 14 days in culture. Encapsulated cells displayed cell type-specific differences in morphology, proliferation, metabolic activity, ultrastructure, and overall microsphere size distribution and bulk stiffness. To prepare assay-ready pre-plated microspheres, a COPAS FP flow cytometer was used for its ability to analyze and sort large sample particles such as tumor spheroids and hydrogel cancer microspheres generated in this study. When using a 96-well plate, the sorting rate varied from 2.5 - 6 microspheres per second, depending on the sample concentration. When sorting a desired number of microspheres per well, the accuracy was greater than 95% as verified visually by microscopy. Viability of sorted microspheres was verified 24 hours post-sort. Shipping conditions were established that maintained cell viability for remote use in drug testing. Methods for compound addition by pinning and imaging were tested and optimized. Using these approaches, the microsphere system was shown to be compatible with an automated liquid handling system for administration of drug compounds; MDA-MB-231 microspheres were distributed in 384 well plates and treated with chemotherapeutic drugs. Expected responses were quantitated using CellTiter-Glo&#174; 3D and detected using automated imaging. Overall, our results demonstrate initial applicability for the tissue-engineered cancer microspheres for drug screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Drug-discovery screen,Biomaterials,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuan Tian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yongwoon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Wen  J.

Pancreatic cancer patients have few therapeutic options and innovative therapies are sorely needed to improve treatment of the disease. This is mainly due to the late diagnosis and partially due to the biology of the disease. Capturing the components of the tumor microenvironment, which serve as both a physical barrier and a source of stromal-driven resistance to therapeutics, is one of the issues faced by drug developers searching for agents to combat pancreatic cancer. We have created a 3D model of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment, the <i>Reconstructed Pancreas<\/i> (r-Pancreas), using Mia PaCa-2, PANC-1, and BxPC-3 pancreatic tumor cell lines embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) that was formulated to recapitulate the typical ECM of pancreatic tumors. We have shown that gemcitabine was effective against pancreatic tumor cells cultured in r-Pancreas (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=0.4-0.8&#181;M), while 5-fluorouracil was ineffective (IC<sub>50<\/sub> not reached), mimicking clinical response. In nude mice, subcutaneous PANC-1 tumors exhibited similar responses to gemcitabine and 5-fluorocurcil. Treatment with gemcitabine resulted in a Day 63 median &#916;T\/&#916;C of 37% while 5-fluorouracil resulted in a Day 63 median delta &#916;T\/&#916;C of 102%. Incorporating a collagen-rich capsule increases the physiological relevance of the r-Pancreas model because it has been shown that human pancreatic tumors have an outer layer of stiff ECM that functions as a physical barrier and prevents drugs from penetrating the tumor. Recently, we showed that, at least in the Mia PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 tumor cell lines, introducing such a collagen capsule dramatically reduced sensitivity to gemcitabine. Disrupting the collagen capsule with MMP-9 restored the sensitivity of the tumor cells to gemcitabine demonstrating that the capsule provides a physical barrier to drug entry. Additionally, creating a co-culture of primary activated pancreatic stromal cells and pancreatic tumor cell lines produces a more complete 3D model that permits the testing of potential therapeutic agents inside the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Hence, we have created a 3D model where pancreatic tumor cells were co-cultured with human pancreatic fibroblasts. According to our results, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> values for pancreatic tumor cell lines treated with gemcitabine increased by twofold when co-cultured with activated pancreatic fibroblasts compared to control sets of tumor cells alone (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=1-3&#181;M). Together, these data imply that, to be clinically relevant, <i>in vitro<\/i> models of pancreatic cancer must integrate tumor-specific components of the microenvironment, including the collagen capsule and activated fibroblasts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,3D cell culture,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Arnat Balabyev<sup>1<\/sup>, Justin  D.

Clearly, a better system to evaluate the personalized response to immunotherapies will greatly benefit the patients and reduce the cost of care. In addition, due to their theoretical and demonstrated benefits in providing durable responses, new immunotherapies are avidly sought after by most major pharmaceutical companies, numerous biotech companies, and academic laboratories. However, preclinical evaluation of new immunotherapy efficacy is challenging and inaccurate using most experimental model systems.E-slice is a faithful model of an individual cancer patient&#8217;s tumor. It is a proprietary 3D tissue slice culture platform, and E-slices are generated by making thin sections of intact, fresh tumor tissues from patients. As such, immune components and the TME in E-slices are native to each patient&#8217;s tumor. E-slice overcomes many of the limitations of other experimental systems for multiple reasons. The E-slice platform: 1) uses chemically defined, serum-free medium; 2) measures viability changes upon treatment longitudinally, from the same tissue, which allows both absolute and relative responses for as short as 4 days or as long as over 4 weeks ex vivo; 3) can be generated from any solid tumor tested thus far (breast, lung, colorectal, pancreas, brain, head 7 neck, and others) from patient tumors directly or from PDX and genetically engineered mouse models; 4) retains the native TME and tissue architecture because E-slices are never dissociated or otherwise reconstituted; 5) is compatible with biopsies as well as surgical samples; 6) has been shown to accurately predict individual patient treatment responses to chemotherapies and targeted therapies in 4-12 days, paving the way for evidence-based personalized treatment selections in a clinically actionable time frame.Specifically for immunotherapy response measurements, key differentiators of the E-slice platform from other ex vivo systems for immunotherapy responses are: 1) E-slice is generated from fresh patient tumor tissues with tumor-trained and resident immune cells and not artificially introduced PBMCs used in most other systems; 2) serum-free, chemically defined medium and does not artificially activate or suppress the immune system; 3) E-slice has been validated by single-cell RNA-sequencing to maintain immune cells in their native state up to 8 days ex vivo; 4) E-slices can be used to detect secreted protein and metabolic biomarkers in the conditioned media pre- and post-treatment; 5) E-slice can measure immunotherapy responses ex vivo in 8 days. In summary, we present a novel ex vivo 3D human tumor tissue drug sensitivity platform that can enhance immunotherapy development pipelines and clinical deployment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Immunotherapy,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thomas D.

In this sense, we developed a novel functional polymer thin film (Poly-X-PTF) via a streamlined liquid-phase synthesis, a more facile and advanced version than previous lab-made vapor-deposited poly(2,4,6,8-tetravinyl-2,4,6,8-tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane) called pV4D4-PTF. Emerging from a previous success with pV4D4, the new platform, Poly-X, could also simply stimulate surface stimuli-guided, rapid transformation of differentiated cancer cells to a number of ECM-enriched, similar-sized 3D CSC-like tumor spheroids from both commercialized cancer cell lines and patient-derived primary GBM cells. Varied GBM patient-derived cancer spheroids demonstrated a variety of phenotypes and transcriptomic profiles known about glioma stem cells (GSCs) in common. Notably, respective sensitivities of different patient-based 3D GSC spheroids to irradiation with or without temozolomide were retrospectively associated with the individual therapeutic outcome and overall survival, as a result of clinically relevant concurrent chemoradiation treatment (CCRT) regimens proposed in a fast Poly-X-spheroids-based 3D viability assay format. Ultimately, this versatile platform may serve to study fundamental CSC biology. Furthermore, it may translate into a powerful preclinical <i>ex vivo<\/i> tool in glioma medical settings both to aid in on-site prospective prediction of the patient-specific prognosis via CCRT viability responses within around 10 days and assess a patient-tailored, promising drug candidate or combination treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Spheroids,Cancer stem cells,Ex vivo GBM model,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Junhyuk Song<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yoonjung Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yumi Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyo  E.

The interactions between cancer cells and stromal tissue have been reported to affect the behavior of cancer cells. So that <i>ex vivo<\/i> model recapturing the tumor microenvironment is needed to evaluate the efficacy of drugs under the condition mimicking the patient tumor tissue. Here, we developed the unique tissue engineering technique, which easily enables the construction of cell - stacked three dimensional (3D) tissue, and co-culture of 3D stromal tissues and patient-derived cancer cells (PDCs). We investigated drug sensitivity in conventional 2D culture, our 3D co-cultured model and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor.<br \/>Methods: Fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells were suspended in a buffer solution containing heparin and collagen to support cell aggregation. The heparin\/collagen-treated cells were seeded in culture-inserts in over-confluent manner, and 3D layered stromal tissue called were constructed. PDCs established from colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the Cancer Institute Hospital of JFCR were co-cultured with the 3D stromal tissue. The 3D co-cultured model applied to drug screening, and the results were compared with those of 2D culture model. <i>In vivo<\/i> drug evaluations were performed with the compounds in which marked differences were observed between 2D and 3D models.<br \/>Results: In our 3D model, drug sensitivities to most of the tested compounds tended to be decreased in comparison with those in 2D culture condition. Interestingly, a part of drugs did not effective in 2D showed marked tumor growth inhibition in our 3D model. The compounds that showed favorable efficacy in 3D rather than 2D in multiple PDCs were accounted for about 5% of tested compounds. At least half of these drugs showed significant tumor growth suppression or tumor regression <i>in vivo<\/i>. On the contrary, in the case of drug sensitivities were considerably fallen in our 3D model, most of the evaluated compounds represented almost no anti-tumor effect<i> in vivo<\/i>. Results from gene and protein expression analyses supported that cancer cells co-cultured in our 3D stromal tissue have some similar profiles to in vivo tumor rather than 2D culture condition.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study proposed the unique 3D co-cultured tumor model.

Here we present data obtained from 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) composed of cancer cell lines, fibroblasts and macrophages. We cultured HT29 and SW480 CRC cell lines (as well as others) with fibroblasts and obtained heterospheroids that could be evaluated in cell viability and apoptosis assays, by flow cytometry and high content imaging (HCI). In addition, mature MCTS were embedded in paraffin and used for traditional biomarker characterization using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The cancer cell x fibroblast interactions promoted a tumor-like microenvironment that recruited monocytes isolated from primary donors. FACS analysis indicated that the infiltrating monocytes polarized into CD163-positive M2 macrophages in HT29 MCTS, and in pancreatic MIA PaCa-2 MCTS, using Pexidartinib and anti-CSF1R mAb, we found that monocyte infiltration was strongly CSF1R dependent. Preliminary data suggest that also infiltration of T cells into the heterospheroids is possible, thus making the models useful for the study of immune cell infiltration. Whole transcriptomic analysis of mono-cultures of SW480 cancer cells and fibroblast spheroids and co-cultures (MCTS) identified traditional cell-type-related transcripts as well as a group of <i>de novo<\/i> expressed genes induced by co-culturing, such as serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A1 (serpinA1) and inhibin-&#946; A (INHBA). The NGS analysis as well as immunohistochemical staining also showed that SW480 expressed high levels of P-glycoprotein (P-Gp, MDR1) in contrast to the fibroblasts. On the other hand, the HT29 MCTS were negative for P-Gp. Histological analysis and the apoptosis assay showed that the fibroblasts were more sensitive to 5FU and cisplatin treatment than the cancer cells. We are currently testing if the P-Gp inhibitor, PSC-833, can re-sensitize the cancer cells to 5FU and cisplatin. In conclusion, we have developed 3D multicellular heterospheroids mimicking tumor-like microspheres that can be used for drug testing of traditional drug compounds, biologics and even immunotherapeutic agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Macrophages,Fibroblasts,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Boye Schnack Nielsen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Natasha  H.

However, as in vivo models, CRC PDXs are costly and low-throughput, which leads to a need for equivalent in vitro models. To address this need, we previously established an in vitro model using a tissue engineering toolset with CRC PDX cells. However, it is unclear whether tissue engineering has the capacity to maintain patient- and\/or cancer stage-specific tumor heterogeneity. To address this gap, we employed three PDX tumor lines, originated from stage II, III-B, and IV CRC tumors, in the formation of 3D engineered CRC PDX (3D-eCRC-PDX) tissues and performed an in-depth comparison between the 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues and the original CRC-PDX tumors. To form the tissues, CRC-PDX tumors were expanded in vivo and dissociated. The isolated cells were encapsulated within poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen hydrogels and remained viable and proliferative post encapsulation over the course of 29 days in culture. To gain molecular insight into the maintenance of PDX line stage heterogeneity, we performed a transcriptomic analysis using RNA seq to determine the extent to which there were similarities and differences between the CRC-PDX tumors and the 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues. We observed the greatest correspondence in overlapping differentially expressed human genes, gene ontology, and Hallmark gene set enrichment between the 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues and CRC-PDX tumors in the stage II PDX line, while the least correspondence was observed in the stage IV PDX line. The Hallmark gene set enrichment from murine mapped RNA seq transcripts was PDX line-specific which suggested that the stromal component of the 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues was maintained in a PDX line-dependent manner. Consistent with our transcriptomic analysis, we observed that tumor cell subpopulations, including human proliferative (B2M+Ki67+) and CK20+ cells, remained constant for up to 15 days in culture even though the number of cells in the 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues from all three CRC stages increased over time. Yet, tumor cell subpopulation differences in the stage IV 3D-eCRC-PDX tissues were observed starting at 22 days in culture. Overall, our results demonstrate a strong correlation between our in vitro 3D-eCRC-PDX models and the originating in vivo CRC-PDX tumors, providing evidence that these engineered tissues may be capable of mimicking patient- and\/or cancer stage-specific heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,3D models,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yuan Tian<sup>1<\/sup>, Iman Hassani<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Anbiah<sup>1<\/sup>, Bulbul Ahmed<sup>2<\/sup>, William Van Der Pol<sup>3<\/sup>, Elliot  J.

Identifying patients who truly benefit from these treatments remains a challenge. Developing newer and better therapy options that fail in the clinical phase is yet another unmet need. Both these limitations could be addressed by employing testing platforms that best capture the heterogeneity and complexity of the tumor within the patient. Farcast<sup>TM<\/sup> TruTumor is a near native human histo-culture platform which retains the tumor and stroma along with the intra-tumoral immune compartment post culture that holds promise to improve treatment outcomes in patients. In this study, we developed a ccRCC platform using surgical excess specimens from consented patients and compared its immune profile with the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) platform. ccRCC samples (n=10) were processed to generate explants and cultured for 72h and interrogated for response to treatment with Sunitinib (TKI :27.7ng\/ml) or Nivolumab (anti-PD1:132&#181;g\/ml). On comparison of immune profiles between HNSCC and ccRCC at baseline, we observed a significantly lower total immune content in ccRCC. ccRCC showed comparatively higher variation in myeloid (70%CV) and lymphoid compartments (30%CV) as compared to HNSCC. Live tumor and immune cell population was found to be well preserved post-culture in ccRCC. Presence of various T cell sub-populations, monocyte and macrophage population post culture were confirmed using flowcytometry. Sunitinib treatment significantly increased caspase-3 expression (8\/10 samples, p value&#60;0.01), along with decrease in tumor content in 4\/10 samples (average drop 23%). Two samples which did not respond to Sunitinib treatment showed an increase in Interferon gamma (IFNg) (Log<sub>2<\/sub>FC &#177; SD, 2.7&#177; 0.7) and Granzyme B (Log<sub>2<\/sub>FC &#177; SD, 1.05&#177; 0.85) secretion, in response to Nivolumab treatment. Of these, in one sample we observed an increase in CD8+ Granzyme B, CD8+ Ki67 and decrease in CD4+ FoxP3 population, with concomitant decrease in Pan CK+ population by flowcytometry. In this sample, we observed a decrease in tumor content indicating anti-tumor response to Nivolumab treatment. In summary, the TruTumor platform potentially offers personalized treatment choices to patients improving their chances of recovery. In addition, this platform could provide powerful insights into the mechanisms of a wide range of therapy molecules in development to predict their efficacy better than other simplistic and non-human testing models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Renal cell carcinoma,Histopathology,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Satish Sankaran<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kowshik Jaganathan<sup>1<\/sup>, Gowri Shankar K<sup>1<\/sup>, Saurabh Bhargav<sup>2<\/sup>, Ganesh MS<sup>3<\/sup>, Amritha Prabha<sup>3<\/sup>, Prakash BV<sup>4<\/sup>, Syamkumar V<sup>1<\/sup>, Biswajit Das<sup>1<\/sup>, Vasanth K<sup>1<\/sup>, Manimaran A<sup>1<\/sup>, Chandan Bhowal<sup>1<\/sup>, Rajashekar M<sup>1<\/sup>, Oliyarasi M<sup>1<\/sup>, Ritu Malhotra<sup>1<\/sup>, Govindraj K<sup>1<\/sup>, Nandini Pal Basak<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Farcast Biosciences, Bangalore, India,<sup>2<\/sup>Mazumdar Shaw Medical Centre, Bangalore, India,<sup>3<\/sup>Vydehi Multi Specialty Hospital, Bangalore, India,<sup>4<\/sup>Sri Lakshmi Multi Specialty Hospital, Bangalore, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1a6c333b-5f11-49f3-a419-8ef7cd2d25bf","ControlNumber":"6073","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Our 3D <i>Ex Vivo<\/i> Patient Tissue (EVPT) platform is a short-term 3D ex vivo culture system utilizing ultra-fresh human tumor material processed to preserve the rich TME with high content image (HCI) analysis for higher throughput screening. The EVPT platform has previously been validated for standard of care (SoC) and immunological drug testing, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), in ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples. Here, we present the expansion of the EVPT platform to other cancer indications, including resections from bladder, prostate, breast cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma (GBM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).<br \/>Methods: Tumor tissues from NSCLC, ovarian, bladder, prostate, breast cancer, melanoma, GBM and HCC patients were processed within 24 hours. Freshly isolated tumor clusters were embedded in a protein-rich hydrogel and exposed to panels of (immuno)-oncology treatments at various doses in a 384-well format for 5-7 days. Phenotypic effects of treatment on morphological features, such as tumor cell killing, growth arrest, and immune cell proliferation, were measured using our proprietary automated HCI platform. Whole blood samples were also collected and PBMCs were isolated for autologous co-culture assays with selected cancer samples. Additionally, biomarkers analysis, including IHC, FACS and cytokine measurements, was performed.<br \/>Results: At least two patient samples per new indication were processed. The success rate of the assay (30-40%) was primarily dependent on the sample quality, and the absence of necrotic, healthy, or fibrotic tissue within the sample. Panels of SoC drugs, targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and control compounds established for each indication were profiled per patient sample. For example, prostate cancer samples responded to Paclitaxel and Crizotinib, and one of GBM samples showed sensitivity to Regorafenib and Bevacizumab. Overall, similarly to clinical findings, about 20% of NSCLC and bladder cancer samples responded to ICI treatment, while 60-70% of the samples have responded to immunostimulatory controls (SEA and CD3\/CD28).Although TME composition varied between NSCLC samples, IHC and FACs analysis showed a rich representation of immune compartment - T Cells (CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+), NK cells (CD16+), myeloid cells (CD14+, CD68+) alongside with EpCAM+ tumor cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Despite tissue quality remaining a challenge for many primary ex vivo assays, the gentle processing and short-term 3D culturing in our EVPT platform preserves the rich TME in a wide range of tumors. This makes our EVPT platform an innovative and translational tool for complex (immuno)-oncology drug testing in multiple cancer indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Ex vivo,Image analysis,3D models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nataliia Beztsinna<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sander Basten<sup>1<\/sup>, Ezgi Kaya Aksoy<sup>1<\/sup>, Niels Meesters<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefanos Timiliotis<sup>1<\/sup>, Donny van der Meer<sup>2<\/sup>, Kuan Yan<sup>1<\/sup>, Emma Spanjaard<sup>1<\/sup>, Willemijn Vader<sup>2<\/sup>, Leo  S.

However, there is a lack of <i>ex vivo<\/i> models to evaluate effects on patients&#8217; tumor biology or to screen patients for treatment efficacy. Therefore, we adapted patient-derived three-dimensional GBM tissue culture models to be compatible with TTFields application and recently published the feasibility of such an approach (Nickl, et al., 2022, doi: 10.3390\/cancers14215177). Here, we applied one of those models, i.e. tumor-organoids cultured as microtumors on murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs), to additional brain tumor entities, namely a sample of an anaplastic ependymoma (AE) patient and an oligodendroglioma patient. Organoids were generated from fresh intra-operatively obtained tumor tissue and cultured for 2 weeks. OHSCs were prepared by slicing the brains of mice 5-8 days postpartum to sections with a thickness of 350 &#181;m using a vibratome, and culturing them for 2 weeks as well. Subsequently, organoids were placed onto the OHSCs. The inovitro&#8482; laboratory research system was used for TTFields administration at 200 kHz and 1.5 V\/cm for 72 h. Microtumor growth was evaluated on fluorescence images. Viable organoids formed from the GBM, AE and oligodendroglioma sample and grew to microtumors when placed onto OHSCs. Application of TTFields at 200 kHz led to a significant decrease of microtumor size of the GBM and AE (both p&#60;0.0001), but not the oligodendroglioma sample. This proof-of-principle investigation proved that the application of patient-derived organoids cultured on OHSCs is feasible to investigate the effects of TTFields on different kinds of brain tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of TTFields efficacy on patient derived AE and oligodendroglioma tissue cultures. While TTFields at 200 kHz led to a decrease in the microtumor size of the AE sample, the non-responsiveness of the oligodendroglioma sample may be due to different inter-patient sensitivity to TTFields or a suboptimal TTFields frequency.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),anaplastic ependymoma,Oligodendroglioma,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Vera Nickl<sup>1<\/sup>, Ellina Schulz<sup>1<\/sup>, Ellaine Salvador<sup>1<\/sup>, Laureen Trautmann<sup>1<\/sup>, Leopold Diener<sup>1<\/sup>, Almuth  F.

Methods to reduce animal models in oncology may include three-dimensional cellular systems that take into account tumor microenvironment (TME) cell types and biomechanical properties. Innovative translational research is needed in low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) in which the presence of oncogenic mutations in the RAS pathway likely suggest the opportunity to test targeted treatments. To address all these needs this study reports on an elastic polymer, to print a scaffold that mimics tissue relevant stiffness. Introduction of single cell suspensions from LGSOC patient-derived early passage cultures of cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblast form heterocellular spheroids mimicking the growth ratio and spatial organization of the LGSOC TME. The resulting scaffold allows long-term (&#62;40 days) follow-up and targeted compound evaluation confirmed the durable response to a drug combination. The drug-response results from this long-term <i>in vitro <\/i>model are compared with drug responses in an orthotopic LGSOC xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, the stiffness-tunable scaffolds colonized by a three-dimensional LGSOC TME allow long-term drug evaluation and can be considered as a valid alternative to reduce, replace and refine animal models in drug discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Modeling,Preclinical testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Elly De Vlieghere<sup><\/sup>, <b>Olivier De Wever<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ghent University Hospital, Gent, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c10d4706-20dc-42b1-8e05-dad854285c40","ControlNumber":"7340","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

CAR-T cell therapy involves specifically engineering T cells to attack tumor cells by binding a tumor antigen and inducing T cell activation resulting in intracellular signaling and cytokine release. Currently, there are six FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapies, which all target the CD19 or BCMA antigens for hematologic B cell malignancies. In the recent years, a strong focus has been placed on CAR T cell therapy discovery for solid tumors, which may better recapitulate physiological conditions, thereby potentially improving the selection of CAR construct candidates. Immune cell trafficking and immunosuppressive factors within the tumor microenvironment increase the relative difficulty in developing a robust CAR-T cell therapy against solid tumors. Therefore, it is critical to develop novel methodologies for high-throughput phenotypic and functional assays using 3D tumor spheroid models to better assess CAR-T cell therapies against solid tumors. Recently, plate-based image cytometry has emerged as a method to investigate and characterize CAR T cell functions in a high-throughput manner. Image cytometry has demonstrated capabilities in<br \/>analyzing transduction efficiency, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity for CAR T cell therapy. With the development of 3D spheroid models, image cytometry may provide the necessary tools and applications for CAR T cell therapy discovery geared towards solid tumors. In this work, we discuss the use of CAR-T cells targeted towards PSMA, an antigen that is found on prostate cancer tumor cells, the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men worldwide. Herein, we demonstrate the use of high-throughput plate-based image cytometry to characterize PSMA CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxic potency against 3D prostate tumor spheroids and simultaneously monitor location of the T cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. We were able to kinetically evaluate the efficacy and therapeutic value of PSMA CAR-T cells by analyzing the cytotoxicity against prostate tumor spheroids. Furthermore, the T cells are fluorescently labeled with a tracer dye to visually locate the cells on the tumor spheroids. The proposed image cytometry method can overcome limitations placed on traditional methodologies to effectively assess cell-mediated 3D tumor spheroid cytotoxicity and efficiently generate time- and dose-dependent results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Cytotoxicity,3D models,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samir Patel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, David Zurowski<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Hui<sup>2<\/sup>, Mignane Ka<sup>2<\/sup>, Charles Hernandez<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Love<sup>1<\/sup>, Bo Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Moore<sup>2<\/sup>, Leo Li-Ying Chan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Resilience, East Norriton, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c96e3ee1-8097-4d09-9bd4-e061d642c6da","ControlNumber":"2223","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

We used 3-dimentional (3D) <i>in vitro<\/i> human cell models of increasing complexity to investigate resistance to CAR-T cell therapy in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), a disease with poor response to immunotherapy. We identified mucin-1 (MUC1) and TnMUC1 as target antigens in HGSOC omental metastasis and the HGSOC cell lines, OvCAR3 and G164. We then generated CAR-T cells against these targets and tested them in spheroids, collagen gels and microfluidic models. In spheroids, OvCAR3 cells were killed by CAR-T cells whereas, G164 cells were resistant to CAR-T cell cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing suggested that the impaired apoptotic signaling in G164 cells caused malignant cell-intrinsic resistance to CAR-T cell cytotoxicity. Treating G164 spheroids with birinapant, an antagonist of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein, induced CAR-T cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, when resistant cells were co-cultured as spheroids with primary omental fibroblasts from ovarian cancer patients, CAR-T cells were activated and cytotoxic. G164 spheroids cultured in fibroblast-conditioned medium also induced CAR-T cell cytotoxicity due to C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) produced by fibroblasts. CCL2 activated CCR2\/4+ CAR-T cells to induce cytotoxicity in an antigen-dependent manner. We then investigated CAR-T cell migration and cytotoxicity in malignant cell\/fibroblast co-culture collagen gels. CAR-T cell migrated into OvCAR3 gels and were cytotoxic against the malignant cells. However, a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) produced primarily by fibroblasts prevented CAR-T cell migration and cytotoxicity in G164 gels. Treating G164 gels with transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#946;) receptor inhibitor SB431542 reduced ECM content and altered ECM structure, thus stimulating CAR-T cell penetration and restoring cytotoxicity against G164 cells. We also developed an ovarian cancer-on-a-chip model which involved culturing cell-seeded collagen gels in vascularized tri-channel microfluidic devices. CAR-T cells successfully penetrated and killed malignant cells in co-culture collagen gels when delivered through vascularized microfluidic devices. To our knowledge, this is the first report to use microfluidic tumor models to successfully deliver CAR-T cells. Using these different human 3D <i>in vitro<\/i> models, we uncovered malignant cell-intrinsic factors and novel mechanisms involving fibroblasts which may influence CAR-T cell activity.

To authentically comprehend the complex chain of events and even enable new therapeutic approaches in mCRC patients, ex-vivo functional models are an unmet research need.<br \/>Experimental Plan: PROMISE project is combining bioengineering solutions such as bioprinting biomaterials and microfluidics to mimic the tumor microenvironment (TME) of metastatic sites in mCRC. In this project, we are developing a bioprinted hydrogel-based microfluidic device that recapitulates this TME. Then, CTCs are isolated from mCRC patients, cultured, and characterized by microdroplet technology. Those CTCs are then infused on the biodegradable polymer that mimics vascular channels and surrounding stromal cells, through microfluidic connection, in order to mimic CTC-endothelial interactions, study the procedures of extravasation (the invasiveness potential of extravasated patient-derived CTCs into TME) and intravasation (the process of CTCs-derived and biopsy-derived tumor spheroids from the TME to the vascular channel).<br \/>The photopolymerizable hydrogel mimics vascular structures, supporting the growth of HUVEC cells, and is printed in a cost-effective manner (30 minutes) using a semi-direct printing method with visible light. The CROSS chip is used for fast and efficient isolation of CTCs from unprocessed blood of mCRC patients. In parallel, multi-omics of mCRC are done in circulant tumor DNA (ctDNA) and tumor biopsy of mCRC, therefore correlating the phenotypic and genetic profile of the patient cohorts studied.<br \/>A first pilot test has been carried out successfully obtaining blood from mCRc refractory patients, and excellent coordination between the multidisciplinary consortium has been achieved to draw blood from the patient, isolate CTCs and infuse them into the hydrogel. Extravasation and intravasation studies are ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: This multidisciplinary project, which brings together bioengineering, microfluidic, and oncology experts&#8217; teams, is developing a successful ex-vivo, in vitro, and dynamic model that will permit a better study and understanding of the metastatic process in mCRC, from the process of intravasation to extravasation of CTCs, passing thought the better multi-omic characterization of CTCs and ctDNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Ex vivo,Microfluidics,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nadia Saoudi González<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Francesc Salvà Ballabrera<sup>1<\/sup>, Ariadna García<sup>1<\/sup>, Javier Gonzalo-Ruiz<sup>1<\/sup>, Iosune Baraibar<sup>1<\/sup>, Javier Ros<sup>1<\/sup>, Marta Rodriguez<sup>1<\/sup>, María García Díaz<sup>2<\/sup>, Marta Falcó Fusté<sup>2<\/sup>, Melika Parchehbaf Kashani<sup>2<\/sup>, Carlos Honrado<sup>3<\/sup>, Alar Ainla<sup>3<\/sup>, Josep Tabernero<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorena Diéguez<sup>3<\/sup>, Elena Martínez Fraiz<sup>2<\/sup>, Elena Élez<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>VHIO Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), Barcelona, Spain,<sup>3<\/sup>International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL), Braga, Portugal","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d531bb00-3414-41a8-b95b-e59bd6fa8044","ControlNumber":"2903","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;N.

As a high proportion of sarcoma patients presents inherent or acquired chemo-resistance, immune checkpoint inhibitors could represent an alternative for these cases. However, only a small fraction of sarcoma patients seem to respond to immune checkpoint therapy, suggesting the existance of heterogenous immune-suppressive mechanisms across individuals and sarcoma subtypes. Therefore, new strategies to boost the immune system, together with tools predicting which patients could benefit from therapy, are needed for sarcoma patients. There is still a lack of methods that take advantage of benefits, such as low consumption of patient material or reagents, offered by miniaturized <i>in vitro<\/i> analysis systems. In this work, we used a novel multichambered microwell chip for testing personalized immunotherapy on patient-derived sarcoma spheroids. We derived multiple primary sarcoma spheroids from various sarcoma subtypes and grades, which were used to test NK cell cytotoxicity in combination with anti-TIGIT, anti-PD-L1, anti-EGFR treatment. Using this combinatorial strategy, we could boost NK-mediated killing significantly. We analyzed immune cell infiltration in the original tumor and found PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> and TIGIT<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic lymphocytes in both peripheral and central tumor tissues, suggesting that anti-TIGIT and anti-PD-L1 therapy could be appropriate in some sarcoma patients. In addition, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in plasma from sarcoma patients, together with high levels of soluble PVR. This work provides a better understanding of immune surveillance of sarcoma and shows an important implementation of patient-derived spheroids. The miniaturized format allowing long-term cell culture, efficient screening and high-quality imaging of small sample volumes makes this methodology promising for personalized immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microfluidics,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Spheroids,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Valentina Carannante<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Niklas Sandström<sup>1<\/sup>, Karl Olofsson<sup>1<\/sup>, Shi Yong Neo<sup>2<\/sup>, Patrick Albert Sandoz<sup>1<\/sup>, Hanna Van Ooijen<sup>1<\/sup>, Quentin Verron<sup>1<\/sup>, Jacopo Fontana<sup>1<\/sup>, Damien Toullec<sup>1<\/sup>, Elisabeth Moussaud-Lamodière<sup>2<\/sup>, Brinton Seashore-Ludlow<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Frisk<sup>1<\/sup>, Madoka Takai<sup>1<\/sup>, Päivi Östling<sup>2<\/sup>, Felix Haglund<sup>2<\/sup>, Andreas Lundqvist<sup>2<\/sup>, Martin Wiklund<sup>1<\/sup>, Björn Önfelt<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"803b65c9-6f7f-444e-84d8-eb9b71ae7f97","ControlNumber":"3479","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

Despite an aggressive treatment strategy, including surgical resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy, GBM has one of the highest mortality rates among all human tumors. The leading causes of this devastating prognosis are rapid recurrence and therapeutic resistance; current chemo- and immunotherapies fail to control tumor growth and progression. Temozolomide (TMZ) remains the gold standard for GBM treatment since its FDA approval for GBM in 2005. Subsequently, GBM treatment strategy has seen no significant advancement, despite TMZ providing only minimal benefit to most patients. Recent efforts to develop novel therapies for GBM have primarily involved <i>in vivo<\/i> animal models and conventional 2D cell cultures. However, animal models do not allow for elucidating specific interactions between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment (TME), while 2D models fail to depict the complex tumor architecture. <i>In vitro<\/i> biomaterial models offer an opportunity to evaluate aspects of cell-cell and cell-matrix driven responses within the complex TME. Here, we construct and validate a 3D hydrogel platform to evaluate drug response in GBM and to examine the role of TME in drug response, resistance, and local invasion.<br \/>Results: Our model departs from most biomaterial platforms by assessing a wide range of TMZ concentrations and further validating drug response at low doses. Moreover, we use a set of GBM cell lines with defined shifts in TMZ response. These lines are an ideal candidate to model TMZ response &#38; resistance&#8212;a unique set of isogenically matched GBM cells (8MGBA vs. 8MGBA-TMZres; 42MGBA vs. 42MBGA-TMZres). This set exhibits TMZ responsiveness or resistance along with disparate proliferative and invasive patterns. Here, we analyze these cell models in GelMA hydrogels to elucidate mechanisms underlying the acquired TMZ resistance in GBM tumors. We validate our platform by using physiologically relevant TMZ doses, showing the possibility to study TMZ response in 3D at low, physiologically relevant (&#60; 100 &#956;M) concentrations. We determine the growth-rate (GR) inhibition, GR50, IC50, and metabolic activity to benchmark detection limits for acquired TMZ resistance in the engineered GelMA GBM model. Subsequently, we use WT and TMZres variants of 42MGBA and 8MGBA lines to determine the upper and lower bounds of detectable TMZ response in 3D GelMA hydrogels. These quantified shifts in TMZ-induced GR inhibition are a key benchmark for studies of the efficacy of novel therapeutics in patient-derived GBM models. Furthermore, we assess the effect of acquired drug resistance on local invasion of GBM. Ongoing experiments aim to adapt our platform for phenotypic drug screening and target validation of novel small-molecule therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Temozolomide,3D cell culture,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Viktoriia Kriuchkovskaia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Brendan  A.
