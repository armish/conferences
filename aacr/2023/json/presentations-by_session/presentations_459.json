[{"Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to explain a serendipitously discovered next generation sequencing (NGS) artifact. While reviewing clinical cases, we found a case of a large deletion that also contained multiple missense mutations. This phenotype was unknown to several molecular pathologists in our group. We reviewed 46 clinical cases with short insertions or deletions (InDels) (1-30 bases) or FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) (6-183 bases) of solid or hematologic malignancy processed with a clinical NGS assay and identified misaligned reads, ranging from 3 to 100% of reads showing mismapped bases. Reads that straddled the InDel with sufficient numbers of bases on both sides were correctly anchored both upstream and downstream of the InDel, and were called correctly. However, reads that ended in the middle of the InDel were incorrectly mapped onto the deletion, thereby producing artifactual missense mutations. The frequency of mismapped bases increased with InDel size, and the VAF of the InDel can be markedly underestimated. The ratio of forward to reverse reads was commonly skewed for the mismapped base compared to the ratio for the wildtype base at that position. ABRA2 was able to correct 41 to 100% of the reads with mismapped bases and led to absolute increases in the VAF from 1 to 61% along with correction of all of the SBSs except for two cases. Knowledge of the various artifacts commonly seen in next generation sequencing is essential to safely sign out molecular pathology cases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular diagnosis,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Mutation detection,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kelly  E.

Gene expression varies drastically between tumors and within cells of a single tumor. This variability in gene expression can be caused by gene-regulatory mechanisms such as DNA copy number changes, extrachromosomal DNA, or aberrant methylation, amongst many others. These mechanisms sometimes generate extreme outliers: transcripts that show atypically high or low gene expression in a small percentage of cancers. These outliers increase the molecular and phenotypic diversity between individuals, contributing to tumor heterogeneity. Gene expression in cancer has been well studied with many reports of differential gene expression patterns between specific cancer types or subtypes. Importantly, many of these differences were strongly associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. For example, the <i>BCR-ABL<\/i> fusion was discovered in chronic myeloid leukemia with drugs targeting this fusion gene dramatically increasing the survival rate. The <i>EML-ALK<\/i> fusion gene is another example of a gene-expression outlier and drug target. It occurs in about 4% of non-small-cell lung carcinomas and has been routinely screened for. These examples demonstrate the critical role gene expression outliers play in cancer progression and highlight their potential as biomarkers for diagnostics and identifying novel drug targets. Despite their importance, there has not yet been a comprehensive pan-cancer study of gene expression outliers and their general properties. We lack the answers to fundamental questions such as how many outliers exist in a typical tumor, whether this differs across cancer types, what mechanisms generate the most outliers, whether specific clinical or somatic mutational features correlate with the number or type of outliers, and how many recurrent outliers exist. To answer these questions, we performed a comprehensive and systematic analysis of cancer gene-expression outliers using molecular data from multiple cancer genomics projects. We have created a new statistical outlier detection method and applied it to transcriptomics and proteomics data across 33 cancer types. We used this resource to describe the fundamental landscape of gene-expression outliers, including the most likely genetic and epigenetic mechanisms driving them. The resulting outliers will be further studied for their impact on cancer progression and validated hits will serve as clinically relevant biomarkers and targets for future functional and therapeutic investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Gene expression,Statistical approach,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jee Yun Han<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Stefan Eng<sup><\/sup>, Jaron Arbet<sup><\/sup>, Paul Boutros<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UCLA - University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4910dd5c-10de-4350-894e-e63b3cbbf668","ControlNumber":"1543","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

To screen out BCs with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), germline mutations in BRCA genes have been tested, which constitute approximately 5% of unselected BC patients. However, a substantial proportion of BCs show HRD phenotypes despite the absence of BRCA inactivating mutations in germline. Herein, we apply whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) in 332 samples from 325 BC patients for characterizing their HRD phenotypes for PARPi treatments. Of 325 BC patients, 75 cases (23.1%) showed remarkable HRD phenotypes, based on mutational signatures of HRR abrogation. Intriguingly, 51 cases do not harbor any germline mutations in HR-related genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2. The whole-genome portrait of these samples was similar to that of HRD-positive BCs with germline mutation in HRR pathway, but showed markedly distinctive features from HRD-negative BCs. With a notable exception of BRCA1, the second most common somatic mutation in HRD-positive BCs without germline mutation, the mutational landscape of the whole study samples was primarily determined by hormone receptor and HER2 positivity, not by HRD status. Likewise, WTS-based clusters determined in an unsupervised manner were highly dependent on the histological subtype of BC, not on HRD status or germline mutations in the HRR pathway. Notably, differentially expressed gene and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that HRD-positive BCs had an increased inflammatory activity compared to BCs with proficient HR. Overall, our analysis demonstrate that WGS enables better classification of the HR status in BC than conventional BRCA germline testing, suggesting WGS as a rapid and sensitive tool for screening breast cancers for PARPi treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Breast cancer,Sequencing,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryul Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Seongyeol Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Joonoh Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Boram Yi<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaemo Koo<sup>1<\/sup>, Sangmoon Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeong Seok Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Yeon Hee Park<sup>3<\/sup>, Young Seok Ju<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>GENOME INSIGHT Inc, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>GENOME INSIGHT Inc, San Diego, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"23742521-a075-401e-936d-8711ef7a4924","ControlNumber":"7969","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

A functional assessment of the genomic instability associated with HRD is critical as more than half of HRD positive tumors do not have a known causative mutation. Genomic instability is commonly achieved through assessment of three characteristic genomic scars: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), Telomeric Allelic Imbalance (TAI), &#38; Large-Scale State Transitions (LST) but is challenging due to the need for robust detection of copy number and allelic events genome-wide.

The software is uniquely capable to profile solid tumors from pan-cancer sequencing panels, such as the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500) panel, by employing a dynamic binning approach of sequencing data to detect copy number variant (CNV) and LOH events. OGM can detect additional classes of structural rearrangements missed by other technologies to provide new insights into genomic instability. In this study, tumor samples were run on multiple technologies and analyzed in VIA to provide a measurement of the genomic scars. A comparative analysis of each technology&#8217;s performance to detect genomic instability through a standardized analytical approach will be described to provide insight into the most effective technologies to assess HRD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,Cancer genomics,Genomic instability,Profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel Saul<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Megan Roytman<sup><\/sup>, Viren Wasnikar<sup><\/sup>, Rachel Burnside<sup><\/sup>, Alex Hastie<sup><\/sup>, Alka Chaubey<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Bionano Genomics, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4fa3f9cd-5375-4609-9bf1-0e81fb133f19","ControlNumber":"7825","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

This level of resolution allows for a clearer understanding of specific cellular functions, tissue complexity, and is a powerful tool to discover therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers. A current limitation of scRNA-seq is the requirement to isolate viable cells from fresh or cryopreserved solid tumor biopsies, especially given that formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) material are ubiquitously utilized for long-term tissue preservation. Though formalin fixation preserves samples for extended periods of time, it also fragments genetic material, which introduces challenges for many RNA-seq methods due to the reduced size of template material. 10x Genomics recently launched the Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling kit, a probe-based solution for scRNA-seq from fixed cells that enables the detection of &#62;18,000 genes. Herein, this study describes and characterizes the utilization of prepared single cells from FFPE tissue sections to establish sample requirements, key quality control (QC) metrics, and reproducibility of a robust single cell fixed RNA profiling kit for FFPE tissues. To accomplish this, FFPE blocks from breast, lung, ovary, and testes varying in age and quality (i.e., DV200) were sectioned to either 25 or 50 &#181;m for processing. One or two FFPE tissue curls per sample were dissociated into single cell suspensions using the Miltenyi FFPE Tissue Dissociation Kit, processed through the Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling workflow, sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq, and analyzed by Cell Ranger 7.0.1. All samples yielded sufficient cells for probe hybridization and for targeting the capture of 10,000 cells. The total number of genes detected was highly reproducible between replicates and ranged between 14,000 and 18,000 per tissue type, indicating robustness of the workflow across tissues. Notably, DV200 scores were observed to strongly correlate with key QC metrics, specifically cell capture efficiency and RNA species diversity. While FFPE curl number and size input variables were found to have no significant impact on QC metrics, the effect of DV200 was observed within each tissue type, indicating a strong driver of metric variability. These combined findings support the use of the 10x Genomics Fixed RNA Profiling workflow to obtain high quality single cell gene expression data from FFPE tissues. These data also demonstrate that meaningful gene expression data is produced by multiple tissue types and input amounts, but samples with the highest DV200 produce the most robust data. Workflow optimizations focused on reduction of required tissue input to maintain reproducible cell population characterizations will be crucial for facilitating the interrogation of tumor FFPE samples with limited material availability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Genomics,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Adam  J.

The template damage of RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material results in 5&#8217; information loss. The hemoglobin mRNA content of blood-derived RNA necessitates a separate globin depletion step. Additionally, poly(A) enrichment results in a loss of a substantial proportion of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are of growing interest as cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Total RNA sequencing, where highly abundant, uninformative RNAs are specifically depleted, is more appropriate for these samples and applications, but traditional approaches are both labor- and time-intensive. To address this need, we developed a simple, rapid total RNA sequencing library preparation solution that improves data quality for the clinical and translational oncology space.We improved upon existing RNA depletion methods by modifying the chemistry of probe hybridization to enable a simplified workflow while also reducing unintended damage to non-targeted RNA. A reverse transcriptase was specifically engineered to improve the conversion of RNA to cDNA - a traditional bottleneck for RNA library preparation complexity. A novel FFPE decrosslinking step was implemented that may increase the amount of RNA available for downstream processing. Cleanup steps were minimized to reduce handling time and sample loss, and enzymatic steps were combined and shortened to simplify the overall workflow. Performance was assessed with RNA extracted from whole blood and multiple independent FFPE blocks of varying qualities as measured by DV200. Results highlight improved sequencing economy and increased gene detection sensitivity with low input and degraded samples. Highly concordant gene expression profiles were observed across a wide range of RNA input amounts, and data show excellent correlation between matched fresh frozen and FFPE samples. Lastly, gene fusions were accurately and confidently identified from an FFPE fusion control sample utilizing a whole transcriptome, non-targeted, approach.This work demonstrates the utility of a total RNA sequencing approach for oncology-relevant sample types, as well as the ability to improve on both workflow and data quality in a single library preparation solution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA-seq,Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),Gene expression,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Travis Sanders<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, David Gelagay<sup>1<\/sup>, Deelan Doolabh<sup>2<\/sup>, Lee French<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Pavlica<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Walker<sup>1<\/sup>, Clara Ross<sup>1<\/sup>, Kailee Reed<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Harrison<sup>1<\/sup>, Ross Wadsworth<sup>2<\/sup>, Eric van der Walt<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian Kudlow<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Watchmaker Genomics, Boulder, CO,<sup>2<\/sup>Watchmaker Genomics, Cape Town, South Africa","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b45b5754-7d0e-4fe6-b357-ef7f129af0b9","ControlNumber":"6891","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

DNA from these samples was sequenced on the PacBio Sequel II System to a target depth of 25x. HiFi reads were processed using the PacBio Human WGS Workflow. Methylation prediction was made from Primrose and 5mC modification probability of CpG sites were computed by pb-CpG-tools. We then assessed phased CpG methylation in known imprinted genes.We found that lrSeq detected translocations in 6 out of 6 cases, providing precise break ends and often clarifying unclear cytogenetic findings (such as partner genes). HiFi sequencing also detected 3 of 3 sequence alterations in CEBPA and TP53; biallelic deletion of CDKN2A; and known regions with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 2 out of 2 cases. However, it had difficulty detecting all amplified regions of chromosome 12 in the case of NBL, such as the one containing MDM2. Finally, we were able to detect methylation differences in a phased manner by parental haplotype in known imprinting regions across the genome. The difference in 5mC modification probability between the two alleles of the known imprinted genes was 81.5. Our results demonstrate that lrSeq can detect multiple CRGAs across several different types of genetic variants and pediatric cancers, bringing us closer to the promise of an all-in-one genetic test for cancer characterization.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sequencing,Cancer diagnostics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Byunggil Yoo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Warren Cheung<sup>1<\/sup>, Irina Pushel<sup>1<\/sup>, Lisa Lansdon<sup>2<\/sup>, Chengpeng Bi<sup>1<\/sup>, Erin Guest<sup>3<\/sup>, Tomi Pastinen<sup>1<\/sup>, Midhat Farooqi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Genomic Medicine Center, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City, MO,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Medicine, University of Missouri - Kansas City, Kansas City, MO,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"13193495-332d-4a44-8509-feffae86e3cd","ControlNumber":"8043","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

The combined analysis offers additional information that is potentially critical for personalized clinical decision making.<br \/>\u0009We retrospectively reviewed 2 sarcoma cohorts that received the TPT, MG (n=21) and MD (n=40) (Table 1), and evaluated reported events that were not previously identified by institute respective targeted panels. A total of 19 (MG) and 23 (MD) additional clinically-relevant SNV\/indels, CNAs, and fusions were identified by the TPT, including an amplification of EZH2, 2 novel fusions with MDM2 as a binding partner, and a known diagnostic fusion, NAB2-STAT6. A high TMB was observed in 5 patients. MSI was stable for all patients. HLA class I loss of heterozygosity was found in 7 patients. In both cohorts, we observed significant changes in the expression of potentially targetable genes, with 81% of patients presenting with increased expression of such targets. Transcriptomic-based tumor microenvironment (TME) classification found that 51% and 49% of patients had an Immune-Enriched (IE) subtype (predicted favorable IO treatment outcomes) and Fibrotic\/Desert (F\/D) subtypes (predicted poor response to IO treatment), respectively. Predicted response to IO therapy through TME subtyping agreed with previous reports, as angiosarcomas were enriched in the IE subtype (83%), and bone sarcomas were enriched in the F (30%) compared to the IE (6%) subtype. Further, these results supported matching patients with biomarker-driven clinical trials at their respective centers.<br \/>\u0009In summary, the TPT identified more clinically-relevant biomarkers compared to respective institute targeted gene panels, highlighting the potential value of comprehensive molecular profiling for patients with highly heterogeneous diseases, such as sarcoma, to support personalized treatment decisions.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{C455B06A-8179-486A-9A62-9063C15E525A}\"><caption>Table 1.

Although the majority of current liquid biopsy techniques focus on DNA from blood, DNA from urine also conveys important genetic information from the human body. Studies have revealed that urine cfDNA can potentially be utilized for bladder cancer detection and monitoring. Urine samples can be quickly and painlessly collected; however, because urine DNA is readily damaged, maintaining high-quality cfDNA in urine is challenging. In this study, we developed a robust and user-friendly urine preservation method to maintain integrity of cfDNA in urine and to facilitate the transportation of urinary samples to clinical laboratories.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Urine samples from 10 donors were collected with Predicine&#8217;s proprietary urine preservation method. Two urine samples were spiked with BL21(DE3) E.coli competent cells to simulate the urinary tract infection. All samples were incubated at 4&#176;C, room temperature, and 37&#176;C to mimic extreme storage or transporting environments. cfDNA was extracted after incubation of 0, 4, and 7 days and measured by Qubit and Fragment analyzer. Extracted DNA was also quantified by ddPCR with two markers: EGFR as an endogenous DNA marker and ARv7 (synthetic oligos containing intron-deleted sequence, post-incubation spike-in) as an inner control for the extraction and detection assays. Whole-genome sequencing was conducted to measure the quality of the cfDNA and bacterial contamination. Other commercial urine preserve buffers are used as control.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: cfDNA derived from urine stored in Predicine&#8217;s proprietary urine preservation buffer remained stable till day 7 at different temperatures.

Illumina's TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500) Comprehensive Assay employs a hybrid-capture approach for target enrichment of 523 clinically relevant cancer genes to enable detection of small variants (SNVs, insertions, and deletions), CNV (copy number variations), TMB (tumor mutational burden), and MSI (microsatellite instability) in DNA and detection of fusions and splice variants in RNA. Briefly, purified DNA and RNA were sheared to the desired length by sonication or heat mediated fragmentation. Fragmented DNA and cDNA then underwent end repair and adapter incorporation, followed by target sequence capture, amplification, and purification using a bead-based approach. The enriched libraries were then pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing data (&#8805; 80M paired-end reads for DNA and &#8805; 16 M paired-end reads for RNA) was analyzed using Illumina Primary Analysis pipeline and custom scripts developed for validation data analysis.To characterize the analytical performance of variant detection using the TSO500 Comprehensive Assay following guidelines established by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and College of American Pathologists (CAP), we utilized various commercially available reference standards and over 59 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, characterized by selected comparator testing methods. The comparator methods were as follows: for DNA small variants, the QCCP (Q2 Solutions Comprehensive Cancer Panel) NGS assay; for CNV, the NanoString nCounter Cancer Copy Number Assay; and for RNA fusions and splice variants, the TruSeq RNA Exome assay. Variant calls for orthogonal assays were manually curated during review by the Medical Director at Q2 Solutions. Analytical sensitivity, accuracy, precision, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were evaluated using both reference standards and clinical FFPE samples. We observed 95% sensitivity, &#62; 99.99% accuracy and specificity as well as &#62; 99.5% PPV for detecting small DNA variants with variant allele frequency (VAF) above 4.5%. The intra-run and inter-run precision for SNV, insertions\/deletions were 99.54% and 99.52%, respectively. Additionally, we observed &#62; 98% accuracy for CNV. The sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, and PPV for fusion and splice variant detection were 94.64%, 99.93%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Robustness of input studies revealed comparable coverage depth and uniformity can be achieved with varying DNA and RNA input (30, 40, and 60 ng). In conclusion, the TSO500 Comprehensive Assay enables robust detection of variants and other clinically relevant biomarkers in FFPE samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Tumor mutational burden,Microsatellite instability,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xinyan Li<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lauren Frady<sup><\/sup>, Juliana Feltz<sup><\/sup>, Hiba Shaban<sup><\/sup>, Jennifer Sims<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Q Squared Solutions, Durham, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4988f28c-aae1-4c3c-9ab7-e1373386b113","ControlNumber":"7590","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Many gene fusion events have been classified as clinically-relevant and are targets for both diagnostic applications, such as TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate cancer, and therapeutic applications, such as CD74-ROS1 and EML4-ALK in non-small cell lung cancer. Given the potential clinical benefits of early detection, there is significant interest in developing highly sensitive and accurate diagnostic assays to detect cancer using these gene fusions as biomarkers. A significant barrier to the development of these diagnostic assays is the lack of a reliable and renewable sample source harboring gene fusions of interest for use in assay development and analytical validation.<br \/>Here, we describe the development and performance of a new fusion reference material: the Twist Pan-cancer RNA Fusion Control, a highly-multiplexed positive control designed to be spiked into a selected RNA background or as a stand-alone positive control. The Twist Pan-cancer RNA Fusion Control provides a wide selection of 80+ common and curated cancer targets for analytical validation and assay development. The synthetic RNAs are designed centered around the known and documented fusion sites with 750 nt of RNA 5&#8242;- of and 3&#8242;- of the fusion junction, suitable for short read sequencing and qPCR experiments. Pooled synthetic fusion RNAs are quantified at known molar ratios, NGS QC&#8217;d for uniformity, and ddPCR&#8217;d to establish a highly precise pool concentration. Finally, in fusion detection NGS experiments, we observe over a 95% recall rate of fusion events.<br \/>The Pan-cancer RNA Fusion Control is designed to serve as a spike-in or stand-alone positive control and specifically pairs well with a clinically-relevant target enrichment (TE) panel within the Twist Targeted Enrichment for Gene Expression solution. This control sample positive for RNA fusions can be applied in both qPCR and NGS workflows to validate panel\/probe sets, establish limits of detection, and monitor ongoing assay performance. The Twist Pan-cancer RNA Fusion Control provides a valuable one-stop solution to assay developers seeking reference materials for a wide array of cancer-associated fusion transcripts.<br \/>For Research Use Only.

Pathogen recognition and clearance is ensured by a process called V(D)J recombination, during which a T cell obtains a unique set of V, D and J gene segments for all the chains (&#945; and &#946; or &#947; and &#948;) that make up its T cell receptor (TCR). Each recombined TCR detects a specific disease-associated antigen peptide, which triggers the appropriate adaptive immune response.<br \/>Understanding the relationship between TCR sequences (clonotypes) and T cell activation during disease pathogenesis and progression can assist in the development of next-generation therapeutics with more favorable and sustainable outcomes. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing allowed for simultaneous profiling of TCRs and full transcriptomes leading to the characterization of key T cell populations with pathogen recognition and disease clearance capabilities. Despite their success, these methods rely on microfluidics devices or plate-based protocols with limited sensitivity and throughput (1,000s-10,000s of cells) making the study of disease-relevant T cells time consuming and costly.<br \/>To overcome these limitations, we have extended our split pool combinatorial barcoding technology to simultaneously characterize the TCRs alongside the full transcriptomes of up to 1 million T cells. As a proof of concept experiment, we applied our method to primary T cells from 8 healthy human donors to characterize their TCR diversity. From the 920,000 T cells assayed we were able to recover TCR sequences from at least one chain in 88% of T cells (807,000 cells) and detected hundreds of thousands of unique alpha and beta chains across all donors. Furthermore we found that most of these chains represent rare clonotypes found in 1 or 2 cells. Lastly, we performed transcriptome-based clustering analyses to identify all major T cell subsets and discovered donor and subset-specific hyper-expanded clonotypes that could help us reconstruct each donor&#8217;s recent history of infection.<br \/>In summary, we report on the extension of our highly flexible and scalable combinatorial barcoding technology to allow researchers to profile up to 1 million of T cells in a single experiment and investigate their functional responses during infection, cancer, autoimmunity, or therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,High-throughput assay,T cell repertoire,single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Efthymia Papalexi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Grace Kim<sup><\/sup>, Bryan Hariadi<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Schroeder<sup><\/sup>, Peter Matulich<sup><\/sup>, Vuong Tran<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Diaz<sup><\/sup>, Charles Roco<sup><\/sup>, Alexander Rosenberg<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Parse Biosciences, Inc., Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"faad3727-f88b-4d3a-a629-6aaaa5f57a32","ControlNumber":"3109","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

FFPE DNA poses many notable challenges for preparing NGS libraries, including low input amounts and highly variable damage from fixation, storage, and extraction methods. Due to the high cost of sequencing and variability of coverage, regions of interest are often specifically enriched using hybrid capture-based approaches, but these methods require a high input of diverse, uniform DNA library to achieve the coverage required for somatic mutation identification in tumor samples. We developed a new DNA repair enzyme mix, enzymatic fragmentation mix, and library amplification PCR master mix, optimizing the activities of these mixes using FFPE samples ranging from DIN 1.8 to 6.8 to maximize yield, WGS library quality, and target enrichment library performance. Combining DNA damage repair and a novel enzymatic fragmentation mix upstream of library preparation reduced the false positive rate in somatic variant detection by repairing damage-derived mutations, and also improved the library yield, quality metrics (including mapping, chimeras, and properly-paired reads), complexity, coverage uniformity, and hybrid capture library quality metrics. The new PCR master mix boosts the library yield without compromising library quality in FFPE-derived samples, allowing flexibility in the PCR cycles used to accommodate high-throughput processing of FFPE samples of highly varied quality. This library prep workflow was evaluated with multiple sequencing platforms including Illumina, MGI, and Element Biosciences.<b> <\/b>This new suite of enzyme mixes allows even highly damaged FFPE samples to achieve high-quality libraries with sufficient input for hybrid capture.

Drugs approved for first- and second-line therapy extend survival by only several months. Hence, there is still a pressing need for new and effective treatments. Sequencing technologies applied to human HCC tissues have identified hundreds of genes that undergo amplification and that may be correlated with mortality. Nevertheless, correlation does not equate to functionality. We aim to annotate gene function by employing an innovative approach with Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and catalytically dead version of CRISPR-associated endonuclease (dCas9) in a CRISPR\/dCas9 activation (CRISPRa) screen to identify driver genes of HCC tumorigenesis in mice. We deliver to the liver&#8217;s hepatocytes a gRNA library targeting genes of interest on plasmids that contain: (1) a transposon system for stable integration of DNA sequences into the cell genome, (2) <i>Myc<\/i> to drive hyperproliferation, as MYC is frequently over-expressed in human HCC, (3) synergistic activation mediator complex sequences for transcriptional activation of target genes, and (4) the gRNA sequence, the only variable sequence in the library. Using datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified 51 genes that are both enriched and amplified in HCC patients. We included gRNAs targeting <i>Tert<\/i>, <i>Vegfa<\/i>, and <i>Ccnd1<\/i>, as control genes with known roles in driving HCC. In total, the screening library contained 290 gRNAs targeting 51 genes and 3 controls. After delivery of the plasmid library to the liver, the <i>Myc<\/i> gene provided a baseline level of oncogenic hyperproliferation, and the readout was gRNA prevalence pre- and post-proliferation via next-generation sequencing. We found that the combination of <i>Myc<\/i> and CRISPRa gRNA library led to a large number of expansive tumors in the liver as compared to <i>Myc<\/i> or the CRISPRa gRNA library only, which contained few to no tumors. gRNAs targeting control genes <i>Ccnd1<\/i> and <i>Vegfa<\/i> were enriched as expected, validating our approach to annotate gene function during tumorigenesis. Additionally, we identified enrichment in gRNAs targeting genes <i>Zbtb7b<\/i>, <i>Vps72<\/i>, and <i>Gba<\/i> in multiple tumors, implicating a role in liver tumorigenesis. <i>ZBTB7B<\/i> and <i>GBA<\/i> expression levels are increased in patients with HCC recurrence as compared to patients in remission (data from BIOSTORM trial), while <i>VPS72<\/i> is an unfavorable prognostic marker for HCC (data from The Human Protein Atlas). In this study, we have established a novel model of liver cancer that combines the <i>Myc<\/i> oncogene with a CRISPRa gRNA library to annotate driver genes in human HCC. Additionally, we identified several promising targets for the treatment of HCC. Ultimately, this study has the potential to impact on the care of patients with HCC in the US and worldwide.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,CRISPR\/dCas9,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexandra Mariel Vázquez Salgado<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shirui He<sup>2<\/sup>, Kirk  J.

In some instances, somatically mutated driver genes such as KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors specific for mutant oncoproteins. In other cases therapeutic vulnerability is an indirect consequence, such as response to immune checkpoint inhibitors caused by somatic inactivation of mismatch repair genes and subsequent creation of neo-antigens in tumors. Synthetic lethal vulnerabilities dependent on common somatic alterations would be highly specific therapeutic targets applicable to a large number of cancer patients. We sought to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for colon cancer by performing a genome wide CRISPR knockout screen in a colon cancer organoid in both TP53-Wild-Type and TP53-Knockout backgrounds. We identified 1784 gene knockouts with TP53-dependent effects on Darwinian fitness. Examples include MDM2 and PPM1D knockouts, both of which selectively harmed the TP53 WT organoids. 250 gene knockouts selectively harmed the TP53 KO organoids and represent novel avenues for development of TP53 synthetic lethal targeted therapeutics. We also identified ~1000 gene knockouts under significant negative Darwinian selection in both TP53 WT and TP53 KO organoids which are not known to be common essential genes. Several of these organoid model specific vulnerabilities are in pathways that are downstream of the somatic mutations present in the tumor and are therefore candidates for highly-specific targeted therapeutic intervention. Examples include Werner&#8217;s pathway dependencies (WRN, EME1, MUS81) which are known to result from mismatch repair deficiency, WNT pathway dependencies (CTNNB1, PORCN) which result from RNF43 inactivating somatic mutation, and BRAF dependency resulting from its own activating oncogenic somatic mutation. In summary, genome-wide CRISPR knockout library screening of human colon cancer organoids can provide a comprehensive overview of dependencies interacting with either natural or engineered mutations and are a promising novel platform for discovering personalized or pathway based therapeutic targets. Future work will focus on target validation and additional primary screens using our biobank of tumor-normal organoid pairs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Organoids,TP53,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Phillip J.

Common methods for this enrichment step include fluorescence activated cell sorting and positive or negative selection with magnetic beads. However, these methods alter native cell phenotypes during the enrichment process by the application of pressure, binding of antibodies, extensive manipulation and centrifugation, among other perturbations. This results in altered gene expression, generating molecular profiles that are not representative of true biological significance. These alterations are prevented by using magnetic levitation cell isolation and enrichment. The LeviCell<sup>TM<\/sup> platform performs hands-free cell enrichment by utilizing magnetic fields to levitate viable, healthy cells away from dead cells and debris. Unlike other single cell separation methods, the enriched target cells are not subject to mechanical force, labeling, or staining to achieve viability enrichment. This results in a single cell suspension that is ready for immediate downstream analysis, producing molecular profiles free of isolation-induced gene expression artifacts.<br \/>We have developed reagents to extend the benefits of this technology to the immuno-oncology research market. These new reagents are used to target the enrichment of all T cells, the CD4+ or CD8+ subsets of T cells, or all B cells, with other target populations in development. In all cases, unwanted cells are captured within the levitation chamber, depleting them from the sample. These reagents leverage the magnetic field across the levitation chamber. Specifically-tagged, unwanted cells are pulled to the edges of the levitation chamber while the target cells undergo viable cell enrichment. The end result is a cell population that has been enriched and at higher viability. We have seen consistent depletion rates of &#62;98%, resulting in a final targeted population with 90% or higher purity in most cases. Here we demonstrate the performance of the LeviCell platform in the enrichment of targeted cell populations relevant to the immuno-oncology research community.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Gene expression profiling,Sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kevin Travers<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nathan Wilson<sup><\/sup>, Abhijit Kale<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>LevitasBio, Menlo Park, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"444f697b-a5b6-4596-b6c8-87c7add80936","ControlNumber":"8097","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Most tests analyze genomic DNA to detect genomic alterations in a few hundred genes. RNA panels have advantages over DNA panels when detecting fusion and exon skipping events.<br \/>Methods: Between April 2017 and March 2022, non-small cell lung cancer samples were analyzed by Todai OncoPanel (TOP), a dual targeted DNA\/RNA panel with matched tumor\/normal pair analysis. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Publicly available genomic data from approved panels in Japan, all of which are DNA-only panels, was downloaded from the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) database on 2022\/11\/3.<br \/>Results: Sixty-one samples were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 62, and 35 were men. The histology of the samples included 52 adenocarcinoma and 9 squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 52 adenocarcinoma samples, pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were detected in 46 (88%), and 40 samples (77%) harbored potentially druggable targets. With the DNA panel, 23 (44%) <i>TP53<\/i> loss-of-function mutations, 17 (33%) <i>EGFR<\/i> activating mutations, 6 (12%) <i>ERBB2<\/i> activating mutations, 5 (10%) <i>KRAS<\/i> activating mutations, 5 (10%) <i>RB1<\/i> loss-of-function mutations, 3 (6%) <i>BRAF<\/i> activating mutations, and 3 (6%) <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 splice site mutation were detected. Meanwhile, with the RNA panel, three <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping and 15 fusion genes in 16 patients (16\/61 = 26%) were detected, all in adenocarcinoma. Specifically, <i>EML4-ALK<\/i>, <i>KIF5B-RET<\/i>, and <i>CD47-MET<\/i> were detected from one sample each, and 12 others were all novel fusions with unknown pathogenicity. Overall, 5 out of 61 (8.1%) non-small cell lung cancer samples harbored <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping or fusion. Using the C-CAT database, 37 <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 splice site mutations and 2 rearrangements were found in 1,514 non-small cell lung cancer samples (2.6%) from the C-CAT database (p = 0.009). One <i>BRCA1<\/i> and one <i>BRCA2<\/i> pathogenic germline variants were detected from the TOP germline panel.<br \/>Conclusion: Analysis of non-small cell lung cancer using TOP led to detection of a high percentage of druggable targets. TOP RNA panel may detect <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping and fusions at higher sensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Lung cancer: non-small cell,RNA sequencing,Cancer diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hidenori Kage<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shinji Kohsaka<sup>2<\/sup>, Kenji Tatsuno<sup>3<\/sup>, Aya Shinozaki-Ushiku<sup>4<\/sup>, Hideaki Isago<sup>5<\/sup>, Kousuke Watanabe<sup>5<\/sup>, Motohiro Kato<sup>1<\/sup>, Tetsuo Ushiku<sup>6<\/sup>, Kiyoshi Miyagawa<sup>7<\/sup>, Takahide Nagase<sup>8<\/sup>, Jun Nakajima<sup>9<\/sup>, Hiroyuki Aburatani<sup>3<\/sup>, Hiroyuki Mano<sup>2<\/sup>, Katsutoshi Oda<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Next-Generation Precision Medicine Development Laboratory, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Division of Cellular Signaling, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Genome Science and Medicine Laboratory, RCAST, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Integrative Genomics, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Clinical Laboratory, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Pathology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Laboratory of Molecular Radiology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Surgery, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"50c88731-af2e-43a2-8998-23303100ea50","ControlNumber":"2609","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

To gain more insights into AMG 510 therapeutic mechanisms, herein we carried out a genome-scale CRISPR Cas9 knock-out screen in a KRAS G12C-harboring NCI-H2122 xenograft model. We first generated a stable NCI-H2122 cell line overexpressing Cas9 and confirmed its Cas9 editing efficiency by a BFP-GFP dual reporter system. Referring to our previous study for <i>in vivo <\/i>subcutaneous xenograft growth and response to AMG 510 treatment of NCI-H2122 cell line in immunodeficient mice, we decided to conduct the <i>in vivo <\/i>screens using 10M cell inoculation each mouse.

Individuals with HLRCC are also at risk of developing an aggressive form of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as 15-20% of patients develop type 2 papillary RCC associated with poor prognosis. Although RCC risk and cancer penetrance of this condition has been studied, whole genome sequencing of associated tumors has yet to be examined, and the landscape of structural variants of HLRCC is largely unknown. We have therefore performed whole genome sequencing of tumor\/normal pairs of HLRCC patients to study the tumor molecular architecture in this form of RCC. Through germline variant and somatic mutation calling, we have identified specific somatic mutational drivers, including those at the structural variant level for the first time in HLRCC. We have also quantified both chromothripsis and kataegis in these tumors, identifying the specific role of localized hypermutational events. Similarly, using tumour subclonal reconstruction techniques, we have inferred the clonality of HLRCC-associated RCC tumors and elucidate the relative timing of key oncogenic events and mutational processes. We also compare each of these mutational features to their equivalents in other RCC tumour subtypes. These studies shed key light on the specific mutational processes and drivers of this rare hereditary malignancy and on its lethality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Kidney cancer,Whole genome sequencing,HLRCC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Selina Wu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Paul  C.

The implementation of sample preparation automation is limited by several factors &#8212; complicated protocols and long incubation times. As an industry first, Avida&#8217;s Point-n-Seq&#8482; hybridization-based targeted sequencing kit solution features 1 hr hybridization time and PCR free capture which enables full automation on a broad range of open platform liquid handlers, from the economical Opentrons (OT-2) to the high throughput Hamilton (Microlab Star).<br \/>We report a walk-away targeted sequencing sample-prep solution based on the highly efficient chemistry of our Point-n-Seq technology. This strategy supports PCR-free capture for variant detection. A sequencing-ready captured library is prepared in 6 hours, with just 25 minutes of hands-on time. More importantly, a PCR-free protocol increases sequence uniformity, decreases amplicon bias as well as GC-bias, and eliminates the need for purification and quantification before capture. We have demonstrated the feasibility of automated workflows using 40 ng of genomic DNA with panel sizes ranging from 20 Kb to 2 Mb. Using a comprehensive oncology panel containing 500 genes to analyze Horizon oncology cfDNA (30 ng) or FFPE gDNA (40 ng) reference standards, we demonstrated reliable detection of SNV and structural variations with allele frequency matching the expected values.The Point-n-Seq technology enables fully automated targeted sequencing sample prep on open platform liquid handlers, enhancing accuracy and reliability while reducing hands-on time. The one hour hybridization time makes hybridization more economical on the liquid handler when compared to off-instrument for overnight\/longer hybridization. This automated solution greatly accelerates the development of fast, simple, and accurate genomic profiling assays. Furthermore, Point-n-Seq targeted methylation sequencing and targeted RNA assays can also be easily adapted to the same automation platforms for research and clinical applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Molecular profiling,Mutation detection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ashraf Wahba<sup>1<\/sup>, Yun Bao<sup>1<\/sup>, Heng Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Kinnari Watson<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Grace Q.

Genome assemblies generated from long read sequencing support the genomic diversity reported by Yao-Cheng et.al, though the specific copy number variants are distinct from those previously reported. Assembled genomes and transcriptomes for these specific lots of HEK293 cells will be available at NCBI. Given the plastic nature of HEK293 cells, we recommend confirmation of genomic and transcriptomic structure of the specific cells in use before and after intervention.<br \/>[1] Lin, Yao-Cheng, Morgane Boone, Leander Meuris, Irma Lemmens, Nadine Van Roy, Arne Soete, Joke Reumers, et al. &#8220;Genome Dynamics of the Human Embryonic Kidney 293 Lineage in Response to Cell Biology Manipulations.&#8221; Nature Communications 5, no. 1 (September 3, 2014): 4767. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/ncomms5767.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sequencing,Cell lines,RNA sequencing,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Laura Blum<sup><\/sup>, Brittany Sexton<sup><\/sup>, Jonathan  C.

Adenocarcinoma of the lung usually evolves from the mucosal glands and represents about 40% of all lung cancers. A significant proportion of lung adenocarcinoma patients present alterations in oncogenic driver genes. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) allows the sequencing of several genomic regions in a single test. There are multiple NGS approaches including Targeted Panel Sequencing (TPS), Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Methods: The detection of actionable genomic mutations in 60 lung adenocarcinoma surgical specimens was evaluated through two NGS approaches TPS and WGS. TPS was performed using the Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) TPS consisting of 75 total genes, with a total coverage of 1.92Mb (exon 0.69Mb, intron 1.23Mb). WGS was performed using Illumina&#8217;s NovaSeq 6000 platform and data were processed with BWA and variant callers including Mutect2 and Delly. Functional mutations were determined by Ensembl VEP, while putative driver mutations were identified via the Genome Insight pipeline (San Diego).Results: A total of 120 driver mutations were detected by TPS. WGS identified 114 out of the 120 driver mutations (95% match). An additional 9 driver mutations were detected by WGS, along with thousands of additional non-driver mutations. (Table 1)Conclusion: An NGS-based approach allows for the identification of actionable molecular changes which leads to more informed clinical decision making. These results validate that Genome Insight&#8217;s WGS workflow and pipeline are comparable to TPS in detecting key driver mutations. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that WGS provides a more comprehensive genetic characterization of lung cancer, which may impact the therapeutic options and patients&#8217; prognosis.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{ECCADDE4-2C9F-46F5-AFF1-F6FE0F724064}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Driver mutations <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b># <\/b><b>of<\/b><b> mutations detected by TPS<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b># <\/b><b>of<\/b><b> mutations detected by WGS<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Detected by TPS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">EGFR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">KRAS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TP53<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fusion oncogenes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PIK3 genes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BRAF<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Secondary drivers detected by TPS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">41<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Sub-total<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">120<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">114<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Missed by TPS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other drivers not detected by TPS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Total<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>120<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>123<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Whole genome sequencing,Lung adenocarcinoma,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ji-Hyung Park<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Young Tae Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Erin Connolly-Strong<sup>3<\/sup>, Young Seok Ju<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Genome Insight, Inc., San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"35daed2c-54e7-43d2-8797-d0b5e145d08f","ControlNumber":"5023","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Multiple genetic abnormalities including variant of unknown significance (VUS) have been detected in various cancer types. However, there is a lack of an integrated analysis system capable of identifying relationships among multiple genetic abnormalities and weighting them appropriately. Here, we report heat map analysis, a new integrated pathway scoring system for cancer genome profiling.<br \/>Methods: In heat map analysis, approximately 180 cancer-related genes among 324 genes evaluated by FoundationOne CDx<sup>TM<\/sup> are scored based on gene annotation and variant allele fraction (VAF), and classified into 16 pathways. This system provides an overall picture of genetic abnormalities and easy recognition of abnormal pathways. To examine the usefulness of the heat map analysis, a retrospective observational study was conducted on 50 patients with solid tumors who underwent cancer genome profiling test at Saga University Hospital from June 2019 to February 2022. The primary end point was the presentation rate of pathways with significantly increased scores.<br \/>Results: A total of 749 genetic abnormalities including VUS were detected in 50 patients with 15 cancer types: 571 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), 156 copy number variants (CNVs), and 22 fusions. The median number of abnormalities detected was 11 (2-20) SNVs, 2 (0-23) CNVs, and 0 (0-4) fusions, respectively. Heat map analysis presented active pathways with significant score elevation in 42 cases (84%).The TP53 pathway was the most common, followed by the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase pathway, PIK3-AKT, RAS, and DNA repair-related pathways.<br \/>Conclusion: Heat map analysis could be a promising new method for integrated analysis using cancer genome profiling tests.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene profiling,Signaling pathways,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chiho Nakashima<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yukimasa Shiotsu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yohei Harada<sup>3<\/sup>, Hiroo Katsuya<sup>1<\/sup>, Emi Ookuma<sup>4<\/sup>, Masanori Nishi<sup>5<\/sup>, Akemi Sato<sup>6<\/sup>, Hideaki Nakamura<sup>7<\/sup>, Naoko Sueoka-Aragane<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Saga University Faculty of Medicine, Saga, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Onco-Genome Institution, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Graduate School of medicine and faculty of medicine Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Saga University Faculty of Medicine, Saga, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Pediatrics, Saga University Faculty of Medicine, Saga, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Saga University Faculty of Medicine, Saga, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Transfusion Medicine, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"69afd50d-2faf-45c6-aee3-d449c65312b9","ControlNumber":"5403","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Automation in laboratories is advantageous to generate reproducible next generation sequencing (NGS) sample libraries, however, assay automation differs from instrument vendor to vendor but also from lab to lab with different deck layouts of the same instrument. These differences require a significant amount of optimization to design the workflow and begin generating NGS libraries. In addition to this optimization, some research, e.g., cancer research utilizes low input and\/or degraded samples such as cfDNA from plasma or FFPE biopsies. Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and Beckman Coulter - Life Sciences together provide a walk away NGS automation solution for these research samples directly upon instrument installation with no optimization required by combining Beckman Coulter&#8217;s Biomek NGeniuS with IDT&#8217;s xGen cfDNA &#38; FFPE DNA Library Prep kit and xGen Hybridization Capture. This trio provides a solution for laboratories to minimize technician hands-on time, error reduction, and rework while improving flexibility. IDT&#8217;s xGen cfDNA &#38; FFPE DNA Library Prep kit utilizes novel chemistry to maximize sample input conversion, suppress adapter-dimer formation, and facilitate consensus analysis. IDT&#8217;s xGen Hybridization Capture products maintain high library diversity, obtain high on-target, and provide consistent and uniform sequencing coverage regardless of panel size. We demonstrate performance of this complete workflow with a custom 2Mb xGen Hyb panel yielding high library complexity, high on-target coverage, and capture uniformity. The combination of IDT&#8217;s xGen library preparation solutions on the NGeniuS Biomek platform provides a reliable and consistent solution that can be instantly downloaded from the portal straight to analysis of precious low input and degraded samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Copy number variation,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Circulating cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicole Roseman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Tucker<sup>1<\/sup>, Francesco Criscuolo<sup>1<\/sup>, Lynette Lewis<sup>1<\/sup>, Li Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Tyler Buit<sup>2<\/sup>, Jasmeen Mandair<sup>2<\/sup>, Zachary Smith<sup>2<\/sup>, Calvin Cortes<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA,<sup>2<\/sup>Beckman Coulter - Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"07c49959-1968-4b61-8db1-d66ad5525d69","ControlNumber":"1904","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;N.

This is because we continue to treat all lung cancers as a homogenous disease. Therefore, personalized therapies based on individual molecular characteristics of patient tumors are needed to improve lung cancer treatment outcomes.<br \/><b>Objective:<\/b> The objective of the current project is to identify novel actionable RNA fusions that can be targeted for the personalized treatment of lung cancer. Fusions, including the ones that are created by joining at the RNA level, can form during cancer development and thus present an attractive way of personalized cancer treatment.<br \/><b>Methodology:<\/b> A list of RNA fusion candidates was processed through a multistep pipeline framework to map the fusion junction of these novel fusions and evaluate their actionability. We had previously obtained this list of RNA fusions by mining the RNA sequencing data from lung cancer samples. The workflow of the project included the following steps: 1) a literature search to assess the oncogenic role of individual gene partners, 2) Blat to map the fusion junction 3) cBioPortal\/Survival analysis to predict the association of individual gene partners with lung cancer patient survival and prognosis, 4) cBioPortal\/ Co-Expression analysis to study if the gene partners are expressed together or have common gene partners and lastly, 5) Open Reading Frame (ORF) Finder to identify if the fusion is predicted to be translated and makes a unique product.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RNA fusions such as TMPRSS13-TMPRSS13, SUPT6H-ESR1, PTPRK-RSPO3, and KIF5B-RET were investigated and fusion junctions were successfully determined. Gene partners from multiple fusion pairs (e.g., SUPT6H-ESR1 and KIF5B-RET) were found to have an oncogenic role in lung cancer. Mutations in KIF5B and RET genes were found to associate with poor survival in the TCGA dataset suggesting that the novel RNA fusions may also play an oncogenic role in lung cancer. Lastly, several of these RNA fusions generated unique ORFs suggesting that these fusions are predicted to be translated and these novel proteins can be selectively targeted sparing the normal cells that don&#8217;t harbor these mutants.<br \/><b>Future directions:<\/b> Next steps will involve preclinical testing of the driver role of these novel RNA fusions and testing of existing drugs such as RET inhibitors for their efficacy to treat lung cancer in tumors that harbor these novel RNA fusions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,RNA fusions,Personalized medicine,Actionable,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Prisha Verma<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sakuni Rankothgedera<sup>2<\/sup>, Micah Castillo<sup>2<\/sup>, Preethi Gunaratne<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>AEOP High School Intern, University of Houston, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Houston, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ff57f985-7026-4921-9e23-1596374598ce","ControlNumber":"7723","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.
