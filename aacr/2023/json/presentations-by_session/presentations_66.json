Using high-dimensional single-cell profiling of human TNBC, here we demonstrate that macrophages are the predominant infiltrating immune cell type in breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA)-associated TNBC. Macrophages are an innate immune cell that play a critical role in host defense and maintaining tissue homeostasis, however their infiltration into tumors has been associated with disease progression and resistance to therapy. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) represent a significant proportion of solid tumors, including breast cancer. TAMs play a major role in tumorigenesis as they can enhance tumor cell growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. In addition, TAMs can inhibit anti-tumor responses of T cells. Our recent work has shown that removal or conversion of TAMs to an anti-tumor phenotype enhances chemo- and immuno-therapy establishing TAMs as targets for anti-cancer therapy. Through multi-omics profiling, we show that PARP inhibitors enhance both anti- and pro-tumor features of macrophages through glucose and lipid metabolic reprogramming, driven by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBF1, SREBP1) pathway. Combining PARP inhibitor therapy with colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)-blocking antibodies significantly enhanced innate and adaptive antitumor immunity and extended survival in mice with BRCA-deficient tumors in vivo, and this was mediated by CD8+ T cells. Collectively, our results uncover macrophage-mediated immune suppression as a liability of PARP inhibitor treatment and demonstrate that combined PARP inhibition and macrophage-targeting therapy induces a durable reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus constituting a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC. Therefore, targeting TAMs offers great potential to enhance both chemo- and immuno-therapy. Deep analysis of TAMs in solid tumors has revealed the complexity of TAMs and revealed major gaps in our knowledge of the functional and phenotypic characterization of TAM subsets associated with cancer, before and after treatment. Here we will discuss the complexity of TAMs in solid tumors including characterizing TAM subsets, location, and crosstalk with neighboring cells, as well as novel TAM-modulating strategies and combinations that are likely to enhance current therapies and overcome chemo- and immuno-therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Macrophages,PARP inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer L.

While the accumulation of cell autonomous mutations contributes to tumorigenesis, the central role age-related changes in the tumor microenvironment play in the transformation process is becoming more fully appreciated. Underscoring the importance of an aged microenvironment in cancer development are findings that senescent fibroblasts, which accumulate with age, directly stimulate preneoplastic and neoplastic cell growth and tumor progression. Investigations into how senescent fibroblasts promote tumorigenesis revealed that they express a plethora of growth factors, extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes, chemokines, and cytokines collectively referred to as the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). To identify a role for senescent stromal cells in a spontaneous model of breast cancer, we used single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to interrogate the cell types and their functional status in the MMTV-PyMT breast tumor model. This analysis revealed the presence of senescent cancer associated fibroblasts (senCAFs) that we also identified in a human triple negative breast cancer scRNA-Seq database. To establish a role for senCAFs in breast cancer, we mated the PyMT model to the INKATTAC (INK) mouse that allowed us to inducibly eliminate senescent cells. We found that the elimination of senCAFs reduced tumor growth and unleashed the killing power of NK cells. We will discuss the mechanism by which senCAFs impact NK cell killing.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sheila A.
