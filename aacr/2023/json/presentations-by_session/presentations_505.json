[{"Abstract":"Autophagy is a self-degradation process, it is essential for growth of heterogenous of breast cancer cells. Breast tumor heterogeneity majorly comprises bulk cancer cells &#38; cancer stem cells (CSCs). Targeting either CSCs or cancer cells could lead to interconversion between these cells due to EMT\/MET transitions. Therefore, it is important to identify a common molecular targets &#38; its mechanism of regulation in these populations for improvement of breast cancer therapy. Here, we utilized a PCR based screen &#38; identified NUMA1 downregulation in FIP200 KO (autophagy gene) cells of three major breast cancer subtypes, FF99 (luminal), N418 (Her2+) &#38; BF3M (basal). Further, NUMA1 KO in these cells reduced tumor formation &#38; CSCs indicating the role of NUMA1 on regulation of CSCs. Therefore, we sorted breast CSCs, ALDH<sup>+<\/sup> and CD29<sup>hi<\/sup> CD61<sup>+<\/sup> from WT &#38; NUMA1 KO cells, tail-vein injected nude mice depicted reduced metastatic potential with NUMA1 KO than WT CSCs. Mechanistically, NUMA1 regulation by PIM1 kinase was observed in CSCs but not in bulk cancer cells. Cell viability assays revealed that combination treatment of autophagy &#38; PIM1 inhibitor showed higher efficacy against cancer cells of three breast cancer subtypes than individual treatments alone. Finally, the combination treatment of autophagy inhibitor, Lys05 &#38; PIM1 inhibitor, SMI-4a reduced tumor formation &#38; metastasis of breast cancer. Human tissue microarray results depicted high expression of NUMA1 &#38; PIM1 in different breast cancer subtypes than non- tumor tissues. Our study demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy &#38; PIM1 in bulk cancer cells &#38; CSCs showed attenuation of tumor formation &#38; metastasis, suggesting this combination treatment serves as an important therapeutic approach for treating breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cancer stem cell,Combination therapy,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kanakaraju Manupati<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mingang Hao<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Haas<sup>2<\/sup>, Syn Kok Yeo<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun-Lin Guan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4f45d728-468e-447e-93b2-08533260e5d8","ControlNumber":"4623","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

One of the clinical challenges is that radioresistance often promotes tumor aggressiveness. However, the underlying mechanisms and molecular determinants are largely unknown. We report here that radioresistance-associated HNSCC aggressiveness is effectively exacerbated by c-Met but can be suppressed by its genetic knockdown and pharmacological inactivation. Through unbiased RNAseq data, we further uncovered that the resulting upregulation of c-Met signaling increases the expression of PLXDC2. a critical gene associated with the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, PLXDC2 is upregulated in radioresistant HNSCC cells through c-Met mediated activation of ERK1\/2-ELK1 signaling cascade. Most importantly, PLXDC2 modulates cancer cell plasticity by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the emergence of cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation. Additionally, depletion of PLXDC2 overcomes c-Met-mediated radioresistance by reversing the EMT progress and blunting the self-renewal capacity of CSCs. Therapeutically, a combination of the c-Met selective inhibitor SU11274 with radiation remarkably induces tumor shrinkage and constrains tumor metastasis to lymph nodes in vivo. Our study is novel in being the first to explore the role and mechanism of the c-Met-PLXDC2 axis in radioresistance-associated HNSCC aggressiveness and the first to our knowledge to evaluate how to take advantage of blocking this signaling to overcome radioresistance in preclinical mouse models of HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),c-Met,Radioresistance,Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Fanghui Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Liwei Lang<sup>2<\/sup>, Chloe Shay<sup>1<\/sup>, Georgia Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Nabil Saba<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Yong Teng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Emory University, Atlanta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Augusta University, Augusta, GA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3a4bba3f-ee15-411e-b1b6-1eba9954e204","ControlNumber":"190","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

It&#8217;s the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death. Because of the atypical early symptoms of liver cancer, the majority of liver cancer patients are diagnosed with advanced-cancer stage, decreasing the chance of resection and resulting in a poor survival rate. Liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are a small subpopulation inside the tumor bulk, characterized by the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency. Thus, LCSCs are responsible for cancer initiation, metastasis, relapse, and chemoresistance. Elucidating LCSC characteristics and disclosing their regulatory mechanism might facilitate the development of prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches to improve the clinical management of liver cancer. Piperlongumine (PL) an active biological pyridine alkaloid has anti-angiogenic, anti-diabetic, and anti-bacterial activities. The present study aimed to isolate highly tumorigenic and aggressive subpopulation of LCSCs (CD133<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD90<sup>+<\/sup>) from primary tumors and different cell lines and investigate the effect of (PL), a novel targeting therapy, on LCSCs proliferation. The isolated LCSCs were treated with different concentrations of PL and its effect was examined by cell viability, cell morphological changes, western blot, caspase-3 activity, apoptotic induction, and clonogenic formation. By using Immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis, the localization of nuclear and cytoplasmic Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH6A1) was detected. PL inhibited the viability of CD133<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD90<sup>+<\/sup>LCSC-sub-popupation and caused morphological changes after 48 hours while enhancing the pre-apoptotic signals and caspase-3 activity. In addition, PL decreased the colonies&#8217; formation ability compared to control group. Furthermore, PL suppressed the protein expression levels of ALDH6A1, Notch-1, &#946;-catenin, ERK1\/2, and Cyclin-D1 in the dose and time-dependent manners. Besides, PL decreased the localization and intensity of nuclear and cytoplasmic ALDH6A1 compared to the control group, indicating that PL decreased the proliferation and stemness markers of LCSCs. Overall, Piperlongumine as a novel targeting therapy has an important role in targeting CD133<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD90<sup>+<\/sup> LCSCs sub-population proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Notch-1,Liver cancer,&#946;-catenin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Basma A.

We have demonstrated the clinical importance of aberrant activation of RSPO3\/&#946;-catenin pathway in a subset of poor prognosis AML (<i>Cancer Cell, <\/i>38:263-278, 2020) and its ability to sustain low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a critical characteristic of human LSCs. This current study has extended our recent finding, and for the first time linked the pathway activation to ferroptosis resistance, a new drug resistance mechanism in cancer therapy. Our single-cell multiomics data in patient-derived xenograft mouse models of relapsed AML showed that the pathway activation in human LSCs led to upregulation of 43 differentially expressed genes associated with iron detoxification (e.g., FTH1) and ROS sensing\/detoxification (e.g., PRDX1), two key features of ferroptosis resistance. Consistent with this observation, we found that AML patient specimens with favourable outcomes, which are independent of RSPO3 pathway, were sensitive to RSL3 treatment leading to increased cell death associated with elevated levels of intracellular ROS and iron. In contrast, AML patient specimens with poor clinical outcomes, which critically depend on RSPO3 pathway activation for survival and maintenance of myeloid undifferentiated state, revealed resistance to ferroptosis inducers (e.g., RSL3). Intriguingly, we found that anti-RSPO3 antibody, a clinical-grade drug that inhibits AML LSCs by blocking the interaction of RSPO3 with its receptor, sensitizes human LSCs to RSL3 treatment, leading to reduced cell viability. Overall, this study is the first to demonstrate the role of ferroptosis resistance in human LSCs and provides an opportunity to develop precision combination therapy by concurrently targeting self-renewal and ferroptosis resistance to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with poor-risk AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,Resistance,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nunki Hassan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hangyu Yi<sup><\/sup>, Lucie Gaspard-Boulinc<sup><\/sup>, Jenny Wang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"14cc53e1-b8ce-48f2-b6be-6fdad80a16c1","ControlNumber":"7906","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Previous studies demonstrated that hypomethylating agents (HMA) re-sensitize ovarian cancer (OC) cells to chemotherapy, however, translation to the clinic has been slow. NTX 301 (PinotBio) is a novel, highly potent, and orally bioavailable HMA, in early clinical development.<br \/>Methods: We assessed the anti-tumor effects of NTX301 in OC models and studied the underlying molecular mechanisms by using cell proliferation, stemness, and ferroptosis assays, RNA sequencing, and validation.<br \/>Results: OC cells (SKOV3, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=5.089nM; OVCAR5 IC<sub>50<\/sub>=3.664nM) were highly sensitive to NTX301 (p&#60;0.05) compared to immortalized fallopian tube epithelial cells (FT-190) (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=103.3nM). Treatment with NTX301 induced significant downregulation of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1-3 expression in SKOV3 and OVCAR5 cells compared with decitabine (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). Treatment with low dose NTX301 (100nM) induced significant transcriptomic reprogramming with 15,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to DMSO (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). Among the NTX301 down-regulated DEGs, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified pathways related to the <i>regulation of alcohol, cholesterol, and fatty acid biosynthetic process and <\/i>molecular functions related to <i>aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and oxidoreductase activity<\/i>, known features of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Indeed, treatment with low dose NTX301 (100nM) reduced the ALDH(+) cell population and expression of stemness-associated transcription factors (Oct4 and Sox2). Additionally, stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD), a key enzyme that regulates unsaturated fatty acid homeostasis in the lipogenesis process was found among the top DEGs downregulated in response to NTX3 (fold change=9.36, <i>FDR<\/i>&#60;0.05). As blockade of SCD had been shown to induce ferroptosis, oxidized lipids levels were measured by C11-BODIPY staining. NTX301 treatment increased the levels of oxidized lipids compared to DMSO and this was blunted by deferoxamine, indicating that NTX301 promoted cell death via ferroptosis. NTX301-induced ferroptosis was successfully rescued by the addition of oleic acid (200&#956;M) into the culture medium, supporting that it was mediated through SCD depletion. <i>In vivo<\/i>, monotherapy with NTX301 (0.5mg\/kg), significantly inhibited subcutaneous OC xenograft tumor growth (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). Decreased SCD levels and increased oxidized lipids were recorded in NTX301-treated xenografts.<br \/>Conclusions: NTX301 is a potent HMA active in OC models.

Ex vivo culturing of primary human AML patient cells is therefore of interest; however, the long-term culture of these cells has been limited by rapid differentiation and loss of clonogenicity. Previously, different growth factors and stromal cells were implicated in the short-term culturing of primary cells. Thus, we aimed to evaluate culture conditions using a cytokine cocktail, allowing long-term expansion and phenotypic maintenance of primary AML cells in vitro. Different culture conditions were constituted by combination of cytokines (SCF, FLT-3L, TPO, IL-6, IL-3, GCSF, GM-CSF) and small molecules (SR1, UM729) in serum-free StemSpan SFEM media. The ability of different growth mediums to support the expansion and clonogenicity of 6 primary AML cells (collected from blood\/bone marrow) over two weeks was assessed using cell counts and colony formation assays. Additionally, cell surface markers (hCD34, hCD45, hCD123, hCD117) were assessed by flow cytometry during the culture period. All tested cultured conditions exhibited successful cell proliferation (4-6-fold expansion) and survival of primary AML cells over two weeks of culture. In addition, the growth media successfully supported 3.5-fold CD34+ stem cell expansion. Growth mediums with early-acting cytokines (SCF, FLT-3L, TPO, and IL-6) and small molecules resulted in phenotypic maintenance of cell surface markers (CD34, CD123) and secondary clonogenicity of primary AML cells over the culture period. The addition of late-acting cytokines (IL-3, GCSF, and GM-CSF) showed a higher growth rate but negatively affected the cell surface markers and clonogenicity. Secondary colony counts (day-9 culture) showed a significant positive correlation with CD34 expression levels. Thus, CD34 levels could serve as a potential surrogate marker for the clonogenicity of primary AML cells. Furthermore, we tested the engraftment ability of two primary AML cells grown in 3 of our promising culture conditions (Day 4, Day 8) in xenograft mice. Flow cytometry analysis on peripheral blood and tissues (spleen and bone marrow) from xenograft mice showed successful engraftment of primary cells cultured for 8 days. On an application note, the optimal condition from our results was used to study the effects of ceramide nanoliposomes (CNL) in AML patient cells. Interestingly, the AML patient cells treated for two weeks with IC15 and IC30 doses of CNL led to cell cycle arrest, reduced CD34 expression, and clonogenicity relative to control cells. The CNL findings from primary cells are different from that of cell lines cultured under the same conditions. Thus, our optimal growth conditions may facilitate researchers to understand AML biology and study various therapeutics under development using primary AML cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ex vivo,Acute myeloid leukemia,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Cancer stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Satyam Patel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Upendarrao Golla<sup>2<\/sup>, Arati Sharma<sup>3<\/sup>, David Claxton<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pharmacology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"44e0e5a5-6b8e-4cf6-b2f9-8e6776830ab3","ControlNumber":"6676","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

CD133 is known to represent an important functional marker of liver CSCs. We have demonstrated CD133 to enrich following chemotherapy treatment, while CD133\/Prom1-depletion would enhance sensitivity of HCC tumors to chemotherapy. Yet unfortunately, CD133 is not specific to HCC, but is also expressed in normal regenerating liver. Identifying critical factors expressed specifically in liver CD133+ CSCs, but not in liver normal CD133+ stem\/progenitor cells may offer important therapeutic opportunities overcoming chemoresistance in HCC. RNA-seq profiling comparing sorted CD133+ and CD133- subsets of normal regenerating liver induced by DDC diet and HCC induced by either N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)\/carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4<\/sub>) or hydrodynamic tail vein injection of oncogenic plasmids AKT and NRAS identified Serine Peptidase Inhibitor Kazal Type I (SPINK1) to be distinctly expressed in the HCC CD133+ subpopulation but not in normal regenerating liver CD133+ subpopulation. SPINK1 overexpression in HCC clinical samples is correlated with a poor prognosis. Expression of SPINK1 increased during early liver progenitor development, peaked during the premature hepatocyte stage, decreased during hepatocyte maturation and increased progressively from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated HCCs. Enhanced transcriptional activity of SPINK1 was mediated by promoter binding of the epithelial cell-specific transcription factor ELF3, which like CD133, were both increased following chemotherapy treatment. SPINK1 inhibition by lentiviral-based knockdown or a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) mitigated tumor initiation, self-renewal and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, secretory SPINK1 bound to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating MEK\/ERK signaling and consequently promoting the formation of CDK4\/6-cyclin D1 complex to phosphorylate Rb and release E2F2, allowing the cells to overcome G1\/S checkpoint promoting cell cycle progression as well as transcribing stemness, oncogenic dedifferentiation and chemoresistance-related genes. Collectively, our findings suggest SPINK1 to play a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis and that SPINK1 mAb may represent a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of HCC, targeting at the CD133+ CSC tumor roots and overcoming chemoresistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,oncogenic dedifferentiation,chemoresistance,tumor plasticity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ki-Fong Man<sup>1<\/sup>, Lei Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Ying-Tung Lam<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Jing-Ping Yun<sup>3<\/sup>, Xin-Yuan Guan<sup>4<\/sup>, Ming Liu<sup>5<\/sup>, <b>Stephanie Ma<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>2<\/sup>The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Centre, Guangzhou, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Clinical Oncology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>5<\/sup>School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"799e769c-db8f-4ba9-858c-956555ad5c0d","ControlNumber":"4260","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

TNBC does yet have a suitable treatment option other than cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Although pitavastatin has been shown to exert anti-proliferative effects and cytotoxicity in various types of cancer cells, the precise mechanisms underlying pitavastatin&#8217;s anti-cancer effects in TNBC have not been fully elucidated. We sought to investigate the mechanism of pitavastatin-induced apoptosis and its effects on cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics in TNBC. Exposure to pitavastatin induced mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death in BT549 and 4T1 cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction was accompanied with a robust production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), resulting in subsequent activation of caspase-3\/-7 and PARP cleavage. Pitavastatin effectively suppressed CSC-like properties in TNBC via targeting CD44+\/CD24- and CD49f+\/CD24- phenotypes, as well as impediment of mammosphere formation <i>in vitro<\/i>. This phenomenon was accompanied with dysregulation of STAT3 survival pathway, concomitant with significant downregulation of cyclin D1, survivin and vimentin. <b><\/b>Pitavastatin effectively targets both the proliferating TNBC tumor cells and CSCs via the dysregulation of STAT3 and suppression of CSC-like properties, markedly reducing angiogenesis and tumor growth, coinciding with decreased Ki-67 expression. It is noteworthy that pitavastatin considerably suppressed metastasis, coinciding with significant reduction of MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF in the circulating blood of mice.

Glioma patients have a 5 percent five-year survival rate and drug-resistant tumors often recur following surgical resection and treatment with radiation and\/or chemotherapy. The cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests the presence of a subset of undifferentiated cells, namely glioma stem cells (GSCs), in the heterogenous tumor mass responsible for disease progression. Understanding mechanisms responsible for maintaining GSCs and developing strategies to deplete the GSC population could improve glioma treatment and prognosis. Some GSCs are similar to oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are observed in neural development and the adult brain. OPCs are prone to malignant transformation and are believed to be a cell of origin for glioma. Recent findings indicate that the well-characterized neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) maintains the primitive state of normal OPCs via muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) preventing maturation and cell cycle exit. We hypothesized that cholinergic signaling may also maintain the primitive state of OPC-like GSCs. We analyzed publicly available single nuclei RNASeq data of patient glioblastoma samples and observed high expression of <i>CHRM3<\/i>, encoding the M3 mAChR, in OPC-like cells of the proneural subtype of glioma. Studies in mouse OPC-like GSCs confirmed high levels of <i>CHRM3<\/i> expression and demonstrated that ACh generated voltage changes and rapid (&#60; 1 second) increases in cytosolic calcium from internal calcium stores. Exposure to a brain permeant FDA-approved anti-muscarinic drug targeting M3mAChR suppressed proliferation, evoked calcium release, and the activation of intracellular second messengers PKC and ERK. Pharmacologic inhibition of mAChRs in established patient derived glioma grafts prevented re-initiation of tumors in subsequent host animals compared with vehicle treated tumors. These studies suggest that the cholinergic microenvironment maintains GSCs in a manner similar to normal OPCs and provides a platform for repositioning available small molecule mAChR antagonists for treatment of glioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,Glioma,Molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sumyuktha V.

As a result, GBM inevitably recurs and only approximately 9% of patients survive 5 years post-diagnosis. Areas of residual disease represent the source of the recurrent tumor that is fatal for GBM patients. However, targeting the residual disease is not offered as part of the standard of care because these areas are difficult to identify and, to date, they have not been characterized during disease progression. Our laboratory was the first to identify and characterize residual disease in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles of GBM patients. Specifically, we found that in the majority of GBM patients the SVZ is a reservoir of tumor cells that promote therapeutic resistance and seed the recurrent tumor. Specifically, our work revealed that in 65% of the cases the SVZ contains treatment-resistant cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), thus investigating residual disease in this area may hold the key to developing a valid therapeutic target for many patients. In this study, we are examining the impact of Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) on treatment-resistant CSCs isolated from the SVZ of GBM patients using molecular techniques, such as single-cell transcriptomics and functional phenotyping analysis. To date, we have isolated and characterized 12 CSCs. These cells are maintained in conditions that preserve the molecular profile of the original patient tumor, thus representing <i>bona fide<\/i> models to study the impact of TTFields on GBM residual disease. We observed that: (i) CSCs show heterogeneous patterns of response to the alkylating agent Temozolomide (100 &#181;M) and radiation (10 Gy), that mimic the standard of care for GBM patients, (ii) their treatment response is independent of the MGMT promoter methylation status and (iii) the proliferation of CSCs resistant to Temozolomide and radiation is significantly inhibited by TTFields when cells are exposed for 48 hours to the optimized frequency for GBM (200 kHz). Altogether, these findings point to the effectiveness of TTFields following Temozolomide and radiation and set the foundation for the single-cell transcriptomic and functional analysis to elucidate the mechanisms whereby TTFields impact the proliferation of CSCs in the SVZ of GBM patients. In the long run, the results of this work will allow the identification of SVZ-specific targets for the development of novel and more effective treatments for GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Cancer stem cells,Tumor treating fields (TTFields),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yamhilette Licon Munoz<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel  B.

Platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapy can reprogram cancer cells to ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) and contribute to incurable recurrence. We have previously shown that Pt-containing drugs, e.g., cisplatin, enrich for OCSCs and Pt-induced alterations in DNA methylation enhanced OCSC malignant properties. CSCs have been shown to be dependent on methionine (Met) in many cancers, and in the current study, we investigated the role of Met and the interplay between methylation and Met metabolism in OCSC enrichment. In high grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR5, OVCAR3), cisplatin treatment (IC50, 16hr) increased (p&#60;0.01) the percentage of cells that were positive for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH+ cells), a known OCSCs marker. Cisplatin treatment also increased (p&#60;0.05) the whole cell level of 5-methylcytosine, indicating Pt-induced methylation changes. In addition, Met metabolism was altered by cisplatin, demonstrated by decreased (p&#60;0.01) level of Met derivative, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), and increased (p&#60;0.01) expression of Met utilization enzyme, methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A). To investigate a possible role of Met metabolism in Pt-induced enrichment of OCSCs, OVCAR5 cells were cultured in complete or Met-depleted (Met-) media, treated with cisplatin or vehicle and examined for CSC properties, including ALDH+ cells and the ability to form spheroids under low-attachment conditions. Met depletion blocked (p&#60;0.01) both the Pt-induced increase of ALDH+ cells and spheroid formation. Both Met- only and Met- in combination with cisplatin activated p38, determined by increased phosphorylated p38, which may have responded to Met depletion and promoted cell cycle arrest. In addition, MAT2A expression was higher (p&#60;0.01) in ALDH+ compared to ALDH- OC cells. MAT2A inhibitor FIDAS-5 combined with cisplatin blocked the Pt-induced increase in ALDH+ cells (p&#60;0.01), demonstrating a requirement for Met utilization in Pt-induced OCSC enrichment. As MAT2A is a therapeutic target in cancer, MAT2A inhibition could represent a therapeutic approach for inhibiting CSC in ovarian cancer. We are further investigating the mechanism of MAT2A-mediated inhibition on Pt-induced OCSCs enrichment by examining the OC methylome and cell cycle arrest.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Metabolism,Methylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shu Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tara  X.

TCGA dataset analysis revealed that mRNA levels of FAK were highly expressed in TNBC compared to other breast cancer subtypes. We found that ebastine binds to the tyrosine kinase domain of FAK, which blocks phosphorylation at the Y397 and Y576\/577 residues and subsequent inactivation of SRC. Ebastine-induced apoptosis was associated with attenuation of JAK2\/STAT3 and MEK\/ERK signaling in TNBC cells. Kinetic analysis revealed a concentration-dependent impairment of cell migration in the presence of ebastine in MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Ebastine targets BCSC-like cell populations as evidenced by a sharp decline in the expression of the BCSC markers ALDH1, CD44 and CD49f and suppression of mammosphere-forming capacity. Ebastine administration led to a significant reduction in the growth ebastine of BCSC-enriched 4T1 mammospheres orthotopically injected into the mammary glands of Balb\/c mice. Ebastine administration significantly impeded angiogenesis and distant metastasis while reducing MMP-2\/-9 levels in circulating blood in vivo. Importantly, biochemical analysis in mice serum showed that ebastine had no effect on liver and kidney function. Our findings suggest that EBA may be an effective therapeutic repositioning candidate for the simultaneous targeting of multiple survival signaling pathways for the treatment of molecularly heterogeneous TNBC. Further investigation of ebastine as an anti-metastatic agent for the treatment of TNBC is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Breast cancer,Cancer stem cells,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Juyeon Seo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Minsu Park<sup><\/sup>, Dongmi Ko<sup><\/sup>, Seongjae Kim<sup><\/sup>, Soeun Park<sup><\/sup>, Kee Dal Nam<sup><\/sup>, Yong Koo Kang<sup><\/sup>, So Ra Seuk<sup><\/sup>, Jaeyoun Park<sup><\/sup>, Eunsun Jung<sup><\/sup>, Yoon-Jae Kim<sup><\/sup>, Ji Young Kim<sup><\/sup>, Jae Hong Seo<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6d2dc0c4-376d-4df4-bab0-f75dd15e1b6c","ControlNumber":"5922","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Given its limited and inefficacious treatment options, the mortality rate of iCCA remains high and thus a novel therapeutic strategy is urgently needed. The concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) explains a subpopulation of cancer cells that possesses self-renewal and differentiation capacities. These CSCs become the culprit for cancer metastasis, cancer recurrence and chemotherapeutic resistance, making them promising targets for cancer treatment. The propose of this study is to identify the signaling pathways crucial for the survival of iCCA with stemness characteristics. Gene expression analysis on a dataset of Thai iCCA patients (n=91) showed that iCCA tumors are enriched in the Adult Stem Cell (ASC) signature which are the shared characteristics among the epithelial-derived cancer with stemness characteristics. Although iCCA cells exhibit some degree of enrichment in stem cells markers when compared with cholangiocyte cells, further upregulation of stem cell-related genes, <i>e.g. Nanog, Oct3\/4, Sox2, and Sox9<\/i>, were found in iCCA cells grown as 3D tumorspheres. A kinase inhibitor screening library was then performed on iCCA tumorspheres. Our initial screening demonstrated that 11 out of the top 50 kinase inhibitors that effectively decrease viability of iCCA tumorspheres belongs to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R)\/phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)\/protein kinase B (PKB\/AKT) axis. Additionally, these inhibitors increase cell apoptosis, judged by the caspase 3\/7 activity, within iCCA tumorspheres. Conversely, IGF-1 treatment which is sufficient to induce activation of IGF-1R and AKT also enhances cell viability and decrease cell apoptosis in iCCA. Taken together, our data demonstrate that IGF-1R\/PI3K\/AKT axis is crucial for survival of iCCA cells with stemness characteristics and this pathway could be a potential therapeutic target in iCCA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Cholangiocarcinoma,Spheroids,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chotirat Rattanasinchai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chidchanok Chornkrathok<sup>2<\/sup>, Donlaporn Sriphan<sup>2<\/sup>, Panida Navasumrit<sup>1<\/sup>, Mathuros Ruchirawat<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Environmental Toxicology Laboratory, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, Thailand,<sup>2<\/sup>Chemical Carcinogenesis, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok, Thailand","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ed68cbb5-2af3-4fcf-b244-891c69f433b1","ControlNumber":"2167","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant and lethal brain tumor that remains incurable partly due to the existence of untreatable cancer stem cells (CSC). The pathogenesis of GBM is largely due to the loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which is implicated in the aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway. The major cause of tumor recurrence, growth, and invasion is the presence of a unique population of CSC. Resistance to conventional therapies appears to be caused by both extensive genetic abnormalities and dysregulation of the transcription landscape. Consequently, CSCs have emerged as targets of interest in new treatment paradigms. Evidence suggests that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can also be applied to target CSCs. In this study, we explored the role of the mTOR pathway in the regulation of stem cells of GBM. GBM stem cells were treated with various inhibitors of canonical PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathways such as rapamycin (mTORC1 inhibitor), PP242 (ATP binding mTORC1\/2 inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), and MAPK inhibitor, U0126. We previously demonstrated the presence of CSC in the peritumor area of GBM. A significant number of GBM tumors expressed stem cell marker nestin and activated mTOR (pmTORSer2448), with most tumor cells co-expressing both markers. The expression of stem cell marker NANOG was suppressed following rapamycin treatment, while U0126 induced translocation of NANOG from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The neurospheres were disrupted following rapamycin and LY294002 treatments. Rapamycin or PP242 treatments given with differentiating agent All-trans-retinoic acid reduced stem cell proliferation. Treatment with novel small molecule dual inhibitors of mTORC1\/2 demonstrated that Torin1 and Torin2 suppressed the proliferation of GBM CSC, while XL388 was less effective. Torin1 and XL388 delay the process of self-renewal as compared to controls, whereas Torin2 halted the self-renewal of GBM CSC. Additionally, Torin2 was able to eradicate tumor cells. Torin2 effectively targeted CSCs of GBM by halting self-renewal and inhibiting cell proliferation, underscoring the use of Torin2 in the treatment of GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,mTOR,Stem cells,Self-renewal,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Olivia Gellerson<sup><\/sup>, Julie Bree<sup><\/sup>, Mohan Das<sup><\/sup>, George Kleinman<sup><\/sup>, Chirag Gandhi<sup><\/sup>, <b>Meena Jhanwar-Uniyal<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Neurosurgery New York Medical College\/WMC, Valhalla, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"65dfa3d3-5d20-48c8-bbed-c191603b12c5","ControlNumber":"1418","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>O.

The metastatic progression is mediated by exfoliation of tumor cells into the peritoneal cavity, the formation of compact OC spheroids, and their implantation onto the overlying peritoneal surface. Spheroid formation is promoted by a change of cell adhesion properties, enhanced secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as fibronectin (FN), that stiffen the tumor stroma, promote the aberrant activation of integrins, and recruit the adaptor protein integrin-linked kinase (ILK). ILK drives cytoskeletal assembly and modulates key processes, including survival, invasion, and stemness. However, the functional role of ILK in chemoresistance of ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) remains incompletely understood. We tested the hypothesis that the formation of FN-integrin complexes at the cell membrane promotes survival of OCSCs and supports OC spheroid formation by activating ILK and downstream oncogenic signaling.<b> <\/b> In OCSCs compared with non-CSC, ILK, FN, and integrin &#946;1 <i>m<\/i>RNA expression levels were increased (P&#60;0.001) and further enriched in OC spheroids compared with monolayers (P&#60;0.01). ILK blockade with the specific inhibitor cpd-22 suppressed spheroid proliferation and tumor initiating capacity in xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, key oncogenic signaling pathways, in particular decreased &#946;-catenin signaling essential to sustaining cancer cell stemness, were altered in OC spheroids treated with cpd-22. Of the genes examined, expression of Wnt receptor Frizzled 7 (Fzd7) was the mostly highly downregulated in OC spheroids treated with cpd-22, indicating a direct correlation between ILK activation and Wnt signaling. By using co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay, we demonstrated that ILK co-localizes with Fzd7 in OC spheroids. Mechanistically, treatment of OC spheroids with the combination of carboplatin and ILK-Fzd7 blockade decreased &#946;-catenin signaling, inhibited phospho-Akt at Ser473 and increased levels of cleaved-caspase-3 compared to single agent alone, resulting in apoptosis. By regulating &#946;-catenin signaling, Fzd7 expression and ILK activation are essential for OCSCs survival. Targeting Fzd7-ILK clusters may represent a new therapeutic approach to eradicate OCSC and ultimately improve patient outcomes.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Chemoresistance,Wnt pathway,Tumorigenicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rula Atwani<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Virginie Lazar<sup><\/sup>, George Earl Sandusky<sup><\/sup>, Salvatore Condello<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c62d3b7b-9585-4051-a34b-c24b9c0af539","ControlNumber":"2510","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Patient derived cancer organoids (PCOs) are an important model of PDAC that maintain the molecular features of advanced disease and have been shown to predict drug response. This study aimed to determine the dynamics of CSC expression on the oligoclonal culture growth of three independent PCOs models.<br \/>Methods: PCOs were assayed using low volume 10&#956;L microformat in 96 well design (Ibidi, Inc). PCOs were treated with physiologic FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (nab-pac) including single agent controls. Response was assayed by growth using timecourse data from 0h to 72h using high content imaging (Cytation 5). At 72h, the PCOs were stained using four distinct CSC markers (CD44, CD133, CD117, and EpCAM). Images were aligned using thresholded root mean standard deviation of 75&#956;m and tracked for normalized change in longest diameter. At 72h, CSC markers were tracked using % area positive from brightfield region of interest. Response was tracked by effect size Glass&#8217;s Delta (G&#916;) defined as the difference between the mean of media control and treatment group normalized to standard deviation of media control.<br \/>Results: PCOs maintained nuclear atypia and high nuclear-chromatin ratios consistent with matured xenografts. AMPC1 showed similar sensitivity with growth arrest by PCO &#916; diameter for gem + nab-pac (mean = +2.2%, G&#916; = 1.29) and FOLFIRINOX (mean = 0.0%, G&#916; = 1.33). AMPC1 had CSC enrichment for CD44 after treatment with nab-pac (G&#916; = 0.93), CD133 expression after treatment with gem + nab-pac (G&#916; = 0.75), CD117 after treatment with nab-pac treatment (G&#916; = 0.80), and EpCAM after treatment with gem + nab-pac (G&#916; = 0.78). In AMPC1, interquartile analysis revealed increased CSC expression conferred reduced growth for CD133 (+72% v. 37%, p&#60;0.005) and CD117 (+81% v. +25%, p&#60;0.005). Normalized &#916; diameter across PDAC PCOs revealed PDAC1 had reduced sensitivity to gem + nab-pac (mean = +16.0%, G&#916; = 1.2) vs. PDAC2 (Mean = 2.1%, G&#916; = 1.65). PDAC1 had CSC enrichment with increased % area of CD44+ after treatment with gem + nab-pac (G&#916; = 1.13). In PDAC2, interquartile analysis revealed increased CSC expression conferred decreased growth rate for CD133 (+65% v. +36%, p&#60; 0.005) and CD117 (+75% v. +38%, p&#60;0.005).<br \/>Conclusions: PDAC and AMPC PCOs reveal oligoclonal expression of CSC markers within a population. Increased CSC expression for CD133 and CD117 within a population consistently revealed decreased growth within an organoid population. CSC expression (CD44, CD133, CD117, and EpCAM) was found to be enriched under therapeutic challenge with gem and nab-pac containing chemotherapy.

Our <i>goal<\/i> is to therapeutically sensitize cancer SCs (CSCs) to differentiation-inducing effects of retinoid agents against CRC. We found that ALDH specifically marks normal and malignant colonic SCs and that retinoic acid (RA) signaling mainly occurs in colonic ALDH+ SCs. That RA signaling occurs through ALDH+ SCs was derived from finding that RA receptors and RA signaling components are selectively expressed in ALDH+ SCs. Indeed, All-<i>trans<\/i>retinoic acid (ATRA) is a highly effective treatment for leukemia (APL) which has a <i>RARA<\/i> translocation. We conjecture that response of solid tumors to RA agents depends on RA pathway genotype. Our bioinformatics analysis shows mutations often occur in RA receptors in human CRCs. Therefore, we <i>hypothesize<\/i> that the ability of RA agents and RA metabolism blocking agents to induce differentiation of CSCs depends on RA pathway genotype.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The ability of RA agents (ATRA, 13-<i>cis<\/i> retinoic acid, 9-<i>cis<\/i> retinoic acid) and RA metabolism blocking agents (Liarozole, Talarozole) to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of CRC cells was evaluated. Nanostring Profiling was used to measure effects of agents on mRNA expression of various markers.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our results show that RA pathway genotype affects the response of RA agents in CRC cell lines. HCT116 and SW480 cells, which have RA receptor mutations, displayed resistance to ATRA. In contrast, HT29 cells that have wild-type RA receptors are sensitive to ATRA. All three cell lines however showed similar responses to the CYP26A1 inhibitor Liarozole. This finding indicates that regardless of RA receptor mutations, inhibition of ATRA metabolism will increase intracellular RA levels. Nanostring profiling analysis shows ATRA treatment of HT29 cells increases expression of <i>RARA<\/i>,<i>CYP26A1<\/i> (ATRA metabolizing enzyme), &#38; <i>KRT20<\/i> (differentiation marker), and decreases expression of CSC markers <i>LGR5<\/i> &#38; <i>ALDH1A1<\/i>. Moreover, ATRA treatment of both CRC cell lines decreases ALDH+ cell population size. These findings show upregulated RA signaling can increase differentiation and decrease CSC numbers in CRC.<br \/><b>Discussion <\/b>Our findings indicate that colon SCs are regulated by RA signaling mechanisms and dysregulation of RA signaling contributes to the SC overpopulation that drives CRC growth. Thus, therapeutically sensitizing CSCs to differentiation-inducing effects of RA agents should provide insight into design of new SC-targeted therapies for CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,ATRA,Colorectal cancer,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Victoria Oluwajuwon Hunsu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Caroline  O.

Chromosomal instability (CIN) has emerged as a hallmark of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as it has recently been shown to promote metastasis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which CIN drives metastasis are not completely understood. We have identified a discrete population of highly metastatic SOX2\/OCT4+ cells expressing elevated levels of epigenetic regulator EZH2 associated with increased CIN in both human and mouse TNBC. EZH2 histone methyl transferase (HMT) is the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), represses target genes through trimethylation of Histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Importantly, genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 lead to reduction of CIN and impaired metastasis. These findings led to the hypothesis that EZH2-mediated CIN constitutes a novel mechanism of metastasis regulation. To directly demonstrate epigenetic regulation of CIN, we used genome wide-Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&#38;RUN) in parallel with RNA-seq. Gene set enrichment of EZH2-repressed target genes directly implicated the spindle formation pathway network. The central core of this network comprised of tankyrase (TNKS), a multifunctional poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) previously implicated in DNA repair, telomere function and centrosome maturation. ChIP-PCR confirmed that EZH2 directly binds to the TNKS promoter, and CRISPR knockout of TNKS abrogated the ability of EZH2 inhibition in suppressing CIN, consistent with pharmacological inhibition of TNKS. More specifically, dysregulation of TNKS by EZH2 in OCT4\/SOX2+ cells lead to increased numbers of centrosomes and multipolar mitosis. To directly demonstrate the role of aberrant H3K27me3 in regulating chromosomal segregation during mitosis, we used dCas9-EZH2 or dCas9-EZH2 catalytically dead mutant together with chromosome-specific CRISPR guides to ectopically enhance H3K27 trimethylation at the pericentromeric region of specific chromosomes.<b> <\/b>Ectopic deposition of EZH2 at pericentromeric regions lead to increased CIN.<br \/>Conceptually, our work provides an unappreciated link between epigenetic regulation and CIN which have been hitherto studied in isolation. From a clinical perspective, demonstrating epigenetic regulation of CIN has opened the possibility for the development of first CIN suppressive therapeutic strategies targeting TNBC metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EZH2,Chromosomal instability,Metastatic tumors,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yang Bai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Albert Agustinus<sup>2<\/sup>, Cem Meydan<sup>1<\/sup>, Dylan  R.
