[{"Abstract":"Background: LAPC is associated with a median overall survival (OS) of 15-18 mos in contemporary clinical trials. CT is typically the initial treatment, and subsequent surgical resection with curative intent is rare. Pam is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the effects of connective tissue growth factor. Phase I and II trials (NCT01181245 and NCT02210559) of CT+pam provided the rationale for a Phase III study of pts with LAPC. CT plus pam\/placebo (PBO) is being evaluated in the Phase III LAPIS trial (NCT03941093).<br \/>Objective: LAPIS is evaluating the efficacy and safety of CT+pam\/PBO as first-line\/neoadjuvant therapy in unresectable LAPC.<br \/>Methods: LAPIS is a global, Phase III, PBO-controlled trial with six cycles of CT+pam\/PBO therapy given in a first-line\/neoadjuvant setting, surgical eligibility using protocol-specific response criteria, surgery, and follow-up periods, including long-term follow-up for OS. Major eligibility criteria include adults (&#8805;18 yrs of age); ECOG PS of 0-1; histologic\/cytologic confirmation of pancreatic cancer; LAPC diagnosis considered unresectable by standard criteria (NCCN v2.2018 and reviewed by central radiology); measurable disease by RECIST v1.1; and treatment-na&#239;ve status.

Pts received six cycles (24 wks) of first-line therapy prior to surgical eligibility decision. Surgical eligibility was defined per protocol for pts with &#8805;1 of the following: decline in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 &#8805;50%; FDG-PET value decrease by &#8805;30%; radiographic downstage to resectable\/borderline resectable criteria per NCCN. Surgical recommendation (resect or not) is provided by the central surgical board. Final decisions on surgery remain with site surgeons. Primary endpoint is OS. Key secondary endpoints include event-free survival [EFS, defined as time to &#8220;treatment failure&#8221; based on earliest occurrence of 1) failure to achieve local disease-free status at end of treatment and\/or after surgery; 2) local or distant recurrence; or 3) death], progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR; complete or partial response) by RECIST v 1.1. Safety (including treatment-emergent adverse events) is evaluated throughout the study, Days 28 and 60 after last CT dose, and Day 90 post-surgery. LAPIS enrollment is complete (N=284). Study completion is estimated for early 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-01 Design and analysis of clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Advanced cancer,Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,Human monoclonal antibodies,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vincent J.

However, recent studies have shown that Black PCa patients have a better response to certain therapeutic regimens than White PCa patients. This study focuses on addressing the critical need to determine novel relationships between ancestry-related genetic variation and PCa aggressiveness and response to secondary hormonal therapy in metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC). We conducted correlative science in a DoD Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC) prospective multicenter study of secondary hormonal therapy in mCRPC stratified by race, Abi Race. This study enrolled 50 self-reported Black and 50 self-reported White mCRPC patients, and such patients received abiraterone and prednisone until disease progression or adverse event. We performed metabolic profiling using serum samples from fasting patients at baseline and after treatment. In addition, we performed genome-wide genotyping using genomic DNA from whole blood specimens from patients at baseline. We then identified race- and ancestry-related metabolite and SNP variations that associated with outcome using a penalized Cox model approach. In addition, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Lasso Analysis to further study race-related metabolites and SNPs. From these analyses, we identified sphingolipids such as ceramide as race-related metabolites associated with outcome as well as SNPs in Sphingosine Kinase Type 1-Interacting Protein (SKIP) associated with outcome. In addition, our analyses suggest that sphingolipids such as ceramides and SKIP may regulate cancer-related biofunctions differently in Black and White mCRPC patients undergoing abiraterone treatment. Both sphingolipids and SKIP are components of the Sphingosine Rheostat, the regulatory component of sphingolipid cellular metabolism often exploited by various cancers, in which ceramides displays a pro-apoptotic role whereas sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is associated with an anti-apoptotic role and is indirectly regulated by SKIP via regulating the activity of Sphingosine Kinase (SPK1). Evaluation of the function of these sphingolipids and SKIP in PCa cell drug response and aggressiveness are currently underway. These findings are furthering understanding of race- and ancestry-related biological factors that influence response to secondary hormonal therapy in mCRPC and have the potential to impact selection of patients for secondary hormonal therapy and to mitigate PCa disparity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-01 Design and analysis of clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Metabolomics,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sean Alan Piwarski<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tyler Allen<sup>1<\/sup>, Bonnie LaCroix<sup>1<\/sup>, Lauren Howard<sup>2<\/sup>, Morgan Paul<sup>2<\/sup>, Nick Bachelder<sup>2<\/sup>, Alex Sibley<sup>2<\/sup>, Steve Patierno<sup>1<\/sup>, Terry Hyslop<sup>3<\/sup>, Kouros Owzar<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel George<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Freedman<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Duke Cancer Institute - GU Oncology, Duke University, Durham, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Duke University, Durham, NC,<sup>3<\/sup>Jefferson Health's Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f2340428-6070-403b-8fb9-2fd7364e4a75","ControlNumber":"2516","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

To enable forward and reverse translational assays to best understand patient-specified biomarkers, high-plex assays which can be performed on individual slides are critical. We&#8217;ve developed the GeoMx&#174; Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) and CosMx&#8482; Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) to allow researchers to explore more hypotheses simultaneously from standard histopathology slides. We demonstrate on standard FFPE sections how the GeoMx and CosMx platforms integrate within the context of biomarker discovery. The GeoMx platform can resolve transcriptome-wide RNA expression profiles or 150+ protein targets from tissue structures selected by pathological review. The CosMx platform allows subcellular profiling of up to 1000 RNA transcripts or 64 proteins from a single slide. We demonstrate the integration of GeoMx and CosMx into a multi-modal approach to how high-plex spatial platforms can complement conventional diagnostic assays for translational research. This includes integration with downstream analytical tools such as digital pathology suites as well as machine learning approaches to model patient outcomes. Spatial technologies, such as GeoMx and CosMx, present groundbreaking opportunities for improving accuracy in biomarker discovery and for providing rich biological insight beyond low-plex profiling approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-01 Design and analysis of clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jason  W.

The implementation of high-plex analyte spatial platforms, such as GeoMx&#174; Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP), is increasing within discovery and development approaches for biomarkers associated with clinical outcome. The surge in spatial platforms parallels the increase of digital pathology in translational and clinical research studies. The integration of these two workflows has the potential to benefit diagnostic and therapeutic development. This study aims to facilitate the implementation of DSP in tissue analysis workflows helping those involved in drug discovery and development efforts to (1) assess platform feasibility for their research, (2) design effective DSP experiments, and (3) enable generation of high-quality, usable spatial data from large cohort studies. The BioPharma GeoMx DSP Consortium has developed consensus-based best practices incorporating the expertise of panel members via virtual meetings. Best practices guidelines for spatial profiling of tissue biopsies in drug discovery and development using GeoMx stands to advance current standard practices in tissue analysis. These best practices recommendations encompass every step of the implementation of DSP in standard tissue analysis workflows, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement, testing, defining experimental conditions prior to execution of large-scale studies, and considerations in assessing assay performance. This study offers a practical reference for the optimal implementation of GeoMx DSP in exploratory sample analysis for drug discovery and development studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-01 Design and analysis of clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Leslie Abad<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Maxine McClain<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Edward Bonnevie<sup>2<\/sup>, Benjamin Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Sarah Church<sup>1<\/sup>, Gokhan Demirkan<sup>1<\/sup>, Premi Haynes<sup>3<\/sup>, Kelly Hunter<sup>4<\/sup>, Anil Kersarwani<sup>5<\/sup>, David Krull<sup>2<\/sup>, Yan Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Prithwish Pal<sup>6<\/sup>, Corinne Ramos<sup>7<\/sup>, Deniliz Rodriguez<sup>8<\/sup>, Jessica Runyon<sup>9<\/sup>, Julien Tessier<sup>10<\/sup>, Esperanza Anguiano<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA,<sup>2<\/sup>GSK, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>BMS, Cambridge, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Propath, Hereford, United Kingdom,<sup>5<\/sup>GSK, london, United Kingdom,<sup>6<\/sup>Illumina, San Diego, CA,<sup>7<\/sup>Imabiotech, Loos, France,<sup>8<\/sup>BMS, Clifton, NJ,<sup>9<\/sup>Bruker, St Louis, MO,<sup>10<\/sup>Sanofi, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"90c7696d-1b1c-4713-aa45-661136ef19c4","ControlNumber":"8090","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

AE is also shown to have clinical association. However, due to its complexity, utilization of AE data has been suboptimal. This study takes a unique approach to utilize AE parameters and to derive a set of innovative AE metrics which could have the potential as a predictive biomarker of treatment response and survival outcomes.<br \/>Methods: The AE-derived biomarkers integrated toxicity severity level (grade) and treatment relatedness, with further tune-up by AE occurrence, frequency, and duration. Implementation of AE-derived biomarkers was performed in a comprehensive strategy starting from overall AE, toxicity category, down to individual AE. Landmark analysis at day 30 from initial treatment date was used to define early AE biomarkers. Two study cohorts (Cohort A and B) from two immunotherapy trials in late-stage non-small cell lung cancer were used to evaluate the potential of AE-derived biomarkers. Clinical outcomes for statistical analysis included progression-free survival, overall survival, disease control, and duration of treatment.<br \/>Results: Both cohorts showed that early AEs were associated with clinical outcomes. Patients experienced with low-grade AEs (including treatment related AEs) at early time point had improved PFS, OS, and were associated with disease control. The significant early AEs included treatment related low-grade AE in overall AE, endocrine disorders, hypothyroidism (immune-related adverse event (irAE)), and platelet count decreased for Cohort A and low-grade AE in overall AE, gastrointestinal disorders, and nausea for Cohort B. In contrast, patients with early development of higher-grade AEs tended to have poorer PFS, OS, and correlated with PD. The associated early AEs included treatment related high-grade AE in overall AE, gastrointestinal disorders with two members, diarrhea and vomiting, for Cohort A and high-grade AE in overall AE, 3 toxicity categories, and 5 related individual AEs for Cohort B. One treatment related low-grade AE, alanine aminotransferase increased, was irAE and correlated with worse OS in Cohort A.<br \/>Conclusions: The study demonstrated evidence of AE utility in predicting positive and negative clinical outcomes. It could be treatment related AEs or combination of treatment related and not related AEs. Grade level played a key role in determining direction of clinical outcomes with low-grade leaning to positive effect and high-grade to negative impact. Significant AEs covering overall AEs, toxicity category AEs, to individual AEs provided relatively comprehensive view of AE results for clinical relevance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-03 Statistical modeling for cancer studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Statistical approach,adverse event,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dung-Tsa Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jhanelle Gray<sup>1<\/sup>, Andreas Saltos<sup>2<\/sup>, Trevor A Rose<sup>3<\/sup>, Alberto Chiappori<sup>2<\/sup>, Zachary Thompson<sup>4<\/sup>, Ram Thapa<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Thoracic Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>Radiology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL,<sup>4<\/sup>Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dba5a1c5-07d0-474d-89f4-e0a9d36b9f93","ControlNumber":"2868","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Women with personal history of breast cancer are at increased risk of second primary cancers including ovarian cancer. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is a well-established option for ovarian cancer risk reduction. However, the benefit of ovarian cancer risk reduction should be balanced against the health sequelae caused by the premature estrogen loss. We examined the associations between BSO after breast cancer diagnosis and long-term health outcomes, using large-scale linked electronic health records.<br \/>Methods: We selected women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer before the age of 75 between 1995 and 2019 using data from the National Cancer Registration Dataset (NCRD), which describes all cancers registered in England. These women were linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care (APC) dataset to identify the delivery of BSO, while the use of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) was identified from the community dispensed prescriptions dataset. Long-term outcomes (e.g., ischemic heart disease) were selected from HES, and the NCRD provided data on second cancer diagnosis and all-cause mortality. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data on stage, grade, hormonal receptor status and ethnicity. Women were followed from the date of breast cancer diagnosis to development of an outcome of interest or censoring or end of data collection. Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine the associations, with BSO modeled as a time-dependent covariate. The analysis was stratified by patient age at BSO (&#60;55 and &#8805;55 years).<br \/>Results: The study included 566,731 women, with median follow up time 8.40 (IQR: 4.4-14.5) years. Of those, 23,881 women had BSO after their breast cancer diagnosis. BSO before the age of 55 was not associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR):1.03, 95%CI:0.98-1.08), while BSO after the age of 55 was associated with a small reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR:0.93, 95%CI:0.89-0.99). BSO before and after the age of 55 was associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease with HRs of 1.23(95%CI:1.07-1.41) and 1.13(95%CI:1.02-1.25), respectively. There was no association between BSO and cerebrovascular events (HR:0.97, 95%CI:0.82-1.15, for BSO under age 55, HR:0.96, 95%CI:0.87-1.07, for BSO after age 55). Ongoing analyses are investigating the associations stratified by the severity of cardiovascular outcome (fatal\/non-fatal) and the use of HRT, and the associations with second cancers and neuropsychiatric outcomes.<br \/>Conclusion: BSO after 55 does not appear to be associated with detrimental health effects in women diagnosed with breast cancer. Further examination of the associations between BSO and other long-term health outcomes and the influence of HRT in younger women is needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-01  Surgical oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Ovarian cancer,Epidemiology,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hend Hassan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tameera Rahman<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Bacon<sup>3<\/sup>, Craig Knott<sup>4<\/sup>, Isaac Allen<sup>1<\/sup>, Catherine Huntley<sup>5<\/sup>, Lucy Loong<sup>6<\/sup>, Yvonne Walburga<sup>1<\/sup>, Katrina Lavelle<sup>2<\/sup>, Eva Morris<sup>7<\/sup>, Steven Hardy<sup>2<\/sup>, Bethany Torr<sup>8<\/sup>, Diana M Eccles<sup>9<\/sup>, Clare Turnbull<sup>5<\/sup>, Marc Tischkowitz<sup>10<\/sup>, Paul Pharoah<sup>11<\/sup>, Antonis C.

Treatment with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) in selected patients has been shown to improve survival. In this study, we aimed to identify potential prognostic factors to predict survival in CRS-HIPEC patients and explore the molecular mechanism implicated in CPC.<br \/>Patient demographic and clinicopathological characteristics, including MSI status, RAS\/RAF, TP53, and APC mutational status were collected from 70 CPC patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC procedure at National Cancer Centre Singapore. Synchronous peritoneal metastasis (median OS = 43.6 months, p=0.008) and the presence of ascites (median OS = 29.53 months, p=0.013) were linked to poorer overall survival. In comparison, no significant difference in OS was observed when stratifying for tumor mutational status. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of ascites was the most significant clinical prognostic factor in CPC (HR 3.097; 95% CI 1.18-8.12). To interrogate the role of ascites in the biology of CPC, we performed transcriptomic profiling of CPC and peritoneal mesothelial cell lines, and identified Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) pathway as a common signaling pathway enriched upon treatment with CPC ascites. Proteomics analysis of CPC ascites revealed that EMT-related proteins were highly abundant. Combining both analyses, we identified 5 putative prognostic targets (TNC, POSTN, LUM, THBS1 and MXRA5) that drive ascites-induced EMT process in CPC.<br \/>Taken together, these findings suggest that careful consideration should be given to performing CRS-HIPEC in CPC patients with clinically observable ascites, as CRS-HIPEC alone is insufficient to improve survival and novel therapeutic strategies are required as an adjunct. The combination of transcriptomics and proteomics analysis of CPC ascites provides insights into the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment, which can be harnessed for identification of prognostic surrogate markers and future development of targeted therapy in CPC. In this study, we identified putative targetable targets driving ascites-induced EMT activation independent of the inherent molecular aberration in the CPC tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-01  Surgical oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ascites fluid,Prognostic factors,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Peritoneal metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Josephine Hendrikson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ying Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Qiu Xuan Tan<sup>2<\/sup>, Joey Wee-Shan Tan<sup>2<\/sup>, Gillian Ng<sup>2<\/sup>, Clara Yieh Lin Chong<sup>2<\/sup>, Chin Jin Seo<sup>1<\/sup>, Jolene Si Min Wong<sup>1<\/sup>, Claramae Shulyn Chia<sup>1<\/sup>, Chin-Ann Johnny Ong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Sarcoma, Peritoneal and Rare Tumours (SPRinT), National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>Laboratory of Applied Human Genetics, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1066f231-d447-40c5-992a-30393b2aa5e7","ControlNumber":"3232","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Predicting recurrence and survival outcomes for patients with early stage STS remains a challenge. In this study, we identify prognostic biomarkers from clinical and transcriptomic data form a large set of early stage STS. Primary tumor samples from 69 subjects with STS were sequenced using the Tempus xT targeted DNA and whole transcriptome next-generation sequencing platforms. The most common histologies included were liposarcoma (n=22), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n=19), and leiomyosarcoma (n=12). As expected, high-grade tumors were associated with decreased DFS and OS times while tumor histology was only correlated with OS. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) values for seven Hallmark genesets were correlated with both DFS and OS; including pro-tumor survival pathways (p53, Apoptosis, TNF-&#945; via NF-&#954;B), tumor proliferation pathways (MTORC1, MYC Targets, Mitotic Spindle), and UV Response signaling. These pathways are associated with tumor proliferation as well as an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To assess the TME of these tumors we estimated immune cell infiltration using CIBERSORTx. Of the 22 cell types accounted for by CIBERSORTx, only elevated infiltration of M2 Macrophages were associated with poor DFS and OS. To further determine TME activation we assessed the expression of 74 known immune response associated genes. Only <i>PDCD1<\/i> (PD-1) was associated with reduced DFS and OS times. Clustering on the nine variables identified here to correlate with both DFS and OS revealed two distinct clusters demonstrating similar histologies. While histologies were similar across clusters, cluster 2 exclusively included high-grade tumors while cluster 1 was made up of 57.4% high-grade tumors. Sub-classifying cluster 1 into low and high-grade subgroups demonstrated a stepped biomarker expression pattern associated with both tumor grade and cluster membership. Using established TME genesets, high-grade tumors demonstrated higher tumor proliferative scores than low-grade tumors, while cluster 2 tumors demonstrated increased tumor associated macrophage signaling. In a multivariable model, cluster membership outperformed tumor grade and histology as the only significant predictor of DFS or OS. Taken together, while tumor grade is a strong predictor of clinical outcomes following surgical resection in STS, immunosuppressive signaling patters may help to identify patients at the highest risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-01  Surgical oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Immunosuppression,Surgical resection,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nathan David Seligson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yan  W.
