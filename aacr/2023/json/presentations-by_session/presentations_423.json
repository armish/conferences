[{"Abstract":"Background: STING emerges as a key immune sensor and activated STING pathway plays a key role in innate and adaptive immune response. STING agonist has shown promising potency to stimulate anti-tumor immunity. Considering immune-related toxicity due to systemic administration, as well as difficulty in intra-tumor administration, targeted delivery of STING agonist by iADC is warranted. We developed CD73-STING iADC JAB-X1800, which uses anti-CD73 mAb for targeted delivery of payload JAB-27670, a highly potent non-cyclic dinucleotide STING agonist.<br \/>Method: Binding assay and HEK293-STING-luciferase reporter assay were performed to test affinity of JAB-27670. Tumor cells with CD73 expression and THP-1 cells were co-cultured in the presences of iADC JAB-X1800 to assess the IFN-&#946; production. The cell killing activity of iADC JAB-X1800 was evaluated when cancer cells co-cultured with human PBMCs. Furthermore, human and mouse plasma stability of iADC JAB-X1800 was assessed. Finally, the anti-tumor effects of iADC JAB-X1800 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 were evaluated in animal models.<br \/>Results: JAB-27670 is a highly potent STING agonist with sub-nanomolar EC50 in binding and luciferase reporter assays. In CD73-expressing cancer cells and THP-1 co-culture experiments, iADC JAB-X1800 induced IFN-&#946; production with significant improvement compared with the free payload. JAB-X1800 also induced potent killing <i>in vitro<\/i>. JAB-X1800 is stable in human and mouse plasma. A single dose of JAB-X1800 induced tumor regression in MDA-MB-231 xenograft model and hCD73-MC38 syngeneic model. JAB-X1800 conferred immunologic memory when tumor free mice were re-challenged. JAB-X1800 showed synergistic anti-tumor activity with anti-PD-1 in hCD73-MC38 syngeneic model.<br \/>Conclusions: The CD73-targeted STING agonist iADC JAB-X1800 demonstrated high stability in plasma, robust activity, and good tolerability in animal models, supporting clinical development of JAB-X1800 alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 for patients with CD73-expressing tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),STING Agonist,CD73,Immunostimulator,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yang Ye<sup><\/sup>, Guiqun Yang<sup><\/sup>, Hongling Wang<sup><\/sup>, Xin Sun<sup><\/sup>, Yanping Wang<sup><\/sup>, Fashun Yan<sup><\/sup>, Lei Wang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Wei Long<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Jacobio Pharmaceutics Co., Ltd., Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1818c694-1c7e-4e2f-a42a-006dcfb1c127","ControlNumber":"6606","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

With new treatment strategies and druggable targets being identified at an increasing pace, the number of patients eligible for cancer immunotherapy is expected to expand steadily. However, promising therapeutic developments face hurdles in translating preclinical findings into therapy since conventional 2D cancer models hold low clinical predictive value. HUB developed an innovative alternative, build on the discovery that adult stem cells proliferate and organise into three-dimensional organotypic structures when they are embedded into extracellular matrix. Patient specific organoids are generated from healthy and malignant tissues and stored as biobanks with high quality and reproducibility. HUB Organoids recapitulate complex characteristics of the original parental tissue, including molecular heterogeneity, and morphological and functional traits.<br \/>Since cancer progression and responses to immunotherapy are governed by immune cell interactions in the tumour microenvironment, we developed an assay in which various types of tumour organoids are co-cultured with T cells modified with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR T cells) to assess the cytotoxic potential. CAR-T cell therapy has been demonstrated to be efficacious against many hematological malignancies, however therapeutic application to treat solid cancers remains challenging. Our organoid-T cell co-culture assay offers a good platform to study the response of tumour organoids on the CAR T cells and will greatly contribute to our understanding of the critical factors that determine a successful CAR T cell therapy. In collaboration with GSK, HUB tested the cytotoxicity of GSK CAR T cells which target specific target antigen on human colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids. Six HUB CRC organoid models were selected based on differential expression levels of target antigen that was confirmed by FACS antibody staining. To evaluate GSK CAR T cell mediated organoid killing, caspase 3\/7 expression was monitored at various timepoints and IFN&#947; secretion was measured by ELISA. For control, staurosporine and nonspecific-CAR T cells were included. Detected CRC-organoid killing demonstrated to be in line with antigen expression levels, indicating the specificity of the tested CAR T cells. Nevertheless, some CRC-organoid models demonstrated more resilient to CAR T cell mediated killing and further evaluation revealed upregulation of check point molecules such as PD-L1. This study reveals that tumour organoid-T cell co-culture assay hold value for preclinical development of CAR T-cell products and for evaluating tumour-evasion strategies. Moreover, this platform could potentially predict patient specific responses to CAR- T-cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,T- cell bispecific antibodies,co-culture assay,cytotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lorenz Jahn<sup>1<\/sup>, Maxime Kempers<sup>1<\/sup>, Roel Verker<sup>1<\/sup>, Wies van Dooremalen<sup>1<\/sup>, Linda Steinacher<sup>2<\/sup>, Pleun Hombrink<sup>1<\/sup>, Farzin Pourfarzad<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert  G.

Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies for cancer indications, and anti-TNF-&#945; monoclonal antibody against autoimmune disorders represent some of most successful therapeutics in the past decade. Over 100 therapeutic targets suitable for antibody therapy have been identified for various disease indications, with several currently in late-stage clinical trials. In addition, there has been an explosion in the various types of therapeutic antibody modalities due to the increasing number of antibody engineering platforms. The new emerging bi-specific T-cell engaging antibodies (BiTEs) along with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have demonstrated superior therapeutic qualities over the traditional monoclonal antibodies.<br \/>Here, we describe a pipeline to extensively characterize the various antibody therapeutics <i>in vitro<\/i> utilizing multiple innovative technologies. Assays to determine target expression and binding potency provide a thorough understanding of the target engagement. Furthermore, we present data from an innovative technology platform, the z-Movi, which measures cell avidity to predict invitro effector functions of T-cell engaging therapies, enabling more robust read-outs and could drive the lead selection of said therapies. Several mechanisms of action of different antibodies were investigated and relevant case studies describing the innate immune effector functions and the signaling pathway modulation are presented. Using a unique label-free approach, the xCELLigence, we report on the kinetics of target cell killing mediated by lymphocytes upon recognition of antigen-antibody complexes. Finally, safety assessment studies focusing on on-target\/off-tumor effects of antibodies on primary cells were conducted. The cytokine profiling and cell viability assays to assess potential risk due to exaggerated levels of cytokine, reiterate the specificity and safety of the next generation of antibody therapeutics and support Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. In conclusion, we provide a comprehensive report on the <i>in vitro<\/i> characterization of the advanced antibody therapeutics, showcasing a pipeline for development and functional characterization of various antibody modalities, including bispecific T-cell engagers. This workflow can be used to progress a wide range of engineered antibodies from pre-clinical to the clinical phase of the drug discovery process.

The PROTECT<sup>TM<\/sup> (PROgrammed Tumor Engagement &#38; Checkpoint\/Costimulation Targeting) platform is designed to tackle these challenges by combining a masking domain that, when cleaved, provides additional immune-modulatory properties. The PROTECT<sup>TM<\/sup> mask consists of a PD1-PDL1 protein pair that sterically hinders CD3 binding in the periphery. The PD-L1 moiety is fused to the anti-CD3 antibody via a linker sequence containing a protease cleavage site. Once cleaved, the resultant molecule is a trispecific antibody providing TCE activity, checkpoint inhibition, and additional differentiated functionality. Previous studies employing pan T cell cytotoxicity assays showed the PROTECT<sup>TM<\/sup> mask increased the therapeutic window by 400-fold. We have now expanded our in vitro evaluation to include more relevant PBMC systems showing a greater expansion of the therapeutic window. In vivo treatment of established tumours with the unmasked trispecific results in complete and durable anti-tumour responses. Here we extend those in vivo studies (in context of established tumour models) to evaluate unmasking and pharmacokinetic properties. We further evaluated the unique and differentiated mechanism of action of the cleaved trispecific to not only enhance engagement of effector T-cells with tumor cells through avidity driven cis-engagement of a tumor associated antigen (TAA) and PD-L1 co-expressed on tumor cells, but to also enhance co-engagement of a TAA with effector T cells co-expressing PD-L1. In addition, the ability of the cleaved trispecific to bridge autologous T cells with DCs results in enhanced T cell activation and proliferation. Finally, TCR dependent signaling assays confirmed the ability of the cleaved trispecific to overcome PD1\/PDL1 checkpoint activity. Taken together, the PROTECT<sup>TM<\/sup> platform integrates a masking and immune-modulatory technology that has the potential to widen the therapeutic window of CD3 engagers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Tumor microenvironment,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Prodrugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anna von Rossum<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Genevieve Desjardins<sup><\/sup>, Nichole Escalante<sup><\/sup>, Wingkie Wong<sup><\/sup>, Bryant Harbourne<sup><\/sup>, Janessa Li<sup><\/sup>, Begonia Silva Moreno<sup><\/sup>, Prajwal Raghunatha<sup><\/sup>, Richard Kunze<sup><\/sup>, Madeline Fung<sup><\/sup>, Florian Heinkel<sup><\/sup>, Harsh Pratap<sup><\/sup>, Kevin Haworth<sup><\/sup>, Eric Escobar-Cabrera<sup><\/sup>, Brandon Clavette<sup><\/sup>, Surjit Dixit<sup><\/sup>, Nina Weisser<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Spreter von Kreudenstein<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Zymeworks, Vancouver, BC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bb77b810-f440-43db-ba63-431303e891ec","ControlNumber":"7317","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A. von Rossum, <\/b> None..<br><b>G.

Due to its roles in tissue remodeling and cancer pathogenesis, therapeutic targeting of integrin-&#945;V&#946;6 has been investigated for both fibrotic diseases and cancers. ITGB6 is homogenously overexpressed in numerous solid tumor types, including breast, head and neck, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancers. Additionally, its expression is an unfavorable prognostic marker in multiple cancers. However, past attempts to therapeutically target ITGB6 have been hindered by its expression in several normal tissues, including bladder, skin, lung, kidney, and muscle. For example, clinical testing of an integrin &#945;V&#946;6-targeting monoclonal antibody was discontinued reportedly due to toxicity concerns. To reduce on-target\/off-tumor toxicities from ITGB6 expression in normal tissues and to enable safe targeting of ITGB6 in solid tumors, we developed an ITGB6-targeting ProTriTAC&#61652; (<i>Pro<\/i>tease-activated <i>Tri<\/i>-specific <i>T<\/i> cell <i>A<\/i>ctivating <i>C<\/i>onstruct), a T cell engager prodrug which is engineered to be preferentially activated in tumor tissue. ProTriTACs consists of three humanized antibody-derived binding domains on a single polypeptide chain: anti-albumin for half-life extension, anti-CD3 for T cell engagement, and anti-target antigen for tumor cell engagement. The anti-albumin domain, bearing a masking moiety and a protease-cleavable linker, keeps the prodrug inert by inhibiting binding of the adjacent anti-CD3 domain to T cells. Cleavage of the linker by tumor-associated proteases removes the anti-albumin domain along with the masking moiety to reveal a potent active drug that directs T cell killing within the tumor. As designed, in vitro binding and functional assays show that the protease-activated T cell engager has &#62;1000-fold improved binding to human T cells and ~100-fold improved T cell killing compared to the intact masked prodrug. In immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human T cells, anti-ITGB6 ProTriTAC demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity in multiple ITGB6-expressing xenograft tumor models, including HCC70 (breast), CAL27 (head and neck), and HPAFII (pancreatic), with complete tumor regression as low as 30 &#956;g\/kg. To determine the potential toxicity and toxicokinetic characteristics of anti-ITGB6 ProTriTAC, an intra-animal dose escalation was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Starting at 20 &#956;g\/kg with weekly 3-fold dose escalations, anti-ITGB6 ProTriTAC was well tolerated up to 540 &#956;g\/kg, which was the highest dose tested. The preclinical activity in rodent tumor models, coupled to its tolerability in cynomolgus monkeys, support the development of anti-ITGB6 ProTriTAC as a therapeutic in a broad range of ITGB6-expressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Tumor-associated antigen (TAA),Prodrugs,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Regina  J.

Trop2 is homogenously overexpressed in numerous solid tumor types, including breast, head and neck, prostate, bladder, and non-small cell carcinoma; however, Trop2 is also expressed in several normal tissues, including skin, respiratory tract, and female reproductive organs. Although Trop2-targeted antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have demonstrated clinical activity, with regulatory approvals in subsets of breast and bladder cancers, their broader utility is still hampered by off-target payload-mediated toxicities. To address this issue, and to avoid on-target off-tumor toxicities, we developed a Trop2-targeting ProTriTAC&#8482; (<i>Pro<\/i>tease-activated <i>Tri<\/i>-specific <i>T<\/i> cell <i>A<\/i>ctivating <i>C<\/i>onstruct), a T cell engager prodrug which is engineered to be preferentially activated in tumor tissue. ProTriTACs consists of three humanized antibody-derived binding domains on a single polypeptide chain: anti-albumin for half-life extension, anti-CD3 for T cell engagement, and anti-target antigen for tumor cell engagement. The anti-albumin domain, bearing a masking moiety and a protease-cleavable linker, keeps the prodrug inert by inhibiting binding of the adjacent anti-CD3 domain to T cells. Cleavage of the linker by tumor-associated proteases removes the anti-albumin domain along with the masking moiety to reveal a potent active drug that directs T cell killing within the tumor. As designed, in vitro binding and functional assays show that the protease-activated T cell engager has &#62;1000-fold improved binding to primary human T cells and ~100-fold improved T cell killing compared to its intact masked prodrug. In immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human T cells, anti-Trop2 ProTriTAC demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity in multiple xenograft tumor models, including HCC70 (breast), CAL27 (head and neck), and HPAFII (pancreatic), with complete tumor regression as low as 30 &#956;g\/kg. To determine the potential toxicity and toxicokinetic characteristics of anti-Trop2 ProTriTAC, an intra-animal dose escalation was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys until individual maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The starting dose was 20 &#956;g\/kg with weekly 3-fold dose escalations until MTD. The one-month study revealed that anti-Trop2 ProTriTAC was tolerated at the 180 &#956;g\/kg dose level, but not at the next higher dose level of 540 &#956;g\/kg. Toxicokinetics, gross pathology, histopathology, and cytokine data will be presented. The preclinical activity in rodent tumor models, coupled to its tolerability in cynomolgus monkeys, support the development of anti-Trop2 ProTriTAC as a therapeutic in a broad range of Trop2-expressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Prodrugs,Novel anticancer agents,Tumor-associated antigen (TAA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sony  S.

Clinical data consist of pharmacodynamic responses reported as non-specific cytokine release, transient drop of CD40-expressing cells in blood and induction of co-stimulatory ligands\/receptors on antigen-presenting cells, but so far clinically meaningful efficacy data on monotherapy use is lacking. Clinical data also indicate a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with excessive immune activation leading to immune exhaustion when combined with check-point inhibitors[1]. Intratumoral route of administration, bispecific antibodies for tumor drug localization or Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) carrying antigenic cargo are or have been assessed, but have associated clinical utility enigmas. Herein we present a novel solution ensuring modular peptide delivery along with an efficient T cell priming strategy; a bivalent anti-CD40 agonistic antibody equipped with a peptide-binding single chain variable fragment (scFv) that binds a short peptide tag (pTag) in the low nM range. The resulting drug strategy makes use of synthetic long peptide production of any tumor-associated antigen (TAA) of choice where the pTag itself ensures simple conjugate production to the protein, through affinity linkage, leading to a final rapid in-hospital mixing step. Data suggest that the novel candidate drug (STRIKE2001), now developed based on the ADAC concept[2], retains similar agonistic activity in its bispecific, IgG2 format and does not inhibit CD40L binding to the CD40 protein. Data further show impressive expansion of endogenous tumor-specific T cells (as measured by tetramer staining), along with effective anti-tumor responses in the TC1 model. In addition, by using the subcutaneous delivery strategy CD40 agonist exposure to liver and spleen is vastly reduced, limiting systemic immune toxicity\/exhaustion risks[3].<br \/>[1] Padr&#243;n, L.J., <i>et al.<\/i> Sotigalimab and\/or nivolumab with chemotherapy in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer: clinical and immunologic analyses from the randomized phase 2 PRINCE trial. <i>Nat Med<\/i> <b>28<\/b>, 1167-1177 (2022). https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/s41591-022-01829-9<br \/>[2] Eltahir, M., <i>et al.<\/i> (2022), An Adaptable Antibody-Based Platform for Flexible Synthetic Peptide Delivery Built on Agonistic CD40 Antibodies.

Blocking CD47 on RBCs, such as by magrolimab, has led to anemia, requiring a priming and maintenance dosing schedule in the clinic. ADG153 is a highly differentiated masked anti-CD47 SAFEbody in IgG1 isotype with enhanced ADCC and ADCP functions, in contrast to magrolimab of IgG4 isotype that lacks ADCC and has weaker ADCP effector functions. In normal tissues, the SAFEbody masking moiety is expected to shield ADG153 from binding to CD47; however, in the presence of highly upregulated CD47 in protease-rich tumor microenvironment (TME), the masked antibody can engage dynamically with highly expressed CD47 and can be cleaved, enabling efficient binding to CD47, blocking CD47\/SIRP&#945; signaling, and triggering strong anti-tumor activities in solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of ADG153 or magrolimab analog (magrolimab) was assessed across several solid tumor xenograft models. Human CD47\/SIRP&#945; knock-in mice, harboring CD47-positive xenograft tumors, were used to determine CD47 receptor occupancy (RO) on normal tissues vs. tumors following dosing with ADG153 or magrolimab.<br \/>Results: ADG153 monotherapy demonstrated strong anti-tumor activities in SCID mice in multiple solid tumor xenograft models, including gastric cancer, SCLC, TNBC, and ovarian cancer models, with mean tumor growth inhibition (TGI) ranging from 75%-99%. Notably, in 2 of these models, the ADG153 efficacy was significantly stronger than that of magrolimab at the same dose level, supporting the importance of IgG1 in introducing ADCC- and ADCP-mediated solid tumor killing effects. In the human CD47\/SIRP&#945; knock-in xenograft mouse model, ADG153 and magrolimab dosing resulted in &#60;10% and ~75% CD47 RO on RBCs, respectively. Magrolimab dosing resulted in high RO on normal tissues, but very low RO on tumors. In contrast, ADG153 treatment resulted in low RO on the majority of the normal tissues and RO higher than that achieved by magrolimab on tumors, consistent with the significantly dampened antigen sink liabilities for the masked ADG153.<br \/>Conclusion: ADG153 demonstrates significantly reduced antigen sink liabilities and favorable CD47 engagement in the TME, which are highly differentiated from other anti-CD47 agents. ADG153 is locally enriched and efficiently cleaved in tumors, engages its target, and elicits potent anti-tumor activities in multiple solid tumor xenograft models. These results indicate that the ADG153 SAFEbody is a novel anti-CD47 IgG1 antibody prodrug with strong ADCC and ADCP capacities and substantially reduced liabilities, supporting its advancement into clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Immune checkpoint,Tumor microenvironment,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Aaron Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Peng Zou<sup>2<\/sup>, Songmao Zheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianfeng Shi<sup>3<\/sup>, Guizhong Liu<sup>3<\/sup>, Yan Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Felix Du<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Peter Luo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jiangchun Xu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Adagene Inc., San Diego, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Translational Medicine, Adagene Ltd, Suzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Adagene Ltd, Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8a205175-18e5-4508-a13f-590db72981f9","ControlNumber":"3648","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

In many solid tumors TROP2 upregulation is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and decreased survival in difficult-to-treat cancers, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. TROP2 ADCs have been developed and one has been approved in breast cancer and advanced bladder cancer. The toxicity associated with the toxin payload and the development of resistance to the payload limits their use.<br \/>We previously described an anti-TROP2 heavy chain-only antibody (HCAb), KJ-103. KJ-103 has demonstrated high potency in <i>in vivo<\/i> preclinical human models, including breast cancer, colon cancer, esophageal carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy of KJ-103 was strongly diminished by use of a IgG4-FALA variant which has negligible interaction with Fc gamma receptors indicating that effector function is the primary mechanism of action. Activity in mouse strains with deficiency in different immune cell types showed that macrophages were the predominant effector cell responsible for <i>in vivo<\/i> activity. Analysis of the xenograft microenvironment from different cancer models established a clear correlation between the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy and the degree of macrophage infiltration that was independent of the CD47 IHC score.<br \/><i>In vitro<\/i>, KJ-103 induces the phagocytosis by human macrophages of M0, M1 and M2 subtypes.

KJ-103 has been humanized and has the same degree of activity as the parental antibody. Immunohistochemistry showed that the KJ-103 epitope was expressed across many tumor types, including breast, colon, ovarian, and head and neck among others.

Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a highly potent topoisomerase I (Topo I) inhibitor payload via a stable, tumor-selective, tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Dato-DXd has shown encouraging antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with NSCLC and TNBC as part of the first-in-human, Phase 1 study (NCT03401385). To enhance clinical responses, clinical trials evaluating combination therapy of Dato-DXd with PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors in NSCLC and TNBC are currently ongoing (e.g. NCT04526691 and NCT03742102). Here we report preclinical evidence for supporting increased antitumor activity of Dato-DXd in combination with PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors using a syngeneic mouse tumor model and its impact on tumor immunity.<br \/>Methods: MC38 mouse colon adenocarcinoma cells stably transfected with human TROP2 (hTROP2_MC38) were inoculated subcutaneously in immunocompetent C57BL6 mice or immunodeficient nude mice and the antitumor activity of Dato-DXd with or without mouse PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors was evaluated. The tumor infiltrating immune cells in hTROP2_MC38 tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry at 3 days and 10 days after dosing. In addition, the impact of CD8+ T cell depletion on the antitumor activity of Dato-DXd against hTROP2_MC38 tumors in C57BL6 mice was evaluated.<br \/>Results: Dato-DXd showed stronger antitumor activity against hTROP2_MC38 tumors in immunocompetent C57BL6 mice than in immunodeficient nude mice, which suggests that immune cells play an important role in the mechanism of action (MoA) of Dato-DXd. The combination of Dato-DXd and mouse PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors enhanced antitumor activity compared to monotherapy against hTROP2_MC38 tumors in C57BL6 mice. Activation of the dendritic cells in hTROP2_MC38 tumors in C57BL6 mice was observed after Dato-DXd monotherapy or combination therapy with mouse PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors, which led to the increase of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Involvement of CD8+ T cells in the MoA of Dato-DXd was also supported by the result that CD8+ T cell depletion in C57BL6 mice decreased the antitumor activity of Dato-DXd against hTROP2_MC38 tumors. In addition, activation of tumor infiltrating NK cells and macrophages was observed after Dato-DXd monotherapy or combination therapy, suggesting the potential effect on innate immunity.<br \/>Conclusion: These results suggest that Dato-DXd may stimulate tumor immunity and sensitize tumors to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors. The combination of Dato-DXd and PD-1\/PD-L1 blockers could be a valuable therapy for patients with TROP2-positive tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Immune checkpoint blockade,Combination therapy,Trop-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daisuke Okajima<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Satoru Yasuda<sup>1<\/sup>, Takami Suzuki<sup>1<\/sup>, Michiko Kitamura<sup>1<\/sup>, Junko Yamaguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Takanori Maejima<sup>1<\/sup>, Tsuyoshi Karibe<sup>1<\/sup>, Tadashi Toki<sup>1<\/sup>, Penny Phillips<sup>2<\/sup>, Toshinori Agatsuma<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Daiichi Sankyo Inc., Basking Ridge, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f0a83924-00f5-4796-a44a-6db854937be6","ControlNumber":"5893","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

CD123, the IL-3R&#945; chain, is highly expressed on leukemic blasts, LSCs, and is further increased in patients with poor prognostic factors. Bispecific T-cell engager (TCE) antibodies and CAR-T cells targeting CD123 have shown promising clinical efficacy in AML patients, but cytokine release syndrome limits their therapeutic window and remains a major safety concern. IGM-2537 is a novel pentameric IgM bispecific TCE antibody engineered with ten anti-CD123 binding sites, and an anti-CD3&#949; single chain Fv domain fused to the joining chain to engage T-cells. Here, we report the functional characterization of IGM-2537 using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy studies with preliminary safety evaluation of this novel class of IgM TCE. IGM-2537 bound with high selectivity, affinity and avidity to CD123 through an epitope distinct from IL-3. In vitro, IGM-2537 co-engaged with both CD123 and CD3 to induce potent T-cell activation and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity of AML cell lines. Though IGM-2537 demonstrated comparable maximal killing activity to a comparator IgG TCE, IGM-2537 demonstrated minimal cytokine release. In ex vivo patient-derived AML or normal bone marrow colony formation assays, IGM-2537 eliminated AML colony forming cells at physiologically relevant effector\/target (E\/T) ratios but spared normal progenitors. In addition, IGM-2537 potently depleted CD123<sup>+<\/sup> basophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In vivo, IGM-2537 completely inhibited tumor growth in the AML xenograft tumor model, MV4-11 in humanized NSG<sup>dKO<\/sup> mice at doses as low as 1 mg\/kg. To further evaluate the potency and safety of the CD123xCD3 IgM bispecific TCE format in vivo, a cynomolgus cross-reactive CD123xCD3 IgM bispecific TCE was evaluated for tolerability and pharmacodynamic responses in cynomolgus monkeys. All animals tolerated this bispecific IgM TCE well at doses up to 10 mg\/kg (the maximal dose level evaluated), a dose 100-fold greater than published doses of a comparator IgG TCE. Complete depletion of CD123<sup>+<\/sup> basophils and substantial reductions of pDCs were seen in blood and bone marrow with minimal to no cytokine induction. In summary, IGM-2537 demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo T-cell mediated cytotoxicity of AML cell lines with minimal cytokine induction. These preclinical data further support the clinical development of IGM-2537 for the treatment of AML and more broadly substantiate the use of IgM antibodies as a framework for TCEs to provide an improved therapeutic window for T-cell redirected therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,CD123xCD3 bispecific IgM antibody,Potent cytotoxicity with minimal cytokine release,Improved therapeutic window,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gene Li<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ling Wang<sup><\/sup>, Poonam Yakkundi<sup><\/sup>, Paul Hinton<sup><\/sup>, Deepal Pandya<sup><\/sup>, Keerthana Sekar<sup><\/sup>, Rodine Rosete<sup><\/sup>, Zhongde Ye<sup><\/sup>, Nardeen Hanna<sup><\/sup>, Maya  F.

Initial studies focused on CD47 blockers and more recently also SIRP&#945; antagonistic mAbs entered clinical studies. The latter approach is thought to be more advantageous since SIRP&#945; expression is primarily myeloid restricted whereas CD47 is broadly expressed and -besides SIRP&#945;- binds other ligands as well.We generated BYON4228, an antibody directed against the two existing allelic variants of human SIRP&#945; that does not recognize the closely related T-cell expressed SIRP&#947;. Functional studies demonstrate that BYON4228 potentiates both macrophage- and neutrophil-mediated elimination of hematologic and solid cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> in the presence of a variety of tumor targeting antibodies, including rituximab, daratumumab, trastuzumab and cetuximab. <i>In vivo<\/i>, BYON4228 increases the anti-tumor activity of rituximab in a B-cell Raji xenograft model in mice and shows a favorable safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys.To position BYON4228 in the emerging field of myeloid checkpoint inhibitors, head-to-head comparison studies were performed. For these studies, previously described anti-SIRP&#945; mAbs HEFLB, 1H9, and SIRPAB-11 were generated in house that in all probability are representative for three clinical stage SIRP&#945; mAbs. These comparative studies focused on principal characteristics of this class of mAbs that are anticipated to affect their clinical profile, namely 1) recognition of both common allelic forms of SIRP&#945; which determines the broadness of its clinical applicability; 2) binding to SIRP&#947; on T-lymphocytes which is reported to affect T-cell extravasation and activation and thereby the adaptive immune response; 3) functionality of the Fc-region of the mAb which can mediate depletion of SIRP&#945;-positive host myeloid immune effector cells thereby compromising host defense and undermining the effect of immunotherapy. The comparative studies show that in contrast to HEFLB, BYON4228 recognizes both common allelic forms of SIRP&#945;. Furthermore, lack of binding to T-cell expressed SIRP&#947; differentiates BYON4228 from 1H9 and SIRPAB-11. Finally, with its impaired Fc-region BYON4228 does not deplete SIRP&#945;+ myeloid cells, in contrast to SIRPAB-11.Thus, BYON4228 differentiates from all three comparator SIRP&#945; mAbs based on at least one fundamental characteristic, thereby underlining its potential to become a best-in-class drug. We therefore endorse its further development for which clinical studies are planned to start in 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mary van Helden<sup>1<\/sup>, Seline Zwarthoff<sup>1<\/sup>, Roel Arends<sup>1<\/sup>, Inge Reinieren-Beeren<sup>1<\/sup>, Marc Parade<sup>1<\/sup>, Lilian Driessen-Engels<sup>1<\/sup>, Karin de Laat-Arts<sup>1<\/sup>, Desiree Damming<sup>1<\/sup>, Ellen Santegoeds-Lenssen<sup>1<\/sup>, Daphne van Kuppeveld<sup>1<\/sup>, Imke Lodewijks<sup>1<\/sup>, Ellen Mattaar<sup>1<\/sup>, Hugo Olsman<sup>2<\/sup>, Hanke Matlung<sup>2<\/sup>, Katka Franke<sup>2<\/sup>, Marloes Stokman<sup>1<\/sup>, Benny de Wit<sup>1<\/sup>, Dirk Glaudemans<sup>1<\/sup>, Danielle van Wijk<sup>1<\/sup>, Lonnie Joosten Stoffels<sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Schouten<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Boersema<sup>1<\/sup>, Monique van der Vleuten<sup>1<\/sup>, Jorien Sanderink<sup>1<\/sup>, Wendy Kappers<sup>1<\/sup>, Diels van den Dobbelsteen<sup>1<\/sup>, Marco Timmers<sup>1<\/sup>, Ruud Ubink<sup>1<\/sup>, Gerard Rouwendal<sup>1<\/sup>, Gijs Verheijden<sup>1<\/sup>, Miranda M.C. van der Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Wim Dokter<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Timo van den Berg<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Byondis B.V., Nijmegen, Netherlands,<sup>2<\/sup>Sanquin, Amsterdam, Netherlands","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8c24e111-4b3c-47b6-9a90-72a791166fb7","ControlNumber":"3358","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M. van Helden, <\/b> <br><b>Byondis<\/b> Employment. <br><b>S.

Recombinant IL-12 reduces tumor growth in multiple mouse models, but its therapeutic application has been limited by severe toxicities. Protease dependent activation of therapeutics with high on-target, off-tumor toxicities may be used to localize activity to the tumor but achieving sufficient exposure of the activated therapeutic in the tumor microenvironment remains a challenge. We have previously shown our design strategy for masked, protease activated IL-12Fc that included optimization of blocking modules, fusion geometry, and linker design. Here we have further expanded our mechanistic evaluations by combining masked, protease activated IL-12Fc with attenuated potency engineering, and selected a lead candidate (ZW270) based on anti-tumor activity and non-human primate (NHP) tolerability.<br \/>The relative activity of masked and unmasked IL-12Fc variants comprising wild type (wt) or attenuated (att) IL-12 potency was evaluated in CD8 T cell activity assays. The wt IL-12Fc displayed comparable potency to recombinant IL-12 and up to 100x reduced potency when masked. Introduction of attenuating mutations to the p40 subunit reduced the potency of the IL-12Fc by up to 20x and addition of the protease cleavable mask further reduced the potency to up to 5000x compared to wt IL-12Fc. In a single dose NHP study, masked att IL-12Fc was well tolerated up to 31.8 mg\/kg, while wt IL-12Fc demonstrated a maximum tolerated dose of below 1.3 mg\/kg.<br \/>Despite the reduced potency of att IL-12Fc <i>in vitro<\/i>, in <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies in a human PBMC engrafted xenograft model the masked att IL-12Fc was able to control tumor growth whereas masked wt IL-12Fc and wt IL-12Fc showed limited anti-tumor activity, suggesting the approach of masked, protease activated att IL-12Fc might be able to achieve a higher exposure of active cytokine in the tumor in comparison to the masked wt IL-12Fc and wt IL-12 comparator. To further investigate the potentially superior exposure response relationship of masked att IL-12Fc, we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model based on our experimental data and literature data. In this model the predicted ratio of IL-12-receptor occupancy by active IL-12Fc in the tumor vs. blood was 18x greater for masked att IL-12Fc than for wt IL-12Fc, whereas the ratio was under 10x greater for masked wt IL-12Fc vs. wt IL-12Fc.<br \/>In summary, the affinity attenuated, masked IL-12Fc lead ZW270 has potent and superior anti-tumor activity to wt IL-12Fc and masked wt IL-12Fc, and is well tolerated in NHPs to &#62;30 mg\/kg. Our data suggests that the combined strategy of masked, protease activated IL-12Fc and attenuated IL-12 potency has the potential to widen the therapeutic index and to have superior activity to masked, protease cleavable wt IL-12 and unmasked wt IL-12 fusions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Antibody engineering,Interleukin-12,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Maya  C.

Activation of the pathway results in potent suppression of immune cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and has been reported to predict poor response to PD-(L)1 targeted therapy in patients (Mariathasan et al, Nature 2018; Kieffer et al, Cancer Discovery 2020). However, TGF&#946; drug development has been hampered by the occurrence of adverse events. INCA33890 is a dual PD-1 and TGF&#946;R2 binding bispecific Biclonics&#174; antibody, developed to antagonize the TGF&#946; signaling pathway specifically in cells co-expressing PD-1 and TGFBR2. Additionally, it potently antagonizes the PD-1 axis independently of TGF&#946;R2 co-expression. The cell-selective action of INCA33890 was designed to mitigate risks of the known adverse effects associated with TGF&#946;-pathway inhibition in tissues requiring active TGF&#946; signaling. &#921;&#925;C&#913;33890 mediates its specificity through a PD-1 binding arm with a &#62;10-fold higher affinity relative to the TGF&#946;R2 binding arm. Consistent with this profile, in isogenic Jurkat cells expressing TGF&#946;R2 &#177; PD-1, INCA33890 potently inhibits TGF&#946;1-induced pSMAD activation in a PD-1-correlated manner. Additionally, in two independent PD-1 reporter assays, INCA33890 inhibited SHP recruitment and enhanced NFAT activation with a potency within an order of magnitude to that of pembrolizumab. In mixed lymphocyte reaction assays with exhausted primary human T-cells, INCA33890 was found to induce a similar level of anti-tumor cytokine production as the combination of pembrolizumab and an anti-TGF&#946;R2 antagonist mAb. Treatment of primary ovarian ascites with INCA33890 ex vivo induced IFN&#947; production in all donors tested, while pembrolizumab had no activity. Similarly, in human CD34<sup>+<\/sup> cell-engrafted NSG mice, INCA33890 significantly inhibited the growth of human MDA-MB-231 and A375 subcutaneous xenograft tumors, whereas pembrolizumab or an anti-TGF&#946;R2 antibody had little or no monotherapy activity. INCA33890 had a balanced pharmacokinetic and potency profile and was well tolerated in NHPs at exposures required for pharmacodynamic and tumor growth inhibiting activity in rodents. Encouragingly, there was no evidence of adverse effects in NHPs due to TGF&#946;-pathway blockade. Collectively, these results provide compelling data for an effective and specific approach to simultaneously antagonizing TGF&#946; and PD-1 signaling in tumors. Clinical development of INCA33890 in checkpoint inhibitor-resistant and other cancers has been initiated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,PD-1,TGF-&#946;,Immune Checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liang-Chuan S.

CBA-1535, originally developed by Biotecnol (UK), is a novel trivalent biological construct named a Tribody&#8482; with two binding sites to the tumor associated antigen 5T4 and one to the T cell expressed antigen CD3&#949;. CD-3 based T cell engagers (TCE) is one of the attractive strategy to treat cancer patients resistant to conventional therapies, however, the effects of TCE on solid tumors are limited due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome this limitation, CBA-1535 is designed to have stronger binding activity to 5T4 with two binding sites, and to have the lower affinity to CD3 than to 5T4 to prevent non-specific T cell activation.CBA-1535 does not have a Fc region with a molecular weight of ~100 kDa and it has a low nM Kd for bivalent binding to 5T4, a 20 to 30 nM Kd for monovalent binding to CD3&#949;. CBA-1535 efficiently induced T cell activation in human PBMCs as exemplified as CD25 and CD69 expressions and showed cytokine release, i.e., IL-2, IL-6, TNF&#945;, and IFN-&#612;, at the concentration between 0.01 and 10 nM only when co-cultured with target cancer cells, however, those T cell activation and cytokine release were not observed under the conditions without target cancer cells, even at the concentration of 1 &#181;M. In the presence of activated human PBMCs as effector cells, CB-1535 elicited 5T4 expressing target cell cytotoxicity with an EC<sub>50<\/sub> of approximately 1-30 pM in a variety of cancer cells. The anti-tumor efficacy of CB-1535 has examined in immunocompromised mice bearing human lung mesothelioma (MSTO-211H) and alveolar epithelial adenocarcinoma (A549) xenografts (such as the 5T4 expressing target cell) and human PBMCs (as effector cells). Anti-tumor efficacy was observed with complete suppression of tumor growth at doses as low as 1 mg\/kg in both xenograft models. No abnormalities related to CBA-1535 administration were observed regarding to body weight and clinical signs. Importantly, CBA-1535 showed a synergistic cytotoxicity against 5T4 expressing target cancer cells <i>in vitro <\/i>when combined with PD-1 antibody Pembrolizumab in a co-culture experiment. In conclusion, we demonstrated encouraging preclinical profile of CBA-1535 as a novel CD-3 based T-cell engager antibody. These results provide the strong rationale for further clinical evaluation of<br \/>CBA-1535 in 5T4 positive tumors. CBA-1535 is now under the phase 1 trial in Japan (jRCT2031210708), with 2 parts, the monotherapy and the combination with Pembrolizumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Bispecific tribody,Novel trivalent biologics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fumitake Takizawa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kotaro Yamamoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Koji Nakamura<sup>1<\/sup>, Ana  R.

As such, HER2 has become a major target in the research and development of anticancer drugs. CD47, an integrin-associated protein, is expressed in many human cancer cells, especially upregulated preferentially in HER2-expressing cells. Co-expression of HER2 and CD47 is more frequently detected in recurrent BC patients with poor prognosis when comparing with the counterpart primary tumors. IMM2902 is a first-in-class, clinical-stage, novel recombinant bispecific mAb-Trap fusion protein targeting both CD47 and HER2 simultaneously. The binding activities of IMM2902, measured as EC50, to total CD47+ and HER2+ in BT474, NCI-N87 and SKOV-3 cancer cell lines are 16, 11 and 5 nM respectively. The affinity of IMM2902 to HER2 is about 15 times higher than that of CD47. IMM2902 not only prevents the engagement of CD47 with SIRP&#945; and hence blocks &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal of CD47\/SIRP&#945;, but also induces strong antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC, EC50 = 0.0045 - 0.0544 nM) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, EC50 = 0.05 - 0.13 nM) activity with specifically engineered IgG1 Fc fragment. Most importantly, IMM2902 induces accelerated HER2 degradation in tumor tissues. Despite its high affinity to CD47, IMM2902 does not binds to CD47 on erythrocyte membrane, therefore, unlike conventional CD47 mAb, IMM2902 demonstrated a minimal impact on red blood cells (RBC). In preclinical research, IMM2902 has demonstrated a much stronger antitumor activity with excellent tolerability in a mouse model of human breast cancer (dose range 3.5 - 10 mg\/kg) and a mouse model of human gastric cancer (dose range 1 -18 mg\/kg) than that of trastuzumab (targeting HER2 only) alone, IMM01 (a SIRP&#945;-Fc fusion protein) alone, and the combination of trastuzumab and IMM01. In HER2-low SUN-1 xenograft models, IMM2902 has showed a strong tumor growth inhibition at doses between 2 to 18 mg\/kg. Intriguingly, IMM2902 also has exhibited potent tumor killing activity against breast cancer resistant to trastuzumab (HCC-1954 and patient-derived xenografts herceptin-resistant model) at doses between 3.5 to 10 mg\/kg. Given the strong preclinical antitumor activity as well as the favorable safety profile, IMM2902 may serve as a potent immunotherapy for HER2-expressing cancers via dual blockade of CD47 and HER2. A Phase 1 clinical trial exploring safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of IMM2902 in patients with HER2-expressing advanced solid tumors is currently ongoing in both China (CXSL2101035) and USA (NCT05076591).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,HER2,CD47,mAb-Trap fusion protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Binglei Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Song Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Dianze Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Dandan Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Huiqin Guo<sup>2<\/sup>, Chunmei Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Li Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Wei Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoping Tu<sup>2<\/sup>, Liang Peng<sup>2<\/sup>, Gui Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Ruliang Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Frank  X.

The expression is gradually reduced as development progresses, and it is hardly expressed in adults, but the overexpression of ROR1 is observed in various blood and solid cancer cells, so it is classified as an oncofetal gene. ABL102, a First-in-Class bispecific antibody targeting ROR1 and 4-1BB, elicits superior T cell activation by tumor specific T cell engagement through ROR1 dependent 4-1BB clustering. Our data showed that tumor target dependents binding of ROR1 and costimulatory 4-1BB by ABL102 induced 4-1BB activation in cell-based 4-1BB bioassay. ABL102 lead to IFN-&#947; secretion and tumor cell killing with a ROR1 dependent manner in co-culture assay with tumor cells and human PBMC. In h4-1BB knock-in mouse model bearing hROR1-expressing tumors, ABL102 potently inhibited tumor progression with a high rate of complete remission (CR). Mice with CR were further protected from the rechallenge of previously exposed tumors after 3 months of cessation of ABL102 treatment, implicating that immunological memory might be generated. In 4-week pilot toxicity study using cynomolgus monkeys, no ABL102-related toxicity was observed up to 100mg\/kg, including mortality, body weight, hematology, liver toxicity, clinical chemistry and pathology, indicating a favorable safety profile. In conclusion, ABL102 exhibited potent in vitro and vivo anti-tumor activity and it was well tolerated and safe in the NHP toxicity study.

While MSLN-targeting agents have shown early signs of clinical activity, therapies with improved safety and efficacy are still needed. T cell engager (TCE) therapies have exhibited clinical utility against hematological malignancies, but limited success against solid tumors due to dose-limiting toxicities associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and on-target off-tumor effects. To improve the therapeutic intervention of MSLN-expressing tumors, we engineered a bispecific TCE, designed to have an improved therapeutic window by enhancing both safety and anti-tumor activity profiles.<br \/>To avoid dose-limiting toxicities related to CRS observed with high-affinity anti-CD3 paratopes (<i>e.g.<\/i> based on OKT3 or SP34), we engineered an anti-CD3 paratope (ZW_CD3_1) with low affinity CD3 binding and, in the context of a bispecific TCE, potent redirected T cell cytotoxicity. Compared to a bispecific antibody containing the high CD3 affinity SP34 paratope, the ZW_CD3_1 anti-CD3 paratope showed reduced and less potent T cell binding, stimulated less cytokine release yet elicited equivalent T cell mediated killing of MSLN-expressing tumor cells. Using the bispecific Azymetric<sup>TM<\/sup> platform, the ZW_CD3_1 paratope was incorporated into a panel of bispecific antibodies with different geometries, formats, and anti-MSLN paratope affinities then screened for T cell mediated lysis of target cells and production of cytokines. Based on reiterative screening and engineering, we determined the MSLN paratope affinity and the 2+1 format, consisting of two anti-MSLN single chain variable fragments (scFvs) and one anti-CD3 fragment antigen binding (Fab) domain, as the lead candidate format. In vivo, the lead format also showed significantly greater anti-tumor activity than other 2+1 bispecific formats.<br \/>Following additional engineering and screening a lead MSLN x CD3 2 +1 bispecific antibody, ZW171, was selected for development. We further characterized the mechanistic and anti-tumor activity of ZW171 and showed that incubation of human T cells and tumor cells with ZW171 led to potent preferential killing of MSLN-mid and -high target cells while sparing MSLN-low expressing target cells. ZW171 only stimulated T cells to proliferate and produce cytokines in the presence of MSLN-expressing tumor cells, mitigating the risk of peripheral T cell activation and CRS. Importantly, ZW171 exhibited potent tumor growth inhibition in multiple established tumor models. Collectively, these data suggest that ZW171 has the potential to be an efficacious and safe therapeutic for the treatment of MSLN-expressing cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelin,T cell engager,Bispecific antibody,CD3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicole  J.

Both ligands serve as activating signals for NKG2D on NK cells and a subset of T cell populations and can induce target cell lysis. Tumor cells evade formation of the NKG2D-MICA\/B axis by shedding of MICA\/B ligands. This is mediated by various proteases found in the tumor microenvironment that target cleavage sites proximal to the plasma membrane. Shedding of MICA\/B is a two-step process. First, the protein disulfide isomerase ERp5 reduces a disulfide bond in the alpha 3 domain. This then allows proteases to gain access to cleavage sites. CLN-619 has been shown to bind to the alpha 3 domain, prevent shedding of MICA\/B, increase the cell surface expression of MICA\/B, and enable ADCC and ADCP. In xenograft models, doses as low as 0.03 mg\/kg inhibited tumor outgrowth, with efficacy dependent on a functional Fc&#947;1 domain. Of note, CLN-619 does not interfere with binding of the alpha 1 and 2 domains of MICA\/B to NKG2D but rather enhances formation of this axis. We have undertaken a structural analysis at an atomic resolution to elucidate how a Fab fragment of CLN-619 interacts with the recombinant alpha 3 domain of human MICA. A co-crystal was obtained that allowed X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.12 Angstroms. The antibody was found to laterally bind to the alpha 3 domain without approaching the distal alpha 1 and 2 domains involved in binding to NKG2D. CLN-619 recognizes a discontinuous epitope, interacts with a total of 19 amino acid residues on MICA, and covers approximately 14% of the alpha 3 domain surface when bound. Several modes of action of CLN-619 may explain inhibition of MICA shedding. In the simplest case, the antibody binds to the cleavage sites on MICA and sterically prevents protease access. However, the cleavage sites appear to be located opposite from where CLN-619 binds the alpha 3 domain of MICA. It is also conceivable that CLN-619 prevents access of ERp5. Location of the ERp5 recognition site in the middle of the discontinuous epitope supports this hypothesis. The rather large footprint of CLN-619 on MICA supports yet another hypothesis. It has been suggested that opening of the alpha 3 domain by reduction of the disulfide bond creates a protease-sensitive conformation. The extended interaction of CLN-619 with MICA may freeze the alpha 3 domain in a protease-insensitive conformation. We will report results from ongoing biophysical and biochemical studies further elucidating the mechanism by which CLN-619 prevents shedding of MICA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,Structure-activity relationships,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kerry  A.

T-Dxd consists of the anti-HER2 antibody Trastuzumab conjugated to Dxd (a topoisomerase-I inhibitor). While the HER2-mediated internalization of Dxd leads to direct and bystander tumor cell killing, it is unclear whether T-Dxd retains Fc-mediated induction of immunity and how these responses may interact with Dxd-mediated tumor cell killing. Therefore, in this study we investigated tumor-specific innate and adaptive immune responses elicited upon T-Dxd treatment versus other HER2-targeting agents.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: We first compared immune responses of T-Dxd versus T-DM1 or Trastuzumab on macrophage activation after co-culture with HER2+ BC cells. We next utilized JEDI T cells to model tumor-antigen presentation by those macrophages. We also investigated the therapeutic effect of T-Dxd in an endogenous HER2 transgenic mouse model, and measured HER2-specific adaptive immune responses, in combination with immune checkpoint blockades.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We found that T-Dxd retains the capability to engage with FCGRs and promote ADCP of HER2+ BC cells by macrophages, with comparable efficacy to Trastuzumab. Interestingly, T-Dxd mediated ADCP combined with Dxd-mediated immunogenic cell death promoted superior macrophage activation over Trastuzumab and T-DM1, resulting in increased expression of antigen presentation genes, chemokines, and interferon-stimulated genes. In co-culture experiments with JEDI T cells, macrophages that have phagocytosed eGFP-expressing tumor cells after T-Dxd treatment showed superior activation of antigen-specific effector T cells. In vivo, T-Dxd demonstrated exceptional tumor growth inhibition over Trastuzumab, accompanied by increased HER2-specific adaptive T cell responses. Lastly, T-Dxd therapy showed synergistic antitumor activity when combined with immune checkpoint blockade of the CD47\/SIRPA axis.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: T-Dxd retains antibody-mediated antitumor mechanisms of Trastuzumab such as FCGR activation and ADCP of HER2+ tumor cells. Importantly, this is synergized with T-Dxd induced immunogenic tumor cell death, which results in enhanced macrophage activation upon tumor cell phagocytosis. This result in enhanced tumor antigen presentation and activation of adaptive immunity in vitro and in preclinical mouse models, which may illustrate T-Dxd&#8217;s superior and long-lasting clinical efficacy in HER2+ BC patients.

The impact of our mAbs on tumor growth and on the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) were also studied in mouse hCCR8-KI mice.

In contrast, it has a limited expression in normal tissue, making it an attractive target for an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). Here we report and characterize the preclinical efficacy of AZD8205, a novel B7-H4 targeted ADC carrying a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) linker-warhead, AZ&#8217;0133 at a drug:antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. The primary mechanism of action of AZD8205 is intracellular delivery of the TOP1i warhead to B7-H4 positive cells, leading to DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. A single IV administration of AZD8205 at 3.5 mg\/kg provided robust antitumor activity in patient-derived xenografts from TNBC, ovarian and cholangiocarcinoma tumors, with overall response rates in B7H4-expressing samples of 75%, 64% and 21% respectively. Tumor response was found to be correlated to cell surface target expression and homologous recombination repair deficiency status. To further exploit the DNA damage elicited by the specific delivery of the TOP1i warhead, the combination of AZD8205 with a novel poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) selective inhibitor, AZD5305, was investigated. Combination of AZD8205 and AZD5305 provided higher antitumor activity than monotherapy, even in PARP inhibition-resistant or low B7-H4 expressing PDX tumors. Finally, cancer cell lines were found to express markers of immunogenic cell death and antigenicity post-AZD8205 treatment in vitro. Therapeutic benefit of combining AZD8205 with checkpoint immunotherapies was then evaluated in syngeneic models, demonstrating enhanced antitumor efficacy of AZD8205 when combined with an anti-PD-L1 antibody. These data demonstrate that AZD8205 is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of B7-H4 positive solid tumors. A first in human phase I\/IIa study in patients with advanced solid tumors is currently ongoing (NCT05123482).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Targeted drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alex Cazes<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Krista Kinneer<sup>2<\/sup>, Bilal Omar<sup>1<\/sup>, Jon Chesebrough<sup>1<\/sup>, Judith Anderton<sup>3<\/sup>, Jixin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna  D.

S100A4 is a highly conserved protein and has been demonstrated to promote cancer metastasis and stemness in multiple cancer types. Furthermore, our recent single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of cancer and stromal cells in human gliomas showed that S100A4 is expressed in both cancer and immune cells to promotes immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. Significantly deleting S100A4 function in stromal cells alone was sufficient to reverse the immune phenotypes of glioma associated T cells and myeloid cells, and resulted in significantly extend survival of two different mouse glioma models. Consistently, higher S100A4 expression is also associated with poor outcomes in many cancer types. Together these observations suggest that S100A4 is a promising therapeutic target for multiple cancer types, and we developed and characterized a blocking antibody against human S100A4. We have screened 114 monoclonal antibodies against S100A4 using S100A4-induced chicken neurite outgrowth <i>ex vivo<\/i> as a functional assay. Seven of the 114 monoclonals showed significant suppressive activity <i>ex vivo<\/i> and were selected for further analysis for their <i>in vivo<\/i> activity. We chose two well-characterized breast cancer metastasis models for in vivo screening: MMTV-PyMT spontaneous and 4T1 orthotopic transplantation tumor models. One of the clones, 4-11, showed the most consistent and dramatic lung metastasis suppressive activity in both models. To identify the potential mechanisms of action since the blocking antibody is anticipated to only affect soluble S100A4 function, we focused on potential immune modulatory effect, based on our own study and those of others. We performed flow cytometry to analyze the immune phenotypes in blood, bone marrow, spleen, breast tumor, and lung metastases. In S100A4-11 treated mice, circulating monocytes (CD11b+Ly6gloLy6chi) and tumor-associated CD163+ macrophage frequencies were significantly decreased in both models. In addition, circulating CD4+ T cells and neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6g+Ly6cint) frequencies were also decreased in the 4T1 model. Others have shown that myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSC: CD11b+, Ly6gloLy6chi,IAIE-) play an important role in cancer metastasis. Our result suggests that soluble S100A4 protein promotes MDSC polarization or survival in the tumor, peripheral blood, and metastatic lung tissues. These findings strongly suggest that S100A4-11 could be used to block metastasis. We are currently testing the humanized S1004-11 antibody in preparation for clinical studies with this novel immune modulator.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Immunotherapy,S100A4,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jia-Shiun Leu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Deng<sup>2<\/sup>, Han Nhat Tran<sup>1<\/sup>, Jose Maria Benitez Salazar<sup>1<\/sup>, Jose A.

However, ADCC mediated by conventional antibodies has its limitations in killing of tumor cells commonly being characterized by low tumor antigen expression. Several strategies have been implemented to boost ADCC including shedding inhibition of CD16A, a key ADCC-mediating Fc receptor on the plasma membrane of NK cells. However, previous results have shown that genetic engineering of the cleavage site of CD16A leads to decreased serial engagement of target cells. Another approach to boost ADCC is provided by tetravalent-bispecific innate cell engagers (ICE&#174;) cross-linking CD16A and tumor antigens triggering anti-tumoral cytotoxicity.<br \/>In the current study, we have investigated whether ICE molecules can induce effective ADCC while maintaining the natural function of CD16A with a particular focus on preserved CD16A shedding. To study cytotoxicity and contact dynamics, we have used an in-house developed live-cell microchip screening with single cell resolution together with a microcontact printing-based assay combined with an ICE&#174;.<br \/>Single cell analysis using microchip screening revealed that the CD16A\/CD30 targeting ICE&#174; AFM13 induces stronger ADCC of NK cells towards CD30+ target cells when compared to anti-CD30 antibodies. This stronger response was reached through increasing both the overall number of cytotoxic NK cells and the fraction of NK serial killers i.e., NK cells performing three or more kills in sequence. Interestingly, the differences were most prominent towards target cells expressing low levels of CD30.<br \/>Combination of AFM13 and inhibition of CD16 shedding increased NK cell conjugation time with target cells, which could potentially limit targeting of additional tumor cells located at a distance from the primary target. To investigate this phenomenon further, we used a microcontact printing assay. Here, a grid of spatially distributed protein patches consisting of AFM13 and anti-LFA-1 was printed on glass surfaces enabling the formation of &#8220;artificial immune synapses&#8221; when probed by NK cells. On these &#8220;artificial immune synapses&#8221; we investigated the influence of shedding inhibition on NK cell migration and interaction dynamics.<br \/>In conclusion, we show that AFM13 increases both the fraction of tumor-target responsive NK cells and the fraction of serial killing NK cells compared to conventional monoclonal antibodies. Based on our data we hypothesize that CD16A shedding facilitates AFM13 induced ADCC potential of NK cells by allowing potent migration to distantly located tumor cells and serial killing. Especially in the context of AFM13 primary indications, Hodgkin and peripheral T cell lymphoma, migration of NK cells might have a particularly strong impact when treating cancer patients due to the disseminated nature of the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Hodgkin's lymphoma,Cytotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chiara Zambarda<sup>1<\/sup>, Karolin Guldevall<sup>1<\/sup>, Damien Toullec<sup>1<\/sup>, Susanne Wingert<sup>2<\/sup>, Christian Breunig<sup>2<\/sup>, Sheena Pinto<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacopo Fontana<sup>1<\/sup>, Joachim Koch<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Björn Önfelt<\/b><sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Applied Physics, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>Affimed GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Med H, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"92bf3dac-f23f-4903-9d5c-df565e836211","ControlNumber":"5786","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Blocking the CD47\/SIRP&#945; myeloid checkpoint with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or decoy receptors is emerging as an effective approach to mobilize dendritic cells and macrophages to support T-cell mediated antitumor responses. The benefit of combining CD47\/SIRP&#945; and PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade to improve tumor control has been convincingly demonstrated in preclinical models and is now being explored in patients. However, CD47 mAbs are hindered by ubiquitous CD47 expression, leading to pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety issues.NI-2901, an IgG4 CD47xPD-L1 bispecific antibody (bsAb), was generated using the &#954;&#955;-body platform. <i>In vitro<\/i> assays were used to characterize its binding profile and checkpoint inhibition as well as its capacity to enhance T-cell activation and macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells. PD-L1-independent CD47 antitumor activity was assessed <i>in vivo<\/i> in a PD-L1-negative xenograft model and compared to the anti-CD47 magrolimab analog. PK and tolerability of NI-2901 were evaluated in non-human primates (NHP), allowing for translational modeling to predict PK and dosing regimens in humans. Consistent with its intermediate affinity to CD47, NI-2901 shows lower binding to RBC as compared to magrolimab analog and is still able to induce CD47\/SIRP&#945; blockade on PD-L1-negative tumor cells, that is significantly enhanced once PD-L1 is expressed. As a result, the bsAb is able to enhance the phagocytosis of PD-L1-negative and -positive tumor cell lines induced by mAbs targeting tumor-associated antigens (e.g. rituximab, trastuzumab and anti-CD19) and demonstrates <i>in vivo <\/i>activity in the Raji B-cell lymphoma xenograft model. Given its high affinity for PD-L1, NI-2901 triggers an effective blockade of the PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction, inducing T-cell activation <i>in vitro<\/i> to a degree similar to anti-PD-L1 benchmark antibodies atezolizumab and avelumab. In immunocompetent huCD47\/huSIRP&#945;-transgenic mice engrafted with MC38 cells engineered to express human PD-L1 and CD47, NI-2901 displayed significant anti-tumor activity. In a NHP study, NI-2901 was well-tolerated after four weekly injections at 30mg\/kg, showing no signs of hemotoxicity. In contrast, the magrolimab analog induced a significant drop in RBC already after a single injection at 10mg\/kg. PK modeling and simulations in humans suggest a more favorable dosing regimen as compared to CD47 targeted approaches. In conclusion, NI-2901, a dual immune checkpoint inhibitor, triggered effective T-cell activation and enhanced phagocytosis of tumor cells. Also, NI-2901 demonstrated significant antitumor activity in vivo and is therefore expected to show improved clinical efficacy over PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade alone. The bsAb was well-tolerated in NHP without inducing RBC or platelet depletion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Bispecific antibody,CD47,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xavier Chauchet<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastien Calloud<sup>1<\/sup>, Pauline LLoveras<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolas Bosson<sup>1<\/sup>, Margaux Legrand<sup>1<\/sup>, Laurence Chatel<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Cons<sup>1<\/sup>, Adeline Lesnier<sup>1<\/sup>, Pauline Malinge<sup>1<\/sup>, Guillemette Pontini<sup>1<\/sup>, Christophe Guillamo<sup>1<\/sup>, Dmitry Shchelokov<sup>2<\/sup>, Oleg Demin<sup>2<\/sup>, Ulla Ravn<sup>1<\/sup>, Valéry Moine<sup>1<\/sup>, Bruno Daubeuf<sup>1<\/sup>, Giovanni Magistrelli<sup>1<\/sup>, Yves Poitevin<sup>1<\/sup>, Susana Salgado-Pires<sup>1<\/sup>, Limin Shang<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolas Fischer<sup>1<\/sup>, Walter Ferlin<sup>1<\/sup>, Krzysztof Masternak<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Light Chain Bioscience – Novimmune SA, Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>InSysBio UK Limited, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"22cc4167-87ec-499a-836a-d78f56018d38","ControlNumber":"3353","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;X.
