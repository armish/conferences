[{"Abstract":"Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 5, CEACAM5, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein highly expressed on the cell surface of several epithelial tumors. CEACAM5 is expressed in virtually all colorectal cancer, ~90% of which to high levels while normal tissue expression is limited. The high prevalence of CEACAM5 expression in colorectal tumor cells prompted us to develop an investigational anti-CEACAM5 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for the potential treatment of CRC patients. We developed a novel ADC, by conjugating an anti-CEACAM5 antibody with a drug linker to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. The anti-CEACAM5 antibody was chosen based on its high selectivity for CEACAM5 and its potential to direct cytotoxic payloads to tumor. The topoisomerase I payload was optimized for potency, reduced PGP efflux and enhanced bystander activity. The novel anti-CEACAM5 topoisomerase I inhibitor ADC binds to CEACAM5 at nanomolar (nM) concentrations and kills CEACAM5-positive colon tumor cells with varying levels of CEACAM5 at sub-nM concentrations with no or very low cytotoxicity towards CEACAM5-negative cells. Mechanistically, the potent anti-tumor activity of the ADC is both mediated by direct internalization, processing, and release of the cytotoxic payload within the CEACAM5-expressing tumor cells, and by a bystander effect mediated by diffusion of the payload to the neighboring CEACAM5-negative tumor cells. The novel anti-CEACAM5 topoisomerase I inhibitor ADC is well tolerated in rats after repeated administration of 30 and 50 mg\/kg\/day, Q1W x 4. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy of this ADC at 1, 3 and 10 mg\/kg (single administration) was evaluated in four CRC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models. The conjugate elicits potent and specific and dose dependent antitumor activity with complete regression (CR) at 10 mg\/kg in the 4 models. This robust anti-tumor activity was further confirmed in a Single Mouse Trial of 16 CRC PDX models, consisting in the use of one animal per PDX model per treatment arm and for which the evaluation of efficacy was based on the criteria RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) used in clinic. In these criteria, the overall response rate includes complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and the a disease control rate includes CR , PR and stable disease (SD). The ADC induces a disease control rate of 95% and an overall response rate of 50% following a single dose of 10 mg\/kg. The outstanding anti-tumor activity across CRC PDX models and its favorable safety profile in rats support further evaluation of this investigational novel topoisomerase I ADC in CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Colorectal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yves Baudat<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Haley Neff-LaFord<sup>2<\/sup>, Celine Nicolazzi<sup>1<\/sup>, Dave Meyer<sup>2<\/sup>, Johann Petur Sigurjonsson<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan Lyski<sup>2<\/sup>, Valeria Fantin<sup>3<\/sup>, Marie-Priscille Brun<sup>1<\/sup>, Marielle Chiron<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephanie Decary<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sanofi R&D, Vitry-Sur-Seine, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Seagen, Bothell, WA,<sup>3<\/sup>Sanofi R&D, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"80529b38-0660-4ccc-83c0-13cfd2d56bab","ControlNumber":"7386","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

I-DXd has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in B7-H3-positive preclinical cancer models and showed early signs of promising clinical efficacy in patients with heavily pretreated, advanced solid tumors. ADCs are postulated to exert cytotoxicity specifically in tumors that express the target antigen via target-specific uptake of the compound. Accordingly, effective action of an ADC depends on multiple dynamic steps including antigen-specific binding, internalization, trafficking to lysosomes, linker cleavage and payload release, as well as payload potency. The goal of this research was to characterize I-DXd molecular dynamics in preclinical tumor cell models by investigating the relationship among target expression and dynamics, its translocation to lysosomes, lysosomal enzyme-mediated linker cleavage, and payload release after I-DXd treatment. As a result, I-DXd demonstrated target dependent internalization, efficient trafficking to lysosomes, and subsequent payload release in the studied tumor cell lines. Payload release levels generally correlated with target expression in vitro using a panel of cell lines with varying levels of B7-H3 expression. Also, in cell-line derived xenograft models, tumor tissue payload concentration corresponded to I-DXd binding at the cell membrane. These results suggest the importance of cell surface B7-H3 expression and ADC dynamics that lead to payload release in target expressing tumors to exert anti-tumor activity in non-clinical model. In addition to target-dependent uptake in tumor cells, it was observed in viable human lung tumor slices that B7-H3 was also expressed in several non-tumor cells including cancer-associated fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and I-DXd was shown to be internalized in these B7-H3-expressing non-tumor cells. In summary, this pre-clinical study characterizes the relationship between B7-H3 expression in the tumor microenvironment and I-DXd molecular dynamics. Our results support developing I-DXd as a targeted therapy against advanced solid tumors known to overexpress B7-H3.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Molecular targets,In vitro,B7-H3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Len Katsumata<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tsuneo Deguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Hasegawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Michiko Yamato<sup>1<\/sup>, Yumi Nishiya<sup>1<\/sup>, Akiko Watanabe<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomoyo Honda<sup>1<\/sup>, Megumi Minami<sup>2<\/sup>, Naomi Kasanuki<sup>2<\/sup>, Takanori Maejima<sup>1<\/sup>, Sumie Muramatsu<sup>1<\/sup>, Monika Herrmann<sup>3<\/sup>, Nina Schulte<sup>3<\/sup>, Gernot Polier<sup>3<\/sup>, Xuya Wang<sup>4<\/sup>, Takanori Yoshida<sup>2<\/sup>, Nanae Izumi<sup>4<\/sup>, Xiaozhong Qian<sup>4<\/sup>, Toshinori Agatsuma<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenji Nakamaru<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Daiichi Sankyo RD Novare Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Daiichi Sankyo Inc., Basking Ridge, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"654febcb-2076-43d3-a107-76ba5f5a4414","ControlNumber":"5546","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

In addition, MMAE also has the ability to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and immune modulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Liu, 2020; Gray, 2020). Other clinical-stage and approved ADCs incorporate payloads that also cause microtubule disruption (DM1, DM4), or that drive DNA damage through topoisomerase I inhibition (exatecan) as the primary mechanism of action (MOA). While ADCs with different linker payloads produce clinical benefit, their long-term impact on survival and how they pair with PD(L)1 agents may differ based on their ability to elicit immune modulation. In this study we have investigated how these payloads compare to MMAE in their ability to drive immune changes in the TME and describe how these changes could support anti-tumor immunity and improve outcomes in the clinic.Building upon an initial in vitro assessment in which we observed superior induction of ICD markers and underlying ER stress with an MMAE ADC, we utilized a B7H4-expressing MDA-MB-468 xenograft model of triple-negative breast cancer to further characterize the ICD properties of ADC payloads. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with a single dose of B7H4-targeted antibody conjugated to either MMAE, DM1, DM4 or exatecan. Tumors were harvested seven days after treatment and processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess changes in immune cell infiltration and analyzed by RNA-seq to determine alterations in gene expression. Payload-driven anti-tumor activity was observed with all ADC treatments, each leading to a similar reduction in tumor volume compared to vehicle or unconjugated antibody. IHC staining of tumor sections for F4\/80, a mouse macrophage marker, revealed that of the microtubule-disrupting agents, only MMAE significantly increased F4\/80+ macrophage infiltration in both the tumor nests and stroma. Increased F4\/80+ macrophages in tumor nests and stroma was also observed as a result of B7H4-exatecan ADC treatment. RNA-seq analysis revealed a unique profile for the MMAE conjugate, with an increase in human transcripts encoding cytokine and type I interferon response genes. In summary, the anti-tumor activity of the B7H4-MMAE ADC resulted in recruitment of mouse innate immune cells to the xenograft tumors. Importantly, immune response genes related to ICD were increased following B7H4-MMAE treatment compared to DM1, DM4, and exatecan conjugates. Together, these data suggest that treatment with vedotin ADCs results in robust immunomodulatory changes in vivo that are distinct from other clinical ADC payloads.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Immunomodulation,Immunogenic cell death,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michelle Ulrich<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kerry Klussman<sup><\/sup>, John  J.

Bioorg Med Chem Lett., 2016). Dato-DXd demonstrated encouraging efficacy in clinical studies in TROP2 expressing tumors, including NSCLC and TNBC (NCT03401385). Clinical efficacy of Dato-DXd in heterogeneous tumors is hypothesized to be derived not only via effective selective delivery of DXd to TROP2 (+) tumor cells but also DXd diffusion from TROP2 (+) tumor cells to nearby TROP2 (-) tumor cells due to high membrane permeability of the DXd payload, an effect called the bystander antitumor effect. In this preclinical study, the bystander antitumor effect was tested by establishing tumor xenograft mouse models containing admixed TROP2 (+) and TROP2 (-) lung cell lines. The antitumor activity of Dato-DXd was tested in these models to demonstrate the bystander antitumor effect of Dato-DXd.<br \/>Materials and Methods: EBC-1 cells and NCI-H526 cells or Calu-6 cells were used as models of TROP2 (+) cells and TROP2 (-) cells, respectively. TROP2 (+) cells and TROP2 (-) cells were mixed in various ratios and inoculated subcutaneously in mice to establish heterogeneous xenograft tumor models with various levels of TROP2 expression. Tumor growth inhibition in each model was evaluated by tumor volume after Dato-DXd or control-ADC administration. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of DXd and TROP2 were performed in Dato-DXd treated tumors to analyze distribution in TROP2 (+) and (-) tumor cells. Tumor cells that responded to Dato-DXd treatment were identified by IHC assay of &#947;H2AX (an indicator of DNA damage).<br \/>Results: TROP2 expression analysis showed that various TROP2 positivity tumor models were established by inoculating various ratios of admixed EBC-1 cells with NCI-H526 cells or Calu-6 cells. Dato-DXd did not inhibit growth of tumors consisting of only TROP2 (-) cells, as expected. In contrast, Dato-DXd showed strong tumor growth inhibition effect on all tumors in which TROP2 (+) cells were inoculated in various levels with TROP2 (-) cells. DXd-IHC analysis showed that Dato-DXd distributed to only TROP2 (+) tumor cells in admixed tumors, however, an increase of &#947;H2AX was observed not only in TROP2 (+) tumor cells but also TROP2 (-) tumor cells, suggesting TROP2 (-) tumor cells responded to DXd generated and distributed from Dato-DXd bound to TROP2 (+) tumor cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Dato-DXd is effective not only in TROP2 (+) tumor cells but also TROP2 (-) tumor cells adjacent to TROP2 (+) tumor cells, thereby demonstrating the bystander antitumor effect of Dato-DXd. This property suggests Dato-DXd should be active in the clinical setting even given potential heterogeneity of TROP2 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bystander effect,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Satoru Yasuda<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takanori Maejima<sup>1<\/sup>, Tadashi Toki<sup>1<\/sup>, Tsuyoshi Karibe<sup>1<\/sup>, Daisuke Okajima<sup>1<\/sup>, Penny Phillips<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., Basking Ridge, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0e62e4a8-06ec-447f-8238-fbe870ba1b6e","ControlNumber":"4176","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

We sought to investigate the immune stimulating potential of STRO-003, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of an anti-Receptor Orphan Receptor Kinase 1 (ROR1) antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase I targeted exatecan warhead via a cleavable linker. ROR1 is an oncofetal transmembrane receptor with restricted expression in normal tissues. Its overexpression in several cancer indications has been described, including in ovarian, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and hematological malignancies, thus making it an ideal ADC target. We have previously demonstrated potent in vivo activity of STRO-003 in a panel of ROR1-expressing lung cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Here we show that the exatecan warhead, SC3386, and STRO-003 ADC induced ICD in vitro as evidenced by presentation of cell-surface calreticulin and release of HMGB1. Consistent with this finding, STRO-003-treated cells elicited monocyte activation in a PBMC co-culture assay. To determine if these immunogenic properties could improve therapeutic efficacy, we evaluated STRO-003 in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in a mouse syngeneic model expressing ROR1. We have demonstrated that STRO-003 in combination with checkpoint inhibition significantly enhances efficacy in a syngeneic mouse model and supports durable anti-tumor immunity. Follow-up vaccination studies were performed to further explore the significance of STRO-003-induced ICD and protective immunity <i>in vivo<\/i>.

With nearly half a century of development, profound advancements have been made in the development of these therapeutics. The most advanced are antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) with currently &#62;100 in development and 11 approved by the FDA. To facilitate preclinical evaluation of novel drug conjugates, Reaction Biology and 4HF Biotec have developed a dedicated platform allowing specific <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in silico<\/i> analyses for this class of therapeutics. The platform is intended to provide information on the potency of the drug conjugate over the corresponding stand-alone cytotoxin, the cancer entities to be treated, the target engagement and the determinant(s) of cancer cell sensitivity. Here, we present our platform to refine antitumor potential of Sacituzumab govitecan (ScG), a recently approved TROP-2 targeted ADC used for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. First, we used the ProLiFiler&#8482; (Reaction Biology), a cell proliferation and survival assay with 140 human cancer cell lines, to establish the antitumor profile of ScG, its payload SN-38 and three other cytotoxins (camptothecin, MMAE and mertansine) to validate the results of our assay. The IC50 obtained for the cytotoxins were next validated using the MoAFinder (4HF Biotec), a tool derived from the NIH COMPARE algorithm that ranks drugs based on the similarity of their growth inhibitory profiles. The analysis confirmed that SN-38 and camptothecin antitumor profiles, as established with the ProLiFiler, correlated best with other topoisomerase-1 inhibitors from our database of more than 1,000 compounds. Mertansine and MMAE correlated best with tubulin inhibitors and were more potent than camptothecin and SN-38. Overall, the response to these cytotoxins was stronger in cell lines from hyperproliferative cancers such as hematological malignancies than in those from solid cancers. Next, by using OMICS data (internal and publicly available), qPCR and flow cytometry connected to drug sensitivity profiles, we will present a differential biomarker screen of ScG vs. SN-38 to identify molecular determinants of sensitivity toward the ADC and its cytotoxin. We will address the expression level of TROP2 and its predictivity for tumor cell sensitivity, screen for predictors of SN-38 response and investigate possible off-target effects in cell lines sensitive to ScG but lacking TROP2 expression. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of our platform to investigate drug conjugates. The comparative profiling of ScG and its payload allows to identify candidate cancer entities for ScG treatment and to improve patient enrollment into clinical trials using biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Trop-2,Preclinical testing,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vincent Vuaroqueaux<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nadine Obier<sup>2<\/sup>, Anne-Lise Peille<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Feger<sup>2<\/sup>, Katharina Schaich<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Metz<sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastian Dempe<sup>2<\/sup>, Heinz-Herbert Fiebig<sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Erik Ehlert<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>4HF Biotec GmbH, Freiburg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Reaction Biology Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7675be56-0f09-4f4e-a1c0-6f1af5348b1d","ControlNumber":"3347","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

Early studies suggested an interaction with tubulin, which remains poorly characterized to date but may be of particular therapeutic interest as NF1 is somatically mutated across multiple tumor types. We showed that multiple CRISPR-Cas9-engineeerd NF1 KO HER2+ breast cancer cells (BT-474, SK-BR3, HCC1954) become exquisitely sensitive to the Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1); we here investigate the underlying mechanism.TDM1 hypersensitivy was specific to the maytansin microtubule-targeting payload, since it was i) replicated by the naked payload but not the naked antibody; ii) absent with other ADCs (T-DxD); iii) not accompanied by increased TDM1 uptake; iv) associated with increased tubulin-maytansin binding in KO cells, as per Cellular Thermal Shift Assay. The mechanism is likely RAS-independent, as KRAS G12V-overexpression did not alter TDM1 sensitivity. RNAseq revealed that KO cells deregulated genes associated with microtubular dynamics and G2-M transition more strongly upon TDM1-treatement. Multiple KO cells investigated by static and live imaging exhibited marked signs of altered mitosis, with longer G2\/M, supernumerary centrosomes, chromosome misalignment and frequent aneuploidy, which could also be inferred in multiple public sequencing datasets (TCGA, MSK IMPACT, AACR GENIE). Based on this, we explored NF1 role on microtubule dynamics. We found several lines of evidence for a direct and mitosis-selective interaction between NF1 and tubulin: i) in Immunofluorescence (IF), NF1 was upregulated in mitosis and colocalized with the mitotic spindle; ii) NF1 co-Immunoprecipitated with tubulin in mitosis-enriched but not asynchronous cells; iii) purified NF1 co-eluted with tubulin in size-selection chromatography; iv) in silico modeling with AlphaFold2 predicted an interaction between NF1 central domains and the alpha-beta tubulin dimer. Crucially, KO cells exhibited severe microtubule hypodynamism in cold-induced depolymerization-repolymerization assays, replicated in multiple cell types and accompanied by imbalanced levels of plus\/minus-end microtubule-associated proteins. By IF on cocultured WT\/KO live cells, KO cells showed significantly higher GTP-tubulin, known to cause microtubular hyperstability, suggesting the intriguing possibility that NF1 may directly regulate tubulin intrinsic GTP-hydrolyzing activity, similar to its role on RAS. In conclusion, we provide extensive mechanistic evidence for a direct and previously underappreciated role of NF1 in microtubular dynamics, which reshapes our understanding of its tumor-suppressive activity and provides a rationale for pharmacological targeting of NF1-mutated tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-01 Cell cycle mechanisms of anticancer drug action,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microtubules,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Bruno  A.

Treatment modalities are restricted to surgery and\/or adjuvant radiotherapy and patients develop recurrence and distant metastasis over time. The absence of effective systematic therapy makes it incurable in advanced stage. ACC display an overall low mutation frequency, therefore very few actionable genetic alterations critical to the ACC development have been recognized. <i>MYB<\/i> fusion\/overexpression is the most frequently found genetic alteration in ACC and is present in ~70% patients. This is followed by activating <i>NOTCH<\/i> mutations, reported in ~20% patients. Despite the presence of few targetable genetic alterations, recent studies revealed substantial transcriptomic heterogeneity amongst ACC tumors suggesting the role of epigenetic alterations in ACC oncogenesis. Symmetric dimethylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that regulates mRNA splicing, transcription, translation, cell cycle and oncogenic signaling pathways. Protein Arginine Methyl Transferase 5 (PRMT5) is a predominant enzyme for symmetric dimethylation among a family of 9 methyl transferases. In was suggested that PRMT5 plays a role in regulating tumor progression via modulation of MYC signaling, cancer stemness, and a wide array of additional cellular and transcriptional pro-oncogenic processes. While inhibition of PRMTs showed anti-oncogenic response in several preclinical tumor models and a subset of patients with advanced solid malignancies (including ACC), preclinical studies investigating the effect of PRMT5 blockade in ACC remain inadequate. In part, due to the scarcity of ACC specimens and limited availability of the experimental models. PRT543 is a selective and potent small molecule PRMT5 inhibitor that specifically targets PRMT5 among 37 methyl transferases. In the present study, we have investigated the effect this novel agent using a unique collection of ACC cell lines, organoids, and patient derived xenograft mouse models. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the therapeutic effect of PRT543 in several preclinical models of ACC. Specifically, we found that PRT543 has potent antitumor activity in in-vitro and in-vivo models with MYB expression and activating NOTCH mutations. Further, based on these observations, we have sequenced a collection of 50 ACC tumor samples to identify the subset of patients who may potentially benefit from PRT543 treatment based on their underlying genetic signatures. This study provides evidence underscoring the role of PRMT5 signaling in ACC and supports the clinical development of PRMT5 inhibitors for this indication.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Organoids,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vasudha Mishra<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alka Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiangying Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Korzinkin<sup>2<\/sup>, Claudia Wing<sup>1<\/sup>, Viktoria Sarkisova<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexandra Ozerova<sup>2<\/sup>, Oksana Glushchenko<sup>2<\/sup>, Venkat Thodima<sup>3<\/sup>, Koichi Ito<sup>3<\/sup>, Peggy Scherle<sup>3<\/sup>, Mark Lingen<sup>4<\/sup>, Rifat Hasina<sup>5<\/sup>, Alexander Pearson<sup>1<\/sup>, Ari Rosenberg<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Zhavoronkov<sup>2<\/sup>, Bruce Ruggeri<sup>3<\/sup>, Nishant Agrawal<sup>5<\/sup>, Evgeny Izumchenko<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, Hong Kong, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Prelude Therapeutics, Wilmington, DE,<sup>4<\/sup>Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>5<\/sup>Surgery, Section of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6e9c78c9-4e9c-4d5a-8594-00d23ed4b6e8","ControlNumber":"5017","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

ONC201, EZH2i and HDACi can modulate tumor microenvironment (TME) and antitumor immunity. We studied the impact of these drugs or their combinations on the TME or tumor immunity by investigating cytokine profiles. We treated U251 GBM and HCT116 CRC cells with vorinostat and found upregulation of CXCL11, CXCL14, INF-&#947; and TRAIL, and downregulation of prolactin, CXCL9, VEGF and CCL2 in U251. CXCL11 promotes anti-tumor immunity by increasing activated CD8+ T cells in tumors but was associated with metastasis of GBM. CXCL13 induces tertiary lymphoid structures and enhances infiltration of CD8+&nbsp;T cells in tumors. INF-&#947; enhances antigen presentation and promotes activation of NK cells. Vorinostat upregulated the secretion of pro-immune cytokines and TRAIL which induces tumor apoptosis. Downregulated cytokines in U251 were prolactin, CXCL9 involved in tumor growth and metastasis, VEGF, and CCL2 involved in immunosuppression in GBM. Cytokines upregulated in HCT116 included IL-8 contributing to CRC progression, and CXCL13, and CXCL11 which correlates with anti-tumor immunity in colon cancer. Downregulated cytokines in HCT116 were soluble TRAIL R2 functioning as a decoy receptor for TRAIL, VEGF, and prolactin. We treated DMG, GBM and HCC cells with imipridones, EHZ2i tazemetostat or HDACi panobinostat alone or combination of imipridones plus tazemetostat or panobinostat or the triple combination of imipridone plus tazemetostat and panobinostat. We observed that cytokines impairing immunity were downregulated and cytokines promoting immunity were upregulated by individual drugs or combinations. Hep3B HCC cells showed the most robust changes among the mentioned tumors with respect to the changes of cytokine profile following the treatments. Imipridone or EZH2i treated cells showed similar cytokine profile changes in tumor cells. Imipridones downregulated EZH1 and EZH2 proteins in tumor cells. We RNA-seq to investigate gene expression profiles following treatment with ONC201 or tazemetostat. In GBM and DMG, ONC201 and tazemetostat shared similar top regulated genes. GO enrichment analysis showed overlap of top regulated pathways between ONC201 and EZH2i treated cells. Shared regulated pathways in U251 included cell cycle arrest, cell adhesion, nervous system development, cell proliferation, negative regulation of proliferation, PERK-mediated unfolded protein response, extracellular matrix organization, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, and cellular response to hypoxia pathways. We conclude that imipridones ONC201, ONC206, and ONC212 which reduce EZH1 and EZH2 proteins share similar cytokine alterations, gene expression targets and actions with EZH2 inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,ONC201,EZH2,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yiqun Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kelsey Huntington<sup><\/sup>, Wafik  S.

Here we present findings <i>in vivo <\/i>using two murine tumor models. We inoculated 4T1 cells into BALB\/c mice from which the cell line was derived. In addition, we inoculated the murine colon carcinoma cell line, MC38, into C57BL\/6 mice, the mouse strain of its origin. We treated the mice with DAC when tumors became palpable. DAC inhibited tumor growth in both tumor models and inhibited metastasis of 4T1 cells into the lungs. Quantitative PCR detected elevated expression of MMTV genes in the tumor tissues of DAC-treated mice in both models. The levels of MMTV <i>env<\/i> RNA in tumor tissues were negatively correlated with tumor mass in both models, so were the levels of the MMTV Env protein in 4T1 tumors. DAC also significantly mitigated tumor-induced splenomegaly. Hepatotoxicity of DAC was observed in C57BL\/6 mice. Our data suggest the possibility that decitabine inhibits tumor growth<i> in vivo <\/i>and <i>in vitro<\/i> via different mechanisms. The findings also support the current understanding of decitabine upregulating endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) which subsequently activate an interferon response. The negative correlation between tumor mass and MMTV Env protein expression suggests a possible role of ERV proteins serving as tumor-associated antigens and decitabine enhancing adaptive immunity against cancer by stimulating ERV expression on tumor cells. Further studies of the interaction between decitabine and MMTV using immunodeficient mice may help us understand the possible involvement of adaptive immunity in the pharmacodynamics of decitabine as well as the role of ERVs in tumor development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Decitabine,Mouse,Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus,Endogenous retrovirus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jieyu Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Savannah Higgins<sup>1<\/sup>, Riley Smith<sup>1<\/sup>, Tania Reginald<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Qi<sup>2<\/sup>, Jiayi Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna King<sup>1<\/sup>, Yingguang Liu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Liberty University, Lynchburg, VA,<sup>2<\/sup>Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d2cef856-52fa-47f3-a540-8021ab0bfd42","ControlNumber":"6972","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Chromosome translocation t(3;3) or inv(3) at 3q26 repositions the enhancer (E) of the tumor suppressor GATA2 to induce EVI1 over-expression, while concomitantly repressing GATA2. EVI1 over-expression promotes self-renewal and blocks differentiation of leukemia stem-progenitor cells (LSCs) and causes therapy refractoriness and inferior overall survival in AML. Previous reports highlighted that targeting BRD4 with BET inhibitor (BETi) is active against AML cells with inv(3)\/t(3;3). BETi treatment also represses EVI1 and its targets c-Myc and Bcl-xL. We recently reported that tegavivint (TV) (BC-2059), a disruptor of the nuclear TBL1\/R1-&#946;-catenin-TCF7L2 complex represses c-Myc, cyclin D1 and Survivin and inhibits growth and survival of AML LSCs. In present studies, a CRISPR screen in UCSD-AML1 cells (with 3q26 lesion and EVI1 overexpression) with gRNAs targeting epigenetic regulators highlighted BRD4 and p300 as dependencies. Treatment with BETi, e.g., OTX015, dose-dependently induced apoptosis of AML cell lines and patient-derived (PD) AML cells (AML191 and AML194) with inv(3) or t(3;3). OTX015 treatment repressed c-Myc, c-Myb, CDK4, MECOM, and MCL1, while inducing HEXIM1 and cleaved PARP levels. TV treatment also dose-dependently induced apoptosis in AML cell lines and PD AML cells with 3q26.2 lesions, associated with depletion of nuclear &#946;-catenin, EVI1, TCF7L2, c-Myc, c-Myb, RUNX1, CEBP&#945;, c-KIT, BCL2, Bcl-xL and MCL1, but increase in p21, CD11b, BIM and cleaved PARP levels. Hi-ChIP with H3K27Ac antibody demonstrated that TV treatment abolished chromatin loops between MYC and its Es within the super-E. RNA-Seq analysis showed negative enrichment (log2-fold) of gene sets of MYC, E2F and WNT targets, DNA replication\/repair and reduction of the 17-gene stemness score. Confocal microscopy showed that TV treatment disrupted co-localization of EVI1 and &#946;-catenin with TBL1, also confirmed by the Proximity Ligation Assay. CyTOF analysis confirmed that TV treatment reduced EVI1, c-Myc, RUNX1, &#946;-catenin, Bcl-xL, BCL2, MCL1 and Ki67 but increased cleaved PARP levels in the phenotypically characterized LSCs (with high expression of CLEC12A, CD123, CD244 and CD99) harboring inv(3) with EVI1 overexpression. Co-treatment with OTX015 and TV or the p300 inhibitor GNE-049 synergistically induced <i>in vitro<\/i> apoptosis in the AML cell lines and the PD AML cells with 3q26.2 lesions. Notably, in the flank-implanted PDX of AML191 or tail-vein infused PDX of AML242 models in NSG mice, treatment with OTX015 and TV, compared to vehicle control or each drug alone, significantly reduced AML growth and improved survival, without any host toxicity. These findings highlight the promising pre-clinical efficacy of novel BETi-based combinations against AML models harboring 3q26 lesions and EVI1 overexpression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,BRD4,Myc,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christine  E.

Triapine is one of the best-known TSCs for anticancer therapy and is currently tested in a clinical phase III trial. To further improve the anticancer activity of TSCs, novel derivatives (such as DpC and COTI-2) have been developed and clinically investigated for their activity against solid tumors. These novel TSCs belong to a subclass (incl. the tetra-methylated Triapine derivative, Me<sub>2<\/sub>NNMe<sub>2<\/sub>) that are terminally disubstituted and demonstrated enhanced anticancer activity <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The improved activity of these TSCs correlated with their ability to form stable copper complexes as well as induce paraptosis, a form of programmed but caspase-independent cell death, that is characterized by the formation of vesicles originating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the molecular events behind paraptosis induction are still not fully elucidated. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular signaling behind paraptosis as well as the reasons behind the induction of this quite unknown form of cell death by TSCs.<br \/>A whole-genome gene expression analysis of cells treated with a terminally disubstituted TSC revealed an upregulation of thiol homeostasis-related genes, copper metabolism, and metallothionein genes as well as ER stress response genes. In addition, we found an upregulation of the copper-sensitive and thiol-containing protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which was confirmed on protein level. In cell-free activity studies, PDI was indeed inhibited by terminally disubstituted TSCs, although only in form of their copper complexes. In agreement, removal of copper ions by specific chelators greatly reduced their anticancer activity as well as paraptotic potential in cell culture. This inhibition was hypothesized to be induced by a general disruption of the thiol redox homeostasis affecting also other responsive proteins and resulting in a more oxidative environment, especially in the ER. In confirmation, thiol-containing small molecules could reduce the compound&#8217;s anticancer activity in viability assays. Furthermore, glutathione as well as PDI were detected predominantly in their oxidized form in cells treated with terminally disubstituted TSCs.<br \/>Consequently, terminally disubstituted TSCs, which are characterized by higher anticancer activity, induce paraptosis due to their high copper complex stability. The formation of the complex results in the interaction with thiol-containing proteins and subsequently in the disruption of the thiol-redox homeostasis, which leads to paraptotic cell death. Overall this work shed light on the paraptotic cell death and will be of interest for future clinical development of anticancer TSCs, as paraptosis is hypothesized to overcome apoptosis-resistance of cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell death,Endoplasmic reticulum,Anticancer thiosemicarbazone,Copper,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sonja Hager<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Walter Berger<sup>2<\/sup>, Christian R.

C1 metabolism encompasses distinct cytosol (Cyto) and mitochondria (Mito) pathways connected by an interchange between serine, glycine and formate. Mito C1 metabolism provides cellular glycine and C1 units (as formate) for <i>de novo<\/i> synthesis of thymidylate and purine nucleotides in the Cyto. Polyglutamyl folates are the predominant folate forms in cells and are generally preferred for C1 transfers. Thus, folate polyglutamylation is essential for cellular homeostasis. Folate polyglutamylation is catalyzed by folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), including Cyto (cFPGS) and Mito (mFPGS) isoforms. C1 metabolism is critical for tumor growth and thus offers a plethora of therapeutic targets for cancer. Of particular interest are Mito C1 inhibitors including &#8220;non-classical&#8221; pyrazolopyran compounds SHIN1 and SHIN2, and &#8220;classical&#8221; pyrrolo[3,2-<i>d<\/i>]pyrimidine antifolate compounds typified by AGF347, all targeting serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2). Both SHIN1 and AGF347 effected <i>in vitro<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy, and SHIN2 and AGF347 showed <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy toward tumor xenografts. We systematically explored the roles of cFPGS and mFPGS levels as critical determinants of C1 inhibitor target engagement and net Cyto versus Mito C1 flux, resulting in anti-tumor efficacy. We found that FPGS transcript levels significantly correlated with the effects of AGF347 toward a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines including MIA PaCa-2. We engineered MIA PaCa-2 cells with FPGS gene knockout to stably express inducible mFPGS or cFPGS form. FPGS in mFPGS-transfected cells (mFPGS#32) was expressed mainly in Mito over Cyto, whereas FPGS in cFPGS-transfected cells (cFPGS#3) was expressed exclusively in Cyto. Accumulation of radiolabeled folate and AGF347 increased with increasing FPGS in both Cyto and Mito for mFPGS#32, but only in Cyto for cFPGS#3. Metabolomics with [2,3,3-<sup>2<\/sup>H]serine in cFPGS#3 and mFPGS#32 established FPGS levels in Mito versus Cyto as important determinants of C1 fluxes. Increased FPGS levels in mFPGS#32 enhanced C1 flux in Mito far greater than in Cyto, and greater than for the increased FPGS in cFPGS#3. As a result, Cyto-targeted antifolates pemetrexed and AGF94 were only modestly impacted by increasing FPGS levels in both mFPGS#32 and cFPGS#3 (~3x). In contrast, increasing FPGS levels dramatically enhanced the inhibitory effects of Mito-targeted antifolates such as AGF347 in mFPGS#32 (~8-25x), and to a greater extent than in cFPGS#3 (~6-8x). Conversely, increasing FPGS levels substantially attenuated the cytotoxic effect of SHIN1 in mFPGS#32 (~19x). In summary, FPGS levels are an important determinant of C1 fluxes, particularly in Mito where they contribute to cytotoxic potencies of Mito-targeted C1 inhibitors at SHMT2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antifolates,One carbon metabolism,Mitochondria,Polyglutamylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Carrie O’Connor<sup>1<\/sup>, Jade Katinas<sup>2<\/sup>, Mathew Schneider<sup>1<\/sup>, Md.

C1 metabolism is frequently reprogrammed in cancer cells to provide nucleotides, amino acids, and glutathione, and to maintain redox homeostasis for proliferation. The mitochondrial C1 converting enzymes serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) 2 and methylene tetrahydrofolate (THF) dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) are among the top overexpressed metabolic enzymes in human cancers, suggesting these are important cancer-specific targets. We previously discovered novel 5-substituted pyrrolo[3,2-<i>d<\/i>]pyrimidine antifolates (with AGF347 being the lead) that potently inhibit mitochondrial SHMT2, as well as SHMT1. Folates are essential cofactors for C1 converting reactions; folates and antifolates primarily rely on the major facilitative folate transporters RFC and PCFT for internalization by tumor cells. In these studies, we explore the effects of folate transporter expression on the compartmentalization of C1 metabolism in the mitochondria and cytosol and the potential impact on SHMT1 and SHMT2 inhibition. We used a tetracycline inducible system for RFC expression in RFC\/PCFT-null HeLa cells, with and without constitutive PCFT, and characterized the impact on transport and accumulation of folates and AGF347 in response to folate transporter expression. Increased accumulation of folates was observed with increasing RFC in the absence of PCFT. In the presence of PCFT, baseline folate accumulation was substantial and independent of RFC expression, indicating a major role of PCFT as a facilitative folate transporter. SHMT2 catalyzes the conversion of serine and THF to glycine and 5, 10-methylene THF in the mitochondria, while SHMT1 catalyzes the reverse reaction in the cytosol, producing THF and serine. To determine how folate transporter expression affects the C1 flux through SHMT1 vs SHMT2, [2,3,3-<sup>2<\/sup>H]serine tracer experiments were performed; increased mitochondrial C1 flux through SHMT2 was observed with increasing RFC in the absence of PCFT, whereas the mitochondrial flux through SHMT2 predominated in the presence of PCFT. By cell proliferation assays it was discovered that cells with lower RFC expression exhibit a hypersensitive phenotype towards AGF347 in the absence of PCFT, indicating a unique therapeutic opportunity for targeting SHMT forms in cancer cells with low folate transport activity. Here we identify RFC and PCFT as key determinants for the compartmentalization of C1 flux in the mitochondria vs the cytosol, in turn affecting the sensitivity of cancer cells towards SHMT inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Drug sensitivity,Antifolates,Folate,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mathew Joseph Schneider<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Carrie O'connor<sup>1<\/sup>, Xun Bao<sup>1<\/sup>, Md.

However, intrinsic or acquired tumor resistance severely limit their clinical application. Here, we investigated the anticancer activity of several novel silver(I) 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine derivatives, containing either triphenylphosphane (PPh<sub>3<\/sub>) or 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) ligands and tested their potential to overcome platinum resistance.<br \/>Methods: Cytotoxicity and cross resistance profiles of the newly synthesized compounds were tested against two OC models (SKOV-3 and MES-OV), a CRC model (HCT-116) and their corresponding sublines resistant to carboplatin or oxaliplatin, as well as non-malignant fibroblasts (F331) via an MTT-based cell viability assay after 72 h continuous drug exposure. Moreover, the intracellular levels of silver were measured via ICP-MS. In addition, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition properties, impact on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis induction potential were investigated via multiple molecular biological methods. Morphological changes induced by the silver compounds were characterized via spinning disk confocal microscopy.<br \/>Results: All tested compounds displayed pronounced anticancer activity and cancer cell selectivity. Moreover, cell intrinsic resistance to carboplatin or oxaliplatin was not impacting on the cytotoxic activity of the compounds. Noteworthy, MES-OV and HCT-116 cells showed exceptional sensitivity to several silver(I) 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine derivatives with a 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) (AP-compounds). This sensitivity was not based on enhanced drug uptake, pronounced TrxR inhibition nor apoptosis induction or cell cycle arrest. In contrast, hypersensitive cells displayed pronounced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles together with multiple others hallmarks of paraptotic cell death.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings did not only demonstrate that the new silver compounds were unaffected by cancer cell intrinsic resistance mechanisms to platinum-based chemotherapy, but also indicated a high vulnerability of tumor (sub)types towards these bipyridine silver complexes. This hypersensitivity is based on the induction of paraptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death. To summarize, these silver compounds represent a new class of promising anticancer drugs, which demand further preclinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Silver(I) compounds,Antitumor activity,paraptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alessia Stefanelli<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ricardo G.

We have previously demonstrated ATO as an effective chemotherapy against high-grade serous ovarian cancer in cell lines and mouse model. In the present study, we aim to determine if ATO is asserting its anti-cancer properties by altering cellular metabolism. Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are the two major sources of intracellular energy. ATO reduces OXPHOS energy production by inhibiting mitochondrial complex III. We first determined whether there is a shift in energy production when OXPHOS is inhibited by assessing glycolytic function in various human (OVCAR3 and OVCAR5) and mouse (ID8) ovarian cancer cell lines. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were assessed by the Seahorse XF Analyzer. First, we pretreated cells with ATO at IC70 concentrations for 1 hour prior to metabolic analysis. As expected, pretreatment with ATO reduces OCR in all cell lines. However, ATO treatment increased basal glycolysis but decreased glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve. This suggests that ATO-treated cells have an impaired ability to shift energy production towards glycolysis when there is an increase in energy demand. One of the initial events that occur in ATO-treated cells is a surge in reactive oxygen species (ROS) as measured by H2DCFDA ROS assay. In the human cell lines, we found that ATO significantly increased ROS by approximately 100-fold (MFI). Whereas, in the mouse cell line, the ATO-induced increase in ROS were comparatively attenuated. We hypothesized that the increase in ROS leads to inhibition of glycolysis. We tested this by pre-treating cells with 2mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an oxygen radical scavenger, for 1 hour before measuring the metabolic responses to ATO. We found that NAC attenuated the inhibition of glycolytic processes in human cell lines but not in the mouse cell line. Our lab has previously shown that ATO induced activation and increased expression of p53. Studies have shown that ROS activate p53, which in turn upregulates the TP53 induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulatory phosphatase (TIGAR), inhibiting the conversion of F6P to F-2,6-BP and ultimately leads to inhibition of glycolysis. Increases in ROS also shuttle G6P towards the phosphate pentose pathways through G6P dehydrogenase for antioxidant production. We found that long-term ATO treatment for 24 hours also resulted in increases in both TIGAR and G6PD mRNA expression. Taken together, these results suggest that ATO decreased plasticity of metabolic capacity in ovarian cancer cells through ROS and ROS associated glycolytic pathways. Further, this study provides mechanistic insights into ATO&#8217;s potential as a chemotherapeutic agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Glycolysis,Oxidative stress,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicha Boonpattrawong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sejal Sharma<sup><\/sup>, Rob Schultz<sup><\/sup>, Mayra  A.

However, most drugs exhibit side effects. Neurotoxicity, one of the side effects commonly accompanied, greatly affects the quality of life and also reduces compliance with treatment. Calcium signal transduction, which occupies a key position in cell signal transduction, has been found to be involved in various mechanisms including proliferation, differentiation, and death of cells, beyond the existing research direction that focuses on channels. To identify the mechanisms of calcium signal regulation that can reduce chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) while maintaining anticancer functions of drugs, we study with the two drugs frequently used in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma, borteozomib (BTZ) and vincristine (VIN), whose main side effects are neurotoxicity. We used the human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y cells, and performed MTT assay after treating them with N-Acetylcysteine &#8203;&#8203;(NAC), an antioxidant, to determine whether the reduction in cell viability by BTZ and VIN was due to the increase in ROS. When BTZ and VIN were treated with NAC, cytotoxicity by BTZ was significantly reduced and cell viability decreased by VIN was significantly increased. From these results, we found that ROS are involved in BTZ and VIN -induced apoptosis. In addition, we performed MTT assay using calcium inhibitors to investigate whether intracellular calcium signaling is involved in BTZ and VIN-induced apoptosis, and 8-Br-cADPR, Ned-19, Xestospongin C, and Heparin were used as calcium inhibitors. To confirm that the cell viability reduced by BTZ and VIN is recovered by calcium inhibitors, BTZ and VIN were treated together with calcium inhibitors, respectively. Cell viability was found to increase significantly. These results suggest that intracellular calcium signaling is involved in cell death induced by BTZ and VIN. The increase in [ca<sup>2+<\/sup>]i in the cytoplasm when treated with BTZ and VIN was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. It was shown that the treatment with BTZ and VIN increased the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm within 1 minute. To confirm that the concentration of intracellular calcium was reduced by the calcium inhibitor, BTZ and calcium inhibitor were treated together, and it was confirmed that the intracellular calcium concentration increased by BTZ was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner at 2uM and 3uM of the calcium inhibitor. In conclusion, this experiment suggests that intracellular calcium signaling is involved in the BTZ and VIN&#8217;s reduction of neuronal cell viability (CIPN) in multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. <b> <\/b> <i>This research was supported by NRF 2021R1A2C1091322 (J.-S.Kim) and 2021R1F1A1064120 (J.

Analysis of intracellular proteins via Western blot indicated that combinatorial treatment induces the integrated stress response, DNA damage\/cell cycle checkpoint responses, and increased apoptosis of tumor cells.

While the field has witnessed numerous attempts to apply human tissue for the prediction of response, fundamental errors in methodologic approaches severely limited the predictive validity and clinical applicability of these important technologies. The first error was a focus upon drug induced cell growth inhibition. This lead to the failure of the clonogenic (human tumor stem cell) and H3*Thymidine incorporation platforms in the 1970&#8217;s and 1980&#8217;s. As the concept of apoptosis arose following landmark observations in 1972, cell death endpoints became predominant including mitochondrial function (MTT, XTT), ATP content (luciferase) and delayed loss of membrane integrity (DISC, EVA\/PCD) among others. These improvements led to more biologically relevant measures. However, a second hurdle arose as investigators chose to amplify subculture and propagate tumors into what are now referred to as human tumor organoids. While these 3-D cultures are more reflective of tumor cell-cell interactions found in cancers, they cannot recreate the cell-vasculature, cell-stroma, inflammatory environment nor cancer associated fibroblast interactions with human cancer cells required for accurate response prediction. To address these shortcomings we developed the ex vivo analysis of programmed cell death (EVA\/PCD) platform that applies native state tumor explants directly from surgical specimens to select drugs and combinations. To date we have reported 11,680 individual analyses. Positive prospective results have been reported in breast cancer (TTP p &#60; 0.03); ovarian cancer (TTP p = 0.05), lung cancer (2-fold improvement in ORR; TTP p =0.035) and recently ovarian and uterine cancer (DFS p = 0.038) with two meta-analyses confirming the predictive validity in hematologic and solid tumors. With over 20 years of CLIA-approved laboratory experience in the study of human tumor primary culture explants, the EVA\/PCD platform provides improved response and time to progression and offers the opportunity to streamline drug development, curtail costs and avoid futile care in patients with advanced and refractory malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ex vivo,Profiling,Cell death,3D models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Adam  J.

Due to the limitations of currently available targeted therapies, there remains a significant unmet need for the development of new targeted therapies for TNBC. Molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is attracting attention as an ideal therapeutic target due to it regulates essential biological functions such as cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Although N-terminal HSP90 inhibitors have had little clinical success to date, C-terminal HSP90 inhibitors have received relatively little attention. We sought to investigate the effects of a new rationally designed NCT-547 on apoptosis, breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)-like properties, migration ability and heat shock response (HSR) <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor growth and metastasis in CSC-enriched allograft model <i>in vivo<\/i>. NCT-547 inhibits TNBC cell proliferation by simultaneously inactivating several survival factors including AKT, MEK, and STAT3. In addition, NCT-547 effectively targets BCSC-like properties with impairment of ALDH1 activity, CD44+\/CD24- phenotype, and 3D mammosphere-forming ability. The expression of HSF-1 target genes such as Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp27, Hsp40 and Hsp65 is highly overexpressed in TNBC patients. The mRNA abundances of target genes were significantly decreased after NCT-547 challenge. NCT-547 effectively targets both the proliferating TNBC tumor cells and CSCs, markedly reducing tumor growth, coinciding with decreased Ki-67 proliferation index and enhanced apoptosis. Anti-tumor effect of NCT-457 was independent of heat shock response as evidenced by significant downregulation of HSF1 phosphorylation and expression of downstream targets HSPs members. It is noteworthy that NCT-547 did not affect markers of hepatic and renal acute toxicity and was not cytotoxic in non-malignant cells. NCT-547 may therefore have potential to address current limitations in the treatment of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Breast cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Cancer stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eunsun Jung<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Seojin Jang<sup><\/sup>, Daeil Sung<sup><\/sup>, Soeun Park<sup><\/sup>, Minsu Park<sup><\/sup>, Dongmi Ko<sup><\/sup>, Seongjae Kim<sup><\/sup>, Juyeon Seo<sup><\/sup>, Kee Dal Nam<sup><\/sup>, Yoon-Jae Kim<sup><\/sup>, Ji Young Kim<sup><\/sup>, Jae Hong Seo<sup><\/sup>, Yong koo Kang<sup><\/sup>, So Ra Seock<sup><\/sup>, Jung Min Park<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c685fcb4-2380-4b8c-b540-63d2e1cfb493","ControlNumber":"5839","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

Although cisplatin therapy may be initially successful, its effectiveness is often significantly reduced in patients with relapsed disease. There is an urgent need to overcome cisplatin resistance in the treatment of NPC and NSCLC. Luminespib (AUY922) is an experimental drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. It is an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a chaperone protein that plays a role in modifying a variety of proteins involved in tumorigenesis. Hsp90 inhibitors have demonstrated potent activity in preclinical testing and clinical trials against various cancer types. We sought to investigate the preclinical efficacy of AUY922 and evaluate its anticancer effect in cisplatin-resistant NPC and NSCLC cells.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Two NPC cells (HK1 and Hone1), four NSCLC cells (A549, SW900, NCI-H1975, and HCC4006), one normal lung cells (CCD11Lu), two cisplatin-resistant NPC cells (HK1-R and Hone1-R), and one cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells (A549-R) were cultured and treated with 100 nM AUY922 for 48 hours. A cell proliferation assay was performed in triplicate to determine the antiproliferative effects of AUY922 on cancer cells. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis. The apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin V and Western blot analysis. Nude mice were used to test the effects of intraperitoneal injection of AUY922 on tumor growth.<br \/>Results: We found that AUY922 significantly inhibited <i>in vitro<\/i> growth in all the two NPC (44% and 40%) and four NSCLC (53%, 77%, 50%, and 62%) cells in comparison to the normal lung cells (4%). The two cisplatin-resistant NPC cells (63% and 37%) also showed significant inhibition of viability after treatment with AUY922. However, there was only a slightly reduced viability in the cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells (14%). Flow cytometry revealed that AUY922 induced G2\/M and S phase arrest in HK1 and HK1-R cells. On the other hand, AUY922 also induced pro-apoptotic peaks in A549, A549-R, Hone1, and Hone1-R cells. Interestingly, Annexin V and Western blot analysis showed that cell death was not caused by apoptosis. <i>In vivo<\/i>, both AUY922 alone and the combination of AUY922 with cisplatin treatments inhibited NPC and NSCLC tumor growth without significant weight loss. In addition, the administration of AUY922 significantly reduced NPC and NSCLC tumor growth in the cisplatin-resistant mouse models.<br \/>Conclusion: AUY922 exhibits potent anticancer activities <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. These findings provide evidence that AUY922 could be useful for the treatment of NPC and NSCLC as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin. Most importantly, our results provide a preclinical proof of concept for the efficacy of AUY922 in cisplatin-resistant NPC and NSCLC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hsp90,AUY922,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>William  C.

This mechanism has recently garnered significant attention in the field of oncology because many difficult-to-treat tumor types are particularly susceptible to this non-canonical form of cell death. However, robust biomarkers that predict sensitivity to ferroptosis are needed to help select well-defined tumor subtypes and patient segments that are likely to respond to GPX4-targeting. Our nascent RNA platform measures the active transcription of not only protein-coding transcripts, but also transcripts initiating from enhancer regions (enhancer RNAs) critical for defining cell type. We reasoned that these data could afford the unique opportunity to identify non-coding transcripts that could serve as novel biomarkers of sensitivity to ferroptosis. We recently discovered a potent and selective GPX4 inhibitor and profiled the compound for its ability to induce ferroptosis across a diverse group of cancer cell types. We chose several of the most sensitive and resistant cell lines for further examination using our nascent RNA platform and identified novel relationships between sensitivity to ferroptosis and cell-specific enhancer RNA profiles. Importantly, enhancer RNA profiles were more effective at stratifying sensitive and resistant cell lines than protein-coding gene expression. Using enhancer RNA expression profiles as biomarkers of drug sensitivity represents a novel strategy that could ultimately improve our ability to select patient cohorts more likely to benefit from emerging drug candidates and established therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription,eRNA \/ RNA,GPX4 \/ Ferroptosis,Drug Discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Timothy Read<sup><\/sup>, David Simpson<sup><\/sup>, Jenna Rimel<sup><\/sup>, Christy Rhine<sup><\/sup>, Casey Pham<sup><\/sup>, Cole Liechty<sup><\/sup>, Eric Martin<sup><\/sup>, <b>Joey Azofeifa<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Arpeggio Biosciences, Boulder, CO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5b1a0de5-f0b2-4445-90b0-76e7ea97ce24","ControlNumber":"6940","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.

Downstream of target engagement, ONC201 activates the integrated stress response pathway resulting in selective tumor cell death. ONC201 is well tolerated and induces durable tumor regressions in H3 K27M-mutant glioma patients. ONC206, a derivative of ONC201 currently in Phase I trials for adult and pediatric brain tumors, is also a bitopic DRD2 antagonist and ClpP agonist with nanomolar potency. We further evaluated in vitro efficacy and mechanism of action specific to ClpP for ONC206 and investigated acquired resistance to ONC201 and ONC206. FITC-casein and peptide degradation assays confirmed that ONC206 acts as an agonist of human ClpP with enhanced potency relative to ONC201. Broad efficacy in the nanomolar range for ONC206 (GI50 &#60;78-889nM, 72h) was observed in 1,088 Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) cancer cell lines with increased sensitivity in cell lines exhibiting high ClpP mRNA expression. Among solid tumors, nervous system-related cell lines were particularly sensitive. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database analysis showed ClpP mRNA was overexpressed in glioblastoma cells relative to normal cells. GDSC observations were confirmed in glioblastoma (GBM) (T98G, A172, U87MG), H3.3 K27M mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (SF8628, SF7761) and astrocytoma (H4, U118MG) cell lines. ONC206 was more potent than ONC201 in cell viability assays for all glioma lines tested. SF8628 cells with a CRISPR-mediated ClpP knockout were shown to demonstrate resistance to both ONC201 and ONC206. Polyclonal resistant cell lines were generated through prolonged passaging in increasing concentrations of ONC201 or ONC206 (SF8628 and T98G cells). Cells with acquired resistance to ONC201 (ONC201Res) or ONC206 (ONC206Res) showed cross resistance to both imipridones. Time-stability of resistance was confirmed by removing drug for 2 to 4 weeks and retesting. RNAseq analysis revealed upregulation of the integrated stress response with imipridone treatment in T98G parental cells but not resistant clones. Whole genome sequencing revealed ClpP mutations in both ONC201Res and ONC206Res cells. Our results confirm the role of ClpP in the mechanism of action of ONC201 and ONC206 in tumor cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,ONC201,ONC206,ClpP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Andrew Lee<sup><\/sup>, Cristina Maranto<sup><\/sup>, Scott Foster<sup><\/sup>, Sara Morrow<sup><\/sup>, Joshua E.

By using NAMPTis to disrupt the cellular metabolic process while simultaneously inhibiting PARP activity, an essential DNA damage repair enzyme, it is possible to exploit the dependence of ovarian cancer cells on functional PARP activity. This is particularly important in homologous recombination deficient subtypes. In addition to a synergistic growth inhibitory response in ovarian cancer cells, preclinical combination studies of NAMPTis with olaparib, an approved PARP inhibitor, exhibited higher levels of DNA damage accumulation than with single drug treatments. Our <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> characterizations of NAMPT inhibition suggest that NAMPTis as either single agents or in combination treatments with PARP inhibitors should be investigated further as potential treatment options for ovarian cancer patient populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug sensitivity,Combination therapy,Metabolism,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jenny  J.

Recent literature reenforces the concept that complex interactions between drugs, neoplastic cells and cells of TME determine the efficacy of anticancer therapies. Systems understanding of these interactions can serve to predict effective treatment combinations simultaneously attacking tumor cell vulnerabilities, enhancing immune surveillance, and mitigating stromal mediators of resistance. The key challenge is to find such TME-modulating combinations in a fast and more informative way. We have developed an integrated analytical platform termed Multiplex Implantable Microdevice Assay (MIMA) to rapidly decompose cancer complexity in drug response and find biomarkers with predictive value for combination therapy efficacy including immunotherapy efficacy. The system deploys a (i) miniaturized implantable microdevice for localized intratumoral drug delivery and (ii) multiplex immunostaining to measure 30+ proteins in single cells at each drug well. Computational analyses of local drug-induced changes provide information about the composition, functional state and spatial cell organization of the tumor and associated TME ultimately bringing new insights into drug mechanisms of action. We used MIMA in genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer to evaluate effects of five targeted anticancer agents (olaparib, palbociclib, venetoclax, panobinostat, lenvatinib) and two chemotherapies (doxorubicin, paclitaxel) and predicted synergistic antitumor effects with anti-PD-1, anti-CD40, anti-CSF1R immunotherapies and vasculature modulating agents. Some of the most effective combinations were not reported before. A pan-HDAC inhibitor, panobinostat, that synergized with anti-PD-1, induced immunogenic cell death and infiltration of antigen presenting neutrophils. Further longitudinal spatial analyses revealed that mechanisms of resistance co-emerged with these response phenotypes and became prominent over time. We measured fibroblast, protumorigenic macrophage and cytotoxic B cell recruitment associated with heavy deposition of collagen VI, increased immune suppression and emergence of invasive and cancer stem cells. Combination with stroma modulating agent, losartan, improved the efficacy of panobinostat\/anti-PD-1 in systemic studies implying that normalization of non-immune stroma might favorably alter aspects of TME for immune and targeted therapy efficacy.

H-FIRE has been shown to precisely and nonthermally ablate brain tumors while transiently disrupting the peritumoral blood-brain barrier (BBB). The enhanced BBB permeability post-tumor ablation can be exploited to enhance therapeutic delivery to invasive tumor margins, but the mechanisms of H-FIRE-induced BBB disruption remain incompletely characterized. We hypothesize that bystander effects of H-FIRE tumor cell ablation, specifically the release of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TDEVs), mediate peritumoral BBB endothelium disruption. F98 glioma and bEnd.3 cerebral endothelial cell lines modelled primary brain cancer and the BBB endothelium, respectively. F98 glioma cells were treated <i>in vitro<\/i> with sham treatment, a sub-ablative (1,500 V\/cm), or an ablative (3,000 V\/cm) electric field dose of H-FIRE, and TDEVs were isolated from the supernatants via filtration and ultracentrifugation. Post-H-FIRE TDEVs were characterized via nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy, with ablative doses of H-FIRE resulting in decreased release of TDEVs compared to sub-ablative H-FIRE and sham treatment. Post-H-FIRE TDEVs were then applied to Transwell models of the BBB endothelium to evaluate the effect of H-FIRE-induced TDEVs on BBB endothelium permeability. TDEVs released after the ablative H-FIRE dose (3,000 V\/cm) significantly increased permeability of the BBB endothelium <i>in vitro <\/i>compared to TDEVs released after sub-ablative and sham H-FIRE treatment.<i> <\/i>TDEVs were then fluorescently labelled with CFSE, and confocal microscopy was used to characterize internalization of post-H-FIRE TDEVs by cerebral endothelial cells. The TDEVs released after ablative doses of H-FIRE were significantly internalized by bEnd.3 cerebral endothelial cells, while TDEVs released after sub-ablative and sham treatment were not internalized. The proteomic payloads of the post-H-FIRE TDEVs were characterized using mass spectrometry, and clustering analysis demonstrated that the <i>in vitro <\/i>BBB-modulatory TDEVs released after 3,000 V\/cm H-FIRE had distinct proteomic payloads compared to the non-BBB-modulatory TDEV populations released after sham and 1,500 V\/cm H-FIRE treatment. Proteins associated with proteasomal degradation, cellular adhesion, and modulation of junctional integrity were increased in the BBB-modulatory group of TDEVs. Taken together, our results suggest that H-FIRE ablation of glioma significantly alters the proteomic cargo of TDEVs to increase internalization of TDEVs by cerebral endothelial cells and increase permeability of the BBB endothelium.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Exosomes,Blood-brain barrier,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kelsey Murphy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kenneth Aycock<sup>2<\/sup>, Spencer Marsh<sup>3<\/sup>, Alayna Hay<sup>4<\/sup>, Christine Chang<sup>5<\/sup>, Shay Bracha<sup>6<\/sup>, Robert Gourdie<sup>3<\/sup>, Rafael Davalos<sup>2<\/sup>, John  H.

UA and digoxin have also been at several clinical trials for treatment of different cancers including prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer. However, they displayed limited benefit to patients. Currently, a poor understanding of their direct targets and mechanisms of action (MOA) in tumor cells severely hinders their further development. We previously identified nuclear receptor ROR&#947; as a novel therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Previous studies implicated UA and digoxin as potential ROR&#947; antagonists in modulating the functions of immune cells such as Th17 cells. Here we showed that UA displays a strong activity in inhibition of ROR&#947;-dependent transactivation function, while digoxin exhibits no effect at clinically relevant concentrations. In prostate cancer cells, UA down-regulates ROR&#947;-stimulated AR expression and AR signaling, whereas digoxin up-regulates AR signaling pathway. UA also showed potent anti-growth effects in AR-positive prostate cancer cells compared to AR-negative prostate cancer cells. In TNBC cells, UA but not digoxin alters ROR&#947;-regulated cell proliferation and apoptosis gene programs. Together, our study shows for the first-time that UA, but not digoxin, acts as a natural antagonist of ROR&#947; in prostate cancer and TNBC cells. Our finding that ROR&#947; is a direct target of UA in specific type of cancer will help select patients with tumors that likely respond to UA treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,ursolic acid,digoxin,ROR&#947;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hongye Zou<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yatian Yang<sup><\/sup>, Demin Cai<sup><\/sup>, Hong-Wu Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, UC Davis, Sacramento, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b6dd5eff-78d2-47c1-a520-861c53607fca","ControlNumber":"7417","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Up to 50% of colorectal carcinoma patients develop LM during their disease and this is associated with a poor prognosis. Our laboratory previously identified a sexual dimorphism in the regulation of the immune microenvironment (IME) of LM and showed that estrogen could promote the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Tregs in the liver in response to invading cancer cells. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of estrogen in the recruitment and polarization of other immune cells and to determine the therapeutic potential of Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader (SERD) therapy in CRCLM bearing female mice, and evaluate if SERD would improve anti PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy. In estrogen-competent female mice bearing CRCLM, we found increased gene and protein expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-&#946;, and inversely a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. Furthermore, we identified a significant decrease of immunosuppressive CD68+CD163+ M2 macrophages, and an increase of the pro-inflammatory CD68+TNF-alpha+ M1 macrophages in estrogen-depleted (ovariectomized) mice as compared to estrogen-competent mice. This observation was reversed upon estradiol supplementation. Moreover, treatment of female mice with the SERD Fulvestrant, markedly reduced the number of CRCLM compared to vehicle-treated mice, reduced the cell frequencies and counts of M2 macrophages, significantly increased NK cells recruitment in the liver. The addition of SERD to immunotherapy has a better therapeutic effect than both therapies alone, and increased CD8+ T-cells, NK cells, and M1\/M2 macrophages ratio. Taken together, our results identify estrogen as a critical regulator of an immunosuppressive TME in the liver and a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Liver,Estrogen,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yasmine Benslimane<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Lapin<sup>1<\/sup>, Julien Chambon<sup>2<\/sup>, Stephanie Perrino<sup>2<\/sup>, Pnina Brodt<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bd432807-5eed-422d-847e-a9df1d4448e3","ControlNumber":"5631","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.
