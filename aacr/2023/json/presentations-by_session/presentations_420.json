[{"Abstract":"In the past decade, great strides have been made in the development of novel immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) to treat cancer. However, despite these improvements, subsets of patients do not respond to ICI, highlighting an unmet need for alternative immunotherapies. As potent immunomodulators, cytokines have been explored as treatments for cancer but have been limited due to toxicity and poor pharmacokinetics (PK). One of these key cytokines, interleukin 21 (IL-21), is a pluripotent cytokine that activates anti-tumor T cell responses, induces B cell activation, and promotes generation and maintenance of germinal centers and tertiary lymphoid structures. A member of the common &#947;-chain family of cytokines, IL-21 acts on a broader range of cells than IL-2 and does not induce vascular leak syndrome. Despite being a potent inducer of immune activation, clinical activity of IL-21 has been hampered by poor PK and adverse events at dose levels associated with efficacy. To explore the potential therapeutic benefits of IL-21 as a treatment for cancer, Werewolf Therapeutics has developed different formats of IL-21 INDUKINE<sup>TM<\/sup> polypeptides containing native human IL-21, an inactivation domain and a half-life extension domain tethered together by protease sensitive linkers. IL-21 INDUKINE<sup>TM<\/sup> polypeptides are peripherally inactive, but due to dysregulation of the protease milieu in the tumor microenvironment, upon dosing and distribution to the tumor, the linkers are cleaved and IL-21 is released intratumorally. We will present data demonstrating that IL-21 INDUKINE<sup>TM<\/sup> polypeptides showed <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>inducibility and activity. In mouse syngeneic tumor models, the IL-21 INDUKINE<sup>TM<\/sup> polypeptides showed improved tolerability and therapeutic window compared to equal molar dosing of a half-life extended IL-21 protein (IL-21-HLE). Mechanistically, IL-21 triggered a pronounced activation of the adaptive immunity in the tumor. Efficacy in these tumor models was linked to expansion and activation of tumor infiltrating T cells, increased polyfunctionality in CD8+ T cells, as well as signs of increased activation of B cells. Together, these data support continued exploration of an IL-21 INDUKINE<sup>TM<\/sup> polypeptide as a therapy for cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Immuno-oncology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jenna  M.

In addition, atezolizumab + bevacizumab combination therapy is approved for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Given the rapid changes in the therapeutic landscape, it is important to investigate effective treatments for people with prior ICI-based combination therapy. E7386 modulates Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling, and a phase 1 study in combination with LEN (a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that mainly targets both VEGFR and FGFR), in people with solid tumors (NCT04008797) is ongoing. In this study, we examined the antitumor activity of the combination of E7386 + LEN, with either prior anti-CTLA-4 Ab + anti-PD-1 Ab or anti-PD-1 Ab + aflibercept (a soluble decoy receptor against VEGF), in the mouse lung tumor KLN 205 model.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Antitumor activity of E7386 (25 or 50 mg\/kg), LEN (3 mg\/kg), and the combination, was evaluated in the KLN 205 model (orally, once daily x 14 days), with or without prior treatments of either anti-CTLA-4 Ab (0.2 mg\/head, weekly x 3, intraperitoneally [ip]) + anti-PD-1 Ab (0.2 mg\/head, weekly x 3, ip)&#9472;ie, CTLA-4 + PD-1; or aflibercept (5 mg\/kg) + anti-PD-1 Ab (0.2 mg\/head, twice a week x 2, ip)&#9472;ie, AFL + PD-1. Mice with relatively rapid-growing tumors and prior treatments were given E7386, LEN, and their combination. RNA-seq analyses were conducted by using tumor tissues collected from mice one day after the prior treatment period or without treatment to analyze gene-expression alterations with prior treatments.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the mouse model without prior treatments, LEN had clear antitumor activity. E7386 had limited antitumor activity as a monotreatment. E7386 + LEN had superior antitumor activity vs LEN in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, E7386 + LEN had superior antitumor activity to each single treatment despite either prior CTLA-4 + PD-1 or AFL + PD-1. E7386 + LEN with prior CTLA-4 + PD-1 had equivalent antitumor activity to LEN without prior treatments. Conversely, E7386 + LEN with prior AFL + PD-1 had strong antitumor activity, including marked tumor regression, compared to both LEN alone and E7386 + LEN without prior treatments. RNA-seq analyses showed that intratumoral <i>Axin2<\/i>, a target gene in the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway, was upregulated with prior AFL + PD-1&#8212;suggesting a potential activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>E7386 + LEN combination shows antitumor activity in the mouse KLN 205 lung tumor model when there is prior ICI-based (CTLA-4 + PD-1 or AFL + PD-1) combination treatment. Further, E7386 + LEN shows enhanced antitumor activity with prior AFL + PD-1; possibly due to activation of Wnt-signaling pathway during prior treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,PD-1,Angiogenesis inhibitor,Lenvatinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Satoshi Kawano<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yusuke Adachi<sup>1<\/sup>, Megumi Kuronishi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kohta Toshimitsu<sup>1<\/sup>, Kotaro Kodama<sup>1<\/sup>, Takayuki Kimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Masahiko Kume<sup>1<\/sup>, Jialing Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Saori Watanabe Miyano<sup>1<\/sup>, Akira Yokoi<sup>1<\/sup>, Junji Matsui<sup>2<\/sup>, Yu Kato<sup>1<\/sup>, Yasuhiro Funahashi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Eisai Co., Ltd., Tsukuba, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Eisai Inc., Nutley, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"da3b5a70-619b-4e15-8f51-18bdf3e8f809","ControlNumber":"5460","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

However, the response to CPIs is dependent on phenotype of tumor microenvironment (TME). A cold tumor known as immune-excluded or -desert has shown poor response to CPIs due to an absence of effector T cells in TME. IL-2 analog, which is immune stimulator and able to recruit cancer-fighting cells into TME, may be promising therapeutic partner for overcoming a limitation of CPIs. Previously, HM16390, a long-acting CD-122-enhanced IL-2 analog, exerted dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in low immunogenic B16F10 melanoma mice. Here, we further investigated the immune cells composition in TME following HM16390 treatment and synergistic anti-tumor effect after combination with CPI. B16F10 mice were sacrificed at days 1, 3, and 8 following single subcutaneous administration of HM16390 or 5 consecutive daily administrations of aldesleukin. According to the result, HM16390 transiently increased peripheral cytokines (IFN&#947; and TNF&#945;) more than aldesleukin. In line with this, we observed that the tumor-infiltrating NK\/T<sub>reg<\/sub> ratio was significantly increased approximately 19 by treatment of HM16390 while showing 4.2 in aldesleukin treated group at Day 3. Furthermore, tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup>\/T<sub>reg<\/sub> ratio was also upregulated approximately 74 by treatment of HM16390 while only showing 6.1 in aldesleukin treated group at Day 8. Significantly increased pro-inflammatory molecules such as GrzB and IFN&#947; were also observed in HM16390 treated group compared to aldesleukin (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01 and <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001, respectively). Next, we investigated synergistic anti-tumor effects in combination with CPI. B16F10 mice were repeatedly given HM16390 once a week or aldesleukin 5 consecutive days per week with or without mouse anti-PD1. After four weeks treatment, 25% of B16F10 mice showed complete response by treatment of HM16390, and significantly increased up to 88% by combination with anti-PD1. However, none of the mice showed complete response by treatment of aldesleukin\/anti-PD1 combo. In conclusion, HM16390 effectively induced tumor growth inhibition through the activation and tumor infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes. This favorable immune alteration in tumor elicited a TME remodeling in which CPI could sufficiently respond.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,Immuno-oncology,Combination therapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jaehyuk Choi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jinyoung Kim<sup><\/sup>, Yu Yon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Seongju Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Sungmin Bae<sup><\/sup>, Daejin Kim<sup><\/sup>, In Young Choi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hwaseong-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"de32147c-8764-44ff-8536-25cbee7a5aee","ControlNumber":"5633","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

The first molecule of this class, BT7480, a Nectin-4-dependent CD137 (4-1BB) agonist, entered clinical trials in 2021 in patients with solid tumors associated with Nectin-4 expression. Compelling preclinical data characterizing BT7480<sup>2<\/sup> led us to develop a second <i>Bicycle<\/i> TICA&#174; molecule, BT7455, which is designed to deliver highly potent CD137 agonism to Ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2)-positive cancers. EphA2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in several human cancers and high expression correlates with poor clinical prognosis in certain cancer types<sup>3,4<\/sup>. BT7455 pharmacology was assessed <i>in vitro<\/i> using surface plasmon resonance, receptor occupancy assays, and PBMC\/tumor cell co-culture bioactivity assays. BT7455 <i>in vivo<\/i> activity was evaluated in efficacy studies in syngeneic EphA2-positive mouse tumor models and pharmacodynamic studies using transcriptional profiling of the tumor immune microenvironment. BT7455 engages EphA2 and CD137 with high affinity resulting in potent EphA2-dependent production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon gamma (IFN&#947;) in human PBMC\/tumor cell co-culture assays. Treatment of MC38 tumor bearing immunocompetent mice with BT7455 using an intermittent dosing regimen led to robust anti-tumor activity, including complete responses. Gene expression profiling of BT7455-treated tumors revealed modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment, including a rapid increase in cytokine expression (both myeloid and T cell origin) and an increase in cytotoxic cell scores. The kinetics and extent of the immune microenvironment modulation differentiated BT7455 from both a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-mouse PD-1) as well as an anti-CD137 agonist antibody (urelumab analogue). To pinpoint the cells responsible for the early bursts of cytokine and chemokine gene expression, we depleted CD8-positive T cells from the mice prior to CD137 <i>Bicycle<\/i> TICA&#174; treatment. We found that the early increase in gene expression of distinct chemokines was not dependent on CD8-positive T cells. We have now turned to single-cell RNA sequencing of CD137 <i>Bicycle <\/i>TICA&#174;-treated tumors to further probe the mechanistic underpinning of this novel finding. In summary, BT7455 is a highly potent EphA2-dependent CD137 agonist with optimal target binding, pharmacologic, and pharmacokinetic properties that enable intermittent dosing for curative effect through modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment in syngeneic mouse models. BT7455 is currently being evaluated in IND-enabling studies. <sup>1<\/sup>Upadhyaya P, et al. <i>JITC<\/i> 2021; 9:e001762. <sup>2<\/sup>Hurov K, et al. <i>JITC<\/i> 2021; 9:e002883. <sup>3<\/sup>Campbell C, et al. <i>Cancer Res<\/i> 2020; 80:5300 <sup>4<\/sup>Xiao, et al. <i>J Hematol Oncol<\/i> 2020; 13:114.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Costimulation,Immuno-oncology,EphA2,Peptides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lia Luus<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kristen Hurov<sup>1<\/sup>, Johanna Lahdenranta<sup>1<\/sup>, Chinmayee Shah<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Devlen<sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Kristensson<sup>2<\/sup>, Peter Brown<sup>2<\/sup>, Cara Bray<sup>1<\/sup>, Heather Cohen<sup>1<\/sup>, Carly Campbell<sup>1<\/sup>, Gemma Mudd<sup>2<\/sup>, Punit Upadhyaya<sup>1<\/sup>, Kevin McDonnell<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongmei Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Phil Jeffrey<sup>2<\/sup>, Philip  E.

IL-12v is designed to more selectively engage antigen activated T-cells, which strongly upregulate IL-12Rb1 upon activation, and to reduce stimulation of NK cells or resting T cells, which express modest levels of IL-12Rb1. To explore anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity in mouse syngeneic tumor models, we generated a half-life extended mouse surrogate of the IL-12 partial agonist (mIL-12v Fc) and compared it to a similarly engineered half-life extended version of wild type mouse IL-12 (mIL-12wt Fc). At efficacious doses, systemic administration of mIL-12wt Fc induced significant weight loss and lethality characterized by early proinflammatory cytokine release and systemic NK cell activation. Conversely, mIL-12v Fc was well tolerated and avoided the robust and rapid NK cell activation and peripheral NK count decreases seen with mIL-12v Fc, suggestive of extravasation to tissues. Both mIL-12v Fc and mIL-12 WT Fc showed similar robust single-agent anti-tumor efficacy in syngeneic tumor models. Depletion of NK cells did not diminish anti-tumor efficacy. Efficacy for both molecules was characterized by CD8 T cell activation, myeloid cell reprograming and antigen presentation. Moreover, combination of mIL-12v Fc with systemic immunotherapies further enhanced anti-tumor activity without compromising tolerability. Overall, mIL-12v Fc retained anti-tumor efficacy without induction of severe toxicities compared to mIL-12wt Fc.

However, tumors developed resistance through various tumor-friendly factors, gradually weakening the effects of ICI. These factors suppress the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby inhibiting the ICI efficacy on tumors. Therefore, it is very important to develop a combination therapy that induces the anticancer efficacy of ICI by suppressing resistance factors produced by tumors. Our previous results demonstrated that 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-3-acetyl-rac-glycerol (PLAG) effectively controls the tumor-friendly factors (neutrophils infiltration, adenosine, etc.) while increasing CTL infiltration to suppress tumor progression.<sup> <\/sup>We suggest that PLAG is one of the effective alternatives to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ICI.<br \/>Method: CT26 colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cell was inoculated into the syngeneic Balb\/c mice SC and maintained for 4 days. PLAG (25\/50\/100 mpk) was daily administered orally for 3 weeks w\/wo 5 mpk aPD-1 (RMP1-14) via IP once\/week. AZD4635 was daily administered orally at 30 mpk, and anti-CD73 by IP at 10 mpk twice\/week. Tumor growth was measured in 3-day intervals.<br \/>Result: aPD-1 treatment inhibited tumor growth by 39%, whereas the aPD-1\/PLAG treatment reduced tumor growth by 85% in the CT26 ICI low-sensitivity CRC model. Tumor weight was reduced by 17.5% in aPD-1, whereas aPD-1\/PLAG treatment decreased by 68%. PLAG treatments (PLAG only group: 4 out of 6, PLAG\/aPD-1 combination group: 5 out of 6) significantly improved the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice compared to control or aPD-1 group (2 out of 6) (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0019). PLAG significantly increased tumor infiltration of CTLs while effectively controlling infiltration of tumor-friendly active neutrophils, as well as induced M1-type macrophage polarization (p&#60;0.05). Importantly, PLAG suppressed the production of adenosine and ATP, which is involved in tumor progression. PLAG showed superior antitumor efficacy compared to current ICI combination therapies targeting the adenosine signaling pathway (AZD4635: A2AR antagonist, anti-CD73: inhibition of extracellular adenosine production). PLAG improved survival rate (AZD4635: 3 out of 6, PLAG: 4 out of 6; <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0394) and reduced the tumor size by 14% compared with AZD4635\/aPD-1.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings show that PLAG inhibits tumor growth by suppressing massive adenosine production, which may increase the antitumor efficacy of aPD-1 through improved CTLs infiltration. We propose that PLAG could be a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with ICI-resistant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Combination therapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,Adenosine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jae Sam Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Guen Tae Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Eun Young Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Su-Hyun Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyowon Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Se Hee Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Ji Won Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Sung Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Ki-young Sohn<sup>1<\/sup>, Jae Wha Kim<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Enzychem Lifesciences, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ac5b2dec-cdb4-45e6-b437-5e322614894a","ControlNumber":"3315","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

We report here that ATRA-treatment represses tumor growth in syngeneic, immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient mice. Tumor immune microenvironment was implicated since depletion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes antagonized these effects in syngeneic mice. Combining ATRA with immune checkpoint blockade did not inhibit lung cancer growth in mice. We sought to augment retinoid anti-tumor effects without affecting its pro-tumorigenicity. We previously reported that CD38 mediated resistance to checkpoint blockade in murine 344SQ lung cancer cells via RAR&#945; transcriptional activation of CD38 expression. Yet, combining the RAR&#945; antagonist (IRX6696) with anti-PD-L1 did not augment anti-tumorigenicity in transplanted 344SQ cells in syngeneic mice. Prior work implicated RAR&#947; in regulating T cell response. Combining the novel RAR&#947; agonist (IRX4647) with anti-PD-L1 statistically-significantly repressed 344SQ lung cancer cell growth in syngeneic mice. This line is relatively resistant to checkpoint blockade. Immunofluorescent analysis of these treated tumors revealed that combined IRX4647 and anti-PD-L1 treatments reduced CD38 expression in the tumor stroma relative to IRX4647 or anti-PD-L1 treatment alone. Statistically-significantly elevated helper (CD4+) T cells were detected in treated tumors along with increased IL-5 and IL-13 expression observed in plasma and tumors. These cytokines can activate helper T cells, altering lung cancer growth. These microenvironment effects were associated with <i>in <\/i>vivo<i> <\/i>anti-tumorigenicity. IRX4647-treatment did not appreciably alter <i>in vitro<\/i> growth of lung cancer cells although retinoid receptors expression profiles were affected. Pharmacokinetic study of IRX4647 found its plasma half-life was 6 hours. Combining an RAR&#947; agonist with immune checkpoint blockade exerted superior anti-neoplastic efficacy against lung cancer versus an ATRA-based regimen. Given these findings we propose exploring activity of this RAR&#947; agonist with an optimal checkpoint inhibitor in a lung cancer clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Retinoic acid receptors,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Cheng-Hsin Wei<sup>1<\/sup>, Lu Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Blair Kreh<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiuxia Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Liliya Tyutyunyk-Massey<sup>1<\/sup>, Zibo Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Mi Shi<sup>1<\/sup>, Vidyasagar Vuligonda<sup>3<\/sup>, Martin Sanders<sup>3<\/sup>, Serguei Kozlov<sup>4<\/sup>, King Chan<sup>5<\/sup>, Amir Horowitz<sup>6<\/sup>, Mary Carrington<sup>5<\/sup>, Patrick Hwu<sup>2<\/sup>, Weiyi Peng<sup>2<\/sup>, Ethan Dmitrovsky<sup>5<\/sup>, <b>Xi Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Molecular Pharmacology Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Io Therapeutics, Inc., Santa Ana, CA,<sup>4<\/sup>Center for Advanced Preclinical Research, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD,<sup>5<\/sup>Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD,<sup>6<\/sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"920675cd-b3e9-4bd4-865b-66785fc09547","ControlNumber":"4525","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

We previously reported that E7386 enhanced the antitumor activity of an anti-PD-1 antibody (Ab) by induction of T cell infiltration into tumors, and E7386 enhanced the antitumor activity of LEN (a multiple kinase inhibitor mainly targeting VEGFRs and FGFRs) by enhancement of antiangiogenic effect in preclinical tumor models. Clinical studies of E7386 in combination with LEN and with pembrolizumab are in progress. Here, we investigated the antitumor activity of E7386 in combination with LEN and with LEN + anti-PD-1 Ab (triple combination) in a mouse renal cell carcinoma RAG model. We also evaluated the mechanism of action underlying the activity of E7386 + LEN and the triple combination. Mice bearing subcutaneous RAG and HepG2 tumors were treated with E7386 at 25 mg\/kg (po, qd), LEN at 10 mg\/kg (po, qd), and anti-PD-1 Ab at 10 mg\/kg (ip, twice weekly) for 4 weeks. Immune-cell population analyses in tumor tissues were performed by flow cytometry. Mouse syngeneic and human xenograft tumor endothelial cells were isolated as CD31-positive cells using magnetic beads and flow cytometry techniques for gene-expression analysis. E7386 + LEN showed enhanced antitumor activity compared with each monotherapy and the triple combination showed enhanced antitumor activity compared with the 2-drug combinations (LEN + anti-PD-1 or LEN + E7386) in the RAG model. Immune-cell population analysis of RAG tumors using flow cytometry revealed that LEN decreased the population of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) and E7386 + LEN further decreased the population of TAM. E7386 combination decreased the population of immunosuppressive monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells that was increased with LEN monotherapy and with LEN + anti-PD-1 Ab combination. Gene-expression analysis demonstrated that expression levels of <i>Axin2<\/i> and <i>Vcan<\/i> (Wnt\/&#946;-catenin target genes) were upregulated in endothelial cells isolated from RAG tumors after LEN treatment. In addition, combination treatment of E7386 + LEN suppressed the upregulation of <i>Axin2<\/i> and <i>Vcan<\/i> with LEN monotherapy in tumor endothelial cells in the HepG2 human hepatoblastoma xenograft model. E7386 suppressed the Wnt signal that was activated with LEN in tumor endothelial cells and E7386 + LEN, and the triple combination also decreased the immunosuppressive myeloid cells that were increased with LEN, and LEN + anti-PD-1 Ab.

We previously demonstrated the immunomodulatory potential of CMG in a transgenic mouse model of <i>Pten<\/i>-null prostate cancer, here we examine its ability to improve the antitumor immune response to ICB of the programmed death cell protein 1 (PD1).

Immune responses were assessed by focused panel qRT-PCR, qIHC, and flow cytometric (FC) analysis. Systemic immune responses were assessed by FC analysis if peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs. Short-term dosing of aPD1 alone or in combination did not affect tumor burden as assessed by a reduction of prostate weight, however, histological analysis revealed that mice treated with CMG\/aPD1 exhibited an increase in the proportion of edematous dilated glands and a non-significant reduction of solid tumor. Mice treated with CMG\/aPD1 showed a significant reduction of s cancer cell proliferation (Ki67) and mice treated with CMG\/aPD1 showed a 1.5-fold increase in cancer cell apoptosis. Gene expression analysis indicated upregulation of genes associated with NKT, NK and dendritic cells with combination therapy. FC and qIHC analysis indicated that T cell activation and T cell cytotoxicity was improved when CMG was administered together with aPD-1. Systemically, treatments with PD-L1 alone or in combination with CMG were associated with increased circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Our findings provide preclinical evidence for the antitumor and immune modulatory activity of CMG in mouse <i>Pten<\/i>-deficient prostate cancer and supports further study to evaluate long-term therapy and explore additional treatment combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Immune checkpoint blockade,Curcumin,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yurie Kura\u0009<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Marco A.

Two cytokines of interest are IL-2 and IL-12, which synergize to proliferate and activate T cells and natural killer cells. However, the only approved human IL-2 product (Proleukin) is rarely used in the clinic due to systemic toxicities, and no IL-12 product has been approved to date due to severe dose-limiting toxicities. Here, we describe CLN-617, a first-in-class therapeutic designed for intratumoral (IT) injection and retention, that co-delivers IL-2 and IL-12 in a safe and effective manner. CLN-617 is a single-chain fusion protein comprised of human IL-2, leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 2 (LAIR2), human serum albumin (HSA), and human IL-12. LAIR2 and HSA functionally retain CLN-617 in the injected tumor by binding collagen and increasing molecular weight, respectively.<br \/>A murine surrogate of CLN-617, mCLN-617, was delivered either IV or IT in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice. The concentration of mCLN-617 as measured in serum two hours after IT administration was &#60;5% that of the concentration following IV administration, demonstrating robust retention of mCLN-617 in the tumor. Following mCLN-617 treatment, durable and complete responses with no significant body weight loss were observed in checkpoint-refractory tumor models, including B16F10, CT26, and MC38.<br \/>mCLN-617 triggered a robust systemic anti-tumor immune response based on three lines of evidence. First, in mice implanted with two MC38 tumors, 70% of injected tumors and 40% of non-injected tumors were eradicated. When combined with IV-administered anti-PD1 antibody, &#62;90% of both injected and non-injected tumors showed a complete response, while anti-PD1 alone exhibited no anti-tumor activity. Second, in mice implanted with an MC38 tumor in the flank and with luciferase-expressing MC38 cells delivered to the liver via intra-splenic injection, the injected flank tumor exhibited ~90% growth inhibition with either mCLN-617 monotherapy or anti-PD1 co-administration. Growth of established metastatic tumors, as measured by luciferase signal, was inhibited by mCLN-617 monotherapy, and metastatic tumor burden significantly regressed in combination with anti-PD1, while anti-PD1 alone exhibited no anti-tumor activity in the metastases. Third, in mice bearing two MC38 flank tumors, tumor-specific CD8+ T cells expanded in both the injected and non-injected tumors and in peripheral blood. We conclude that IT-administered mCLN-617 is efficiently retained in the injected tumor, thereby preventing systemic toxicity of the two cytokines, yet can activate and remodel systemic immunosurveillance for clearance of non-injected distal lesions.<br \/>A phase I trial of CLN-617 in patients with advanced solid tumors is expected to commence in 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Interleukin-2,Interleukin-12,Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Naveen  K.

However, our understanding of how the aging process affects CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells remains incomplete. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also a feature of old age caused by a well-recognized decrease in vitamin absorption. Interestingly, clinical studies have reported a significant decline in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in individuals with vitamin B12 deficiency, suggesting that vitamin B12 levels might be a mechanistic link between aging and deregulation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. An important and often overlooked consequence of vitamin B12 deficiency is an elevation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in circulation. Our laboratory has previously established a critical role for age-induced MMA in promoting progression into metastatic disease of breast and lung cancers, which coincided with a robust immunosuppressive signature. Here, we demonstrate that exposure of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells to MMA or culture of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the absence of vitamin B12 reduces T cell activation, thereby decreasing T cell numbers and effector function. Conversely, supplementation of vitamin B12 on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells isolated from old mice enhances their ability to activate and increases T cell numbers. Evaluation of the effects of MMA on the CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells metabolome revealed a decrease in antioxidant levels, including a pronounced reduction in vitamin C and reduced glutathione, which were accompanied by an increase in both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that an increase in reactive oxygen species might be the link between MMA and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell dysfunction. Together, these results put forward the idea that MMA is an important regulator of immune cell function and that supplementation of vitamin B12 in older people and individuals diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency may function as an important strategy to improve immune cytotoxic responses and thereby increase anti-cancer immunosurveillance and the effectiveness of certain immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Immunosuppression,Cytotoxic T cell,Aging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joanne  D.

STING signaling in intratumor myeloid cells can enhance interferon (IFN) production leading to enhanced local innate and adaptive immunity, and synergism with other anti-tumor mechanisms. Here, we used a novel iADC, TAK-500, to selectively activate STING in CCR2-expressing cells. This approach enables systemic delivery and favors intratumor accumulation of a STING agonist to potentially achieve anti-tumor activity.<br \/>Methods: TAK-500 and mTAK-500, a murine surrogate, were employed to study the immunomodulatory role and anti-tumor effects in preclinical models. CCR2 protein expression was characterized in the TME of &#62;1,000 primary human tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 2 cohorts, N= 411), colorectal carcinomas (CRC, 2 cohorts, N=350) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC, 1 cohort, N=228) represented in tissue microarrays using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (mQIF).<br \/>Results: TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent monocyte activation <i>in vitro<\/i>. mTAK-500 induced robust activation of innate and adaptive immune responses both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In syngeneic mouse models with CCR2 expressing intratumoral myeloid cells, mTAK-500 treatment caused accumulation and activation of CD8+ effector T-cells in the TME resulting in prominent anti-tumor activity and enhanced survival. The baseline levels of CCR2-expressing mMDSCs in mouse models positively associated with anti-tumor response to mTAK-500. mQIF analysis of human tumors confirmed high expression of CCR2 in myeloid cells, lower expression in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and absence in tumor epithelial cells. Using an mQIF panel for simultaneous measurement of DAPI, CK, CCR2, CD11b and CD68, we identified CCR2 protein expression in 94% of NSCLCs, 87% CRCs and 89% PDACs. The levels of CCR2 protein were significantly higher in NSCLC than in CRC and PDAC. In NSCLC, high CCR2 protein in myeloid cells was associated with the presence of activating EGFR\/KRAS mutations and increased CD8+ TILs and local PD-L1 expression. In CRC, higher levels of CCR2 in CD68+ macrophages were seen in tumors harboring microsatellite instability than in microsatellite stable carcinomas.<br \/>Conclusion: The iADC TAK-500 and mTAK-500 induces CCR2-dependent immune cell activation and anti-tumor effect. CCR2 is highly expressed in intratumor myeloid cells from NSCLC. High CCR2 is associated with enhanced local adaptive immune responses and specific clinical\/molecular tumor subsets. TAK-500 is currently being evaluated clinically as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in adults with select locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NCT05070247).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),STING,Interferon Signaling,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kurt A.

Given their abilities to initiate and activate immune responses, cytokines have long been utilized in cancer therapy, whereas there are limitations, short half-life, pleiotropism, functional redundancy, and side effects, slow down the wide application of cytokine therapy. Thus, evaluating the pharmaceutical properties of cytokines or their translated forms, such as supercytokines, immunocytokines, engager cytokines, and synthetic cytokines, in non-human primates shall be a substantial approach to guide and define clinical trial strategies of cytokine-based therapies. In this study, Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is preferably focused due to its potential in proliferating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes by which host&#8217;s immunity was boosted to fight against tumor progression. To evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamics of IL-15 in vivo, rhesus macaques were administered intravenously with recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15). We revealed that intravenous administration of rhIL-15 to rhesus macaques caused a slightly weight loss and neutropenia, while no other abnormalities were observed during the whole study. Moreover, the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was found significantly elevated which was consistent with the increased abundance of MCP1, CCL4, and IL-RA chemokines in serum, suggesting that IL-15 treatment induces acute inflammatory response. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed the activation, proliferation and expansion of memory T and NK cells after receiving IL-15. In conclusion, our study deepens the understanding of T and NK cell homeostasis after IL-15 administration in NHPs and may offer critical clinical strategies for human trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Innate immunity,Pharmacodynamics,Safety,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wei Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yixuan Xu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xin Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Dan Zhu<sup>2<\/sup>, Meng Xiao<sup>2<\/sup>, Yulin Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhijie Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Haodong Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Bo Pang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xinghai Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Yan Xiao<sup>2<\/sup>, Wenting Shi<sup>2<\/sup>, Qian Qian<sup>2<\/sup>, Qingyang Gu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Oncology & Immunology Unit, WuXi AppTec, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>WuXi AppTec, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"17b17cd2-7f7c-4f81-ab01-882f6bc22e84","ControlNumber":"2693","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;W.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have a limited role in mCRPC, although androgen receptor (AR) blockade increases CD8+ T cell function and can modulate the antitumor immune response. We investigated the effect of AR inhibitors (ARi) enzalutamide (Enza) and darolutamide (Daro) on NK cell function.Materials and Methods: We evaluated cell viability to investigate the effect of Enza and Daro on PC cells (LNCap, 22Rv1 [ARv7 mutation], DU145, PC3 [AR-]) and NK-92 cells. We performed co-culture experiments with PC and NK cells at a 1:1 ratio and analyzed immune cell-mediated tumor cell killing (ImageXpress Confocal HT). Cytokine profiling (Luminex 200) of culture supernatants was performed following treatment with ARi -\/+ and anti-IFN-&#947; antibodies. In vivo studies were performed in NCr Nude mice harboring subcutaneous PC tumors treated orally with Daro (50mg\/kg\/bid) and Enza (30mg\/kg\/bid) for 4 weeks.<br \/>Results: Treatment of co-cultures of PC plus NK-92 cells with ARi significantly increased immune-mediated PC killing within 24 hours (control: 19%&#177;2.7; Enza: 36%&#177;3; Daro: 41%&#177;4.2). Treatment of NK cells alone with ARi did not impact their viability. ARi increased the secretion of cytokines such as IL-2 (7.6 pg\/ml&#177;1.3 vs. 18 pg\/ml&#177;2.4, p=0.004), IL-1&#946; (17.8 pg\/ml&#177;2.8 vs. 67 pg\/ml&#177;12.6, p=0.005), CXCL10 (224.2 pg\/ml&#177;16.6 vs. 504 pg\/ml&#177;42.4, p=0.017) and GDF-15 (member of the TGF&#946; superfamily; 8.4 ng\/ml&#177;0.43 vs. 14.3 ng\/ml&#177;3.2, p=0.042) and decreased VEGF (302.5 pg\/ml&#177;62.1 vs. 120 pg\/ml&#177;50.4, p=0.01), FGF-basic (7.4 pg\/ml&#177;1.6 vs. 3.6 pg\/ml&#177;2.1, p=0.007), M-CSF (70.9 pg\/ml&#177;14.2 vs. 25.3 pg\/ml&#177;4.5, p=0.01) and IL-8 (2645 pg\/ml&#177;201 vs. 1821 pg\/ml&#177;62.3, p=0.02). ARi increased NK-92 secretion of IFN-&#947; (15.2 pg\/ml&#177;5.4 and 48.2 pg\/ml&#177;8.2, p=0.01) and granzyme B (630 pg\/ml&#177;32.2 vs. 1024 pg\/ml&#177;102.4, p=0.001). IFN-&#947; upregulation induced by ARi was blocked with IFN-&#947; mAb in the co-culture experiments and inhibited the NK cell-mediated killing of PCs. Analysis of PC tumors from NCr Nude Mice treated with Daro or Enza showed increased NK cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Results: We report the discovery that ARi promotes the activation of NK cells mediated by IFN-&#947;, leading to increased killing of PCs. Ongoing validation of these results includes PC organoids and patient-derived samples to understand further the innate immune system response to ARi and direct novel therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Natural killer cells,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maximilian Schwermann<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kelsey  E.

Despite this, no two cancers have the same pathogenesis and there is significant variation in patient response rates. Understanding mechanisms of carcinogenesis in model cell culture systems, such as aberrant signaling, as well as how tumor immunity can be initiated, retargeted or reinvigorated upon incorporation of the immune system will fuel drug discovery. High-Content Screening (HCS) platforms allow single-cell imaging analysis and are used to interrogate these models to enable drug development and understand mechanisms of action. They provide an opportunity to test novel cancer therapeutics in a translationally relevant setting that integrates primary immune effector function. Here we outline several macrophage-based HCS assays which allow assessment of therapeutics targeting;1) early aspects of immune cell activation 2) macrophage mitochondrial health 3) macrophage activation and re-polarization 4) immune cell infiltration and tumor killing. To test efficacy of drugs targeting immune signaling or activation, macrophages were treated with a canonical NF-&#409;B activator +\/- TCPA-1, a known inhibitor for benchmarking as a model therapeutic. Robust NF-&#409;B translocation was observed and reduced in the presence of TCPA-1 rendering this an appropriate assay to screen therapeutic cytokines or TLR agonists activating NF-&#409;B signaling. A macrophage inflammasome activation assay was developed to analyze levels of ASC and speck formation. CRID3i, an established inflammasome inhibitor was validated as a robust control therapeutic that prevented NLRP3 activation suggesting this is a relevant platform to assess cancer drug efficacy. Interrogating mitochondrial health and dynamics in primary macrophages is vital to understanding the impact of accumulating ROS species or metabolites in the tumor microenvironment. Assays modelling the effects of these molecules on macrophage polarization and activation as well as mitochondrial integrity were used to test macrophage repolarizing therapeutics, a key approach in immuno-oncology. Finally, a complex multi-cellular 3D spheroid tumor killing assay was optimized to model immune cell infiltration following exposure to IO-targeted therapeutics and robust enhancement of tumor killing was directly observed. Overall, these assays demonstrate the power of imaging in performing HCS to assess the efficacy and mechanisms of action of a range of IO-targeted therapeutics. This suite of assays is applicable to IO drug screens targeting macrophage function, immune cell activation and immune cell infiltration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Immune response,Tumor immunity,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Rebecca Roberts<sup><\/sup>, Henry Leonard<sup><\/sup>, Ilona Aylott<sup><\/sup>, Douglas Best<sup><\/sup>, Dan Rocca<sup><\/sup>, Ben Thompson<sup><\/sup>, Nunan Robert<sup><\/sup>, <b>Louise Brackenbury<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Bristol, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8665e101-7ca9-49a5-a7aa-a02025d9f711","ControlNumber":"6836","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

Unfortunately, less than half of the bladder cancer patients demonstrate clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. Novel therapeutic approaches such as oncolytic virotherapy may unleash the full potential of immunotherapy. Oncolytic viruses display tumor-lysing properties, while leaving normal cells unharmed. Besides the direct oncolytic effects, oncolytic viruses are capable of inducing systemic anti-tumor immune responses, thereby representing a promising anti-cancer therapy. In our multi-center <u>o<\/u>ncolytic <u>v<\/u>iro-<u>i<\/u>mmuno<u>t<\/u>herapy (OVIT) consortium we evaluate and compare the oncolytic and immunomodulatory properties of several oncolytic viruses (reoviruses, novel non-human primate Adenoviruses, Newcastle disease virus), develop tools to predict oncolytic virus efficacy and design strategies to personalize oncolytic virus therapy. In this study we evaluated and compared the direct oncolytic and indirect immunostimulatory effects of wildtype reovirus R124 and mutant reovirus <i>jin-3<\/i> in human bladder cancer. Mutant reovirus <i>jin-3 <\/i>harbors mutations in the spike protein Sigma-1 and can infect cells independently of junction adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) expression on the tumor cell surface. For this, we exploited multiple preclinical bladder cancer models, including patient-derived tumor models (e.g. 3D cultures) and <i>ex-vivo<\/i> cultured tumor tissue slices. Both R124 and <i>jin-3 <\/i>reoviruses<i> <\/i>could infect, replicate and induce cell death in a panel of 2D and 3D cultured bladder cancer cells lines with a basal, luminal or mixed phenotype. Furthermore, the viruses were capable of infecting the tumor cells and induced cell death in <i>ex-vivo<\/i> cultured tumor tissue slices. Reovirus mutant jin-3, and to a lesser extent R124, strongly induced immunogenic cell death markers (HMGB1, cell surface expression of calreticulin, HSP90), interferon-stimulated genes, and inflammatory cytokines (IFN&#946;, CXCL10, TNF&#945;) in human bladder cancer cells. Co-culture of reovirus-infected murine bladder cancer cells MB-49 with murine splenocytes resulted in increased activation markers of dendritic cells and NK cells. In conclusion, reoviruses display oncolytic properties in multiple preclinical models of human bladder cancer. Mutant reovirus <i>jin-3<\/i> displays more potent immunomodulatory responses in preclinical bladder cancer models compared with wildtype reovirus R124. Therefore, <i>jin-3<\/i> represents an attractive candidate for clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Oncolytic virus,Preclinical testing,3D models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arjanneke F.

PH-762, a self-delivering RNAi compound targeting PD-1 built on proprietary INTASYL&#8482; technology, rapidly enters tissues without need for further formulation or delivery vehicles. In preclinical studies, PH-762 and its murine-targeted analog (mPH-762) provide robust PD-1 silencing, anti-tumor efficacy and associated immunophenotypic changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME). PH-762 is currently under clinical investigation in a Phase 1b study as neoadjuvant therapy for advanced resectable melanoma. We have previously shown that IT mPH-762 provides abscopal efficacy toward untreated distal tumors in a bilateral Hepa1-6 model of murine hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we identify potential mechanisms underlying this abscopal efficacy in follow-up studies in vivo and ex vivo. Equivalent inoculums of Hepa1-6 cells were subcutaneously implanted into bilateral flanks of C57BL\/6J mice (N = 12 \/ group). When tumors reached a mean volume of 150 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, vehicle (PBS) or mPH-762 (0.5 mg\/dose or 2 mg\/dose) were administered to one of the two tumors (the directly treated tumor), on Days 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13. Tumor volumes and body weights were recorded longitudinally. Directly treated (DT) and untreated distal tumors (UT), as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) and spleens (SP) were isolated from a satellite group (N = 6) on Day 14. On-target immunomodulatory changes were assessed in DT and UT TME by immunostaining \/ flow cytometry. Additionally, systemic tumor specific T cells were expanded from bulk mLN and SP by 21-day culture with irradiated Hepa1-6 cells. Tumor specific memory reactivity was assessed by challenge with either intact Hepa1-6 cells; or intact CT26 BALB\/c colon cancer cells, PMA\/ionomycin, or PBS controls: and assessed by intracellular IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945; and surface CD107a staining. IT mPH-762 again provided an abscopal decrease in mean tumor volume of UT tumors compared to IT PBS. On-target immunomodulatory changes to TME appeared primarily confined to the DT only at this timepoint. However, IT mPH-762 increased both the frequency and reactivity of Hepa1-6-specific CD8 T cells expanded from mLN and SP compared to IT PBS. These data indicate that IT mPH-762 generates a systemic immune response of durable tumor-specific reactive memory CD8 T cells in systemic lymphoid organs, providing a mechanism for the abscopal efficacy of mPH-762. These data further support the clinical development of IT PH-762.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,RNAi,In vivo,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin G.

However, a large clinical need remains for more effective CAR-T therapies and to expand their use to broader patient groups including those with solid tumors. The exogenous administration of IL-2 and IL-21 were shown to enhance the engraftment, persistence, and functionality of CAR-Ts in preclinical models. However, clinical use of such cytokines is limited due to their pleiotropic nature that can result in toxicity and undesired effects on endogenous immune cells. To overcome this, we applied our <i>cis<\/i>-targeting technology to develop CAR-T specific IL-2 and IL-21 molecules that selectively activate CAR-Ts and exhibit minimal activity on non-CAR cells. <i>Cis<\/i>-targeted IL-2 and IL-21 molecules are comprised of a targeting antibody fused to an affinity-attenuated cytokine mutein, the activity of which is rescued due to the avidity provided by the targeting arm. This enables the highly selective delivery of cytokine support to human CAR-T cells. We engineered two types of fusions targeting either 1) the CAR directly without blocking CAR antigen recognition (CAR-IL2) or 2) an exogenous cell surface tag (non-signaling truncated epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFRt]) co-expressed with the CAR (EGFRt-IL2 and EGFRt-IL21). We characterized these molecules in vitro and in vivo. Both CAR- and EGFRt-targeted molecules demonstrated &#62;100-fold preferential STAT activation of CAR-T cells over non-CAR cells. Unexpectedly, CAR-targeted fusions induced substantial antigen independent cytokine release, whereas fusions targeting the EGFRt tag did not. We found that antigen independent cytokine release was more suppressed by a LCK inhibitor rather than a JAK inhibitor, suggesting that downstream CAR signaling was the major contributor, compared to cytokine receptor signaling. In vivo studies examined the anti-tumor activity of the tag-targeted cytokine fusions given their desired safety profile. A single dose of either EGFRt-IL2 or EGFRt-IL21 on day 1 or day 7 following a sub-optimal infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells (0.1 x10<sup>6<\/sup>) induced strong tumor regression and relapse free survival for &#62;70 days in an aggressive NALM-6 leukemia model. EGFRt-IL21 induced a sustained 10-fold expansion of CAR-T numbers over PBS in the blood by day 7. In contrast, EGFRt-IL2 induced a delayed but greater expansion (1000-fold over PBS) by day 14 suggestive of a mechanistic difference of the two <i>cis<\/i>-targeted molecules. Analysis of EGFRt-IL2 and EGFRt-IL21 in a solid tumor model using CAR-T cells targeting endogenous tumor antigen showed similar anti-tumor effects.<i> <\/i><i>Cis<\/i>-targeted IL-2 and IL-21 fusion molecules directed by anti-tag EGFRt antibodies confer selective enhancement of CAR-T cells with a minimal safety risk, representing a promising approach as an adjuvant CAR-T therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cytokines,Immunocytokines,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nathan  D.

Consistently, recent evidence demonstrated improved efficacy with neoadjuvant\/adjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with debulking surgery in patients with melanoma (Patel et al, ESMO 2022). However, evaluating these regimens preclinically is challenging due to the rarity of appropriate models. To address this question, we have established a novel murine tumor model involving partial tumor-debulking surgery which enables monitoring of the temporal response to immunotherapy in neoadjuvant, neoadjuvant\/adjuvant and adjuvant settings. We utilized the MC38 tumor model which represents a &#8216;hot&#8217; tumor microenvironment (TME), analogous to the TME in melanoma patients. MC38 tumor-bearing C57Bl\/6 mice were subcutaneously administered murine nemvaleukin alfa (mNemva), an engineered IL-2 immunotherapy that selectively activates and expands cytotoxic NK cells and antigen-experienced CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Partial tumor-debulking surgery was performed under general anesthesia 3 days after the first dose of mNemva along with neoadjuvant and neoadjuvant\/adjuvant regimens, or 1 day before the first dose of mNemva in the adjuvant regimen. Whereas a single dose of mNemva was administered to mice in the neoadjuvant setting, four and five doses were given in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant\/adjuvant settings, respectively. Two types of control groups were also evaluated: vehicle in combination with partial tumor-debulking surgery, and five doses of mNemva without the debulking procedure.The neoadjuvant\/adjuvant treatment regimen was superior to neoadjuvant or adjuvant in all aspects with 28% of animals exhibiting complete responses, tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 82% and prolonged median survival from 17 to 27 days. While the neoadjuvant regimen yielded 10% complete responders, TGI was only 7% and median survival was not extended. No complete responders were observed with the adjuvant regimen. Importantly, tumors in both control groups grew to the predefined endpoint irrespective of treatment and surgical procedure. Following tumor re-challenge, 75% of prior complete responders were protected, suggesting that mNemva induced immunological memory in most mice. Moreover, long-term immunity was 100% effective if the re-challenge experiment was performed out to 5 months after the last dose of mNemva had been administered.Therefore, the neoadjuvant\/adjuvant dosing regimen exhibits a superior response in this preclinical model, when combined with partial tumor-debulking surgery, similar to the recent findings in patients with melanoma that were treated with pembrolizumab. In addition, this strategy enables sampling of tumor tissue for analyses of the immune response and the identification of potential predictive markers of response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Preclinical,Tumor microenvironment,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sara Prijic<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jason Wood<sup><\/sup>, Arthur Liberzon<sup><\/sup>, Harikiran Nistala<sup><\/sup>, Raymond  J.

According to TCGA, a substantial fraction of different tumor types expresses both IDO1 and TDO2. In 82 tumor samples (GBM, hepatocellular carcinoma, NSCLC, and ovarian cancer) analyzed for IDO1\/TDO2 RNA expression (RNA sequencing) and TRP metabolite content (LC-MS\/MS), we found TDO2 highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and to lower levels in NSCLC and ovarian cancer. IDO1 was found to be expressed in NSCLC and ovarian cancer but at higher levels and its expression was correlating with KYN levels. Immunosuppressive properties of KYN and downstream metabolites are mediated through T cell apoptosis and regulatory T cell (Treg) induction. In our hands, KYN at concentrations &#8805; 50uM was shown to be immunosuppressive, notably inducing T cell apoptosis. According to our and published data, such high KYN concentrations (&#8805; 50uM) can be found in a subset of human tumors. As outlined, both IDO1 and TDO2 can contribute to high KYN levels in tumors. Hence, dual IDO1\/TDO2 inhibition should be superior in decreasing tumor KYN levels and levering immunosuppression as compared to IDO1 selective inhibition. In this regard, we have generated potent dual IDO1\/TDO2 inhibitors inhibiting IDO1 and TDO2 enzyme activity in cellular assays in vitro. To prove the concept of superiority in vivo, we established a dual IDO1\/TDO2 expressing human tumor model (LOVO+IFNg) in the mouse and showed that the oral administration of a dual IDO1\/TDO2 inhibitor as compared to an IDO1 selective inhibitor showed enhanced KYN\/TRP modulation in the tumor. Lead compounds with favorable drug-like properties are currently investigated for pre-clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IDO1,Immunosuppression,Immunomodulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carina Lotz-Jenne<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sylvaine Cren<sup><\/sup>, Christoph Joesch<sup><\/sup>, Sabine Ackerknecht<sup><\/sup>, Jennifer Brandes<sup><\/sup>, Claire Moebs<sup><\/sup>, Dominik Hartl<sup><\/sup>, Felix Hartrampf<sup><\/sup>, Philippe Guerry<sup><\/sup>, Julien Pothier<sup><\/sup>, Alexia Chavanton-Arpel<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Allschwil, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"110a8913-0e39-4c86-95a7-dc41fbcdbb9a","ControlNumber":"3455","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

The generation of a robust anti-tumor response relies on dendritic cells (DCs) to process tumor antigens, migrate to draining lymph nodes, and activate T-cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, immunosuppressive factors impede DC differentiation and activation, and the subsequent immature DC phenotype is a major mechanism underlying the ineffective T-cell response in melanoma patients. We have shown that low-intensity focused ultrasound (LOFU), a novel therapy that delivers mechanical and thermal stresses locally at the tumor site, may enhance DC function in a B16 murine melanoma model. <u>We hypothesize that LOFU enhances the dendritic cell-mediated anti-tumor response by inducing changes in tumor cell and dendritic cell autophagy and increasing pro-immunogenic factors in the TME.<\/u><br \/>Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent process of cellular content degradation that has previously been implicated in the regulation of multivesicular body formation\/degradation, and thus in the secretion of extracellular vesicles. Autophagy may subsequently modify the cargo of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, in a pro-immunogenic manner. We have found that LOFU treatment is associated with an increase in autophagic flux in melanoma cells and have identified at least 82 proteins within melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles that are significantly enriched or reduced with LOFU treatment, with enriched proteins partaking in essential processes including antigen processing, intracellular trafficking, and cellular metabolism. DCs pulsed with vesicles from LOFU-treated melanoma cells have shown enhanced activation of both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell activation, suggesting that the LOFU-induced increase in tumor cell autophagy and modification of vesicular cargo may promote a DC-activated anti-tumor antigen activation response. Characterization of other mechanisms by which LOFU may enhance DC function, such as direct changes in DC autophagy, is critical to elucidate DC-mediated pathways involved in the anti-tumor response. Further understanding of DC involvement in the anti-tumor response will provide novel targets for the development of immunotherapies to improve survival and quality of life in advanced melanoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ultrasound,Dendritic cells,Autophagy,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sandra Pelka<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sanmay Bandyopadhyay<sup>1<\/sup>, Sanjay Pandey<sup>2<\/sup>, Chandan Guha<sup>2<\/sup>, Fernando Macian<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Radiation Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c1d6b5e2-2ccd-4bad-9beb-f8441046d060","ControlNumber":"856","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Although the first generation of STING agonists dosed intratumorally showed a strong anti-tumor response in preclinical models, positive clinical data has so far been limited, potentially due to reduced efficacy in non-injected tumors. Newer classes of STING agonists that are delivered systemically are expected to deliver more consistent and predictable levels of STING activation, but may less tolerated due to untargeted activation of the immune system resulting in immune related adverse events. We have previously demonstrated that IFI16 promotes activation of the cGAMP-activated STING pathway by a process relying on IFI16 PYRIN domain-dependent protein-protein interactions<sup>1<\/sup>. Based on these findings, an IFI16 Pyrin domain-derived peptide incorporating a cell penetrating peptide that recapitulates the agonist-dependent activation of the STING pathway by IFI16, was developed. This peptide, ST317, acts as a STING sensitizer for effective and safe induction of anti-tumour immune responses only at sites where STING agonists are present. In vitro, ST317 sensitizes STING to pathway activators (Cytoplasmic DNA and cGAMP) and pharmacological STING agonists including ADU-S100 and diABZI compound 3, reducing the EC<sub>50<\/sub> values of agonist-induced STING pathway activation while inducing supraphysiological (i.e. increasing the E<sub>Max<\/sub>) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines\/chemokines (e.g. Type I interferon and CXCL10) in cell line and primary cells. Mechanistically, ST317 sensitizes STING to cGAMP by accelerating and increasing STING translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, resulting in earlier and longer activation of the STING pathway components, as determined by the phosphorylation kinetics of TBK1 and IRF3, as well as STING itself. Consistent with its in vitro pharmacological profile, ST317 can be safely administered parenterally without evidence of peripheral STING activation. In vivo experiments in immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models demonstrate that ST317 dosed I.V. was well tolerated and was associated with anti-tumor efficacy when used as a single agent or in combination with immune checkpoint blockers such as anti-PD1. In addition, ST317 improved the anti-tumor response to a pharmacological STING agonist at doses that do not cause immune cell death that result from over-dosing this type of agent. In summary, ST317 represents a new class of STING pathway activator, which enables safe systemic administration while giving rise to enhanced STING pathway activation only at sites at which STING agonists are present. The data presented here warrant the assessment of ST317 in cancer patients in a clinical trial. 1.

A major reservoir for such drug resistance is minimal residual disease (MRD), which is comprised of drug-tolerant tumor cells laying in a dormant state. Towards exploiting potential therapeutic vulnerabilities of MRD, we established a genetically engineered mouse model of Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>-driven melanoma MRD wherein genetic Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup> extinction leads to strong but incomplete tumor regression. Transcriptional time-course analysis of tumors after Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup> extinction revealed that after an initial surge of immune activation, tumors later became immunologically \"cold\" after MRD establishment. Computational analysis identified candidate T-cell recruiting chemokines that may be central players in the process, being strongly upregulated initially and then steeply decreasing as the immune response faded. As a result, we hypothesized that sustaining the chemokine signaling could impair MRD maintenance through increased recruitment of effector T-cells. We show that intratumoral administration of recombinant Cxcl9, either naked or loaded in microparticles, significantly impaired the relapse of MRD in BRAF-inhibited tumors, including several complete pathological responses after the triple combination of microparticle-delivered rCxcl9 with BRAF and MEK-inhibition. Our experiments constitute a proof of concept that chemokine-based microparticle delivery systems are a potential strategy to forestall tumor relapse and thus improve the clinical success of frontline treatment methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Nanoparticle,Minimal Residual Disease,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gabriele Romano<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Francesca Paradiso<sup>2<\/sup>, Peng Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Pooja Shukla3<sup>3<\/sup>, Lindsay Barger<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivia El Naggar<sup>1<\/sup>, John  P.

VerImmune has pioneered &#8220;<u>A<\/u>nti-tumor <u>I<\/u>mmune <u>R<\/u>edirection&#8221; (AIR), an approach that repurposes a patient&#8217;s pre-existing anti-viral or childhood vaccine immunity towards tumor cells for targeted destruction. Mechanistically, this involves VerImmune&#8217;s proprietary platform technology known as AIR-ViPs (<u>A<\/u>nti-tumor <u>I<\/u>mmune <u>R<\/u>edirection <u>V<\/u>irus-<u>i<\/u>nspired <u>P<\/u>articles). ViPs are based on a modified mouse papillomavirus capsid protein of which 60 copies self-assemble into a 20-30nm T=1 icosahedral structure that are then conjugated on their surface with a CD8+ T cell viral peptide antigen. This peptide conjugated platform specifically targets solid tumors and delivers viral peptide antigens to class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-1) on the tumor cell surface. This leads to the recognition of the tumor by existing memory viral-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. We show here the three-step MOA of AIR-ViPs. The first step is the specific binding of AIR-ViPs to tumor cells by targeting HSPGs on the tumor cell surface. The binding of ViPs is HSPG-dependent as they do not bind to a HSPG-knockout cell line (PGSA-745). To further assess specificity, we pre-incubated ViPs with varying amounts (100ng\/mL-1mg\/mL) of heparin which resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in binding where the highest dose of heparin was able to completely block ViP binding to tumor cells. The second step of the MOA is the exogenous loading of the CD8+ T cell-specific peptides onto tumor cell surface MHC class I molecules. To prove this, we demonstrated loading of the SIINFEKL OVA peptide on tumor cells incubated with a SIINFEKL-conjugated AIR-ViP using an antibody that specifically recognizes the SIINFEKL\/K<sup>b<\/sup> (MHC-I) complex. We further demonstrate exogenous loading utilizing RMA-S cells that are deficient for MHC-I intracellular processing. The third and final step of the MOA is the redirection of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells to kill tumors following peptide loading. Utilizing an <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity assay, which involves co-culturing tumor cells and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the presence or absence of AIR-ViPs, specific tumor cell killing was observed and quantified using luciferase which acts as a surrogate for cell viability. Using this assay system and HCMV AIR-VIPs, we showed specific immune redirection of human donor CMV CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines incubated with HCMV AIR-VIPs but not with the control unconjugated ViPs. Our results demonstrate the potential of AIR as a tumor antigen-agnostic immunotherapeutic. Additionally, the specificity of ViPs to tumor HSPGs makes AIR potentially applicable across many solid tumors regardless of their origin.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Cytotoxicity,Cancer immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cayce Dorrier<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Felagot Abebe<sup><\/sup>, John Troyer<sup><\/sup>, Joshua Wang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>VerImmune Inc, Washington DC, DC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8633c353-d410-4d89-a6ff-273f042a6804","ControlNumber":"3661","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

DAG and PA act as vital second messengers that regulate multiple cellular signal transduction pathways including PKC and MAPK. DGK&#945; (DGKA), one of the ten human DGK isoforms, has been reported to play a role in mediating numerous aspects of cancer progression including survival, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Emerging data indicate that DGKA mediates T-cell dysfunction during anti-PD-1 therapy, playing a role in the development of resistance to PD-1 blockade. This suggests that DGKA inhibition offers a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer. Although serotonin (5-HT) antagonists ritanserin, R59022 and R59949 have been previously repurposed as DGKA inhibitors, their potency and selectivity profiles are largely unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is a significant unmet clinical need to develop potent and selective DGKA inhibitors.<br \/>Here, we used our proprietary PandaOmics platform to explore targets that can overcome the resistance to anti-PD1 therapy. In order to do so, we created a project that included bulk RNAseq data from 4 datasets alongside with 2 single-cell RNAseq datasets. Based on the calculation results, DGKA inhibitors may overcome anti-PD-1 resistance and expand the responder patient population in cancer immunotherapy. We then designed and evaluated a series of compounds in biochemical and cellular assays, and report that ISM4312A is a novel DGKA inhibitor with excellent potency (IC50 of 120 pM) and high selectivity (&#62;25000 fold) for DGKA versus 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B. Further, ISM4312A showed high selectivity against 468 other kinases. In the cellular T-cell activation assay, ISM4312A induced IL-2 production in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced T-cell activity at concentrations as low as 20 nM.<br \/>In the MC38 in vivo syngeneic model, ISM4312A at 3 mg\/kg BID showed robust anti-tumor activities with (Tumor Growth Inhibition, TGI, 93.4%, 37.5% mice achieved CR) or without (TGI, 25.2%) anti-PD-1 therapy. Data from this combination study indicate synergistic activity as compared with the single anti-PD-1 treatment (TGI, 50.8% at 5 mg\/kg BID, no mice achieved CR). ISM4312A also exhibited favorable ADME, excellent oral bioavailability, and tolerance.<br \/>Together, the data support the ongoing clinical development of ISM4312A as a potential first-in-class DGKA inhibitor in cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immune response,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Deheng Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongfu Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Huaxing Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Feng Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Mike Korzinkin<sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Cai<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiao Ding<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sujata Rao<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Feng Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Zhavoronkov<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"73635c98-5da4-48bb-9fb5-7e30d960427f","ControlNumber":"3266","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

To support this new combination, to what extent those drugs could reshape tumor immunity remains to be evaluated, prior to establishing optimal scheduling or sequencing with Pembrolizumab. Both Pemetrexed and Cisplatin are expected to trigger immunogenic cell death, whereas Bevacizumab could help T lymphocytes to extravasate and better infiltrate tumor micro-environment. Here, we studied the impact of Cisplatin and Pemetrexed at two dose levels (i.e., low dose and Maximal Tolerated Dose, MTD) and fixed flat-dose Bevacizumab, alone or in combination (i.e., Cisplatin, Pemetrexed, Cisplatin + Pemetrexed, with our without Beva), on the immune repertoire of BalbC mice ectopically grafted with KLN-205 murine lung tumors. CD45, CD4, CD8, FoxP3-CD4 (Tregs), and MDSCs were monitored by FACS analysis in blood, spleen, and tumors on D2, D7, D14, and D21 after treatment. Results were normalized by CD45 counts. All treatments led to an increase in CD4+ T cells in blood as compared with control (i.e., untreated) animals. Little increase was observed in tumors, regardless of the treatments but mice treated with the Beva+CT combo (both low dose and MTD CT) showed an increase in CD4+ in the spleen on D14. Regarding CD8+ T cells, all treatments led to an increase from D2 to D7. Beva + CT low dose led to a continuous increase in CD8+ cells, whereas in Beva+CT MTD mice, after an initial increase, a reduction in CD8+ was observed after D7 eventually. In the spleen, CD8+ proved to be stable apart from the Beva + CT low dose group which showed an increase up to D14. In tumors, an increase in CD8+ cells was observed in all the groups. No change in MDSCs levels was observed, regardless of the drugs, the dosing and the organ. Conversely, Tregs decreased in the blood in the Beva + CT low-dose group on D14, and decreased in spleen and tumors as compared with Control mice, regardless of the drugs and the dosing. Overall, our data suggest that the triple combination between Beva, Pemetrexed, and Cisplatin has a stronger impact on immune cells than each drug used as a single agent. MDSCs were the only cells to be unaffected by the treatments. Dosing could be relevant as well since the reduction in CD8+ T cells observed with MTD CT could come from drug-related lymphopenia. The Beva followed by low dose Pemetrexed + Cisplatin group is thus the more likely to harness tumor immunity, with peaks in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and drop in Tregs observed on D14.

The aim of this study was to analyze in immuno-competent BalbC mice bearing or not 4T1 murine breast cancers, the impact on immune system of blank liposomes (i.e., Lipo) or blank immunoliposomes grafted with trastuzumab with a maleimide linker (i.e., ANC). Both nanoparticles were 120 nm of diameter and were pegylated. Mice were administered with saline solution (Control) or treated with either Lipo or ANC with single-dosing (SD) or multiple-dosing (MD). Impact on immunity in blood, spleen and tumors was monitored in a longitudinal fashion in blood for up to 8 weeks, and once per animal in spleen and tumors (i.e., D18 or D23). Immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. In tumor-free mice, in blood a transient increase in B-cells between D7 and D15 was found (p= 0,003; &#60; 0,001 and 0,009, t test) for ANC-MD, Lipo-SD and Lipo-MD, respectively. Of note, mice treated with ANC-MD exhibited persistent increase in B-cells up to 8 weeks. Regarding T-cells, a transient increase of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes from D0 to D15 was observed. In spleen, more CD4+ T-cells than CD8+ cells were found, both with Lipo and ANC. Blank Lipo or blank ANC did not impact the tumor growth as compared with Control, and tumor sizes were comparable among all groups. In tumor-bearing mice, in blood little difference between B-cells was observed among the groups. Considering T-cells, a significant diminution in CD4+ cells was observed throughout time in mice treated with either ANC or Lipo (p=0.029, Anova). Conversely, a sharp increase in CD8+ cells as compared with Control group was observed between D18 and D23 for all the treatment arms (p&#60;0.05, Anova). Of note, ANC-MD and Lipo-MD showed significantly higher CD8+ as compared with SD treatments. In spleen, more CD8+ cells than CD4+ cells were found. Still, CD4+ T-cells tended to increase, including in the Control group, between D18 and D23, whereas no such increase was observed for CD8+ cells. In treated animals, a sharp increase in FOXP3 CD4+ Tregs was observed in spleen. In tumors, B-cells increased in Control group but decreased in both Lipo and ANC-treated animals. A marked decrease in CD4+ cells was observed in Control group, whereas little change was observed in treated mice. Conversely, a sharp increase in CD8+ was observed, especially in mice treated with Lipo-MD and ANC-SD. Interestingly, no Tregs were found in treated mice (i.e., either Lipo or ANC) on D23, whereas Tregs were still observed in Control group. As a conclusion, our data suggest that nanoparticles can reshape tumor immunity indeed. Little difference was found between ANC and Lipo, suggesting the immunomodulating features we observed are probably supported by the pegylated liposomes, and not the grafted trastuzumab. Increase in CD8+ cells in blood and tumors, associated with decrease in Tregs in tumors, suggest that liposomal nanoparticles could help turning cold tumors into hot ones.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liposomes,Immunomodulation,T lymphocytes,Flow cytometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mathilde Dacos<sup><\/sup>, Guillaume Sicard<sup><\/sup>, Benoit Immordino<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Giacometti<sup><\/sup>, <b>Joseph Ciccolini<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Anne Rodallec<sup><\/sup>, Raphaelle Fanciullino<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>COMPO SMARTc, CRCM, Marseille Cedex 05, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"91b68aa2-7a2d-4986-bd55-a4cb01590943","ControlNumber":"2617","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Typically, checkpoint inhibitors are delivered systemically, which may be inadequate due to poor drug distribution and limited penetration into solid tumors due to high intra-tumoral pressure. In such tumors, interstitial fluid pressure and solid stress restricts blood flow and therapeutic agent distribution throughout the tumor stroma. Pressure enabled drug delivery<sup>TM<\/sup> (PEDD<sup>TM<\/sup>) has been demonstrated to improve therapeutic delivery in pre-clinical models and in patients. PEDD has also been shown to reduce off-target tissue exposure to embolics while increasing intra-tumoral therapeutic concentration. We hypothesized that PEDD hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) using a TriNav<sup> <\/sup>device would enhance anti-PD-1 antibody delivery to porcine liver tumors when compared to systemic delivery.<br \/>Methods: The study was conducted in transgenic pigs (oncopigs) 35-50kg in weight. Explanted liver tissue was treated to induce oncogene expression and re-implanted in the liver at 4 locations for tumor formation. A fixed dosage (1 mg\/animal) of fluorescently labeled InVivoSIM anti-human PD-1 (AB_2894731) checkpoint inhibitor (<i>CPI<\/i>) was infused in 10ml of PBS at 2 ml\/min. The TriNav was positioned within a HA branch supplying a hepatic lobe with a fully formed tumor for local-regional infusion. Systemic infusion was conducted through the femoral vein. Liver tissue was collected 1 hour following infusion and drug levels were quantified by nearIR fluorescence imaging on sequential 1 cm thick sections. NearIR images were overlaid on color images, tumor border delineated, and the mean fluorescent <i>CPI <\/i>signal was calculated in concentric rings relative to the tumor border.<br \/>Results: A significant 2.6-to-5.4-fold increase in <i>CPI<\/i> signal intensity was observed from 15mm within the tumor to 30mm from the outer edge of tumor with PEDD using the TriNav<sup> <\/sup>device when compared to systemic delivery (p &#8804; 0.05). PEDD delivery also resulted in significant 2.5-to-3.9-fold enrichment from 5mm within the tumor to 10mm surrounding the tumor (relative to normal tissue within the treated lobe, p &#8804; 0.05). No significant difference in signal intensity was observed in peri-tumoral regions and a reduction in signal was observed in tissues 5mm to 15mm within the tumor relative to normal tissue (p &#8804; 0.05) following systemic <i>CPI<\/i> infusion.<br \/>Conclusions: This study demonstrates that HAI delivery of <i>CPI<\/i> into liver tumors in the oncopig via PEDD using a TriNav device resulted in superior delivery compared to systemic infusion. Importantly, PEDD significantly concentrated delivery of <i>CPI<\/i> into the tumors and within the rapidly growing margin of the tumors where target immune cells such as lymphocytes are present.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Targeted drug delivery,Tumor targeting,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David Benjamin Jaroch<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chandra  C.
