[{"Abstract":"Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a new type of &#8220;living drug&#8221; that has proven to be a powerful immunotherapy for hematologic malignancies. To date, there are six CAR-T products approved by the FDA for hematologic malignancies, four targeting CD19, and two targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). However, this success has not yet been transferred to solid tumors. A major hurdle is the on-target off-tumor toxicities due to the shared expression of target antigen on normal tissues. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is highly expressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); however, it is also expressed on bile duct at a lower physiological level leading to off-tumor toxicity of CAIX targeted therapies. The first anti-CAIX CAR-T studies, using the 1st generation G250 CAR-T cells plus IL-2 to treat patients with metastatic ccRCC, caused severe liver enzyme abnormalities in the treated patients after CAR-T cell infusions. To understand CAIX expression on tumor and normal tissues, we quantified CAIX expression on ccRCC patient samples and healthy bile duct tissues using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) which provides single-molecule resolution. Tet-On inducible CAIX expressing cell lines were established to mimic various CAIX densities on normal tissue and tumor samples. Using biolayer interferometry (BLI) and avidity analyzer, we identified a low-affinity, high-avidity anti-CAIX CAR G9. G9 CAR-T cells only kill CAIX high ccRCC tumor cells but not CAIX low normal cholangiocytes, and exhibited a CAIX density dependent response to Tet-On inducible CAIX expressing cell lines. Compared to high-affinity G250 CAR-T cells, G9 showed a better safety profile and a wider therapeutic window. G9 demonstrated a superior ex vivo efficacy on ccRCC patient derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) 3D cultures which recapitulate ccRCC patient tumor microenvironment (TME), as well as low toxicity on cholangiocyte derived organotypic spheroids (CDOS). In summary, affinity \/ avidity fine-tuned CAIX targeted CAR-T cell therapy holds promise to achieve cures of ccRCC by efficaciously killing tumor cells and mitigating on-target off-tumor toxicity on normal tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Carbonic anhydrase IX,Renal cell carcinoma,On-target Off-tumor side effects,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yufei Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alicia Buck<sup>1<\/sup>, Gabriella Kastrunes<sup>1<\/sup>, Rabia Abbas<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Lynch<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhou Zhong<sup>3<\/sup>, Song-My Hoang<sup>3<\/sup>, Andras Miklosi<sup>4<\/sup>, Kun Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jae-Won Cho<sup>5<\/sup>, Marion Grimaud<sup>1<\/sup>, Cecile Razimbaud<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew Chang<sup>1<\/sup>, Atef Fayed<sup>1<\/sup>, Audrey Apollon<sup>1<\/sup>, Nithyassree Murugan<sup>1<\/sup>, Ze-Hua Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Tran Thai<sup>1<\/sup>, Luann Zerefa<sup>1<\/sup>, Brandon Piel<sup>1<\/sup>, Elena Ivanova<sup>1<\/sup>, Amy Cameron<sup>1<\/sup>, Quang-De Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhu Zhu<sup>5<\/sup>, Kevin Wei<sup>5<\/sup>, Yasmin Nabil Laimon<sup>5<\/sup>, Aseman Bagheri Sheshdeh<sup>5<\/sup>, Sabina Signoretti<sup>5<\/sup>, David  A.

However, its role in CAR-T cell effector function has not yet been studied. Our work aims to understand the differential modulatory effect of KIR2DL2 immune checkpoint on the effector function of therapeutic T cells used for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: We generated CAR-T cells, with or without KIR2DL2 overexpression, using a bicistronic retroviral vector based on the MSGV1 backbone. HLA-C1-deficient tumor cells (HLA-C1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) were generated by CRISPR\/Cas-based knockout of the B2M gene. We designed gRNAs targeting KIR2DL2, validated their cleavage efficiency and proved the feasibility to abrogate its expression in primary T cells. We tested the inhibitory role of KIR2DL2 <i>in vitro <\/i>in HLA-C1<sup>+ <\/sup>or HLA-C1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> tumor cells using impedance- and bioluminescence&#8209;based cytotoxic assays at different effector:target ratios. We evaluated cytokine production after coculture of CAR-T and target cells using the ELLA system. To assess the modulatory role of KIR2DL2 <i>in vivo, <\/i>we generated HLA-C1<sup>+ <\/sup>or HLA&#8209;C1<sup>-<\/sup> subcutaneous xenografts of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (HPAC) cells, then treated the mice with KIR2DL2<sup>+ <\/sup>or KIR2DL2<sup>-<\/sup> PSCA-CAR-T cells. We assessed the effect of KIR2DL2 in a lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) xenograft model (NALM6 cells), treated with either KIR2DL2<sup>+<\/sup> or KIR2DL2&#8209;deficient CD19-CAR-T cells (i.v.).<br \/>Results: <i>In vitro, <\/i>KIR2DL2<sup>+<\/sup> CAR-T cells were significantly less cytotoxic in an HLA-C1-dependent manner, regardless of their target antigen. Cytokine analysis after coculture showed that overexpression of KIR2DL2 in CAR-T cells impaired their ability to produce IFN-&#947;, IL-2 and TNF-&#945; in presence of HLA-C1. <i>In vivo<\/i>, KIR2DL2-overexpressing PSCA&#8209;CAR-T cells injected in NSG mice harboring PSCA<sup>+<\/sup>\/HLA-C1<sup>+ <\/sup>pancreatic tumors were not able to eliminate tumors.

Two gRNAs targeting KIR2DL2 were validated in primary T cells by means of an enzymatic cleavage assay and flow cytometry. Current efforts are focused on characterizing the impact of KIR2DL2 ablation on the anti-leukemia activity of CAR-T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: KIR2DL2 impairs CAR-T cell effector function and cytokine secretion <i>in vitro<\/i> in both pancreatic and ALL tumor models, and <i>in vivo<\/i> in the pancreatic model. We implemented abrogation of KIR2DL2 by CRISPR\/Cas9 during CD19-CAR-T cell manufacturing. Ongoing efforts focus on testing the impact of KIR2DL2 ablation on the <i>in vivo<\/i> performance of CAR&#8209;T cells. These results strengthen the notion of KIR2DL2 as an immune checkpoint with a relevant role in T cell immunosurveillance and may constitute an actionable target to enhance adoptive cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CRISPR\/Cas9,KIR2DL2\/3,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miguel Gomez Fontela<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sebastian Snedal<sup><\/sup>, Elena Martinez Planes<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Abate-Daga<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Immunology, H.

Although Epstein-Barr virus-positive and microsatellite instability subtypes can be detected early and properly treated, they are rare in AGC. In this regard, recent combinational therapy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors and other various therapeutics has been tried, but there are clinically limited doses and drug resistance. We hypothesized that CAR-T targeting PD-L1, the common tumor-associated antigen (TAA), which expresses in most advanced cancer cells, would make a significant breakthrough in curing a solid tumor. This study aimed to evaluate the killing effects of anti-PD-L1 CAR-T against gastric cancer cell lines. Removal of PD-L1-expressing cells in the AGC TME will improve the clinical outcomes of current therapies.<br \/><b>[Results] <\/b>We constructed a second-generation PD-L1 CAR lentiviral vector targeting PD-L1, which has an intermediate affinity with PD-L1 in solid tumor TME. As the secondary signaling motif, CD28 was chosen and tested along with the CD3 zeta chain. The effector CAR-T, named Vax-CAR-T, specifically recognized the PD-L1-expressing AGC cell line, SNU638, and exhibited rapid and robust cytotoxic activity <i>in vitro<\/i>. When compared to untransduced T cells, the level of the CD25 activation marker was higher in Vax-CAR-T cells. Besides, the inhibitory markers of Tim3 and LAG3 were expressed even higher than the untransduced.

NK cells are also amenable to CRISPR and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) genomic engineering for enhanced functions. Another important anti-tumor role of NK cells is via antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The process is mediated by CD16a of NK cells, which binds the Fc portion of antibodies. After NK cell activation, the CD16a ectodomain is rapidly cleaved from the NK cell surface by a disintegrin, Metalloprotease-17 (ADAM17), that is produced by both tumor cells and activated NK cells. This dampens NK cell activity by preventing NK cell attachment to antibody-coated target cells and diminishes CD16a signaling. Inhibiting ADAM17-mediated CD16a cleavage leads to augmented ADCC activity and increased cytokine production by human NK cells. Other NK cell activating receptors are known to be regulated by a similar mechanism<sup>1<\/sup>. In this study, we have utilized CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to disrupt the ADAM17 gene in isolated peripheral blood NK cells from healthy donors. FACS and Amplicon NGS Sequencing data confirmed successful disruption of the gene. Edited NK cells were expanded using IL-2 and stimulation with NKSTIM, a modified K562 stimulatory cell line expressing a membrane-bound form of IL-15 (mbIL-15) and 4-1BBL. IL-12 and IL-18 were added during expansion to drive memory-like NK cell differentiation. Furthermore, we transduced ADAM17 edited NK cells to express a CD70 CAR<sup>2<\/sup> or CD19 CAR<sup>3<\/sup> construct and mbIL-15. CAR expression was assessed by FACS. In vitro cytotoxicity was measured by IncuCyte. Using an artificial activation system (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA]), we showed that ADAM17 KO NK cells maintain dramatically higher surface expression of CD16a and CD62L than control NK cells. In IncuCyte cytotoxicity assays against Raji tumor cells in the presence of rituximab (anti-CD20), ADAM17 KO NK cells and ADAM17 KO CD19 CAR NK cells demonstrated higher cytotoxicity compared to control NK cells. Similarly, ADAM17 KO NK cells and ADAM17 KO CD70 CAR NK cells also showed enhanced cytotoxicity against 786-O tumor cells in the presence of anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab. Furthermore, ADAM17\/CISH\/CBLB triple KO CD70 CAR NK cells exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo in a 786-O RCC tumor and a HL60 AML xenograft model. Taken together, we show ADAM17 KO NK or ADAM17 KO CAR NK cells demonstrate improved ADCC and ADAM17 KO can enhance in vivo anti-tumor activity of CISH\/CBLB KO CD70 CAR NK cells against relevant tumor models. These data support the further exploration of ADAM17 gene knockout NK cells for clinical application and to improve efficacy of therapeutic antibodies in combination with adoptive transfer of engineered NK cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,ADCC,CRISPR\/Cas9,ADAM17 Knockout,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chao Guo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yanying Fan<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexander Aronov<sup>1<\/sup>, Nikki Kimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Damie Juat<sup>1<\/sup>, Jessica Sood<sup>1<\/sup>, Ivan  H.

Targeted agents, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and KRAS G12C inhibitors, have provided clinical benefits for patients and can yield significant tumor shrinkage. Inevitably, however, there remain residual tumors that harbor drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPCs) not killed by initial treatment, leading to emerging of drug-resistant cells (DRCs) and tumor recurrence. The identification of effective treatment strategies to target DTPCs is a critical and unmet need. We hypothesized that DTPCs can be targeted using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based cellular therapy approaches directed at cell surface proteins expressed on DTPCs and that the combination of such approaches with targeted agents will more effectively delay the emergence of fully drug-resistant cells than targeted agents alone. To this end, we first performed luciferase-based killing assays and observed that EGFR-targeting CAR-T and CAR-NK cells displayed potent cytotoxicity against DTPCs of osimertinib-treated EGFR mutant NSCLC cells. Moreover, osimertinib DTPCs showed increased sensitivity to EGFR CAR-T and CAR-NK cells compared to their parental cells, likely due to the upregulation of EGFR on the cell surface following osimertinib treatment. In a patient-derived xenograft model of HER2<sup>YVMA<\/sup> mutant lung cancer, we observed that HER2 CAR-NK cells showed enhanced antitumor activity in mice treated with the HER2 inhibitor, poziotinib, for two weeks, compared to CAR-NK cells only, poziotinib only, or mice treated upfront with HER2 CAR-NK cells plus poziotinib. These <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> data support that CAR-based cellular therapy can effectively eliminate DTPCs. To identify additional candidate cell surface proteins expressed on DTPCs that could be targeted by CAR-based cell therapy approaches, we interrogated RNA expression from our panel of DTPCs as well as public datasets containing DTPCs of targeted agents. Likewise, we investigated the expression of cell surface proteins using datasets of parental and DRCs to identify the common candidate targets that could be exploited on both DTPCs and DRCs. Our analysis identified CD70 as being consistently upregulated in both EGFR TKI-resistant cells and DTPCs of osimertinib-treated EGFR mutant NSCLC. Moreover, we observed CD70 upregulation in DTPCs and DRCs of other targeted agents, including KRAS, ALK, and RET inhibitors, suggesting that CD70 may be a common target in DTPCs across oncogenic drivers. Furthermore, we determined that CD70-targeting CAR-T and CAR-NK cells showed promising <i>in vitro<\/i> activity against the DTPCs of osimertinib-treated EGFR mutant NSCLC. These results demonstrate CAR-based cellular therapy as an effective approach to target DTPCs and identify CD70 as a novel therapeutic target for combatting DTPCs in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,CD70,CAR T cells,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yan Yang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Monique Nilsson<sup><\/sup>, Sonia Patel<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoxing Yu<sup><\/sup>, Alissa Poteete<sup><\/sup>, Qian Huang<sup><\/sup>, Simon Heeke<sup><\/sup>, John Heymach<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d397c380-a37c-49b7-86ca-2be97180b338","ControlNumber":"2932","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Pooled data from the Phase 1 (NCT03132922) and Phase 2 (SPEARHEAD-1, NCT04044768) trials of afami-cel showed an acceptable benefit to risk profile with an overall response rate of 36.2% and a median duration of response of 52.0 weeks.<sup>1<\/sup> To support the continued investigation of potential mechanisms of durable anti-tumor activity, we previously showed that afami-cel induces broad and enduring peripheral cytokine responses<sup>2<\/sup> and that afami-cel tumoral infiltration is associated with increased presence of activated and proliferative cytotoxic T-cells in the tumor microenvironment.<sup>3<\/sup> Here, we report the results of translational analyses exploring the cooperation between afami-cel-induced innate and adaptive immune responses pooled from the Phase 1 and 2 trials. Methods included measurement of 92 biomarkers related to apoptosis, chemotaxis, metabolism, tumor immunity promotion\/suppression, and vascular\/tissue remodeling in pre- and post-infusion serum samples from 38 patients. We also conducted multiplex immunofluorescence and gene set variation analysis of Reactome immune system pathway categories and microenvironment cell populations in RNA sequencing data from pre- and post-infusion biopsies from &#8805;15 patients. Serum analyses showed that patients with a clinical benefit as defined by RECIST v1.1 had significantly greater post-infusion levels of chemotactic markers (Kruskal-Wallis; p&#60;0.05 for partial response [PR] compared to progressive disease, p&#60;0.01 for PR compared to stable disease), indicating higher signaling related to immune-cell recruitment towards lesions. Tumor analyses showed increased expression of genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity, and cytokine signaling, in post-infusion biopsies, including T-cell receptor signaling-related expression, which was consistent with relatively greater spatial protein detection of pro-immune infiltrate. This profile was associated with longer progression-free survival. In conclusion, our data suggest that afami-cel induces peripheral and tumoral innate and adaptive immune responses, a hallmark of durable anti-tumor activity.

For mCRC, while systemic therapies (cytotoxic therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy or their combinations) have extended patient&#8217;s life expectancy, not all patients are candidates for these treatments. Immunotherapy has achieved significant curative effects in patients with solid tumors; however, a considerable proportion of mCRC patients (~90%) are not responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) leaving a gap in the CRC immunotherapy options.<br \/>Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells that display potent effector responses against a wide variety of tumor cells; however, they are frequently dysfunctional in cancer patients. NK cells from CRC patients exhibit decreased expression of activating receptors and reduced cytokine production after stimulation with CRC cells with a more accentuated phenotype in advanced stages of the disease. Memory-like (ML) NK cells differentiated after IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 activation have been shown to overcome limitations associated with deficient tumor recognition and poor anti-tumor activity. In clinical trials, ML NK cells were safe and active against acute myeloid leukemia (Romee R et al, Sci Transl Med, 2016). Preclinically, ML NK cells exhibited improved responses against melanoma (Marin ND et al, Clin Cancer Res, 2021) and ovarian cancers, compared to conventional NK cells. Here, we hypothesized that memory-like differentiation will enhance multiple aspects of the NK cell response against CRC cells.<br \/>Allogeneic ML NK cells displayed enhanced IFN-&#947; production against four CRC cell lines DLD-1 (p=0.015), SW480 (p=0.0005), HT-29 (p=0.0005) and HCT116 (p=0.001), as well as primary patient derived CRC tumoroids (p=0.0156), compared to conventional (c) NK cells. ML NK cells also exhibited superior and sustained killing of CRC cell lines over time compared to cNK cells, as measured by Incucyte assays and using CRC tumoroids. Furthermore, IFN-&#947; production was significantly reduced after blockade of NKG2D, DNAM-1 and NKp46 (p&#60;0.01) revealing mechanistic insights into how ML NK cells recognize CRC targets. Finally, using a xenograft model of CRC in NSG mice, we demonstrated that ML NK cells exhibited superior control of Luciferase expressing HCT116 cells compared to cNK cells (p=0.01) as measured by bioluminescent imaging (BLI).<br \/>Collectively, these findings demonstrate that ML NK cells exhibit enhanced responses against CRC cells, and thus warrants further investigation in clinical trials for CRC patients, especially those who are not candidates for standard of care therapy or failed ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,Colorectal cancer,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nancy D.

Identifying suitable target antigens in myeloid malignancies has been hampered by expected on-target-off leukemia toxicity. FLT3 is a promising target antigen with high expression in most AML samples independent of FLT3 mutation status (Brauchle et al., 2020). Here, we compared two T-cell based immunotherapy approaches, BiTE&#174; vs CART, in targeting FLT3 in AML. We tested BiTE&#174; and CAR mediated cytotoxicity against several AML cell lines and primary AML (pAML) cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. The impact of positive co-stimulation was evaluated using our previously established Ba\/F3 model system, which is devoid of human costimulatory molecules. Conjugate formation as a surrogate for synapse formation and consecutive T-cell degranulation were analyzed. Combination with tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) was tested in conjunction with BiTE&#174; and CAR to further enhance cytotoxicity against FLT3mut AML cells. On-target off-leukemia toxicity was tested in mixing assays of AML cells and healthy bone marrow (hBM). Finally, we compared CAR and BiTE<sup>&#174;<\/sup> in an <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft AML model. No differences in BiTE&#174; vs CAR mediated cytotoxicity were observed against cell lines with different genetic background and FLT3 expression levels or pAML samples. However, the percentage of T cell-AML conjugates formed utilizing CART was significantly higher compared to BiTE&#174; molecules. Also, faster and stronger degranulation of CD107a was detected using CAR T cells vs BiTE&#174;. Interestingly, we showed that expression of the costimulatory CD86 increased the cytotoxicity of BiTE<sup>&#174;<\/sup>-redirected T cells while CAR mediated lysis was unaltered. In case of the FLT3-ITD mutated cell line MV411, the addition of FLT3 TKIs significantly increased CAR and BiTE<sup>&#174;<\/sup> mediated cytotoxicity. Looking at on-target off-leukemia toxicity, in particular hBM cells, we only observed low cytotoxicity. Moving to an <i>in vivo<\/i> AML xenograft model, we observed that CAR T cell treated mice had an improved OS compared to BiTE<sup>&#174;<\/sup>-treated mice, accompanied by enhanced proliferation and homing of the CAR T cells to the spleen. We conclude, that FLT3 is a promising target antigen for T cell-based immunotherapy with limited on-target-off leukemia toxicity. Our preclinical <i>in vitro<\/i> data demonstrate similar cytotoxicity of both platforms against AML cell lines and pAML cells. Utilizing a xenograft mouse model, CAR T cells provided a significant survival benefit over BiTE&#174; molecules. Our data support the hypothesis that positive co-stimulation either integrated within the construct (e.g. 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation CAR) or provided by the target cell (e.g. CD86 expressing leukemia cells) propagates Tcell activation and proliferation. Future studies will be needed to further dissect differences between BiTE&#174; vs CAR T cell based immunotherapy platforms and identify suitable combination partners.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Bispecific antibody,CAR T cells,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lisa Rohrbacher<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Nixdorf<sup>1<\/sup>, Helena Stadler<sup>1<\/sup>, Bettina Brauchle<sup>1<\/sup>, Florian Märkl<sup>1<\/sup>, Nora Philipp<sup>1<\/sup>, Gerulf Hänel<sup>1<\/sup>, Anetta Marcinek<sup>1<\/sup>, Maryam Kazerani<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca  L.

However, we hypothesize that LGG-targeting T-cells may exist at low frequency and with limited regional infiltration within the tumor. Multi-region tumor sampling coupled with high-throughput T-cell receptor (TCR) profiling across the LGG landscape detected neoantigen-specific T-cells that persisted in peripheral blood. TCR-engineered T-cells transduced with these TCRs demonstrated neoantigen-specific immunogenicity.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>Maximal-anatomical sampling of at least 10 distinct tumor regions were collected at the initial resection for three WHO Grade II diffuse astrocytoma patients for exome-based prediction of clonally and subclonally expressed neoantigens, RNAseq analysis of regional immune cell composition, and TCR beta deep sequencing. We used these predictions to generate a barcoded library of patient-specific peptide-HLA multimers loaded with predicted neoepitopes. With this library, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T-cells were captured and isolated from patient peripheral blood. Single cell TCR sequencing allowed us to identify the neoantigen-reactive TCR clonotypes which were transduced subsequently into Jurkat76 cell lines for functional validation.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>We screened patient-derived peripheral blood drawn two years after initial resection in 3 mutant <i>IDH1<\/i> LGG patients and detected a total of 20 TCR clonotypes recognizing neoepitopes derived from truncal, tumor-wide mutations in <i>CNTNAP1<\/i> (<i>n<\/i>=8), <i>TP53<\/i> (<i>n<\/i>=3), and <i>MRPL46<\/i> (<i>n<\/i>=2) as well as subclonal mutations in <i>PRMT5<\/i> (<i>n<\/i>=1) and <i>ZDHHC5<\/i> (<i>n<\/i>=6). Multi-sampling RNAseq analysis indicated varying degrees of interpatient and intratumoral immune infiltration as well as distally located populations of neoantigen-reactive T-cells within the tumor, suggesting widespread migration of neoantigen-specific T-cells across the glioma landscape. We proceeded with TCR functional analysis for one patient (P375) with 5 detected TCR clonotypes recognizing neoantigens derived from mutations in <i>PRMT5<\/i>, <i>MRPL46<\/i>, and <i>TP53<\/i>.

The tumor microenvironment can impair T cell function within solid tumors through a variety of mechanisms, including nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and recruitment of immuno-suppressive cells. CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm), which are characterized by surface expression of CD69 and CD103 and a unique transcription factor circuit, are found within solid tumors, important for tumor surveillance, and responsive to checkpoint inhibitor blockade. However, it is unclear whether CAR T cells adopt Trm features in the tumor microenvironment and how the nature of the CAR costimulatory domain could impact Trm differentiation and efficacy against solid tumors. To investigate Trm differentiation in solid tumors, we utilized murine the MC38 syngeneic graft tumor model and found three populations of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes: CD69-CD103-, CD69+CD103- and CD69+CD103+. CD69+ populations downregulated circulating T cells genes and expressed Trm signature genes often found in non-tumor Trm cells. To examine if tumor infiltrating CAR T cells follow a similar differentiation pattern, human carcinoembryonic antigen (hCEA)-specific CAR T cells with either a CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domain were transferred into hosts bearing MC38-hCEA tumors. hCEA-CD28 CAR T cells accumulated in the tumor, while hCEA-41BB CAR T cells and T cells without a CAR were present at much lower numbers. hCEA-CD28 CAR T cells displayed delayed Trm differentiation with an increased proportion of CD69-CD103- cells when compared to hCEA-41BB CAR T cells or T cells without a CAR. While hCEA-CD28 CAR signaling drove T cell accumulation, there was significant heterogeneity in the degree of T cell expansion, and the size of CD69-CD103- population correlated strongly with the number of hCEA-CD28 CAR T cells within the tumor. CD69-CD103- hCEA-CD28 CAR T cells were more proliferative and expressed lower levels of surface markers associated with dysfunction, including PD-1 and LAG3. These observations suggested CD69 could be a negative regulator of T cell proliferation and function. Indeed, deletion of CD69 in hCEA-CD28 CAR T cells further enhanced proliferation, which resulted in greater numbers of CAR T cells in tumor. In summary, hCEA-CD28 CAR signaling prolonged T cell proliferation in solid tumors by delaying Trm differentiation and the upregulation of CD69, whose expression impairs T cell proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Differentiation,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Menglin Cheng<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tessa Bergsbaken<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ff975b50-2050-4cf0-b41d-3bc8d89ddcf6","ControlNumber":"8112","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

As this treatment modality continues to evolve toward the targeting of novel tumor antigens and engineering of cells with greater persistence, there is a need in multiple phases of the CAR-T development pipeline for highly specific detection reagents that can be leveraged to monitor the expression of CARs on the cell surface. Many commercially available CAR detection reagents, however, either lack specificity or are not versatile in their ability to detect CARs of differing antigen specificity. Here, we report on the generation and validation of rabbit monoclonal antibodies raised against two linker sequences that are commonly integrated into single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-based CARs. These antibodies serve as versatile detection reagents that can be used to interrogate the surface expression of CARs.<br \/>Methods: The monoclonal antibodies, E7O2V and E3U7Q, were generated by rabbits immunized with peptide sequences most commonly used to construct the linker region of scFv based CARs, Gly<sub>4<\/sub>Ser and Whitlow, respectively. E7O2V and E3U7Q were validated for specificity and versatility using flow cytometric analysis of non-transduced versus CAR-transduced cell lines and primary human T cells.<br \/>Results: Flow cytometric analysis of live Jurkat cells and primary human T cells transduced with CAR constructs revealed that E7O2V and E3U7Q could detect surface expressed CARs containing the appropriate linker sequence, independently of scFv specificity. No specific staining was observed on non-transduced cells.<br \/>Conclusions: In a flow cytometry assay, E7O2V and E3U7Q specifically detect surface expressed scFv-based CARs containing either a Gly<sub>4<\/sub>Ser linker or a Whitlow linker, respectively.<b> <\/b>Furthermore<b>, <\/b>these monoclonal antibodies are versatile in that they can also detect their respective linker sequence independently of scFv specificity. The potential exists to leverage these antibodies for CAR-T cell enrichment and for incorporation into multiparametric flow cytometry panels used to phenotype CAR-T cells during the discovery, manufacturing, and clinical phases of the development pipeline.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Immunotherapy,Immunoassay,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amrik Singh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah L'Heureux<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Sinapius<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Kvorjak<sup>2<\/sup>, Emma Wade<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Lohmueller<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeremy Fisher<sup>1<\/sup>, Reginaldo Prioli<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"97074b52-1b9a-4292-9508-3e0cfc6be439","ControlNumber":"1476","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Tumor immune evasion mechanisms, presence of immunosuppressive factors and cellular resistance to tumor infiltration are key mechanisms that the TME uses to reduce efficacy of T-cells against the tumor. Therapeutic options for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain limited to date despite it being the most aggressive subtype of breast cancers and carrying the poorest prognosis. Tumor-associated MUC1 antigen is overexpressed in a large number of TNBC patients offering an effective discriminatory target for CAR T-cell therapy. Here, we present innovative strategies exploring alternative delivery routes and purposeful armoring of CAR T-cells to boost efficiency while preserving safety. To maintain anti-tumor CAR T-cell cytotoxic and proliferation in the hostile TME of solid tumors, we developed state-of-the-art multiplexed gene editing using high precision TALEN&#174; technology. With that aim, we armored allogeneic CAR T-cells with specific attributes to release immune inflammatory cytokines and protect from inhibitory effects of the TGFB1 and PD1 pathways. A combination of strategies using allogeneic CAR T-cells with diverse attributes were evaluated against TNBC tumors<i> <\/i>in various <i>in vivo<\/i> pre-clinical models. Local CAR T-delivery resulted in effective control of tumor growth and robust antigen specific recognition. Furthermore, we assessed how the delivery route contributes to CAR-T cell distribution. CAR T-cell activity could also be increased systemically upon tumor-specific release of immunostimulatory cytokines without compromising safety. Our results demonstrate not only superior activity of armored MUC1-CAR T-cells resulting in tumor clearance but also in the recovery of normal glands. Thus, innovative strategies can be used to allow CAR T-cell efficiency in the hostile tumor microenvironment while preserving safety. Overall, our pre-clinical results underline the capability of armored allogenic MUC1-CAR T-cells to excel in the immune suppressive tumor micro-environment, suggesting that allogenic MUC1-CAR T-cell therapy could be an effective option in treating relapsed\/refractory TNBC patients with limited therapeutic options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Allogeneic,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Piril Erler<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hana Cho<sup><\/sup>, Jordan Skinner<sup><\/sup>, Laurent Poirot<sup><\/sup>, Beatriz Aranda-Orgilles<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cellectis, Inc., New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9f8627c2-25a8-428d-be4b-4376271f79ac","ControlNumber":"4758","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

Responding to numerous cues from various cell types present in the tumor, TAMs often exhibit a spectrum of phenotypes, often ranging between M1 (inflammatory) and M2 (tumor-supportive) macrophages. Therefore, the M1\/M2 macrophage ratio often determines tumor suppression or tumor growth. Higher TAMs infiltration is usually associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types due to their predisposition towards M2 function. Therefore, reprogramming TAMs to the M1 phenotype is a promising avenue to be explored. In this study, we reprogrammed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) <i>ex-vivo<\/i> by treating them with HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i) followed by polarization to M1 phenotype and directly implanted them into immunocompetent tumors. We performed immunohistochemistry of tumors for macrophage markers, immunophenotyping of tumor-infiltrated immune cells by flow cytometry, gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR, and immunoblot analyses. We also performed single-cell analyses, including secretome with Isoplexis platform and CD45+ tumor-infiltrated immune cells by single-cell RNA-seq analysis. To further underscore the translatability of macrophage-based cell therapy, we treated humanized NSG-SGM3 mice bearing melanoma PDX tumors with HDAC6i-treated human M1 macrophages. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with HDAC6i-treated M1 macrophages resulted in significant tumor suppression and prolonged survival compared to other cohorts in the study. Two weeks post-transplantation, ACT macrophages were viable, and inhibition of HDAC6 rendered them resistant to M2 polarization. Inhibition of HDAC6 suppressed STAT3 activation and subsequent M2 marker <i>Arg1<\/i> expression, further underscoring the role of HDAC6 in macrophage plasticity. M2 re-polarization assay further corroborated that HDAC6i-treated M1 macrophages were resistant to change into M2 phenotype. Single-cell secretome analysis revealed polyfunctionality as HDAC6-treated M1 macrophages were capable of secreting inflammatory cytokines such as Tnfa and t-cell recruiting Cxcl10. Histological analysis of tumor sections for macrophage markers and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of tumor-infiltrated immune cells further corroborated the M1\/M2 ratio the increase observed by flow cytometry. Pro-inflammatory gene expression signature from scRNA-seq analysis also correlated with better survival in the SKCM dataset. In both immuno-competent SM1 murine melanoma and humanized NSG-SGM3 melanoma models, ACT enhanced anti-tumor immunity by increasing the M1\/M2 ratio and infiltration of CD8 effector T-cells shifting the balance towards anti-tumor immunity. For the first time, we demonstrate that reprogramming macrophages with class-specific HDAC inhibitors is a viable cell therapy option to treat solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Macrophages,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Satish Kumar Reddy Noonepalle<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Gracia Del Mar Hernandez<sup>2<\/sup>, Christian Zevallos Delgado<sup>3<\/sup>, Nima Aghdam<sup>4<\/sup>, Nithya Gajendran<sup>1<\/sup>, Tessa Knox<sup>2<\/sup>, Karen Tan<sup>1<\/sup>, Eduardo Sotomayor<sup>5<\/sup>, Katherine  B.

Neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (neoTCRs) were isolated from the patients&#8217; circulating CD8 T cells followed by non-viral precision genome engineering into autologous apheresis-derived T cells for infusion back into the patient. We present comprehensive immune monitoring data for 2 patients treated in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03970382).

Analysis of longitudinal biopsies confirmed that targeted mutations were truncal, with both neoantigens present pre- and post-dosing. NeoTCR+ T cells were identified in the tumor by RNA seq and imaging, with neoTCR+ T cells also expressing Granzyme B. Furthermore, single cell RNA seq of neoTCR+ T cells from the pre-infusion product as compared neoTCR T cells isolated from the patients&#8217; blood 2 months post-infusion demonstrated evidence of antigen engagement in 1 out of 3 neoTCR T cell products, with a shift from a predominantly Tcm\/Tem-like phenotype pre-infusion to a Teff-like state post-infusion. This neoTCR T cell product also increased slightly in the blood from 1.1 to 3.4% between month 1 and 2, while the other 2 T cell products remained predominantly in the Tcm-like phenotype and remained stable in the blood between month 1 and 2. Patient 0612, a patient with melanoma, was treated with 3 unique neoTCRs (4.0x10<sup>9<\/sup> neoTCR+ cells) which targeted 3 distinct neoantigens presented by HLA-B*08:01 or HLA-C*07:02. Longitudinal biopsies support the assessment that 2\/3 mutations were truncal and 1 targeted mutation was sub-clonal based on their presence in each biopsy. Retrospective analysis showed HLA loss of heterozygosity at HLA-C07:02 in all 3 biopsies, affecting 2\/3 infused TCR products. The remaining TCR showed evidence of a shift from a predominantly Tcm-like phenotype pre-infusion to more differentiated Teff\/Tcm-em phenotypes post-infusion compared to the 2 TCRs targeting mutations expressed by the lost HLA allele.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These case studies illustrate for the first time tracking of 3 unique personalized T cell products within a single patient.

Standard therapies often fail, with more than 50% of patients experiencing relapse, eventually with metastatic disease. Colorectal tumors are densely infiltrated by immune cells that have a role in surveillance and modulation of tumor progression. However, exhaustion mechanisms acting within the tumor microenvironment impede their functional capacity against tumor cells. We paired high-dimensional flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to describe the T cell functional landscape in tumor and peritumoral tissues from primary colorectal cancers and liver metastases. Analysis of the healthy, peritumoral and neoplastic tissues of treatment-na&#239;ve primary CRCs and of the peritumoral and tumoral tissues of CRC patients undergoing surgery for liver metastasis, revealed extensive transcriptional and spatial remodeling across tumors, being metabolic pathways among the major drivers of this variance. Regarding the immune infiltrate, we found that T cells are mainly localized at the front edge and that tumor-infiltrating T cells co-express multiple inhibitory receptors. Unsupervised analysis of flow cytometry data performed by an advanced pipeline of data handling by dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms allowed the definition of a peculiar inhibitory receptors signature in TILs enriched both in primary CRCs and liver metastases. Among the highly co-expressed inhibitory receptors, CD39 was found to represent the major driver of exhaustion in both primary and metastatic colorectal tumors. CD39 is a diphosphohydrolase converting ATP into AMP that is emerging as exhaustion marker for tumor-specific T cells, thus highlighting its relevance as molecular target for T cells engineering. We leveraged on these findings to generate a novel cellular product for the adoptive cell therapy of CRC. By CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing tools, we simultaneously redirected T cell specificity by disrupting the alpha and beta genes of the endogenous T cell receptor with 90% efficiency for both genes, and disrupted CD39 with 100% efficiency, generating triple-knockout engineered lymphocytes. By lentiviral transduction, we redirected the specificity of our engineered T cell product employing a novel T-cell receptor targeting the HER-2 antigen. Triple-edited, HER2-redirected T cells were challenged <i>in vitro <\/i>against HER2+ patient-derived organoids from liver metastases (mPDOs). Measurement of Cas3\/7 displayed a functional advantage for CD39-disrupted, HER2-redirected T cells in recognizing and killing mPDOs. We then evaluated the efficacy of our T cell product in two different <i>in vivo<\/i> models: subcutaneous injection of mPDOs, and intra-hepatic injection of mPDOs. In both models, CD39-disrupted, HER2-redirected T cells displayed a superior capacity of controlling tumor outgrowth long term.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Adoptive cell therapy,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alessia Potenza<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chiara Balestrieri<sup><\/sup>, Luca Albarello<sup><\/sup>, Federica Pedica<sup><\/sup>, Martina Spiga<sup><\/sup>, Francesco Manfredi<sup><\/sup>, Beatrice  C.

Allogenic natural killer (NK) cell therapies have also been shown to mount potent responses against hematologic malignancies but are less likely to cause high-grade toxicities and can be mass produced for off-the-shelf usage. We have developed an iPSC-derived NK (iNK) platform amenable to engineering multiple features for improving efficacy against both solid and liquid tumors.Our previous studies showed that knocking out the <i>CISH<\/i> gene, which encodes a key regulator of activation, in iNK cells (<i>CISH<\/i> KO iNK cells) significantly improves their anti-cancer activity, in vivo persistence, metabolic fitness, polyfunctional cytokine production, and resistance to cell exhaustion. In this study we have expanded upon this work to show that <i>CISH<\/i> KO iNK cells increase anti-tumor activity against a broad range of both hematologic and solid tumor cell types in several types of in vitro assays, making <i>CISH<\/i> KO iNK cells an attractive cell therapy platform for additional development. CAR enabled NK cells using CARs developed for T-cells have shown clinical efficacy. However, recent studies using signaling modules of NK cell activating receptors (i.e., NKG2D and 2B4) for recombinant CAR signaling domains have demonstrated increased activity. In this study we screened a library of CAR constructs (targeting CD19) containing signaling modules from diverse immune cell signaling receptors including NK cell activating receptors, cytokine receptors, and integrins. Our screen identified several CAR signaling domains that performed better than both T cell CARs and previously reported NK cell CARs. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our top CAR construct, SLNK12, we generated SLNK12-CARs paired with antigen binding domains for various tumor antigens. We confirmed that SLNK12-CARs potently kill target cancer cell lines regardless of the antigen being targeted in monolayer, 3D spheroid, and serial killing assays in vitro. We also describe the development of iNK cells with enhanced ADCC activity. NK cells normally bind antibodies via their CD16A receptor, which has low affinity for the antibody Fc domain and thus limits therapeutic response. We have constructed a recombinant Fc-receptor that combines a high-affinity Fc-binding domain (to improve antibody binding) with our NK-optimized CAR signaling domains to enhance ADCC-mediated killing. These &#8220;enhanced ADCC&#8221; engineered <i>CISH<\/i> KO iNK cells possess potent anti-cancer activity in combination with several different therapeutic antibodies. Taken together, our results show that engineering <i>CISH<\/i> KO iNK cells with either NK-optimized CARs or enhanced ADCC receptors improves anti-tumor activity against a variety of solid tumor target lines in vitro.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,Adoptive cell therapy,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lee Swanson<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Spencer Goodman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kenyon Lyon<sup>1<\/sup>, Davide Bernareggi<sup>1<\/sup>, Caryn Gonsalves<sup>1<\/sup>, Max Schabla<sup>1<\/sup>, Guoxin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qin Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Leah Mitchell<sup>1<\/sup>, Dan  S.

T cell therapy has emerged as a viable treatment for brain malignancies. While promising, the efficacy of this approach is often limited by a complex immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These complexities mean that more sophisticated T cell products are required. The brain tumor microenvironment provides local restraints via metabolic competition suppressing antitumor immunity, specifically inhibiting infiltration and effector functions of host and adoptively transferred tumor-reactive T cells. The objective of this project is to test new treatments to reverse immune dysfunction in brain cancer through the regulation of T cell metabolic signaling. We propose that modulating glucose signaling can potentiate T cell anti-tumor activity. The glucose signaling pathway of T cells was modulated through overexpression of glucose transporters and the function of metabolically modified T cells was investigated using murine and human models. We revealed a competition for glucose between T cells and tumor cells, with tumor cells imposing glucose restriction mediating T cell hyporesponsiveness. Overexpression of glucose transporters such as Glut1 and Glut3 enhanced T cell glucose utilization and provided a survival\/growth advantage and greater activation, specifically in glucose-restricted conditions. We established that glucose transporter overexpression improves intratumoral infiltration and expansion of adoptively transferred CAR T cells, resulting in improved survival. Our study integrates fundamental concepts of tumor and immune metabolism in the design of immunotherapy and confirms that immunometabolism represents a viable target for new cancer therapy to treat brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Metabolism,Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tanya Ghosh<sup><\/sup>, Avirup Chakraborty<sup><\/sup>, Linchun Jin<sup><\/sup>, Diana Feier<sup><\/sup>, Aryeh Silver<sup><\/sup>, Maryam Rahman<sup><\/sup>, Catherine Flores<sup><\/sup>, Matthew Sarkisian<sup><\/sup>, Jianping Huang<sup><\/sup>, Duane  A.

Both chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and transgenic T cell receptors (TCRs) have been used to redirect T cells in preclinical and clinical studies. TCR Therapy (TCR-T) can target essentially any tumor antigen via the major histocompatibility (MHC) system. However, the development of novel tumor antigen specific TCRs is hampered by the lack of easy-to-use model systems and sensitive readouts to facilitate candidate screening and development. Particularly, determination of transgenic TCR activation in primary and immortalized T cells is confounded by the presence of endogenous TCR expression which results in mixed alpha\/beta TCR pairings and compression of assay readouts. Herein, we describe the development of a novel cell-based TCR knockout (TCR-KO) reporter assay platform for the development and characterization of novel TCR candidates. CRISPR\/Cas9 was used to knockout the endogenous TCR chains in a T cell line that stably expresses a luciferase reporter gene responsive to TCR activation. Reintroduction of a transgenic TCR into the TCR-KO reporter cells results in robust antigen-specific reporter activation compared to parental reporter cells. The further development of CD4\/CD8 double-positive and double-negative versions enable low and functional high avidity TCR screening with or without MHC bias. Furthermore, stable TCR-expressing reporter cells generated from TCR-KO reporter cells exhibit sufficient sensitivity and robustness for safety and specificity studies of lead TCR candidates. Together, our data demonstrate that TCR-KO reporter cells can be a useful tool for the discovery, characterization, and deployment of T cell immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Adoptive cell therapy,Adoptive immunotherapy,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jamison Grailer<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michael Slater<sup><\/sup>, Jim Hartnett<sup><\/sup>, Frank Fan<sup><\/sup>, Mei Cong<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Promega Corp., Madison, WI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"051b1a21-51bf-4c67-9922-522bb66fd2bd","ControlNumber":"3628","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

A variety of in vitro assays are used to characterize the proliferation, cytokine release, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity of engineered immune cells, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, each representing an important aspect driving clinical efficacy of the cellular product. Importantly, adoptive cell therapies must exhibit potent tumor killing over a prolonged period in vivo. Here, we describe an in vitro potency assay that quantifies immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity in response to repeated challenges with target cells. The repeated challenge assay was performed with two separate protocols, each providing a unique assessment of the effector cell function. In the first method, SKOV3 target cells (5k cells\/well) were seeded into a multiwell microplate with embedded electrodes in the substrate. Electrical impedance measurements from the electrodes in each well detected the attachment and proliferation of the target cells. HER-2 specific CAR T effector cells were added 24 hours after the target cells and co-cultured with the target cells at a 1:1 effector to target ratio. Cytolysis of the target cells was calculated by comparing treated wells to no treatment control wells. Additional SKOV3 target cells (5k per well) were added every 24 hours for the repeated challenge conditions, with total tumor cell killing computed from the area under the impedance curve. The repeated challenge condition reached complete killing after the 6th tumor cell challenge (144 hours after first effector addition), whereas the single challenge condition reached complete killing within 96 hours of effector addition. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the effector cells proliferated significantly more for the repeated challenge condition (4.7 fold increase) than the single challenge condition (1.5 fold increase). In the second method, the CAR T cells were removed after each challenge, counted, and added to a fresh plate of SKOV3 target cells at a 1:1 effector to target cell ratio. Here, the E:T ratio was kept constant for each challenge, allowing a direct comparison of the killing kinetics (KT50) for each subsequent challenge. The KT50 decreased from the first challenge (19.9 hr) to the fourth challenge (83.5 hr). Flow cytometry analysis revealed a reduction in CD8+ cells for the repeated challenge condition, indicating a change in the make-up of the immune cell population. The paradigms described above facilitate a label-free, in vitro workflow to assess potency of immune effector cells across repeated challenges, with the opportunity to incorporate additional assays, like flow cytometry or cytokine release, after each successive challenge.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cytotoxicity,CAR T cells,Potency assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Denise Sullivan<sup><\/sup>, <b>Stacie Chvatal<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Daniel Millard<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Axion BioSystems, Atlanta, GA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7cc72eec-0fe2-474d-b4f2-540fb8908325","ControlNumber":"7476","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

In general, an antibody is used for detection of target protein expression in the tumor to identify appropriate targets for the CAR-T cell therapy in solid tumors. However, the local conjunction between CAR-T cells and the target is not exactly the same in the antibody and the target because CAR-T cell recognizes the target by single-chain variable fragment (scFv). In this study, we evaluated the anti-GPC1 scFv-Fc fusion protein as a detection tool of GPC1 expression in human cancer cell lines.<br \/>Methods: The sequences encoding the anti-GPC1 scFv are based on the sequence of anti-GPC1 mAb (clone: 1-12) that recognizes human and mouse GPC1 (Harada et al., 2017). The sequences of anti GPC-1 scFv were cloned into pCAG-Neo mIgG2a-Fc plasmid for the generation of anti GPC1_scFv-mIgG2a_Fc fusion proteins. The plasmids were transfected into 293 T cells and the fusion proteins were purified from their culture supernatants using Antibody TCS Purification Kit. LK2-GPC1 (a GPC1 overexpressing lung carcinoma cell line), TE8 (an esophageal carcinoma cell line with endogenous GPC1) and LK2-mock (a GPC1-negative lung carcinoma cell line) were used for the evaluation of the anti-GPC1 scFv-Fc fusion protein.<br \/>Results: In FACS assays, fluorescence microscopy analysis and immunohistochemistry staining, GPC1 expression was successfully detected by both anti-GPC1 scFv of VL-VH and VH-VL in LK2-GPC1 and TE-8, and not detected in LK2-mock. Localization of GPC1 expression on the cell membrane was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy.<br \/>Perspective: Further comparative evaluation between anti-GPC1 antibody and anti-GPC1 scFv-Fc fusion proteins are needed especially in human tumor tissues. We plan to evaluate a relationship between GPC1 positivity in various human tumor tissues detected by anti-GPC1 scFv-Fc fusion protein and CAR-T cell cytotoxicity against the tissue.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Glypican-1,Single chain antibodies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Takeshi Sawada<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tomonori Yaguchi<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuko Sakai<sup>1<\/sup>, Chinatsu Suzuki<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenji Morii<sup>2<\/sup>, Masahiko Aoki<sup>1<\/sup>, Masaru Fukahori<sup>1<\/sup>, Satoshi Serada<sup>3<\/sup>, Tetsuji Naka<sup>3<\/sup>, Jun  K.

With new treatment strategies and druggable targets being identified at an increasing pace, the number of patients eligible for cancer immunotherapy is expected to expand steadily. However, promising therapeutic developments face hurdles in translating preclinical findings into therapy since conventional 2D cancer models hold low clinical predictive value. HUB developed an innovative alternative, build on the discovery that adult stem cells proliferate and organise into three-dimensional organotypic structures when they are embedded into extracellular matrix. Patient specific organoids are generated from healthy and malignant tissues and stored as biobanks with high quality and reproducibility. HUB Organoids recapitulate complex characteristics of the original parental tissue, including molecular heterogeneity, and morphological and functional traits. Since cancer progression and responses to immunotherapy are governed by immune cell interactions in the tumour microenvironment, we developed an assay in which various types of tumour organoids are co-cultured with T cells modified with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR T cells) to assess the cytotoxic potential. CAR-T cell therapy has been demonstrated to be efficacious against many hematological malignancies, however therapeutic application to treat solid cancers remains challenging. Our organoid-T cell co-culture assay offers a good platform to study the response of tumour organoids on the CAR T cells and will greatly contribute to our understanding of the critical factors that determine a successful CAR T cell therapy. In collaboration with GSK, HUB tested the cytotoxicity of GSK CAR T cells which target specific target antigen on human colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids. Six HUB CRC organoid models were selected based on differential expression levels of target antigen that was confirmed by FACS antibody staining. To evaluate GSK CAR T cell mediated organoid killing, caspase 3\/7 expression was monitored at various timepoints and IFN&#947; secretion was measured by ELISA. For control, staurosporine and nonspecific-CAR T cells were included. Detected CRC-organoid killing demonstrated to be in line with antigen expression levels, indicating the specificity of the tested CAR T cells. Nevertheless, some CRC-organoid models demonstrated more resilient to CAR T cell mediated killing and further evaluation revealed upregulation of check point molecules such as PD-L1. This study reveals that tumour organoid-T cell co-culture assay hold value for preclinical development of CAR T-cell products and for evaluating tumour-evasion strategies. Moreover, this platform could potentially predict patient specific responses to CAR- T-cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Organoids,co-culture assay,cytotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Soura Mardpour<sup>1<\/sup>, Mirella Georgouli<sup>2<\/sup>, Ana Pereira Puri<sup>2<\/sup>, Ravit Oren<sup>2<\/sup>, Joshua Audu-Evans<sup>2<\/sup>, Farzin Pourfarzad<sup>1<\/sup>, Sara Brett<sup>2<\/sup>, Pleun Hombrink<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sylvia  F.

To interrogate the molecular determinants of ultra-long CAR T persistence, we sequenced one million pre-infusion CAR T cells from 82 pediatric ALL patients and 6 healthy donors and obtained high quality multi-omics data from ~700k single cells at the basal level or upon antigen specific stimulation. We identified that elevated type-2 functionality in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets was associated with five patients maintaining a median B-cell aplasia duration of 8.4 years (BCA-L group), which was independently validated using both intracellular flow cytometry and multiplexed secretomic assay. Further network analysis revealed several pathways promoting the activation of the Th2 master regulator GATA3 in BCA-L cells. Through ligand-receptor interaction analysis, type-2 cytokines were found to regulate a specific cluster of Tim-3+ terminal effector cells showing overactivation of cytotoxicity, impaired immune function, elevated exhaustion signature and diminished proliferative potentiality, and CAR T cells from BCA-L patients showed reduced dysfunctional hallmarks. In addition, activated BCA-L cells maintained a significantly higher level of oxidative phosphorylation metabolism that is likely associated with their observed central memory phenotype, whereas CAR T cells from patients who developed primary resistance or relapse exhibited imbalanced functional and metabolic programs. Specifically, CAR T products from initial non-responders showed hyperactive glycolysis metabolism, and the CD19-negative relapsed patients (RL- group) had significantly attenuated gene module expression of a broad spectrum of metabolic categories, including major energy-producing metabolisms. By direct comparison with BCA-L cells, our analysis identified a strikingly impaired mTOR signaling in RL- CAR T cells, along with reduced proliferation activities and a systematic deficiency of pathways orchestrating immune response. Although the mechanism is still unclear, our hypothesis is that the impaired mTOR signaling could only endow blunted functional and metabolic response in RL- cells, thereby conferring more opportunities to leukemic cells to escape the attack. In summary, our large-scale single-cell multi-omics dataset provides valuable insights for dissecting mechanistic basis of CAR T cell longevity in mediating 8-year leukemia remission, highlighting several therapeutic strategies to edit specific CAR T functionality to ameliorate clinical outcome, particularly boosting the type-2 immunity to mitigate dysfunction thereby extending persistence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Single cell,Metabolism,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhiliang Bai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, J.

Even so, the 5-year survival rate for high risk patients remains 50%, warranting novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Given their MHC-independent cytotoxic activity towards transformed cells, &#947;&#948; T cells are attractive tools for adoptive cellular immunotherapy. &#947;&#948; T cell cytotoxicity is mediated through the expression of various activating receptors that contribute to multiple mechanisms of anti-tumor activity. Specifically, their expression of the &#947;&#948;-TCR works in concert with tumor expression of members of the butyrophilin-3 (BTN3A) subfamily for cytotoxicity in response to phosphoantigens (pAg). In other cancers, stimulation of pAg production through zoledronate (ZOL) supplementation promotes &#947;&#948; T cell recognition\/killing. We have identified that &#947;&#948; T cells are differentially cytotoxic towards NB cell lines, suggesting variations in expression of key players responsible for &#947;&#948; T cell susceptibility. This work serves to understand the significance of BTN3A members in NB, and their impact on the susceptibility of NB to &#947;&#948;-TCR mediated killing.<br \/>It is hypothesized that the pAg-mediated response can be augmented by increasing intracellular pAg via use of ZOL or by manipulating BTN3A members. To test this, NB cells were pre-treated with either vehicle or ZOL for 24 hours and then co-incubated with expanded &#947;&#948; T cells for 4 hours at various effector:target (E:T) ratios. Apoptotic death was then determined for NB cells using Annexin-V\/7-AAD staining. Across 8 tested NB cell lines, Kelly, NB-1643, NGP, SK-N-AS, SH-SY5Y, NLF, and SMS-SAN cells were resistant to &#947;&#948; T cells at a 10:1 E:T ratio when untreated with ZOL. IMR-5 demonstrated 12-18% lysis at a 5:1 E:T. When NB cells were pre-treated with ZOL, &#947;&#948; T cell cytotoxicity was enhanced towards all models except SK-N-AS. We identified three NB cell lines with differential susceptibility to &#947;&#948; T cell killing, SK-N-AS&#60;NLF&#60;IMR5. Using a high-risk NB gene expression dataset, expression of important BTN members was queried, revealing IMR5 to have BT3.2low expression, NLF to have BT3.2mod expression, and SK-N-AS to have BT3.2high expression. BT3.2 expression levels was confirmed via western blotting. It has been postulated that BT3.2 may be a decoy receptor that interacts with &#947;&#948; T cells without intracellular signaling, given it lacks the intracellular pAg sensor. Due to its high expression in SK-N-AS, a lentiviral system was used to knockdown BT3.2. SK-N-A-S shBT3.2 models had 48-55% lysis at a 5:1 E:T when untreated and 65-72% lysis when pre-treated with ZOL.<br \/>In summary, the anti-NB &#947;&#948; T cell response can be augmented with ZOL pre-treatment. Additionally, the expression of BT3.2 may be responsible for differential sensitivity of NB cell lines to &#947;&#948; T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Adoptive cell therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Andrew Ho<sup><\/sup>, <b>Hunter  C.

NSG mice were inoculated subcutaneously with firefly luciferase-expressing MKN-45 cells (1 &#215; 10<sup>6 <\/sup>per mouse) and treated 5 days later with 10 &#215; 10<sup>6 <\/sup>SSTR2-expressing CAR-T or non-transduced T cells. Tumor growth and CAR T cell expansion were monitored near synchronously by bioluminescence and PET-CT imaging, respectively. Resistant or relapsing tumors were harvested and MACS sorted into human CD45+ tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) and CD45-depleted tumor cells. CAR T cell products and MKN-45 tumor cell line prior to injection were included in single cell analysis for comparison.<br \/>Results: TCR clonal analysis supports that CAR T cells in resistant tumors are proliferative and clonally expanded, which finding is corroborated by whole-body CAR T cell imaging. Highly expanded clones were observed within the CD4+ CAR T cell compartment, especially within the regulatory T (T<sub>reg<\/sub>) cell cluster. CD8+ CAR T cells underwent less clonal expansion with most clones found within the exhausted cells (LAG3, PDCD1, and TIGIT, LAYN and SOX4), whereas non-transduced control CD8+ T cells did not express high levels of exhaustion associated genes. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis between TILs and pre-infusion CAR T cells showed increased expression of LAYN, CXCL13, LMNA, and DUSP4 in TILs. The most upregulated DUSP4 was previously found to be overexpressed in T<sub>reg <\/sub>and aged T cells, and the DUSP4 induction is linked to a defective adaptive immune response. In addition, we observed the loss of cell-surface CAR in TILs, likely from chronic exposure to antigens in resistant tumors. Furthermore, DGE analysis reveals that under CAR T cell treatment MKN-45 tumors upregulated interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27), TNFRSF14 and a group of pathways related to metabolic activity and antigen processing and presentation, implying the evolution of tumor cells to resist T cell killing.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings highlight the complex tumor-T cell interplay as tumor evades CAR T cell killing. Tumor resistance is associated with CAR T cell transition from cytotoxic to dysfunctional phenotypes, the suppression of expanded T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells, and the acquisition of resistant features by tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Tumor resistance,Single cell multiomics,PET imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yanping Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Raymond Louie<sup>2<\/sup>, Janusz Puc<sup>3<\/sup>, Yogindra Vedvyas<sup>1<\/sup>, Yago Alcaina<sup>1<\/sup>, Irene  M.

Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of immune cells that display properties of both T cells and natural killer cells and bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses upon antigen recognition. Unlike conventional &#61699;&#946; T cells, iNKT cells express an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) that recognize glycolipids presented in the context of the monomorphic, MHC-class I related molecule, CD1d. iNKT cells are ideal cell types for allogeneic, off the shelf approach as they can target cancers without the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), circumventing the need to delete or knock out the endogenous TCR. Here, we report the engineering of &#8216;off-the-shelf&#8217; iNKT cells directed against CD19 and their robust in vitro and in vivo functional profile. Briefly, peripheral blood derived iNKT cells were isolated from healthy donors and were engineered to express a CD19 CAR using a 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation lentiviral vector. To demonstrate the CAR-dependent and independent anti-tumor activity, CAR19-iNKT cells were compared in vitro against non-transduced (NT) iNKT cells in cytotoxicity assays and intracellular cytokine staining assays. Allogeneic CAR19-iNKT cells upregulated activation markers, secreted cytokines, and lysed cancer cell lines and primary tumor cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and marginal zone lymphoma patients in an antigen-specific manner. Excellent post thaw recovery and viability was noted in cryopreserved CAR19-iNKT cells. Finally, the anti-tumor activity of cryopreserved CAR19-iNKT cells were evaluated in an established aggressive NSG mice model of SEM-luc, a B cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line expressing luciferase<i>. <\/i>Robust antitumor activity by CAR19-iNKT cells was observed without any obvious adverse effects compared to controls (untreated and NT iNKT cells). The persistence of CAR19-iNKT cells in this model is currently being evaluated. These data demonstrate a unique, off the shelf CAR19-iNKT cell platform for targeting hematological malignancies that combines the specificity of CD19 targeting CAR with the innate features of iNKT cells. The data indicates that iNKT cells are a potent cell type for generating allogeneic off the shelf products for treating a broad spectrum of hematological malignancies and solid tumors by targeting different receptors on the respective tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD19,CAR19-iNKT cells,Allogeneic cell therapy,Lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kanagaraju Ponnusamy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Janani Kanagaraju<sup>1<\/sup>, Yingxin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Bryan Lye,<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongwei Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Sandhya Buchanan<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael  J.

However, these responses are often not durable, and a significant proportion of patients do not respond to therapy at all. Therefore, there is a significant need to understand the factors driving success or failure of these therapeutics.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed the functional single-cell and bulk cytokinetic secretome profiles of TCR-T products infused into 26 patients (MART-1 n = 13, NY-ESO-1 n = 13) under associated TCR-T cell clinical trials at UCLA (NCT00910650, NCT02070406, NCT01697527, NCT03240861) using the IsoPlexis proteomic barcode chip platform. TCR-T cells were separated into CD4 and CD8 compartments and stimulated with their cognate antigen presented by transgenic HLA-A:02:01 K562 cells <i>in vitro<\/i> at an effector:target ratio of 1:1. Stimulated cells were loaded into IsoCode chips for single-cell polyfunctionality analysis while culture media supernatants from the antigen-specific stimulation were loaded into CodePlex chips for bulk analysis. All chips were automatically processed using an IsoSpark machine and analyzed using IsoSpeak software. Patients&#8217; baseline preinfusion serum cytokine levels were analyzed via Luminex Immunoassay.<br \/>Results: Single-cell secretome analysis showed that polyfunctional CD4 TCR-T cells producing TNF-a and IL-17A were significantly associated with improved progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively (p = 0.036; p = 0.014). Polyfunctional CD8 TCR-T cells producing TNF-a and MIP-1a were significantly lower in patients with progressive disease at end-of-study compared to patients without progressive disease (p = 0.0498; p = 0.0468). Bulk secretome analysis demonstrated that aggregate CD4 production levels of IL-4 and IL-5 were both significantly lower in clinical responders compared to non-responders (286.9 vs 1088.5 pg\/mL, p = 0.0073; 811.8 vs 1957.9 pg\/mL, p = 0.034). Preinfusion patient serum IL-15 levels examined by Luminex were significantly greater in clinical responders compared to non-responders (19.65 vs 4.74 pg\/mL p = 0.0122).<br \/>Conclusions: In clinical samples of preinfusion TCR-T cells targeting MART-1 and NY-ESO-1, polyfunctional CD4 TCR-T cells producing TNF-a and IL-17A, CD8 TCR-T cells producing TNF-a and MIP-1a, as well as preinfusion serum IL-15 levels, are significantly correlated with improved clinical outcomes in TCR-T cell therapy targeting MART-1 and NY-ESO-1. Furthermore, aggregate TCR-T cell production of the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 were significantly associated with non-response to therapy. These results have important implications for the design of future generations of transgenic cellular therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Cole  W.
