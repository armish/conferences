Positive age acceleration&#8212;when biological age is older than chronological age&#8212;is associated with higher risk of age-associated diseases. Recent adjuvant therapy is reported to increase age acceleration, but the longer-term effects of a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment on age acceleration remain unknown. Here, we use blood samples collected at two timepoints to examine changes in age acceleration over time comparing women who did and did not develop breast cancer. Paired whole blood samples were drawn an average of 8 years apart (range: 5-11 years) in a sample of non-Hispanic White and Black (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) women. DNAm was profiled using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips. Approximately half the women were diagnosed and treated for breast cancer between blood draws (cases; n= 190, baseline mean age= 57) whereas the other half remained breast cancer-free (controls; n= 227, baseline mean age= 56). Longitudinal changes in three age acceleration metrics were compared to determine whether an intervening breast cancer diagnosis and treatment was associated with trajectories in biological aging. On average, the cases were diagnosed with breast cancer 3.5 years after the initial blood draw and 4 years before the second blood draw. Among the cases, 36% were treated with chemotherapy, 65% with radiation therapy, and 70% with hormonal therapies; 45% of the cases received two types of therapy, and 13% received all three. Compared to women who remained cancer-free, women diagnosed and treated for breast cancer had increases in age acceleration over time as measured by PhenoAgeAccel (adjusted standardized mean difference (&#946;)= 0.13, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.26), GrimAgeAccel (&#946;= 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.24), and DunedinPACE (&#946;= 0.35, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.48). The associations did not vary by timing of diagnosis between the blood draws or race; however, women diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER) negative tumors appeared to experience faster increases in age acceleration than women diagnosed with ER positive tumors (GrimAgeAccel; ER negative &#946;= 0.27, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.47; ER positive &#946;= 0.10, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.21; P-interaction= 0.14). To investigate the impact of different types of breast cancer therapies, associations were examined using a case-only design. In models that simultaneously included chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy, radiation therapy had the strongest associations with accelerated biological aging as measured by PhenoAgeAccel (&#946;= 0.38, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.58), GrimAgeAccel (&#946;= 0.27, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.45), and DunedinPACE (&#946;= 0.25, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.47). We find that years after the initial diagnosis, breast cancer survivors have significantly accelerated biological aging; treatment modalities may differentially influence these rates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Epidemiology,Breast cancer,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jacob K.

However, recent clinical trials showed a lack of protective effect, though length of intervention (18 months to 4.7 years) and follow-up (20 months to 4.7 years) were limited. We sought to examine the association between post-diagnostic aspirin use (frequency, dose, and duration), timing and age of initiation on breast cancer-specific mortality. Our study included 10,493 women diagnosed with stage I, II, or III invasive breast cancer. Participants were enrolled in the large, prospective Nurses&#8217; Health Study (NHS) and NHSII in 1980 and 1989 prior to diagnosis and followed up through June 1, 2017. We collected information on frequency, dose and duration of aspirin use. Regular aspirin use was defined as using aspirin (standard- and low-dose) &#8805;2 days per week, and non-regular aspirin users were those who reported use of aspirin &#60;2 days per week. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer-specific mortality. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there were 2,506 total deaths and 1,221 breast cancer-specific deaths among 10,493 stage I to III breast cancer patients over 32 years of follow-up. In multivariable models, regular use of aspirin (n=3,523; 34%) was associated with a 38% lower risk of death from breast cancer compared with non-regular users (including nonusers) (HR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.54-0.71). The association was independent of pre-diagnostic aspirin use. Associations between aspirin use and breast cancer-specific mortality were stronger with longer time since diagnosis (HRs for &#60;5 years since diagnosis: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59-0.90), 5-&#60;10 years: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.49-0.80), and &#8805;10 years: 0.53 (95% CI: 0.41-0.69)). The relations between aspirin use and breast cancer survival were similar across categories of dose (compared to non-users, HRs for 0.5-5 tablets per week: 0.59 (95% CI: 0.51-0.68); &#8805;6 tablets per week: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.48-0.74)) and appeared stronger with longer duration (compared to non-users, HRs for &#60;5 years: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.10); &#8805;5 years: 0.61 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.72)). For women who initiated regular aspirin use after age 70, regular aspirin use was associated with worse survival (HR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.16-2.63); on the other hand, initiation of regular aspirin use at age &#8804;60 (HR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.95) or 60-&#8804;70 (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.50-0.95) was associated with improved survival (p-interaction=0.02). Regular aspirin use after diagnosis of nonmetastatic breast cancer was associated with improved long-term survival over 32 years. Although the associations between post-diagnostic regular aspirin use and improved survival did not differ by BMI, smoking or tumor characteristics, women who initiated regular aspirin use &#62;70 years of age had increased risk of death due to breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-24 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survival,Aspirin,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cheng Peng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle D.

Although cancer is the most common disease-related cause of death in this age group world-wide, the highly favorable overall 5-year survival rate for AYA cancer patients&nbsp;is creating a large and growing segment of the cancer survivorship population. Young cancer survivors have rates of comorbidities, frailty, and other phenotypes that are in line with that of individuals decades older, suggesting that cancer and\/or treatment exposures accelerate the aging process in these survivors. Cardiotoxicity due to anthracycline and\/or radiation exposure is a major contributor to poor cardiovascular health in AYA cancer survivors, yet the presence and the potential impact of accelerated cardiac aging remains unclear. We hypothesized that hearts in AYA cancer patients exposed to cardiotoxic treatment modalities have a functional phenotype that mirrors heart function in non-treatment exposed individuals who are decades older. In this cross-sectional study, 424 echocardiograms from 127 AYA Hodgkin lymphoma (N=98) and sarcoma (N=29) survivors who were treated with anthracyclines and\/or radiation were reviewed for eight functional measures (left ventricular ejection fraction, A-wave, E-wave, E\/A ratio, E&#8217;-wave, posterior wall thickness, mitral deceleration time, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension). The median anthracycline dose received for the population was 291.0 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (SD: 133.7) and 44.9% were exposed to radiation to the chest. At last follow-up, 8.3% were taking cardiac medications and 15.8% had been diagnosed with a cardiovascular disease during an average follow-up period of 5.6 years. Echocardiograms were obtained on average 1.3 years post-diagnosis (range: 0-14) and were grouped based at AYA survivor age at procedure (20-29 years, 30-39 years, and 40-49 years). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and E&#8217;-wave were significantly lower than controls in all three age groups (P&#60;0.001), with four other measures being significant in both of the two younger age groups (P&#60;0.05). Strikingly, 90% of the population had more than one functional measure that was indicative of hearts at least two decades older than the patient at time of echocardiogram with AYA survivors having an average of 4.2 measures displaying evidence of accelerated cardiac aging. These results suggest that AYA cancer survivors exposed to cardiotoxic treatment modalities have a high burden of poor cardiac function and that accelerated cardiac aging may responsible.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-24 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cardiotoxicity,Aging,Late effects of treatment,Survivorship,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michelle A.

It is also unclear whether CRCs diagnosed at or shortly after age 50 are similar to early-onset CRC. We hypothesized that tumor molecular, immune, and microbial characteristics in CRC tissue might show differential heterogeneity patterns between three age groups (&#60;50 \"early-onset\", 50-54 \"intermediate-onset\", &#8805;55 \"later-onset\").<br \/>Methods: We examined 3,395 CRC cases with available tissue data, including 660 early-onset and 243 intermediate-onset cases in the Nurses' Health Study, Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and Ontario Familial Colon Cancer Registry. We profiled the <i>in situ<\/i> T-cell landscape of 959 cases using digital imaging, machine learning, and a customized 9-plex multiplexed immunofluoresence panel with antibodies directed against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CD45RO, FOXP3, and MKI67 (Ki-67). Using chi-squared test or Spearman&#8217;s correlation test, we assessed differences in tumor characteristics including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), <i>KRAS<\/i>, and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations, LINE-1 methylation levels, <i>pks<sup>+<\/sup> E. coli<\/i> and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum<\/i> positivity, histopathologic lymphocytic reaction, and T-cell densities between early-onset, intermediate-onset, and later-onset cases.<br \/>Results: Compared to later-onset CRC (21%), early-onset (4.8%) and intermediate-onset CRCs (5.1%) exhibited a lower prevalence of CIMP-high status (P&#60;0.001). The mean tumor LINE-1 methylation level increased with increasing age [59 (SD, 12) in early-onset, 61 (SD, 10) in intermediate-onset, and 64 (SD, 9.8) in later-onset CRC (P&#60;0.001)]. Early-onset CRC (4.1%) had fewer <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations than intermediate-onset (10.4%) and later-onset CRC (15%) (P&#60;0.001). Compared to later-onset CRC, early-onset CRC tended to show lower levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P=0.013), and intratumoral periglandular reaction (P=0.025). Compared to later-onset CRC, early-onset CRC had a lower density of memory (both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup>) T-cells (median 21 vs. 48 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>; P=0.002) and a higher density of MKI67<sup>+ <\/sup>immune cells (median 50 vs. 19 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>; P=0.003) in tumor epithelial areas but not in the surrounding stroma. No significant differences in other tested characteristics were identified.<br \/>Conclusions: Compared to later-onset CRC, early-onset and intermediate-onset CRCs tended to have aggressive tumor phenotypes such as LINE-1 hypomethylation, lower lymphocytic immune reaction, and a higher density of MKI67<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells.

Epidemiological studies indicate a strong dependence of the subsequent primary on the characteristics of the first primary. For example, there is evidence that individuals with a first primary breast cancer is more likely to develop a second primary lung cancer. These observations highlight the need to develop a statistical model that characterizes age-to-onset of cancers beyond the first primary, while accounting for the complex relationships between the cancer occurrences. Such a modeling framework was previously lacking. We hereby propose a Bayesian semiparametric framework, where the occurrences of each cancer type follow a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The time-varying intensity of this process is conditioned on genetic and demographic covariates, such as status of genetic mutation and sex, as well as on a patient&#8217;s cancer history, such as type and timing of the first primary, thus allowing our model to capture the heterogeneity in cancer risks across individuals. Since our model requires a dataset that is enriched with MPC cases, we utilize data collected from families affected with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), which is a genetic disorder characterized by germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene<i> TP53<\/i>. People with LFS are at higher risks of certain cancer types, and many cancer survivors develop additional primary malignancy. We train and cross-validate our model on a patient cohort selected according to clinical LFS criteria at MD Anderson Cancer Center from year 2000 to 2015. The cohort consists of 11,186 individuals across 429 families, out of which 2,286 were diagnosed with at least one primary cancer and 335 were tested positive for germline mutations in <i>TP53<\/i>. Upon model training, we construct cancer-specific penetrance curves for the second primary cancer, which vary considerably among patients with different covariates and cancer history, thus highlighting the utility of our model for personalized risk prediction. Our penetrance estimates display good performance when being used to make cancer-specific predictions of the second primary among cancer survivors, achieving AUCs (Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves) of 0.91, 0.76 and 0.68 respectively for sarcoma, breast cancer, and all other cancers combined. While we apply our model to an LFS dataset, the statistical framework is general, and can be tailored to analyze any time-to-event datasets with suitably selected sets of covariates. Future applications include population-based characterization of specific cancer type combinations over time to impact public health policy making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-23 Statistical and epidemiological methodology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TP53,Risk prediction,Age-at-onset penetrance,Cancer survivor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nam  H.

We hypothesize that different tumor foci may harbor distinct driver molecular aberrations, making it a more complex disease and difficult to manage. To avoid overlooking smaller tumor foci with clinical and biological significance, we used an innovative approach to understand the genetic underpinnings of each tumor foci based on the molecular analysis of whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens rather than a systematic sampling of dominant nodules alone. Our study aimed to identify distinct molecular subsets of prostate cancer, if any, and correlate them with clinical outcomes in Caucasians (CA) and African Americans (AA).<br \/>Method: We randomly selected 834 whole-mount radical prostatectomy tissues including 463 (56%) CA and 371 (44%) AA. We used combined dual immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ERG and SPINK1 and dual RNA in-situ hybridization (ISH) for ETV1 and ETV4. The racial disparity in aberrant oncogene expression was analyzed by the Chi-squared test. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients with distinct molecular subsets of prostate cancer was examined by the Kaplan-Meier method and cox-ph models. The Gleason&#8217;s grades of prostate biopsies were summarized by spaghetti plot and compared by linear mixed models.<br \/>Results: Patients with localized prostate cancer expressing none, one, two, and three of four oncogenes were 16.4%, 58.4%, 21.7%, and 3.5%, respectively. The expression of ERG and SPINK1 was negatively correlated (odds ratio (OR)=0.38, 95% CI 0.29-0.51, p&#60;.001). Compared with CA, AA had a lower incidence of ERG (38.8% vs 60.3%), a higher incidence of SPINK1 (63.3% vs 35.6%), and similar incidences of ETV1 (9.4% vs 9.3%) and ETV4 (4.6% vs 3.9%). Importantly, ETV1 expression was associated with a worse RFS in CAs (hazard ratio (HR)=2.49, 95% CI 1.15-5.38, p=.02). ETV4 expression was associated with a worse RFS in AA (HR=3.11, 95% CI 1.32-8.04, p=.01). In addition, ETV4 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis in AA (OR=4.0, 95% CI 1.06-12.44, p=.02) but not in CA (OR=0.56, 95% CI 0.03-2.85, p=.57). For those who had multiple biopsies before radical prostatectomy, Gleason&#8217;s grade increased with time in AA (0.23 per year, p&#60;.001) but was unchanged in CA. ERG expression was associated with a lower Gleason grade (-0.20, p=.03). ETV4 was associated with a higher Gleason grade (0.50, p=.02).<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings showed the molecular heterogeneity between CA and AA who had localized prostate cancer, and supported ETV1 and ETV4 as prognostic markers that can be incorporated into clinical practice to better predict prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy in CA and AA, respectively.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,African American,Prognostic markers,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wei Zhao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pin Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Shannon Carskadon<sup>1<\/sup>, Craig Rogers<sup>1<\/sup>, James Peabody<sup>1<\/sup>, Mani Menon<sup>2<\/sup>, Dhananjay Chitale<sup>1<\/sup>, Sean Williamson<sup>3<\/sup>, Nilesh Gupta<sup>1<\/sup>, Nallasivam Palanisamy<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>Mount Sinai Health System, New York City, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bcabe054-58f2-4b14-b614-91e996e15b0f","ControlNumber":"4008","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

Human Papillomavirus-related second cancers (HPV-SMN) are generally preventable through screenings and vaccination. We identified disparities in HPV-SMN among AYA survivors by demographics and first cancer therapy, and examined temporal trends in incidence of HPV-SMN.<br \/>Methods: We identified diagnoses of any HPV-SMN, oropharyngeal-SMN, and cervical-SMN among AYA survivors in the SEER 9 1976-2015 registries starting two months after the first cancer. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) compared risk between AYA survivors and general population. We used Fine and Gray competing risk models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of therapy on risk for HPV-SMN while controlling for cancer site and demographic confounders. Age-period-cohort (APC) models identified temporal trends in HPV-SMN incidence.<br \/>Results: Of 374,408 survivors diagnosed with a first primary cancer ages 15-44, a total of 1,369 had an HPV-SMN occurring on average five years after the first cancer. Compared to the general population, AYA survivors had increased risks of 70% for any HPV-SMN (95%CI=1.61-1.79) and 117% for oropharyngeal-SMN (95%CI=2.00-2.35). Cervical-SMN risk was generally lower in survivors (SIR=0.85, 95%=CI 0.76-0.95). Hispanic AYA survivors had a significant increase in cervical-SMN relative to the general population (SIR=1.46, 95%CI=1.01-2.06). AYAs who were uninsured or on Medicaid at diagnosis had significant increases in HPV-SMN risk relative to the general populations (Uninsured SIR=5.23, 95%CI=2.26-10.31; Medicaid SIR=5.95, 95%CI=4.07-8.40). AYAs first diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma, leukemia, Hodgkin, and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma had increased risk for HPV-SMN relative to the general population. Among survivors with HPV-related first primary cancers, radiation was associated with increased risk for HPV-SMN (HR=1.35, 95%CI-1.03-1.77). Among survivors whose first primary cancer was not HPV-related, chemotherapy was associated with increased risk for HPV-SMN (HR=1.20, 95%CI=1.00-1.44) but the general effect of treatment was not significant (p=0.16). In APC models, incidence of oropharyngeal-SMN significantly declined over time.<br \/>Conclusion and Impact: While the overall risk is low, AYA survivors are at higher risk for HPV-SMNs than the general population, largely driven by oropharyngeal-SMN. Hispanic survivors are the only group at higher risk for cervical-SMN than the general population suggesting a need to improve their cervical cancer screening. Uninsured\/Medicaid AYA survivors also face higher HPV-SMN risks. Improving access to screening and HPV vaccination is needed to reduce the burden of HPV-SMN in AYA survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-24 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Screening,Susceptibility,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Judy  Y.
