This talk considers how insights into the biology of mutants in normal tissues can inform our understanding of the earliest stages of carcinogenesis. The esophagus becomes a patchwork of mutant clones. As they expand, these clones compete for the limited space available, resulting in selection of the fittest mutant genes. The ability to out compete other mutants in normal tissue does not correlate with carcinogenic potential. For example, <i>NOTCH1<\/i> mutant clones colonize most of the esophagus by middle age but <i>NOTCH1<\/i> mutations are comparatively rare in squamous cancers. In mouse models<i> Notch<\/i> pathway mutant clones eliminate microscopic intraepithelial neoplasms and loss of<i> Notch1<\/i> markedly slows esophageal tumor growth. In contrast, mutant <i>TP53<\/i> is less effective than <i>NOTCH1<\/i> at driving clonal expansion but is found in almost all human squamous esophageal cancers and contributes to carcinogenesis in mice.<br \/>The normal tissue mutational landscape of the esophagus is shaped by environmental factors. For example, body metabolism alters the behavior of mutant <i>PIK3CA<\/i> which drives clonal expansions in the esophagus of overweight humans and mice. The mutation causes cells to switch their metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, giving the mutants a proliferative advantage. One way to reduce the competitive advantage of mutants is to increase the fitness of the neighboring cells. Treating cells or mice with metformin, a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, induces aerobic glycolysis throughout the tissue. This eliminates the growth advantage of <i>Pik3ca<\/i> mutant clones, showing it may be possible to halt the expansion of oncogenic mutant populations.<br \/>Beyond the esophagus, these findings suggest the need to consider the relative prevalence of mutations in normal tissue and the corresponding cancer(s) before deciding if a mutant gene is a cancer driver or not. Variation in cancer risk between different human populations may depend on the proportion of pro- and anti-oncogenic mutants in normal tissue. Understanding how certain mutations can impede cancer development and how environmental factors alter selection of oncogenic mutants in normal tissue may guide new approaches to cancer prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,Cancer prevention,Squamous cell carcinoma,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Phil H.

Decades of cancer screening have preferentially diagnosed early, asymptomatic, indolent lesions. This trend will only increase as screening technologies become ever more sensitive, leading to an epidemic of overtreatment in completely asymptomatic individuals. The treatment of many of these conditions often has uncertain benefit on cancer mortality, while coming at the clear cost of treatment-related morbidity. Multi-omic testing plays a role in refining treatment recommendations based upon risk of progression. Genomic profiling of accurately annotated longitudinal case control datasets have provided insights into breast lesions termed &#8220;ductal carcinoma in situ&#8221; (DCIS), which are thought to be precursors to invasion and metastases. Both transcriptomics as well spatially resolved proteomic characterization of DCIS have uncovered novel biology of the epithelial cells that make up DCIS, as well as the heterogeneous precancer ecosystems which can be either permissive or inhibitory for invasion. Recent work has uncovered a clonal evolution pathway characterized by multiclonal invasion, and has helped to build risk stratification tools to refine treatment recommendations. In addition to molecular characterization, risk modeling may yield insights about which patients derive greatest benefit from intervention. For asymptomatic tumors at low risk of cancer progression, there may be little to no benefit to treatment, whereas for more high-risk lesions, progression to invasion and metastasis may be rapid and deadly. Given the lead-time between the development of precancer and progression to invasive disease, there may also be a case for tailoring intervention of screen detected cancer by age and the presence of competing comorbidities. The decision of whether and when to intervene for screen-detected cancers will require a multidisciplinary effort including expertise in cancer biology, mathematical modeling, psychology, health policy, decision science and communication, as well as thoughtful engagement from patients and health care providers to identify the optimal time to intervene along the cancer progression continuum.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DCIS,Gene expression profiling,Biomarkers,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>E.

As pancreatic cancer develops, it forms a complex microenvironment of multiple interacting cells. The microenvironment of advanced pancreatic cancer includes a dense composition of cells, such as macrophages and fibroblasts, that are associated with immunosuppression. New single-cell and spatial molecular profiling technologies enable unprecedented characterization of the cellular and molecular composition of the microenvironment. These technologies provide the potential to identify candidate therapeutics to intercept immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer. Inventing new mathematical approaches in computational biology are essential to uncover mechanistic insights from high-throughput data for these precision interception strategies. Here, we demonstrate how converging technology development, machine learning, and mathematical modeling can relate the pancreatic precancer microenvironment to carcinogenesis and therapeutic response. Combining genomics with mathematical modeling provides a forecast system that can yield computational predictions to anticipate when and how the cancer is progressing for therapeutic selection. This mathematical forecast system will empower a new predictive oncology paradigm, which selects therapeutics to intercept the pathways that would otherwise cause future cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Pancreatic cancer,Premalignancy,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elana Judith Fertig<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Increasing access and awareness of medical studies with an emphasis on populations who have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) has also shown to expand the reach of innovative and novel breakthrough therapies in early detection to improve cancer outcomes. To ensure that advances in early detection improve cancer health inequities for all, early engagement has been demonstrated to be critical. Early and ongoing engagement has been at the core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) All of Us Research Program. All of Us adheres to the community engagement principles of information-sharing, consultation, involvement and collaboration in decision-making, and empowered action in informal groups or through formal partnerships. Since its inception in 2015, the overarching goal of the All of Us community engagement strategy has been to create a program that reflects the needs, preferences, and priorities of individuals in the U.S. inclusive of UBR communities. As such, program participants and partners have been involved in all aspects of the program including governance, oversight, design, conduct, dissemination, and evaluation. All of Us has accomplished unprecedented advances in the inclusion of UBR populations by building the largest, most diverse biomedical resource of its kind: 80% of program participants are from UBR communities covering a broad range of age, social, racial, ethnic, cultural, geographical, and health statuses. Additionally, nearly 50% of participants self-identify as racial and ethnic minorities. This inclusion of diverse communities throughout the program moves us closer to achieving health equity in biomedical research and ensuring more precise care for all.<br \/><b>The Role of Early Community Engagement in Mitigating Cancer Disparities.<\/b> Our ability to have a diverse participant pool is due in large part to intentional and early community engagement efforts together with the creation of an ecosystem built to support community partners. Research shows that community engagement can help mitigate cancer health disparities by increasing communities&#8217; knowledge of the importance of healthy behaviors such as screening, awareness of research, building trust in research, and improving study design and ethics. All of this combined with groundbreaking progress in early cancer detection and available therapies has the potential to transform patient care. Immunotherapy and gene therapy, a better understanding of fertility preservation in cancer treatment, and how artificial intelligence (AI) models can predict patients&#8217; risks of breast cancer are only a few recent and transformative advances that are driving progress against cancer. While these and other advances are promising, many UBR communities have not benefited equally from this progress. Historical, systemic, and structural barriers, such as the digital divide and lack of access to and awareness of clinical trials, are preventing the achievement of equitable advances in precision medicine and cancer research. Early and intentional community engagement efforts must be put in place to ensure that these innovative advances reduce cancer disparities and improve cancer prevention and detection in medically underserved groups. For instance, we must consider the role that \"ZNA\" (zip code or neighborhood association) or \"place and space\" has on cancer. We know that ZNA can be just as important in the precision medicine and cancer journey as someone&#8217;s DNA. Research has not always been conducted in places where the populations reflect the diversity of the U.S. Most cancer oncology trials and cancer treatment centers may not be accessible to those that carry the greatest burden of disease, which leads to greater disparities. Similarly, researchers play an essential role in community engagement; studies have shown that being engaged by a research team that reflects the diversity of the population being studied leads to greater participation in research, better retention, and adherence to recommendations.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These are only a few reasons why engaging UBR communities in the early phases and throughout the duration of research studies is important to identify the right problems, formulate the appropriate questions, and build mutual trust and transparency. Redefining participants&#8217; roles not as &#8220;patients&#8221; or &#8220;subjects&#8221; but as true partners will improve health outcomes and better address health care for all, leading us to a future where precision engagement drives research along with rigorous science and where community engagement ensures equity and inclusion in precision medicine for all. <b><br \/>Objectives:<\/b> This presentation will (a) describe how early engagement can lead to mitigation of cancer disparities, (b) discuss best practices of early and intentional community engagement, (c) outline the All of Us engagement ecosystem, and (d) explore the future of engagement in building sustainable, cohesive, and equitable communities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-03 Community-engaged research\/community-based participatory research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Precision medicine,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Karriem S.
