[{"Abstract":"Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is prototypical of cancers with exceptional chemoresistance, and metastatic capabilities fueled by remarkable heterogeneity. The cell-extrinsic factors that govern SCLC heterogeneity are poorly understood especially since non-genetic mechanisms are thought to be major contributors to its intratumoral heterogeneity and plasticity. In order to answer the above question, we sought to inquire about the role of tumor microenvironment (TME) in SCLC heterogeneity which is challenged universally by a lack of patient-derived adequate tumor biopsies. Leveraging large tumor sampling performed at rapid autopsies done on 10 different patients who died from SCLC metastatic disease, we developed a multi-omics approach involving spatial transcriptomics (ST) (Whole transcriptomic atlas), bulk whole genome sequencing, and multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) and standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) to better characterize spatially proximate tumor (36 segments), TME (32 segments) and 4 normal segments. Genomically, SCLC characteristic alterations like TP53 (70%) and RB1 (80%) inactivation and MYC (50%)\/MYCL (80%) were evident. ST profiling reveals three distinct tumor subtypes corresponding to the known high-Neuroendocrine (NE) and low-NE SCLC subtypes as well as a novel hybrid-NE state with multiple elevated cancer hallmark capabilities and morphological evidence of nesting and budding. High-NE and hybrid-NE subtypes appear to be driven by ASCL1 and the low-NE subtype resembles the SCLC- inflamed subtype. ST profiling of proximate TMEs reveals similar heterogeneity that is closely linked with SCLC-NE heterogeneity at inter-patient and intra-tumoral levels with distinct features and cellular compositions. Specifically, low-NE TME is marked by increased pro and anti-tumor features including B cells, NK cells, M1-macrophages, and evidence of more checkpoint molecules. High-NE TMEs are predominated by a distinct absence of adaptive immune cells and a strong presence of M2 macrophages. Most strikingly the hybrid-NE TME shows a significant enrichment of immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts with the absence of T and other adaptive immune cells confirmed using IHC and IF. Next, we attempt to narrow down the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF) axis as one of the unique TME-driven factor(s) that could groom non-NE features in SCLC fueling their plasticity and heterogeneity. Subsequently using various SCLC cell lines, we demonstrate that in-vitro modulation of FGFR in SCLC may constrain their plasticity by downregulation of NOTCH signaling, MYC, and its downstream effector REST. We describe the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity of SCLC tumor and TME and demonstrate their interlinking as well as potential translational avenues of leveraging the cellular crosstalk in order to constrain SCLC heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stromal-epithelial interactions,Lung cancer: small cell,RNA-seq,Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Parth Anil Desai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nobuyuki Takahashi<sup>2<\/sup>, Yingying Cao<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Schultz<sup>1<\/sup>, Darryl Nousome<sup>1<\/sup>, Desiree Tillo<sup>1<\/sup>, Lakshya Chauhan<sup>3<\/sup>, Mayank tandon<sup>1<\/sup>, Rajesh kumar Bhardwaj<sup>1<\/sup>, Delphine Lissa<sup>1<\/sup>, Vinodh Rajapakse<sup>1<\/sup>, Suresh kumar<sup>1<\/sup>, Yang Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Elmeskini Rajaa<sup>1<\/sup>, Donna Butcher<sup>1<\/sup>, Linda Scuito<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingjing Gong<sup>4<\/sup>, Brett Schroder<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Warner<sup>1<\/sup>, Samantha Nichols<sup>1<\/sup>, Jordan Kimberly<sup>5<\/sup>, Alejandro Schaffer<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohit kumar Jolly<sup>3<\/sup>, Stephen Hewitt<sup>1<\/sup>, Anish Thomas<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Center Hospital, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>IISC, Bangalore, India,<sup>4<\/sup>Nanostring, Seattle, WA,<sup>5<\/sup>University of Colorado-Anschutz Campus, Boulder, CO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2a609130-0fcb-4ac7-a145-26776d4daebf","ControlNumber":"411","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

The expression of PD&#8209;L1 and PD&#8209;L2 on tumor cells (TCs) and tumor&#8209;infiltrating immune cells (ICs) was investigated with respect to M2 tumor&#8209;associated macrophages (TAMs), which are key components of the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Methods: We performed immunohistochemical studies to evaluate the M2 TAM distribution by CD163 staining, PD-L1 expression on TCs and ICs by the Ventana SP263 assay, and PD-L2 expression on TCs and ICs, using the Ventana BenchMark GX system, in 175 patients with resected NSCLC.<br \/>Results: M2 TAM density revealed high levels of variation among the 175 tumor tissues (mean &#177; standard deviation (SD), 382.5 &#177; 381.9 cells per mm<sup>2<\/sup>). The percentage of PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive TCs and PD-L1-positive ICs varied greatly among the 175 tumor tissues (mean &#177; SD; 15.6 &#177; 27.0% and 9.4 &#177; 10.9%, respectively). In addition, the percentage of PD&#8208;L2&#8208;positive TCs and PD-L2-positive ICs also ranged widely among the 175 tumor tissues (mean &#177; SD, 14.6 &#177; 22.9% and 12.5 &#177; 18.4%, respectively). M2 TAM density was significantly associated with the expression of PD&#8209;L1 on TCs and ICs (P &#60; 0.0001 and P &#60; 0.0001, respectively). M2 TAM density was also significantly associated with the expression of PD&#8209;L2 on TCs and ICs (P = 0.0452 and P = 0.0125, respectively). The percentage of PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive TCs was significantly correlated with the percentage of PD&#8208;L1&#8208;positive ICs (r = 0.396; P &#60; 0.0001). In addition, the percentage of PD&#8208;L2&#8208;positive TCs also was significantly correlated with the percentage of PD&#8208;L2&#8208;positive ICs (r = 0.488; P &#60; 0.0001). However, there was no correlation between the percentage of PD&#8209;L1&#8209;positive TCs and the percentage of PD&#8209;L2&#8209;positive TCs (r = 0.019; P = 0.8049). Meanwhile, tumor differentiation was significantly associated with PD&#8209;L1 expression on TCs and ICs (P = 0.0002 and P &#60; 0.0001, respectively). By contrast, tumor differentiation was inversely associated with PD&#8209;L2 expression on TCs and ICs (P = 0.0260 and P = 0.0326, respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on TCs and ICs was associated with M2 TAMs in NSCLC, although there was no correlation between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on TCs. The combined evaluation of PD&#8209;L1 and PD&#8209;L2 expression could be clinically important in the treatment strategy of immune&#8209;checkpoint inhibitors in patients with NSCLC. In particular, the evaluation of PD&#8209;L2 expression may be necessary for patients with PD&#8209;L1&#8209;negative NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,PD-L1,Tumor microenvironment,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryota Sumitomo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cheng-long Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Hiroshi Date<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Thoracic Surgery, Kyoto Univ.

Notably, despite widely reported significant differences between the immune system of males and females, there continues to exist a knowledge gap regarding sex disparities in anti-cancer immune responses. Recent meta-analyses indicate that immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment has higher efficacy in male patients compared to females, regardless of the cancer type. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these sex-specific differences we utilized the syngeneic colorectal cancer model MC38 because it mirrors the clinical situation yielding responding and non-responding mice. Therefore, we inoculated tumor cells subcutaneously (s.c.) into male and female mice, and treated them with either IgG2a control Ab or anti-PD1 Ab. When analyzing the tumor response to anti-PD1 treatment we observed significant sex-biased growth kinetics upon ICB favoring males. To asses a potential role of androgens in impacting observed sex differences to ICB response <i>in vivo<\/i>, we performed surgical androgen deprivation therapy (orchiectomy) in male mice, as well as sham-surgery in male and female mice as control. After a recovery period, we proceeded with s.c. cell injection and ICB treatment as previously described. Sham male mice showed a very high response rate to anti-PD1 (92%) compared to sham females (58%), but more importantly, testosterone suppression by surgical androgen deprivation therapy led to a lower response rate of castrated mice (71%). To further confirm whether the presence of testosterone was beneficial for ICB response, we implanted s.c. sham or testosterone pumps into male and female mice and proceeded as before. Males with sham pumps showed a very high response rate to anti-PD1 (90%) compared to females with sham pumps (50%), while testosterone supplementation in females led to enhanced response rate (85%). Overall, this demonstrated that regardless of biological sex, presence of testosterone is sufficient to positively impact ICB therapy outcome. Furthermore, immunophenotyping analysis by flow cytometry showed that females supplemented with testosterone and treated with anti-PD1 had significantly increased intratumoral stem-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup>TCF1<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells compared to sham females. Additionally, these findings also correlated with enhanced intratumoral terminal<sup> <\/sup>differentiated<sup> <\/sup>effector CD8<sup>+<\/sup>TCF1<sup>-<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in both sham males and females supplemented with testosterone, compared to sham females. In summary, androgens can modulate anti-cancer immune responses by contributing to a more sustained anti-tumor CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell response and consequently better responses upon treatment with anti-PD1. These findings are in concordance with male cancer patients responding better to ICB and warrant therapy escalation in female patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Androgen,Immuno-oncology,Sex difference,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>María Elena Vargas-Delgado<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lara Meier<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonas Waizenegger<sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Oberbauer<sup>2<\/sup>, Nikolaus Berenbrok<sup>1<\/sup>, Janik Engelmann<sup>3<\/sup>, Victoria Gensch<sup>1<\/sup>, Franziska Heilmann<sup>2<\/sup>, Jochim Reinert<sup>4<\/sup>, Kristoffer Riecken<sup>5<\/sup>, Boris Fehse<sup>5<\/sup>, Hannelore Lotter<sup>6<\/sup>, Dorothee Schwinge<sup>7<\/sup>, Christoph Schramm<sup>7<\/sup>, Hans-Willi Mittruecker<sup>8<\/sup>, Isabel Ben-Batalla*<sup>1<\/sup>, Sonja Loges* (*equal contribution)<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>DKFZ-Hector Cancer Institute, University Medical Center Mannheim; German Cancer Research Center; University Hospital Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University Heidelberg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>2) Division of Personalized Medical Oncology, 3) Department of Personalized Oncology, DKFZ-Hector Cancer Institute, University Medical Center Mannheim; German Cancer Research Center; University Hospital Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; DKFZ-Hector Cancer Institute, University Medical Center Mannheim, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Comprehensive Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>5<\/sup>Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Molecular Biology and Immunology, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"42e8c94f-e161-4280-8406-cf59bca0c63d","ControlNumber":"1531","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

However, how CD200 affects tumor microenvironment (TME) and host immunity is incompletely understood. In the present study, we evaluated the role of the CD200-CD200R pathway in TME using loss-of-function CD200R<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice, along with two clinically relevant, CD200-positive murine tumor models: the mouse neuroblastoma NB9464D and melanoma Yummer1.7. We found that comparing with the wild type mice, CD200R<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice were significantly more potent in rejecting these CD200<sup>+<\/sup> tumors. Transcriptome analysis by single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that tumors from CD200R<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice had more infiltration of CD45<sup>+ <\/sup>immune cells, including CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, and NK cells but less infiltration of neutrophils. Antibody depletion experiments revealed that immune effectors including CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and NK cells in combination, are crucial in inhibiting tumor growth in CD200R<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. Mechanistically, we found that CD200R signaling differentially regulates the expression of chemokines in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In the absence of CD200R, TAMs up-regulate CCL24 and CCL8 and down-regulate CXCL3, CXCL2, and CCL3 via activation of ERK and\/or p38 MAP kinases. Increased expression of CCL24 in CD200R-deficient tumors resulted in increased infiltration of eosinophils, which also contributes to anti-tumor activity. Overall, we conclude that CD200R-mediated signaling, via interaction with CD200 on tumor cells, contributes to unfavorable TME primarily through chemokine-dependent recruitment of immune suppressive neutrophils and exclusion of anti-cancer immune effectors. Our study has significant implications in developing CD200-targeted immunotherapy of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Tumor microenvironment,CD200,CD200R,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cho-Hao Lin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fatemeh Talebian<sup>1<\/sup>, Yang Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Jianmin Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Bolin Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Jin-Qing Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Sujit Basu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xueling Pan<sup>2<\/sup>, Xi Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Pearlly Yan<sup>2<\/sup>, William  E.

Peritoneal metastasis is the main cause of poor prognosis and decreased quality of life for patients with DGC. Histologically, DGC tumor lesions are associated with massive fibrotic stroma caused by the extensive proliferation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Peritoneally metastasized tumors of DGC are also accompanied by abundant fibrotic stroma and CAFs. CAFs are known to promote the progression of DGC by enhancing the growth, invasion, and dissemination of tumor cells. Previously, we reported that the direct heterocellular interaction between cancer cells and CAFs is necessary for the invasion and peritoneal metastasis of DGC. In this study, we aimed to identify and target the molecules that mediate such direct heterocellular interaction. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against intact DGC cells were generated and subjected to high-throughput screening to obtain mAbs that block the adhesion of DGC cells to CAFs. As a result, several such inhibitory mAbs were obtained. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry revealed that all mAbs recognized integrin &#945;5 complexed with integrin &#946;1. Blocking integrin &#945;5 in DGC cells abrogated the adhesion of DGC cells to CAFs. Similarly, blocking fibronectin, a ligand of integrin &#945;5&#946;1, deposited on CAFs blocked the heterocellular adhesion. Furthermore, administration of mAbs or knockout of integrin &#945;5 in DGC cells suppressed their invasion led by CAFs in vitro and peritoneal metastasis in a mouse xenograft model. Analysis of the public database revealed that integrin &#945;5 and fibronectin were highly expressed in DGC.

To gain a better understanding of the relationship between CAFs and the immune environment in head and neck cancer, we leveraged protein activity inference tools to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing of advanced-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients pre- and post-treatment with the &#945;PD-1 therapy, nivolumab. From this analysis, we identified a novel CAF population predictive of patient response to &#945;PD-1 therapy. Utilizing <i>in vitro <\/i>co-culture assays with primary human CD8 T cells, we discovered that this novel CAF population was able to elicit features associated with enhanced CD8 T cell function, namely the reduction of PD-1+TIM-3+ exhaustive phenotypes and induction of CD103+NKG2A+ tissue-resident memory phenotypes and cytotoxicity. Due to their unique ability to stimulate T cells in this manner, we termed this novel CAF population T cell-stimulating CAFs (tsCAFs). In efforts to elucidate the mechanism behind this pro-inflammatory function, we determined that tsCAFs secrete a heat-sensitive small molecule\/s in order to alter CD8 T cell behavior. However, tsCAFs will only secrete this factor in the presence of activated T cells demonstrating crosstalk between T cells and CAFs in the head and neck TME. This pro-inflammatory crosstalk between CAFs and T cells represents a novel finding that further contributes to the idea of immunoregulatory pleiotropy among CAFs. Accordingly, our findings highlight the functional importance of distinct CAF subsets in modulating the immunoregulatory milieu of human HNSCC and warrant more extensive characterization of CAF-T cell interactions in human squamous cell carcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,T cell,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Diana Graves<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aleksandar Obradovic<sup>2<\/sup>, Henry Schares<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Korrer<sup>3<\/sup>, Brian Bachmann<sup>1<\/sup>, Young Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Ben Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Paula Hurley<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN,<sup>2<\/sup>Columbia University, New York City, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Elephas Biosciences, Madison, WI,<sup>4<\/sup>Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Tarrytown, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e61eb417-8d67-47d4-a585-5ae581aba7b0","ControlNumber":"2066","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Mesothelial cells are the first point of contact with ovarian cancer cells during peritoneal spread. Peritoneal mesothelial cells also play an essential role in immune surveillance. However, the mechanism by which cancer and mesothelial cells within the tumor microenvironment coordinate growth and immune evasion remains poorly understood. To study the role of mesothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment, we have recently generated novel syngeneic mouse models of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, which were derived from Fallopian tube epithelium, and bear human-relevant mutational genotypes. Analysis of one such model (CCNE1 amplified) using single-cell transcriptomics in omental metastases revealed specific expression of the anti-Mullerian hormone type II receptor (Amhr2) in cancer-associated mesothelial cells, whereas normal omental mesothelium does not express Amhr2. Co-culture of cancer cells with normal omental mesothelial cells induces AMHR2 expression along with a pro-tumorigenic cancer-associated mesothelial cell phenotype. Overexpression of AMHR2 in a human immortalized mesothelial cell line significantly modulated the expression of genes involved in immune response pathways, remodeling of extra-cellular matrix, and secretion of growth factors by RNAseq and qPCR. Furthermore, we showed that anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (the ligand of AMHR2), is secreted by ovarian cancer cells and further downregulates the chemoattractant cytokines secreted by CAMCs, thus promoting immunosuppression within the tumor. Finally, implantation of ovarian cancer cells in syngeneic Amhr2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> hosts results in tumors that grow significantly slower than those implanted in wild-type hosts. Together these data suggest AMHR2 is a specific marker of CAMCs, whose expression is necessary for the reprogramming of mesothelial cells into CAMCs. The AMH-AMHR2 axis mediates paracrine signaling between cancer cells and CAMCs within the tumor microenvironment to promote tumor growth and immune evasion. These results suggest that AMHR2 could be a highly specific target to enhance immunotherapies in ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Mesothelium,Microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maeva Chauvin<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Massachusetts General Hospital \/ Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"44f34b38-2cd1-4cf8-b1fd-671bc05b31e5","ControlNumber":"1931","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Recently, we introduced oncostreams to refer to dynamic multicellular neuropathological structures that facilitate glioma cell growth and invasion into the normal brain. Moreover, we have shown that targeting Col1&#945;1 within gliomas eradicates oncostreams and prolongs median survival in two genetic murine models. However, the signaling that collagen utilizes to maintain the glioma tumor microenvironment is still unknown. Our RNA-seq data show that collagen receptor DDR1 is overexpressed in genetically engineered glioma mouse models (GEMMs) including NPA (NRAS\/shp53\/shATRX), NPD (NRAS\/shp53\/PDGF&#946;), and NPAI (NRAS\/shp53\/shATRX\/ IDH1<sup>R132H<\/sup>) compared to healthy mouse brain tissue. We discovered that pharmacological inhibition of DDR1 radio-sensitized gliomas <i>in vitro<\/i> and dismantled oncostreams <i>ex vivo, <\/i>imaged with time-lapse confocal microscopy<i>.<\/i> GEMMs of DDR1 knockdown (NRAS\/shp53\/shATRX\/shDDR1) using the Sleeping Beauty transposase system significantly increased median survival. This suggests that gliomas employ DDR1 mediated mechanisms to promote the immunosuppressive TME and thus stimulate tumor growth. Inhibition of DDR1 within gliomas enhanced intratumoral infiltration of CD45<sup>+<\/sup>, and CD3<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells at the tumor core and invasive tumor border and prolonged median survival in GEMMs of glioma. We postulate that glioma DDR1 blocks immune-surveillance by enhancing collagen fiber alignment, which we assessed using collagen-specific second-harmonic generation microscopy. In human datasets such as CGGA and TCGA, DDR1 expression negatively correlates with PTPRC (CD45) gene expression. Furthermore, our results show that DDR1 inhibition suppresses oncostream formation, impairs glioma cell proliferation (PCNA<sup>+<\/sup>) and remodeled the tumor microenvironment by lowering Iba1<sup>+<\/sup> glioma-associated microglia. We propose that DDR1 inhibition within glioma cells reprograms the TME to an immune-stimulatory state with enhanced radio-sensitivity.

FAP is highly expressed in the cancer stroma and is a predictor of poor survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For this reason, it is being explored as a potential drug target. FAP has broad proteolytic activity and can directly promote multiple aspects of tumor progression. The aim of this study was to develop a tool to non-invasively measure FAP activity and validate its potential as a non-invasive biomarker in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: An ELISA, named C3F, was developed to reflect proteolytic activity of FAP by quantifying FAP-mediated cleavage of type III collagen in serum. To confirm that C3F reflects proteolytic activity of FAP, type III collagen was assayed after incubation with and without FAP. C3F was measured in serum samples from healthy controls (n = 26) and patients with NSCLC: adenocarcinoma (AD) (n = 26) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 14). An ELISA quantifying matrix metalloprotease degraded type III collagen (C3M) was used for measuring the same serum samples and compared to C3F using spearman correlation test and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs).<br \/>Results: A C3F signal only appeared after FAP cleavage of type III collagen, supporting that C3F reflects FAP proteolytic activity. Compared to healthy controls, C3F was significantly elevated in serum from patients with SCC (p = 0.0004, AUROC = 0.86), but not AD (p = 0.21, AUROC = 0.66). C3F was also significantly elevated in SCC compared to AD (<i>p<\/i> = 0.030, AUROC = 0.77). In comparison, C3M was significantly elevated in serum from both SCC and AD compared to healthy controls (<i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.0001, AUROC = 0.93 and <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.0001, AUROC = 0.92, respectively), but no difference was seen between SSC and AD (<i>p <\/i>&#62; 0.99, AUROC = 0.56). Only a moderate correlation was seen between C3M and C3F (<i>r <\/i>= 0.58, <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: FAP activity can be non-invasively quantified in serum by assaying FAP cleaved type III collagen (C3F). C3F shows promise as a cancer biomarker in NSCLC with potential for discriminating between NSCLC subtypes. As C3F reflects FAP activity, it is potentially a more suitable (or complementary) biomarker for anti-FAP drug development and prediction of anti-FAP treatment response compared to methods that asses the presence of FAP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rasmus Sund Pedersen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jeppe Thorlacius-Ussing<sup><\/sup>, Nicholas Willumsen<sup><\/sup>, Morten A.

Pleural dissemination of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a condition in which cancer cells directly spread from the primary tumor site into the extrapulmonary thoracic cavity and colonize the pleura. However, not all free detached cancer cells can survive under anchorage-independent conditions in thoracic cavity, and some important factors are assumed to be involved in the formation of pleural dissemination. In this study, we investigated the role of CAFs in the formation of pleural dissemination in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Using in vitro co-culture models, conditioned medium, and in vivo xenograft models, we investigated CAF-induced phenotypic changes in lung cancer cell: proliferative ability, invasive ability, anchorage-independent growth ability, cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, and tumorigenicity in thoracic cavity. Next, we performed RNA sequencing analysis using 3D co-culture models of cancer cells and CAFs to explore a molecule that contributes to the formation of pleural dissemination, and then verified it using in vitro and in vivo mice models of pleural dissemination.<br \/>Results: Cancer cells showed enhanced migration, anchorage-independent growth, adhesion, and invasion ability by co-culture with CAFs. In 3D co-culture model of cancer cells and CAFs, even cancer cells which did not form spheroid by themselves acquired the ability of spheroid formation surrounding the CAF core, suggesting that the interactions with CAFs promote spheroid formation. Inoculation of cancer cells together with CAFs into mouse thoracic cavity developed pleural dissemination more efficiently than inoculation of cancer cells alone. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that co-culture with CAFs upregulated the expression of Cellular Communication Network Factor 1 (CCN1), a matricellular protein, in cancer cells. We then verified that ectopically CCN1-overexpressing lung cancer cell lines increased migration and adhesion ability in vitro, and tumorigenicity in thoracic cavity in mouse pleural dissemination model.<br \/>Conclusions: CAFs promote development of pleural dissemination via driving spheroid formation and upregulating CCN1 expression in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Lung cancer: non-small cell,3D cell culture,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Masayoshi Ohki<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Naoki Matsuda<sup><\/sup>, Ken Suzawa<sup><\/sup>, Tomohiro Habu<sup><\/sup>, Mao Yoshikawa<sup><\/sup>, Kazuma Iwata<sup><\/sup>, Yin Min Thu<sup><\/sup>, Kazuhiko Shien<sup><\/sup>, Hiromasa Yamamoto<sup><\/sup>, Shinichi Toyooka<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>General Thoracic Surgery and Breast and Endocrinological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f7c00cd5-7d56-4df5-8614-45a52ebda44e","ControlNumber":"3167","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

A discovery cohort (127 LPC patients) and two independent validation cohorts (406 LPC &#38; 126 LPC patients) were used for subtype identification. All three cohorts were subsequently used for subtype characterization and prognostic evaluation. Identified subtypes were characterized by evaluation of clinical characteristics, by gene set enrichment analysis, and by cell-type deconvolution analysis. Survival differences between subtypes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and univariate Cox regression analyses with biochemical recurrence (BCR) as endpoint. Lastly, a high-risk stromal subtype was investigated for its ability to improve risk stratification for intermediate risk prostate cancer using hazard ratio changes from univariate Cox regression analysis.<b> <\/b>We identified three stromal subtypes (S1-S3) in prostate cancer. Of these, subtype S3 showed characteristics of a highly reactive stromal environment with significantly (adj. p &#60; 0.05) decreased cell polarity and stroma related functions, significantly (adj. p &#60; 0.05) reduced fibroblast infiltration, and a significantly (adj. p &#60; 0.05) increased immune cells infiltration compared to the other subtypes. Survival analysis also revealed significant (p &#60; 0.05) association of S3 with BCR in all three cohorts (HR = 3.2, 2.1, and 3.4 in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 respectively). Lastly, S3 significantly (p &#60; 0.05) improved the risk prediction for patients with intermediate recurrence risk according to the clinical nomogram CAPRA-S (cohort 1, delta HR = 1.4; cohort 2, delta HR = 2.3; cohort 3, delta HR = 4.2). In conclusion, by focusing on the stromal alteration in prostate cancer, this study sheds new light on the influence of tumor microenvironment on LPC aggressiveness. A stromal subtype characterized by dysregulated stromal functions and changes in stroma and immune cells infiltration predicted adverse outcome in patients with a high prognostic ambiguity. This utilization of stromal information to improve risk assessment for clinically intermediate risk PC indicates a potential use in future evaluation of PC aggressiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer progression,Stromal-epithelial interactions,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Martin Rasmussen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jacob Fredsøe<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul  V.

Elements of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including fibroblasts and senescent cells, have been shown to contribute to tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and therapy resistance, and are therefore major contributors to disease progression. However, this has been complicated by accumulating evidence suggesting that the function of fibroblasts is heterogeneous, with normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) both promoting or suppressing tumorigenesis and drug sensitivity within different contexts. Moreover, although senescent fibroblasts have been shown to accelerate tumor growth and contribute to therapy resistance, whether phenotypic differences exist between different senescent fibroblasts remains poorly understood. It is clear that additional work must be done to unravel the precise mechanisms by which NFs, CAFs, and their senescent counterparts interact within the tumor microenvironment to modulate tumor cell growth and sensitivity to therapy. Here, we show different NF and CAF lines exert varying effects on AGS gastric cancer cells. We found that when AGS cells are co-cultured with IMR90 lung fibroblasts, they form fewer and smaller colonies (total colony area = 5.14E3 pixels^2) than when cultured alone (total colony area = 2.57E4 pixels^2). On the other hand, colony formation ability is enhanced when AGS cells are co-cultured with GF1 primary gastric fibroblasts (total colony area = 3.56E4 pixels^2), and to a greater extent when cultured with CK4520 (total colony area = 4.59E4 pixels^2) and CK8612 (total colony area = 4.88E4 pixels^2) primary gastric CAFs. We next sought to determine whether these cells modulate AGS sensitivity to ABT-263, a BH3 mimetic that activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by targeting and inhibiting Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. We treated AGS cells with ABT-263 with or without the addition of fibroblast-conditioned medium. We showed that IMR90 cells sensitize AGS cells to ABT-263, with an IC50 shift from 109 nM to 54 nM in AGS cells treated with IMR90-conditioned medium. On the other hand, AGS cells were more resistant to ABT-263 when treated with GF1, CK4520, or CK8612-conditioned medium, with IC50s of 270 nM, 520 nM, and 540 nM, respectively. Ongoing efforts involve expanding these experiments to senescent fibroblasts and conducting cytokine profiles to begin investigating the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes. These results contribute to our understanding of tumorigenesis and drug resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Senescence,Gastric cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francesca  R.

The poor response can be attributed to the presence of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that can act biochemically or physically to interfere with cytotoxic T cell migration, leading to a limitation in tumor cell killing. Through previous work on deconstructing this matrix and outlining the spatial arrangement of proteins, we were able to identify versican as a key protein in T cell location. Versican is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and has multiple functions in the ECM due to its ability to bind many ECM components. Using immunohistochemistry in this study, we analyzed the localization of CD8+ T cells within human TNBC tissues to classify them as inflamed (tumor<sup>hi<\/sup>, stroma<sup>hi<\/sup>), desert (tumor<sup>lo<\/sup>, stroma<sup>lo<\/sup>) or immune excluded (tumor<sup>lo<\/sup>, stroma<sup>hi<\/sup>). From the analysis of 26 tissues, nearly half were classified as immune excluded with most of the CD8+ T cells restricted to the stroma, whilst only a quarter were inflamed. When comparing this to versican accumulation we noticed that immune excluded tissues have significantly higher levels of versican in the tumor epithelium compared to inflamed tissues where versican is mostly found within the stroma. To investigate the function of versican&#8217;s structure, we carried out transwell migration assays using versican enriched protein treated with or without chondroitinase ABC and showed that the chondroitin sulfates attached to versican&#8217;s peptide backbone are an important factor towards T cell trafficking with a reduction in migration following chondroitinase ABC treatment. Comparison of versican levels to chondroitin sulfate via immunohistochemistry showed a positive correlation within inflamed tissues, however no correlation was observed in immune excluded tissues. Versican isoforms expression in TNBC tissues and cell lines<b> <\/b>was examined with qRT-PCR which showed that within all tissues and cell lines the V0 and V1 isoform are the highest expressed out of the 5 isoforms. Overall, in this work, we have found that versican is differentially expressed in excluded tissues in comparison to inflamed tissues. With chondroitin sulfate shown to play a major role in immune cell trafficking, understanding how it differs between inflamed and excluded tumors can help identify potential targets to improve immunotherapy response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Extracellular matrix,Immune cells,Migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priyanka Hirani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kimberly  M.

We have previously shown that patient-derived CM CAFs can either support or inhibit tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, suggesting that CM CAFs comprise a heterogenous subgroup of cells. Accordingly, we recently reported, based on literature in other cancer types, that CAFs can be categorized into four main subpopulations: &#8216;desmoplastic&#8217;, &#8216;immune&#8217;, &#8216;contractile&#8217; and &#8216;aggressive&#8217;. The purpose of our study is to identify different CAF subpopulations in the TME of CM and determine their impact on CM growth. To do this, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 10 CM patient tissues and 8 patient-derived CM CAF cell lines established in our lab. ScRNA-seq analysis of tumor tissues revealed that desmoplastic, immune, contractile, and aggressive CAF subpopulations are also present in the TME of CM. In addition, scRNA-seq showed that CM CAF cell lines were mainly comprised of the desmoplastic and aggressive CAF subpopulations. These two subpopulations showed differential expression of the newly described tumor inhibitory CAF marker Immunoglobulin Superfamily Containing Leucine Rich Repeat (ISLR) and classic tumor supportive CAF marker Actin Alpha 2, Smooth Muscle (ACTA2, &#945;-SMA), with desmoplastic CAFs showing ISLR<sup>high<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low<\/sup> expression while aggressive CAFs were associated with ISLR<sup>low<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>high <\/sup>expression. Next, we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) based on the expression of ISLR on the cell surface to enrich and expand the ISLR<sup>high<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low<\/sup> desmoplastic CAF and the ISLR<sup>low<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>high<\/sup> aggressive CM CAF subpopulations. Reciprocal expression of &#945;-SMA and ISLR was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence after FACS. Additionally, co-culture experiments showed that ISLR<sup>high<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low <\/sup>CM CAFs inhibit CM cell proliferation. In summary, our data show that there are several molecularly defined subpopulations of CAFs in the TME of CM that can act to either inhibit or promote CM tumor growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our results support that the desmoplastic CM CAFs characterized by ISLR<sup>high<\/sup>\/&#945;-SMA<sup>low<\/sup> can inhibit tumor growth. Overall, the present study improves our understanding of the CM TME, which ultimately will help establish new strategies to harness the cancer restraining capabilities of tumor inhibitory CAFs in order to improve outcomes for patients with CM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Single cell,Brain metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thomas Simon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, David N.

In lung cancer however little is known about specific fibroblast subpopulations or mechanisms subtending their immunoregulatory potential. We previously identified the nuclear transporter XPO1 as a master controller of lung fibroblast protumorigenic potential. Here we evaluated the potential of fibroblasts to modulate interactions between immune and cancer cells.<br \/>Material and Methods: Cultures of primary lung fibroblasts isolated from tissues resected during lung cancer surgery were characterized by multiparametric flow-cytometry and used for experiments with lung cancer cells and monocytes. Co-cultures, conditioned media and decellularized extracellular matrices deposited by fibroblasts (dECM) were employed to investigate different modes of interactions. Modulation of stemness and EMT properties were evaluated by flow cytometry and Real-Time PCR. Co-injection of dECM and lung cancer cell lines were performed in immunocompromised mice and heterotypic tumors were evaluated for their growth, local microenvironments and disseminating potential.<br \/>Results and Discussions: Using fibroblast cultures form both cancer and normal lung tissue we detected protumorigenic potential also in cultures form normal lungs, in line with presence of classical activation markers (alpha-SMA, FAP). Bioactivity of fibroblasts include the ability to induce EMT and modulate stemness potential (increase of CD133+ cancer stem cells and CD133+\/CXCR4+ metastasis initiating cells). Interestingly dECM displayed similar potential compared to co-cultures. Exosomes isolated from both CAF and normal fibroblasts also showed potential to induce conversion of normal monocytes into myeloid derived suppressor cells. In co-injection experiments, dECM from pro-tumorigenic fibroblasts regulated the local immune microenvironment of ensuing tumors inducing generation of a stroma with high content of COL1A and COL6A3, reducing the infiltration from NK cells and increasing neutrophil content, thereby favoring dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs. Pharmacological inhibition of fibroblast activation through compounds targeting XPO1 activity was able to reduce these effects and counteract fibroblast protumorigenic action.<br \/>Conclusion: Fibroblasts play a regulatory role in tumor stroma and dissection of their activities could pave the way for rationale development of treatments to reverse immunosuppressive microenvironments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Fibroblasts,Immunomodulation,Exosomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Giulia Bertolini<sup><\/sup>, Elvira Pantano<sup><\/sup>, Giuliana Pollaci<sup><\/sup>, Federica Facchinetti<sup><\/sup>, Ugo Pastorino<sup><\/sup>, Gabriella Sozzi<sup><\/sup>, <b>Luca Roz<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6fbd504d-87c4-4383-aa0f-6db3a2a83105","ControlNumber":"4285","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

In this study, we sought to identify effective therapeutic targets in CAFs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/>Experimental Design: We established fibroblast cell lines from the cancerous and non-cancerous parts of surgical lung specimens from patients with NSCLC and evaluated the differences in behaviors towards NSCLC cells using in vitro co-culture models, conditioned medium, and in vivo xenograft mouse models. Next, RNA sequencing analysis was performed to investigate the differentially expressed genes between normal fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs, and we then verified the biological activity of the identified molecule on NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo mouse model.<br \/>Results: Cancer cells showed enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and drug resistance by co-culture with CAFs or CAF-derived conditioned medium. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that CAFs showed higher expressions of POSTN, a matricellular protein, than NFs. Single-cell RNA sequencing data of NSCLC from public database confirmed that POSTN-positive fibroblasts were highly enriched in lung tumor tissues but rarely observed in normal lung tissues, suggesting CAF-specific POSTN expression in lung cancer. Recombinant POSTN increased cell proliferation via NSCLC cells&#8217; ERK pathway activation and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which improved migration in vitro. In addition, POSTN knockdown in CAFs suppressed these effects, and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the POSTN knockdown improved the sensitivity of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells for Osimertinib treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results showed that CAF-derived POSTN is involved in tumor growth, migration, EMT induction, and drug resistance in NSCLC.

CAFs are also a major cell type in the desmoplastic stroma in PDAC and may account for half of the entire tumor tissue. Multiple subtypes of CAFs have been suggested, but the tissue origin(s) of CAF subtypes are unknown and genetic tools to robustly target them <i>in vivo<\/i> are lacking. Here we aimed to examine three potential tissue sources of CAFs: the pancreatic epithelium (through epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition), the bone marrow (through circulation), and the pancreatic mesenchyme or tissue resident fibroblasts (TRFs) in the normal pancreas (through proliferation). We utilized a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC, where <i>Kras<\/i> and <i>p53<\/i> mutations were engineered in the pancreatic epithelium using an <i>Flp-Frt<\/i> system. To determine whether the pancreatic epithelium gives rise to CAFs, we permanently labeled the pancreatic epithelium with a GFP reporter and traced their cell descendants by GFP expression. Despite robust GFP labeling of the epithelium, GFP expression was rarely identified in CAFs. To determine whether the bone marrow gives rise to CAFs, we transplanted donor bone marrow carrying a ubiquitously expressed GFP reporter to GFP-negative recipient mice. We found that minimal proportion of pancreatic CAFs were tagged with GFP. Lastly, to determine whether pancreatic TRFs give rise to CAFs, we used an inducible <i>CreER-LoxP<\/i> system to allow for permanent Tomato labeling in TRF progenitors, the splanchnic mesenchyme, during mid-gestation. Lineage tracing in PDAC showed that the vast majority of CAFs were labeled with Tomato expression, suggesting their splanchnic origin. Furthermore, certain splanchnic gene expression signatures persisted in subsets of CAFs in both the PDAC mouse model and human patient samples. Deletion of one of the splanchnic genes, <i>Gata6<\/i>, in CAFs resulted in increased tumor burden in the pancreas, suggesting a tumor-restraining role of Gata6 in CAFs. In summary, we found that the pancreatic epithelium and bone marrow contributes to a minimal proportion of CAFs in PDAC. Meanwhile, pancreatic TRFs are derived from the splanchnic mesenchyme during fetal development and they expand to contribute to the vast majority of CAFs in PDAC. Moreover, the persistence of splanchnic signature defines subtypes of CAFs, with a potential tumor-suppressing function. This study provides genetic approaches to robustly target CAFs <i>in vivo, <\/i>and novel insights into CAF origin, heterogeneity and function in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblasts,Pancreatic cancer,Mouse models,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lu Han<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yongxia Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Kun Fang<sup>2<\/sup>, Sean Sweeney<sup>1<\/sup>, Ulyss Roesner<sup>1<\/sup>, Melodie Parrish<sup>1<\/sup>, Khushbu Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Tom Walter<sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Piermattei<sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony Trimboli<sup>2<\/sup>, Julia Lefler<sup>1<\/sup>, Cynthia Timmers<sup>1<\/sup>, Xue-Zhong Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Victor Jin<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Zimmermann<sup>2<\/sup>, Angela Mathison<sup>2<\/sup>, Raul Urrutia<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Ostrowski<sup>1<\/sup>, Gustavo Leone<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Charleston, SC,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"205299b9-77d4-47c5-a550-66e1a905cbc6","ControlNumber":"4937","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

PDAC is one of the most lethal types of cancer with few effective treatments. The abundant stromal cells and the stiff desmoplastic microenvironment constitute more than 90% of the primary tumor bulk. However, there are few easily tunable models to recapitulate this stiff microenvironment. To address this issue, we have developed a Matrigel-based, orthogonally tunable 3-dimensional (3D) culture system to co-culture mouse derived PDAC organoids and host-matching cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Using this biomimetic model and a mechano-sensation-dependent reporter, we have identified a unique subpopulation of CAFs responsible for mechano-sensing the fibrotic matrix and facilitating CAF-mediated chemoresistance. Moreover, these mechanosensitive CAFs (mecCAFs) respond to increased stiffness through YAP-mediated pathways. Our results also demonstrate how ECM stiffness affects chemoresistance via the hypersecretion CAF-derived exosomes. Moving forward, therapies designed to interrupt the function of mecCAFs could be utilized to overcome matrix-mediated chemoresistance in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stroma,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Exosomes,YAP\/TAZ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Weikun Xiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Chae-Young Eun<sup>1<\/sup>, Weian Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Reginald Hill<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Lawrence J.

We previously reported a larger accumulation of TAFs in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) compared to lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the two most frequent lung cancer subtypes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. TAF accumulation is largely contributed by the proliferation and\/or migration of resident fibroblasts. Moreover, we recently showed that SMAD3 is epigenetically repressed in SCC-TAFs compared to ADC-TAFs owing to an excessive exposure to cigarette smoke particles, which elicited a compensatory increase in its closely related homolog SMAD2 in SCC-TAFs. However, it remains unknown whether the differential SMAD2\/3 expression between ADC- and SCC-TAFs contributes to the larger accumulation of TAFs in ADC. To address this question, we knocked-down SMAD2 or SMAD3 in control pulmonary fibroblasts by shRNA and used them as ADC-like or SCC-like models. To assess proliferation, we examined cell number density and found that shSMAD2 (ADC-like) fibroblasts exhibited a significantly lower number density in basal conditions compared to shSMAD3 (SCC-like) fibroblasts, which was confirmed in TAFs. In the presence of TGF-&#946;1, number density increased and attained similar values in shSMAD2 and shSMAD3 fibroblasts as well as in ADC- and SCC-TAFs. To assess fibroblast migration, we used a microfluidic device to quantify biophysical descriptors of protrusions and subsequent migration within a 3D collagen culture. Notably, both protrusions and migration descriptors were increased in basal conditions selectively in shSMAD2 (ADC-like) fibroblasts concomitantly with Erk1\/2 hyperactivation This enhanced migration was abrogated by TGF-&#946;1 as well as by the MEK inhibitor Trametinib. In contrast, high SMAD2 fibroblasts were poorly responsive to TGF-&#946;1 and Trametinib, exhibiting impaired migration in all conditions. Consistent results were observed in ADC-TAFs upon knocking-down SMAD3 as well as using the Transwell migration Boyden assay, thereby revealing that the enhanced migration in high SMAD3 conditions as in shSMAD2 and ADC-TAFs is caused by an intrinsic migratory priming. These results reveal that altered SMAD2\/3 expression provide growth and migration advantages only in the absence of TGF-&#946;1, although in opposing directions, since growth advantage was observed in high SMAD2 conditions (as in SCC), whereas migration advantage was found in high SMAD3 conditions (as in ADC). These findings strongly support that the larger TAF accumulation in ADC occurs at early stages (under low TGF-&#946;1) and is driven by the enhanced migration of ADC-TAFs due to their high SMAD3 and Erk1\/2 activation. Moreover, our results encourage the therapeutic use of MEK inhibitors in ADC-TAFs but not SCC-TAFs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Smad,Lung adenocarcinoma,Migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Natalia Isabel Diaz Valdivia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yago Juste Lanas<sup>2<\/sup>, Alejandro Llorente<sup>1<\/sup>, Rafael Ikemori<sup>1<\/sup>, Alejandro Bernardo<sup>1<\/sup>, Noemi Reguart<sup>3<\/sup>, Jose  M.

Different CAF subtypes have been identified that evidently contribute to desmoplasia, immunosuppression, and therapy response variably. The lack of models to study their plasticity and heterogeneity reproducibly poses a major limitation. We, thus, describe the development and characterization of a panel of immortalized patient-derived pancreatic fibroblasts (iPDPFs), studying their impact on PDAC cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b><u>Method:<\/u> <\/b>We developed six iPDPF lines using human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) from cancer-adjacent normal pancreas (9-26-NP), chronic pancreatitis (CPP1), and PDAC CAFs (9-17-P, 10-15-P, 10-03-P, &#38; 10-32-P). Immunoblotting, bulk-RNAseq, and qPCR were performed for their molecular characterization. Functional characterization was done <i>in vitro<\/i> using collagen contraction assay and co-culture studies with COLO357. The impact of iPDPFs on the tumor cell behavior <i>in vivo<\/i> was studied by their co-implantation with COLO357 in athymic nude mice.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u><\/b> The iPDPFs exhibited variable expression of activation, inflammatory, and ECM markers indicative of heterogeneity across the panel. While CAFs expressed high levels of &#945;SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin) and fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1), the expression of these markers was low in 9-26 NP &#38; CPP-1. Also, the iPDPFs variably expressed TGF&#946;, PDGFR&#946;, VDR, COL1A, and small GTPases. High expression of inflammatory markers was observed in 9-26 NP, CPP-1, &#38; 10-32-P suggesting their iCAF type while 9-17-P, 10-03-P, and 10-15-P were of myCAF type. These observations were recapitulated in the transcriptomic analysis. Interestingly, the marker expression changed with passage suggesting existence of plasticity in the iPDPFs. 9-17-P induced highest collagen contraction (47.9%) while 10-15-P induced the least contraction (25.89%). Co-culture of iPDPFs with COLO357 enhanced the expression of ROCK-1. <i>In vivo<\/i>, iPDPFs resulted in stroma-rich tumors; however, the extent of stroma and growth rate were variable across iPDPF lines and implantation sites. 9-17-P xenograft tumors exhibited the highest percent &#945;SMA (14.5%), and FSP1 (30.7%) positive cells. Limited analysis showed that iPDPF co-implanted tumors exhibited variable vascularity and ECM composition suggesting that the heterogeneity observed <i>in vitro<\/i> was manifested <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b><u>Conclusion:<\/u><\/b> Overall, the iPDPFs recapitulate pancreatic fibroblasts heterogeneity, reflecting the overlapping nature of CAF subtypes. Also, the iPDPFs are functionally variable and plastic <i>in vitro<\/i>. Importantly, these fibroblasts exert variable effects on the tumor cells <i>in vivo<\/i>.

To better understand mechanisms of intercellular interactions driving tumor response or resistance to chemotherapy, it is crucial to account for the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been implicated as key drivers supporting mechanisms that both promote and restrain tumor growth. Using our model system that investigates interactions between CAFs and cancer cells, we show a novel intercellular interaction through VEGF signaling that drives proliferation.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We interrogate intracellular crosstalk in the PDAC TME using a novel<b> <\/b>3-dimensional (3D), patient-matched coculture system of patient-derived organoids (PDO) and CAFs, obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection. Molecular characterization is performed by profiling with a 1200 analyte multiplex ELISA screen, multiparameter flow cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing of CAF and PDO cocultures, imaging mass cytometry (IMC) on patient samples, and qPCR.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Secretome profiling of 7 patient-derived CAF lines demonstrated patient-specific heterogeneity in proteins such as: FGF-12, FGF3, and CD79a. Common CAF-derived signaling proteins with the potential to regulate intercellular crosstalk that were seen across all samples include CRP, IL-6R, R-Spondin and others. To better understand how factors change with intercellular interactions, we set up direct CAF-PDO cocultures over 4 days to identify global transcriptional changes using bulk RNAseq. Phenotypically, coculture drives gene expression changes in both PDO subtype (basal vs classical) and CAF subtype (prevalence of iCAFs vs myCAFs). We used these transcriptome data to identify pathways modulated by CAF-PDO crosstalk. Profiling coculture supernatant, we identified upregulation in VEGF secretion. In tandem, when we investigate cellular surface marker changes, we see upregulation of VEGFR2 on the surface of CAFs by flow cytometry. This interaction is accompanied by an increase in PDO proliferation seen in the coculture conditions. Ongoing experiments aim to investigate the impact of this relationship spatially using matched patient tissue.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Interactions between cancer cells and CAFs compound the complexity of the biology of the TME and contribute to poor patient outcomes; therefore, we have put forth a model that better represents these interactions through patient matched PDO - CAF cocultures. Using this model, we demonstrate a novel interaction through VEGF that enhances tumor cell proliferation. We introduce a targeted approach to investigating the complex biology of the TME to inform the mechanisms driving cancer biology in individual patients that can also be used to develop novel therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Inflammation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samantha Guinn<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Joseph Tandurella<sup><\/sup>, Jignasha Patel<sup><\/sup>, Richard Burkhart<sup><\/sup>, Jacquelyn Zimmerman<sup><\/sup>, Elizabeth Jaffee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6d209d02-2fcc-4639-97c8-0611ae28dbd0","ControlNumber":"7832","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Current cross-sectional imaging tools rely solely on tumor size and perfusion to monitor therapy and fail to characterize tumor biomechanics. Shear-wave elastography has emerged as a non-invasive technique that can quantify stromal elasticity. The goal of the present study is to characterize the molecular underpinnings associated with shear wave elastography measurements in liver cancer. To this end, rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777 stably expressing green fluorescent protein genes (fluc\/GFP) were implanted in the left liver lobe of Buffalo rats. Three weeks after tumor implantation, adequate tumor size was verified by B-mode ultrasound. A 7-color panel was developed to assess the percentage of vimentin, &#945;-smooth muscle actin, IBA-1, S100A4, TGF-&#946;, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in tumor sections. Shear wave elastography data was used to stratify tumor nodules as stiff or soft according to the mean value of the shear wave (3.05 versus 2,26 m\/s). Our results showed two distinct tumor phenotypes. Stiffer tumors, as determined by higher shear wave speed measurements on ultrasound, were characterized by higher percentages of vimentin-positive cells, low S100A4 and IBA-1 macrophages expressing TGF-b, and intermediate expression of IBA-1 macrophages and GFAP cells. Slow shear wave speed, characteristic of softer tumors, displayed the opposite phenotype (two-factor ANOVA; P&#8804;0.001). The most remarkable difference between stiffness phenotypes was the percentage of cells expressing vimentin, with a mean percentage in stiffer tumors of 26.54 compared with 13.68% in softer tumors (P&#60;0.003). Our results indicate that high expression of vimentin is highly correlated with increased shear wave speeds. Given the association between vimentin expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition a marker of aggressive characteristics of tumor cells (increased migration and invasion), our findings suggest that longitudinal quantification of shear wave speed can be useful to assess functional changes in the stromal component and identify more aggressive tumor phenotypes with a higher likelihood of metastatic potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ultrasound,Extracellular matrix,Liver cancer,Stroma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Andrea  C.

Overexpression of pFAK, a master regulator of the TME, and CXCR4, a receptor involved immunosuppression and tumor progression, are associated with poorer outcomes in PDAC. Exceptional responders, broadly defined by extended survival and durable treatment responses, represent a rare subset in PDAC. We hypothesize that the immune and stromal signatures of exceptional responders vary significantly from non-exceptional responders, specifically exhibiting decreased p-FAK and CXCR4 expression and decreased immunosuppressive myeloid phenotypes in the TME.<br \/>Methods: We performed correlative quantitative analysis of multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) employing 40 biomarkers on stage I\/II PDAC, surgically resected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 9 non-exceptional responders and 11 exceptional responders. Exceptional responders were selected based on degree and duration of disease-free survival or overall survival more than double the historical matched medians. mIHC and image cytometry were used to distinguish and quantify total immune cell populations and colocalize biomarker expression across each distinct cell type. Cell populations and expression levels were compared using unpaired T-tests.<br \/>Results: Exceptional responders showed significantly decreased overall pFAK expression (p=0.02) and overall CXCR4 expression (p=0.04). In exceptional responders, pFAK expression and CXCR4 expression were significantly decreased in immunosuppressive CD66b<sup>+<\/sup> granulocytes (p=0.01, p=0.03, respectively) and in tumor associated macrophages (p=0.01, p=0.006, respectively). While not significant, exceptional responders demonstrated a marked decrease in immunosuppressive pFAK<sup>+<\/sup> fibroblasts (p=0.12) when compared to non-exceptional responders.

Suppression of pFAK and CXCR4 in fibroblasts and granulocytes, respectively are associated with exceptional clinical outcomes.

This is essential for understanding the tumor-stromal crosstalk. Thus, integrating scRNA-seq data with ST-seq data will facilitate understanding intercellular communication in TMEs.<br \/>Material and Method: We performed and combined ST-seq in CRC with public scRNA-seq. And, immunohistochemistry (IHC) (HLA-G, CD68, and SPP1) was performed on 20 CRC surgical specimens collected in our hospital. To verify this, we knocked out H2-M3 (HLA-G in humans) in mouse CRC cell lines (MC-38 cells) using the CRISPR\/Cas9 system and examined H2-M3 KO tumor volume in xenograft mouse models.<br \/>Results: We identified co-localized cells with CRC cells at the invasive front and those in the center based on the spatial distribution estimated by an analytical pipeline, Cell2location. At the invasive front, CRC cells co-localized more frequently with SPP1+ macrophages than other cells. To dissect the molecular machinery and cell types inducing SPP1+ macrophages, we found ligand activity by another pipeline, NicheNet. The prominent signal to SPP1+ macrophages was mediated by several ligand-receptor pairs including HLA-G- immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT)2\/ILT4. Next, we disclosed the effect on CD8+ cells, and SPP1+ macrophages secrete IL-10 suppressing the immune activity of CD8+ T cells. And the ratio of HLA-G-positive cancer cells was predominantly higher in areas with more SPP1+ macrophages by IHC in CRC. In vivo analysis, H2-M3 KO reduced CRC tumor volume and tumor tissue from H2-M3 KO cells exhibited higher SPP1 and CD68 staining compared with wild type cells.<br \/>Conclusion: SPP1+ macrophages and cancer cells secreting high levels of HLA-G may represent targets to improve the prognosis of patients with CRC. Further analysis is currently underway with a focus on early-stage cancer in carcinoma in adenoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Colorectal cancer,Cell invasion,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Masahiro Hashimoto<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuki Ozato<sup>2<\/sup>, Yusuke Nakano<sup>1<\/sup>, Tadashi Abe<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuichi Hisamastu<sup>1<\/sup>, Takeo Toshima<sup>1<\/sup>, Yusuke Yonemura<sup>1<\/sup>, Mamoru Uemura<sup>2<\/sup>, Takaaki Masuda<sup>1<\/sup>, Hirofumi Yamamoto<sup>2<\/sup>, Masaki Mori<sup>3<\/sup>, Hidetoshi Eguchi<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuichiro Doki<sup>2<\/sup>, Koshi Mimori<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Beppu Hosipital, Kyusyu University, Beppu, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University, Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Tokai University, School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e3eda8a0-5536-4185-9fbf-4fce8eb36536","ControlNumber":"2701","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.
