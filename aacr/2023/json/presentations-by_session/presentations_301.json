[{"Abstract":"Plasma proteomics is a non-invasive source of potential biomarkers associated with cancer treatment outcomes, including disease progression and overall survival (OS). Loncastuximab tesirine (lonca) is an antibody-drug conjugate, composed of a humanized anti-CD19 antibody conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer cytotoxin, for the treatment of relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here, we investigated the association of plasma protein biomarkers with OS of R\/R DLBCL patients prior to treatment with lonca (phase 2 trial, NCT3589469, LOTIS-2).Abundances of 888 plasma proteins, including inflammation, cancer and DNA repair associated markers, were measured for 62 patients with R\/R DLBCL from plasma samples collected at baseline. Protein markers predictive of OS were selected using a L1 regularized Cox proportional hazards model (CoxPH) incorporating survival time and censoring status. Protein modules associated with OS were discovered by performing principal component analysis (PCA) on scaled protein abundances. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) sets. We initially applied a regularized COX proportional hazards model to our proteomics dataset to identify proteins associated with OS, which revealed 5 protein markers (associated with decreased survival = REG3A, LAP3; associated with increased survival = NPTXR, C1QTNF1, FLT3) which stratified patients into distinct survival groups (p = 2.3e-4). As a complement to this approach and to extend our biological understanding of this cohort, we then applied PCA to the proteomics data to reveal underlying protein modules associated with survival. Our analysis identified principal component 3 (PC3) to have the strongest association to OS (rho= -0.63, FDR = 8.7e-07); with its top loadings consisting of known markers of cancer progression (top 3 proteins: SIGLEC10, IL6, TNFRSF6B). GSEA on PC3 loadings identified 68 significantly enriched gene sets (FDR &#60; 5%). Gene sets reflective of changes in immune activation, increased cytokine activity and interleukin mediated activation (IL6, IL10) were negatively associated with OS, including activation of the following Hallmark pathways: IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 signaling and inflammatory response pathways.Overall, our results identify proteomics markers associated with DLBCL survival upon treatment with lonca, highlighting the potential of plasma proteins as a source of relevant biomarkers pending additional validation.<br \/>[FV and VC contributed equally to this work]","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Machine learning,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Overall survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francesco Vallania<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Victoria Cheung<sup>1<\/sup>, Anupriya Tripathi<sup>1<\/sup>, Maggie Louie<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Snyder<sup>1<\/sup>, Jimmy Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Karin Havenith<sup>2<\/sup>, Yajuan Qin<sup>2<\/sup>, Serafino Pantano<sup>2<\/sup>, Jens Wuerthner<sup>2<\/sup>, Patrick  H.  van Berkel<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Freenome, Inc., South San Francisco, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>ADC Therapeutics SA, Epalinges, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f188d7f2-a259-4425-9ec3-344ae8d31ede","ControlNumber":"5312","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;F.

As an example, the deep learning-based Quantitative Continuous Scoring (QCS) algorithm [1] enables the objective measurement of biomarker expression based on the detection of individual tumor cells in the tumor regions and - for each cell, on the instance segmentation of its nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane compartments.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In order to extend the QCS image analysis to similarly analyze tissue slides stained with immunofluorescence (IF), we re-trained the fully supervised deep-learning models, adjusted the normalization of images on tissue controls to account for variability between different staining batches, and finally used the normalized signal in IF instead of the Optical Density (OD) signal in IHC as a 8-bit grayscale image on which the biomarker expression is estimated. We performed QCS on HER2 IF images (HER2 clone 29D8 [CST], imaged with Vectra [Akoya] in parallel with HER2 IHC clone 4B5 [Roche Tissue Diagnostics]) performed on 26 primary and metastatic breast cancer samples representing the full range of HER2 expression, from null to highly overexpressed.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Our analysis demonstrated that the QCS-based scoring on IHC-HER2 images correlates with the QCS-based scoring on IF-HER2 images. We observed a Pearson correlation of R=0.92 between the median membrane OD in IHC and the median normalized membrane signal in IF. Defining a positive cell as having an estimated membrane expression higher than a given so-called positivity threshold, we found a median Pearson correlation of R=0.85 between the percentage of positive cells detected in IHC and the percentage of positive cells detected in IF for increasing values of positivity thresholds. Correlation of the QCS median normalized membrane signal in IF was R=0.91 with mRNA (ERBB2 transcript levels [Nano String]) and R=0.88 with IHC-based H-scores, against R=0.83 and R=0.87 respectively for the QCS median membrane OD signal in IHC.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We describe the extension of a computational pathology-based approach for biomarker quantification in IHC to IF stained tissue slides. The consistency of the image analysis method translates into the consistency of the measurements in the two imaging methods. The use of IF could enable the improved quantification of expression, co-localization and spatial distribution of multiple proteins on the tissue sample.<br \/><b>References: <\/b>[1] Gustavson et al., abstract PD6-01, Cancer Research <i>81<\/i>, PD6-01, 2021","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,Machine learning,Fluorescence imaging,Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicolas Brieu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Joshua  Z.

However, few studies have analyzed TIL distribution and associated genomic signatures based on proximity to the tumor-stromal border (TSB). Here, we describe TIL density, <i>IFN-&#947;<\/i> signature, and tumor mutational burden (TMB), according to set distances from the TSB, in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-carcinoma dataset. For spatial TIL analysis, we used Lunit SCOPE IO, an AI-powered H&#38;E whole-slide image analyzer, which identifies and quantifies tumor and lymphocyte cells within cancer or stroma area. In TCGA pan-carcinoma (n=7,468) dataset, the median values of cancer area and cancer stroma were 46.8 (interquartile range [IQR] 21.6-87.0) and 26.6 (IQR 10.9-54.5) mm<sup>2<\/sup>, respectively, and those of TIL density in each area were 72.1 (IQR 34.1-160.1) and 747.2 (IQR 330.4-1575.9) \/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, showing 10-fold enrichment in stromal TIL (sTIL) compared to intratumoral TIL (iTIL). Subdividing the cancer area in 10 micron-wide steps from the TSB toward the tumor core, the median proportions of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 (IT 0-10, IT 10-20, IT 20-30), and greater than 30 microns (IT 30-core) were 17.7%, 20.8%, 13.6%, and 47.9%, respectively. For subdividing the cancer stroma outwards from the TSB, the median proportions of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 (ST 0-10, ST 10-20, ST 20-30), and greater than 30 microns (ST 30-outside) were 13.6%, 19.4%, 13.5%, and 53.5%, respectively. From the tumor core to TSB, median values of TIL density were 53.4 (IT 30-core), 59.3 (IT 20-30), 69.3 (IT 10-20), 127.4 (IT 0-10) \/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, respectively. From the TSB to the remaining stroma, median values of TIL density were 98.7 (ST 0-10), 567.6 (ST 10-20), 708.8 (ST 20-30), and 896.1 (ST 30-outside) \/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, respectively. Hence, the density of TIL generally increased from the tumor core to the outside of cancer stroma. Of note, <i>IFN-&#947;<\/i> signature showed the highest level of correlation with TIL density in IT 10-20 (Spearman&#8217;s rho [&#961;] 0.5146) or IT 0-10 (&#961; 0.5143), compared with other subdivided cancer areas (&#961; 0.4567-0.4924), and cancer stromas (&#961; 0.1454-0.4529). However, TMB was highly correlated with TIL density in ST 20-30 (&#961; 0.3162) or ST 30-outside (&#961; 0.3278), compared with other subdivided cancer stromas (&#961; 0.0588-0.2843) and cancer areas (&#961; 0.0784-0.1208). In conclusion, AI-powered analysis of the tumor micro-environment reveals that iTIL density increases from the tumor core to the outside of tumor-stromal border. <i>IFN-&#947;<\/i> signature is high in the area of the tumor-stromal border on the tumor side, while tumor mutational burden is associated with sTIL far from the tumor-stromal border.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Artificial intelligence,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sanghoon Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Gahee Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Sukjun Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Sangjoon Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Seokhwi Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Wonkyung Jung<sup>1<\/sup>, Mingu Kang<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohammad Mostafavi<sup>1<\/sup>, Heon Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Aaron Valero<sup>1<\/sup>, Sérgio Pereira<sup>1<\/sup>, Donggeun Yoo<sup>1<\/sup>, Seulki Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Seunghwan Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Ken Nesmith<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Chan-Young Ock<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Lunit, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Translational Genomics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"35b311bf-1d51-45c0-a1b6-4c004dbbd5ef","ControlNumber":"4300","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

However, the response rate is still low. With the accumulation of data, efforts to use these data to build machine learning predictors of ICB response are rising. However, as most datasets are still quite small, pertaining machine learning models may often &#8216;overfit&#8217; the data, i.e., have a much weaker performance on independent test data than on the data they were learned upon.<b> <\/b>Here we analyzed ~2000 patient samples from multiple cohorts across 16 solid tumor types. Based on 10 genomic &#38; clinical features, we built different machine learning models, comparing their performance in terms of the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) and importantly, in terms of the AUC difference between training vs validation sets, using a standard cross validation procedure. As a result, the Linear LASSO Regression (LLR) model outperformed all other models by having the highest AUC on the validation set (0.74) and notably, the smallest AUC difference between training and validation sets (0.02). In contrast, these two AUC values for the FDA approved tumor mutational burden (TMB) biomarker are 0.63 and 0.03. The highest predictive features were, receiving chemotherapy before ICB treatment or not, TMB, cancer type, blood albumin level, blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and patient age. The LLR score also consistently predicted overall survival and progression-free survival across all individual cancer types. More importantly, ICB response probability increased near-monotonically from 0% to &#62; 43% with the LLR score, which is an important feature for patient exclusion. In contrast, ICB response probability is ~25% when TMB = 0 and not always higher with higher TMB. In summary, the LLR model identifies key features predicting pan-cancer ICB response and survival. The use of combined genomic and clinical features holds potential to further facilitate clinical ICB patient stratification beyond TMB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Machine learning,Genomic instability,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tiangen Chang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Saugato  R.

Two proteomic profiles from the pan-cancer cell line cohort were generated using two independent sample preparation methods. These were normalized by Combat and merged by averaging the protein abundance, yielding a single training set (D1) with 975 cell lines and 9,688 proteins. Similary, 1,277 tissue samples were processed by DIA-MS, quantifying 9,501 proteins. Celligner was used to align the cell lines (D1) with the tissue cohort. Half of the tissue proteomes were used as a second training set (D2) for online ML and a hold-out test set was constructed by taking the other half of the tissue cohort (T1). A multinomial logistic regression was used to predict cancer and tissue types. Top-k accuracy, as the evaluation metric, computes how often the correct cancer and tissue type class is among the top k classes predicted.<br \/><b>Results<\/b><b> <\/b>As a proof of concept, we defined six cancer types (adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, squamous carcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma and small cell carcinoma) and seven adenocarcinoma tissues of origin (breast, colorectal, liver, lung, ovary, stomach\/esophagus and pancreas) for an ML experiment. We learned a classifier using the cell lines (D1) as the baseline training set, and consecutively added 10% of D2 to D1 for online ML. We tested the baseline model and each subsequent new model on the test set T1. We observed a monotonic performance increase from 0.89 (baseline; Top-1 accuracy) to 0.97 (all D2 were used) when predicting the six cancer types. We observed an analogous trend when predicting the seven tissue types (from 0.64 to 0.84). These results suggest that cancer cell lines can be used to predict cancer type and adenocarcinoma tissue of origin.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b><b> <\/b>Our proteomic-based ML model can predict cancer type and adenocarcinoma tissue of origin in concordance with existing histopathological classification. It can also assign multiple probabilities to tumor type and tissue of origin, potentially enabling the classification of CUP in future work. By adding tissue samples stepwise to the existing model, its predictive performance can be further enhanced. This reflects a real-world knowledgebase that will continue to increase in predictive power as additional data are added.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Pan cancer Proteomics,Online learning,Carcinoma of Unknown Origin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhaoxiang Cai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zainab Noor<sup>1<\/sup>, Adel  T.

However, precise quantification of target protein expression on Tumor Cells (TC) from immunohistochemistry (IHC) is challenging. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence powered image analyzer, called Universal IHC (UIHC), which robustly detects and quantifies targets of interest expressed in multiple untrained cancer types and antibodies.<br \/>Methods: UIHC model can detect TCs and classify IHC positivity across many antibody-cancer pairs, called &#8220;domains&#8221;. UIHC is trained on four domains: lung cancer (569K\/107K) (No. of negative TC \/ positive TC), bladder cancer (270K\/116K), and breast cancer stained with PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx (270K\/96K), and breast cancer stained with HER2 4B5 (307K\/256K); all annotated by board-certified pathologists. For comparison, we developed four AI models using only a single domain (SD). All models were evaluated on hold-out test sets divided in three groups: &#8220;in-domain&#8221; included the four training domains; &#8220;near-out-domain&#8221; contained PD-L1 SP142 and SP263 on lung cancer; &#8220;far-out-domain&#8221; contained 7 antibodies on 15 cancer types.<br \/>Results: For cell detection, the harmonic means of the precision and recall (F1 score) averaged on TC- and TC+ (mF1), formatted as (UIHC; avg-SD [min, max]) were: &#8220;in-domain&#8221; (72.5%; 68.9% [67.1%-69.9%]), &#8220;near-out-domain&#8221; (64.8%; 61.6% [59.7%-65.2%]), and &#8220;far-out-domain&#8221; (70.3%; 62.5% [59.0%-65.9%]).<br \/>At image level, cutoffs at 1% and 50% of TPS are applied for PD-L1 22C3 and SP263, thus 3-way accuracy is computed*. In far-out-domain, the mean TPS per antibody is used as a cutoff.<br \/>UIHC outperforms SD on most antibodies (Table 1).<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrated that a UIHC, built by merging multiple domains during development, can be effective on untrained domains. UIHC can be applied to novel targets in future clinical research with minimal or no adaptation needed.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\"

The CNNs consisted of multiple convolutions, max pooling, fully connected, etc., layers. To incorporate our data into the VGG network, we customized the network architecture and hyperparameters to enhance the classification performances. For AutoML, we used the system's default network with standard hyperparameters. The trained model was then tested on a held-out set of 140 patients (70 cases and 70 controls). The quantitative performance was evaluated using accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), precision (PR), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), etc. For qualitative results, we generated heatmaps using weights and feature maps from the final convolution layer of our customized CNN. Heatmaps were superimposed onto original H&#38;E images to highlight different unique features (such as pattern, texture, color, and morphology).<br \/>Results: We found both deep learning methods to demonstrate remarkable ability in predicting case-control status in the held-out set (AUROC= 90% and 89% for customized CNN and AutoML, respectively). However, our customized CNN outperformed AutoML in terms of ACC (83.57% (95% confidence interval (CI): 76-89%) vs 77.86% (95%CI: 70-84%), respectively); SE (82.85% (95%CI: 72-91%) vs 77.86% (95%CI: 70-84%), respectively); PR (84.05% (95%CI: 73-92%) vs 81.97% (95%CI: 70-91%), respectively); F1 score (83.45% (95%CI: 76-89%) vs 76.34% (95%CI: 68-83%), respectively); as well as error rates (0.16% (95%CI: 0.11-0.24%) vs 0.22% (95%CI: 0.16-0.30%), respectively). Heatmaps revealed specific stromal and epithelial features that were distinct between case and control images.<br \/>Conclusion: By using routinely available H&#38;E-stained WSIs, we developed a customized CNN that outperformed AutoML in distinguishing future BC cases from controls in a BBD population. The qualitative results identified stromal and epithelial regions in the BBD biopsies that were highly predictive of being a case versus control and vice versa thereby providing etiologic clues into breast cancer development following BBD. Future research will focus on leveraging DL to better understand the histologic basis of BBD progression to invasive BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast,Deep learning,Machine learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Monjoy Saha<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mustapha Abubakar<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas  E.

Yet ~25% of the &#8220;suspicious&#8221; nodules identified by LDCT are confirmed to be benign through resection surgery, which adds to patients&#8217; discomfort and the burden of the healthcare system. In this prospective study, we set to develop a non-invasive liquid biopsy assay for distinguishing pulmonary malignancy from benign lung nodules using cfDNA fragmentomic profiling.<br \/>Methods: An independent training cohort, which consisted of 193 patients with malignant nodule and 44 patients with benign nodule, was used to construct a machine learning model. Base models employing 4 different fragmentomics profiles were optimized using an automated machine learning (autoML) approach before being ensemble stacked to create the final predictive model. An independent validation cohort included 96 malignant nodules and 22 benign nodules, as well as an external test cohort containing 58 malignant nodules and 41 benign nodules, were used to assess the performance of the ensemble stacked model.<br \/>Results: Our machine learning models showed excellent performances in detecting patients with malignant nodules. The AUCs reached 0.857 (0.782 - 0.932) and 0.860 (95% CI: 0.788 - 0.933) in the independent validation cohort and the external test cohort, respectively. The validation cohort achieved an excellent 68.2% specificity (95% CI: 45.1-86.1%) at the targeted 90% sensitivity (89.6%, 95% CI: 81.7-94.9%). An equivalently good performance was observed while applying the cutoff to the external cohort, which reached a specificity of 63.4% (95% CI: 46.9-77.9%) at 89.7% sensitivity (95% CI: 78.8-96.1%).

Current cancer prognosis models largely rely on clinical and demographic patient characteristics. Adding &#8216;omics&#8217;-based modalities can help improve patient OS prediction and lead to better disease categorization and understanding. We introduce a data driven methodology for combining multi-omics and clinical data, including clinical\/demographics, mutations, gene expression, long non-coding and micro-RNA expression, DNA methylation, and proteomics for improving prediction of OS in cancer patients. High dimensionality of &#8216;omics&#8217; modalities present challenges to combining them into one model. We propose a late stage modalities fusion where we construct a separate data driven model for OS prediction for each modality, later combining individual predictions in a final linear OS prediction model. With a limited number of patients to develop the model, such an approach helps to better protect against overfitting, and allows to account for different degrees of informativeness of modalities by weighting them according to individual success. We introduce a robust machine learning pipeline with rigorous training, testing and evaluation capabilities, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a suit of TCGA data. When comparing early vs. late fusion of omics and clinical modalities for survival prediction using NSCLC TCGA data, we observe the C-index improvement from 0.57&#177;.04 to 0.61&#177;.01. Best individual modality performance was at 0.59&#177;.02 using clinical modality. Dominant modalities in unimodal survival analysis varied between cancers, with clinical, RNA, and miRNA for LUAD, and clinical, RNA, and RPPA for LUSC. Using pan-cancer TCGA data for survival prediction, the best C-index = 0.77 was achieved using multi-omics model, followed by 0.76&#177;.01 for clinical, 0.75&#177;.01 for RNA seq, and 0.73&#177;.01 for RPPA unimodal models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Machine learning,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nikos Nikolaou<sup>1<\/sup>, Domingo Salazar<sup>2<\/sup>, Harish RaviPrakash<sup>1<\/sup>, Miguel Goncalves<sup>2<\/sup>, Gustavo Alonso Arango Argoty<sup>1<\/sup>, Nikolay Burlutsky<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Natasha Markuzon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Etai Jacob<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>AstraZeneca Oncology, Waltham, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>AstraZeneca Oncology, Cambridge, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5a8b31c6-af92-4b04-a609-654d20fe9dd8","ControlNumber":"7461","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;N.

Because of the complex nature of OC, diagnoses are often by display of symptoms at late stages of disease. Identifying OC at early stages can increase the 5-year survival rate from 40% in stage IV to 94% in stage I. Therefore, effective screening and detection of OC at early stages is imperative. The main objective of this study is to develop a diagnostic panel of markers that correlate with early-stage OC, and ultimately, improve the survival rate of patients.<br \/><b>Background: <\/b>Approaches in the past several years to detect malignant OC have focused on processing relevant images or screening genomic data. These studies use liquid-based biopsies, sonographic images, cyst images, CT images, MR imaging and genomics data. Some studies have focused on distinguishing malignant tumors versus benign tumor cells. In addition to statistical methods to examine available genomic datasets, Machine Learning models including K-Nearest Neighbor, K-means, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Fuzzy algorithms have been used.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this study we proposed a method to determine a possible correlation between some actively expressed genes and OC, using publicly available mRNA data sets. The samples were retrieved from the GSE106817 dataset via the NCBI GEO site, with 333 cancerous and 2759 Non-cancerous samples. The objective is to define a set of genes which is able to illustrate prediction of correlation through the use of PCA, NMF and SVD. We further verified our findings by testing on one additional different mRNA datasets. For this, we compared several machine learning algorithms to potentially correlate active genes and OC stages, from the available data.<br \/><b>Results and Discussions:<\/b> Through our study we have developed Machine Learning models valuable to identify patterns of disease at different stages, thus, potentially be useful in developing predictive models. Our initial experimental results have been demonstrated with a set of mRNA signatures, which may be used to create a panel of biomarkers valuable for detecting early-stage OC. Our results confirm the correlation between OC and PAX8, PEG3, and BIRC5, and MYB and RAC2.

Completion of conversion surgery following mFOLFIRINOX is an important prognostic factor. In this study, we evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict completion of conversion surgery following neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX in BRPC and LAPC.<br \/>Methods: Between January 2017 and December 2020, a total of 647 patients with BRPC and LAPC treated with neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea were enrolled. All demographic and clinicopathological data were retrospectively collected; age, ECOG performance status, BMI, resectability as per the NCCN guidelines, tumor location, tumor size, maximum standardized uptake value assessed by 18F-FDG PET\/CT, number of cycles of mFOLFIRINOX, tumor response to mFOLFIRINOX, and serum CA 19-9. Several machine learning models, such as logistic regression and random forest classifier, were trained to predict curative-intent resection and were then internally validated. The relative importance of each variable was analyzed using both Gini importance and permutation importance.<br \/>Results: Among 647 patients, 173 (26.7%) underwent curative-intent conversion surgery (R0 or R1) following mFOLFIRINOX. The patients who underwent surgery showed significantly better overall survival (median 42.1 vs 17.2 months, P&#60;0.0001) than those who did not. In multivariable analysis using logistic regression, age, resectability as per the NCCN guidelines, tumor size, number of cycles of mFOLFIRINOX, tumor response to mFOLFIRINOX, and CA 19-9 change rate (percentage change in CA 19-9 after mFOLFIRINOX) were significantly correlated to tumor removal with curative-intent conversion surgery. Random forest classifier showed the best predictive capability with AUC at 0.832. The most important feature was the CA 19-9 change rate.<br \/>Conclusions: In this large cohort-based analysis, completion of conversion surgery could be predicted successfully in BRPC and LAPC patients treated with neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX using machine learning models.

OpGen will be helpful in radiotherapy treatment planning automation and efficiently reducing the required time to reach the target goals and improving the quality and safety of the treatment.OpGen has been developed in Python and has four main modules: 1- Analyzing radiotherapy treatment planning parameters of the previous patients in the database. We have developed (a) a powerful graphical user interface (GUI) that allows quantitative and qualitative analysis of the previous knowledge, including the type of frequently used objective parameter (Min Dose, Max Dose, Min DVH dose, etc.); (b) The range of values used for each specific objective type, and (c) Histogram of the number of patients vs. values used for a specific objective type. 2- Importing patients from treatment planning and retrieving a user-defined number of treatment planning information from the previously treated patients in the database corresponding to the given patient using the user-defined quantitative features (geometrical, distance or geo-distance) and retrieval algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest). 3- Generating optimization objective values based on the following available options: (a) The most similar patient in the database; (b)- Average or median value over the number of patients retrieved from the database; and (c) Deep learning generated values using a model trained over 100 similar cases retrieved from the database. 4- Generate a portable database of the objective values and patient geometric information for any inter- or intra-institutional usage of the algorithm.

Herein, we conducted a novel approach to improve the performance of KRAS G12C prediction based on an ensemble model trained not solely on H&#38;E images, but also with multi-layered semantic content produced by a pre-trained artificial-intelligence (AI) analyzer, Lunit SCOPE IO.<br \/><i>M<\/i><i>ethods<\/i>: The Cancer Genome Atlas LUAD and LUSC (TCGA-Lung) samples were used for model development. A self-supervised vision transformer was used to extract deep features from raw H&#38;E images; and an AI-based pathology profiling analyzer extracted semantic contents such as the spatial information of tumor cells, lymphocytes, cancer epithelium, and cancer stroma. A set of classifiers was trained based on the two features, and the ensemble of these features was used to improve robustness. The final model was evaluated through cross-validation and assessed on independent NSCLC samples from Samsung Medical Center (SMC) who tested KRAS mutation by various methods including whole exome sequencing or target sequencing.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: TCGA-Lung dataset (n = 930) includes 150 (16.1%) KRAS driver mutations, and 62 (6.7%) KRAS G12C.

However, the current ctDNA mutation profiling approaches were limited by low sensitivity, while the cfDNA fragmentomics profiling has shown an excellent capability for cancer early detection in NSCLC and therefore exhibits great potential for predicting disease progression. In this retrospective study, we aim to develop a non-invasive liquid biopsy assay utilizing cfDNA fragmentomics profiling for predicting disease progression in inoperable localized NSCLC patients.<br \/>Methods: The study cohort retrospectively enrolled 44 patients diagnosed with inoperable localized NSCLC who received first-line chemoradiotherapy\/radiotherapy (including 23 disease progression during follow-up). Plasma samples were collected during or post-treatments, including 39 at the fourth week of treatment (TP1), 33 and 25 at 1 (TP2) and 3 (TP3) months post-treatment, respectively. cfDNA fragmentomic profiling, generated based on target sequencing data, was used to fit Regularized Cox Regression models. For each time point, a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was performed to evaluate the models&#8217; predictive performances, which was subsequently compared against the ctDNA status determined by the mutation-based method.<br \/>Results: Our cfDNA fragmentomics assay showed excellent performance detecting patients with a high risk for disease progression. At TP1, the high-risk patients detected by our model showed an increased risk of 3.62 times (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.62, <i>p<\/i> = 0.0026) for disease progression, compared to 3.91 times (HR = 3.91, <i>p<\/i> = 0.0022) and 4.00 times (HR = 4.00, <i>p<\/i> = 0.019) for TP2 and TP3, respectively. These fragmentomics determined HRs were higher compared to the ctDNA mutation-based results (HR = 2.08, <i>p<\/i> = 0.074; HR = 1.49, <i>p<\/i> = 0.61) at TP1 and TP3, albeit being lower at TP2 (HR = 9.47, p &#60; 0.0001). At TP1, the predictive model reached 40% sensitivity at 92.9% specificity, which was higher than the mutation-based method (40% sensitivity at 78.6% specificity), while the combination of the two methods reached a higher sensitivity (60%). Finally, a subset of the cohort (N = 19) with data for all three time points (TP1, TP2 and TP3) was examined, and the patients were labelled as high-risk for having a positive prediction or ctDNA status at any time point. The combined methods could predict disease progression with an excellent sensitivity of 88.9% at 80% specificity.<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a cfDNA fragmentomics assay for predicting disease progression in inoperable NSCLC patients. This assay showed increased predicting power during and post treatment compared to the ctDNA mutation-based method, thus illustrating a great clinical potential to guide treatment decisions in inoperable NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Machine learning,Prognostic markers,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yin Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tao Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingbo Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianyang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Wanxiangfu Tang<sup>2<\/sup>, Hua Bao<sup>2<\/sup>, Haimeng Tang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xue Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yang Shao<sup>2<\/sup>, Xin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuqi Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Linfang Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Kunpeng Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingjing Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Luhua Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Nan Bi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Center\/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc., Nanjing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"524293d5-6c88-4ed0-96dc-8ce5f325c0de","ControlNumber":"1929","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

To accurately reconstruct the CC expression profile, LightGBM gene models were trained on artificial transcriptomes created from &#62; 1,000 different solid tumor cancer cell lines and &#62; 3,000 samples of various TME cellular proportions. The LighGBM gene models included genes expressed predominantly in the TME (e.g., <i>CD3E<\/i>), both the TME and the CC (e.g.,<i> BCL6<\/i>), or in the CC (e.g., <i>HER2<\/i>).

The resulting predictions were adjusted based on the CC cell fraction.

When comparing multiple in vitro models and especially patient-derived models such as patient-derived tumor organoids, the degree of intrinsic cell proliferation or doubling time substantially differs and therefore limits conventional metrics as above. Furthermore, assays that directly measure cellular viability can oftentimes overlook therapeutic agents that have cytostatic, versus cytotoxic mechanisms of action and require assays with similar sensitivity and precision to account for this phenotype. Finally, terminal endpoint assays can require tedious temporal optimization to capture the full dynamic range of a given therapeutic which makes cross-therapeutic and cross-model comparisons difficult to interpret. An assay that incorporates these multiple features and in vitro specific doubling time would lead to highly accurate measurements of drug effects and allow the calculation of growth-adjusted IC50 values i.e. GI50 values.<br \/>We, therefore, sought to develop a computer vision model that utilizes label-free longitudinal light microscopy images as input to report the total number of nuclei present within a given experimental well, allowing for the monitoring of cell division and any cytostatic effects. To train the neural network, we use Hoechst-stained images as our ground truth. The model used is an extension of the Regularized Conditional Adversarial Network (PMID: 34320344). It takes as input Brightfield images along with the registered Hoescht stained wells. The label for each well is obtained using commercial image processing software to count the total number of nuclei present in each well from the Hoescht stained channel. The model was trained to predict the virtually stained Hoescht well for every Brightfield, as well as the aggregate nuclei count for all organoids present inside the well. The model was trained on 29000 individual sites across 9 distinct cancer types.<br \/>Five experiments were conducted during training to test for bit depth and tonality effects of the input training data. Inference on 9240 images showed a pearsonR score of 0.81 on the best-performing model. Results show that the model performs well and can be applied in real-time using only experimental data to correct for differing cell division rates and measure cytostatic phenotypes all while using simple light microscopy. The tool will enable cross-comparison of different therapeutic MoAs as well as enable cross-cancer type\/indication comparison for a therapeutic in development to inform early development clinical strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Deep learning,Organoids,Drug-discovery screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Madhavi Kannan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Brian Larsen<sup><\/sup>, Chi-Sing Ho<sup><\/sup>, Jagadish Venkataraman<sup><\/sup>, Martin Stumpe<sup><\/sup>, Ameen Salahudeen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Tempus Labs, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bbef35ae-060d-49d3-b18c-934a66d158af","ControlNumber":"5088","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Upon coactivator YAP\/TAZ binding, TEAD transcription factors are activated to induce expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. It has been shown that auto-palmitoylation is required for TEAD interaction with YAP\/TAZ and hence activation of transcriptional activity. Potent small molecule TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibitors have been reported (Tang <i>et al<\/i>, 2021, <i>Mol Cancer Ther<\/i>.). These TEAD inhibitors disrupt YAP\/TAZ-TEAD protein interaction, suppress TEAD transcriptional activity, and selectively block proliferation of <i>NF2<\/i>-deficient mesothelioma <i>in vitro<\/i> and inhibit <i>NF2<\/i> mutant xenograft tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Although genetic alterations of pathway components (such as, <i>NF2<\/i>) leading to YAP\/TAZ constitutive nuclear localization and TEAD activation have been reported in a variety of human malignancies, these alterations are infrequent in most cancers, and increased accumulation of nuclear YAP has been reported in cancers (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma) that do not harbor pathway mutations. Utilizing <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacy data from cell line screens, gene expression (RNA-Seq) datasets, and a custom bioinformatics data-processing and normalization pipeline, we sought to elucidate gene expression patterns by using a random-forest based classifier. Our classifier, which aims to predict the response (efficacy) of treatment using normalized gene expression of selected genes, was originally trained on the public bulk RNA-seq pan-cancer <i>in vitro<\/i> dataset available in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) from the Broad Institute, as well as a privately obtained TEADi response data for corresponding CCLE cell lines. Binary response labels (responder\/non responder) for each cell line were obtained by thresholding efficacy measures. The classifier - evaluated using cross-validation - achieved an average AUC of 0.80. Then from our screen of 50 patient-derived Chinese liver cancer (CLC) cell models (Qiu <i>et al<\/i>, 2019, <i>Cancer Cell<\/i>), both as single agent and in combination with mTOR inhibitor everolimus, we found that TEAD inhibitors (TEADi) were efficacious in several of these liver cancer models. This allowed us to verify the classifier without any re-training on an independent dataset (CLC). In this independent validation scenario, the classifier achieved the AUC of 0.82. Having established efficacy of predictions on both <i>in vitro<\/i> datasets, we re-trained the classifier using both CCLE and CLC datasets as input to achieve maximum predictive performance, and we predicted, post-hoc, response status of 99 responders out of 2056 patient-derived xenograft models. The algorithm showed early promise by retrospectively classifying a model with <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy as the most likely to respond.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP\/TAZ,Small molecule inhibitor,Machine learning,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Adam Kurkiewicz<sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastian  Y.

In determining the molecular subtype of breast cancer, protein receptors such as estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) are used as key factors. These protein receptors also play an important role in determining the treatment method or predicting the prognosis of breast cancer. To confirm this, a test should be performed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In this study, we investigated the morphological relationship between the molecular subtypes and hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) without IHC stained images, and performed an experiment to evaluate that the protein receptors can be predicted by these morphological features. The TCGA-BRCA data were utilized in this study. There were 728 cases out of the total 1097 cases where the IHC status for ER, PR, and HER2 was either positive or negative. Each individual case is scanned using different scanners and magnifications. In some cases with multiple slides, we use only the first scanned image. The entire WSI was randomly split into 3:1:1, and used for training, tuning, and test, respectively. Individual WSIs was tiled into 1024x1024 patches for this study. The multi-task deep learning model predicts the protein receptor status of individual patches. In this study, a confidence measure was added to remove the uncertainty of the deep learning model. When learning WSIs, patches of less than 70% based on these confidence scores did not affect WSIs. Specifically, when learning morphological features, we used strong augmentation such as grayscale, gaussian blur, color jitter, and posterization to ensure that predictions were not biased by color alone. Based on individual patches, ER accuracy of 76%, PR accuracy of 65%, and HER2 accuracy of 79% are shown. As a result of prediction by majority voting on WSI images through patch predicted results, ER accuracy of 74.6% PR accuracy of 66%, and HER2 accuracy of 76.6% Through this study, it was confirmed that the sufficiently trained deep learning model predicted ER, PR, and HER2, which are important factors of molecular subtype, relatively well. Through this, it was found that there was some correlation between morphological characteristics and molecular subtypes in H&#38;E stained WSIs. If more data are collected through future experiments, a molecular subtype prediction model can be developed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular subtypes,Breast cancer,Receptors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Geongyu Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chungyeul Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Tae-Yeong Kwak<sup>1<\/sup>, Sun Woo Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyeyoon Chang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Deep Bio Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"35760f92-ba93-4175-8533-c69a2f361aa7","ControlNumber":"3334","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

Despite the recent use of molecular-based tools to identify the tumor tissue-of-origin (TOO), overall survival for CUP patients remains low. Here, we present an AI-based tool that predicts the TOO by using genomic and transcriptomic data to classify CUP tumors into hierarchically-organized molecular subgroups. The TOO predictor was composed of DNA, RNA, and Consensus classifiers that were hierarchically organized with respect to molecular diagnosis with upper level clusters based on common molecular features reflecting similar cell of origin, and lower levels containing specific diagnoses for further classification. The ML-based DNA classifier was trained on a dataset of publicly available genomic data generated from 8,000 samples, and independently validated using more than 5,500 samples. The ML-based RNA classifier was trained on a dataset of publicly available transcriptomic data created from more than 10,100 samples with tumor- and normal-specific features for each cancer type, and independently validated using 20,000 samples. The Consensus classifier, combining outputs from both DNA and RNA algorithms, was trained on a dataset of genomic and transcriptomic data from 1,000 samples, and validated on an independent dataset of 2,000 samples. Each classifier contained features selected based on data analysis according to the weighted F1-score, and the best hyperparameters for the final model. The 3-classifier algorithm predicts TOO for 33 cancer types and subtypes belonging to solid neoplasms, independently of sample source, sequencing methods, and cohort. Validation of the Consensus classifier showed a higher accuracy (95% f1-score) compared to the DNA and RNA classifiers (79% and 93% f1-scores, respectively), along with a high sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and precision (96%), as it takes into account both genomic events and expression patterns. The TOO predictor was prospectively validated on approximately 298 clinical samples with a known diagnosis using all classifiers. The diagnosis was identified in 90% of clinical cases (295\/297) by the Consensus classifier with 90% sensitivity and 94% precision. The call rate for the DNA and RNA classifiers was above 95%. Of note, sensitivity of the top 4 predicted diagnoses was &#62; 90% for all 3 classifiers, and the calculated rule-out accuracy of the Consensus classifier was 97%. In conclusion, an ML-based algorithm was developed that utilizes genomic and transcriptomic data to accurately predict the TOO for CUP tumors. Utilizing the Consensus classifier after DNA and RNA classifiers helps to identify the TOO of the tumor with high specificity, which can guide precision oncology therapeutic options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Genomics,RNA-seq,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Zoia Antysheva<sup><\/sup>, Daria Kiriy<sup><\/sup>, Anton Sivkov<sup><\/sup>, Alexander Sarachackov<sup><\/sup>, Alexandra Boyko<sup><\/sup>, Naira Samarina<sup><\/sup>, <b>Nara Shin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jessica H.

A third of ovarian cancer patients have elevated platelet counts that are associated with poor prognosis. However, the exact mechanism by which platelets preferentially extravasate into tumor microenvironment is unknown, partly owing to lack of tools that can accurately segment and measure platelet counts found in tumor tissues. In this study, we hypothesize that tumor secreted SDF-1 interacts with CXCR4 receptors on platelets and initiates platelet chemotaxis towards tumor microenvironment. We developed a digital pathology (DP) platform with automated whole tissue confocal imaging and deep learning (DL) model that can be used to automatically segment out platelets and calculate platelet density with high precision and consistency in the mouse ovarian cancer tissue sections for supporting hypothesis evaluation.<br \/>Methods: A DL algorithm to accurately segment out platelets was developed based on the U-Net structure using our original datasets from the murine ovarian cancer model. Tumor-bearing mice were injected with 5 mg\/kg of Plerixafor, a CXCR4 inhibitor, daily for 4 weeks. Then, tumor nodules were resected, stained with CD41a antibody, and imaged using the whole slide confocal microscopy. Using these high-resolution images, we performed manual annotation of platelets to generate the mask dataset and performed further data augmentation to increase the diversity of datasets. We trained our model using 85% of these images and performed validation using the remaining 15%.<br \/>Results: Using our DLDP platform, the validation dataset achieved pixel-wise accuracy of 98.7%. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99 with high sensitivity and specificity. Intersection over union (IoU) score of 0.724 was obtained. A statistically significant (p=0.0467), 7.03% reduction in the platelet density was shown in the Plerixafor-treated mouse ovarian tumor tissues (n=8) compared to the control tumor tissues (n=9). Note that the traditional threshold method was not able to find the statistical significance (p=0.0966) in the same dataset.<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a DLDP platform to segment and quantitate tens of thousands of platelets from whole slide mouse ovarian cancer tissues automatically with high accuracy and consistency. Applying the DLDP platform, we demonstrated that treatment with Plerixafor leads to overall reduction in platelet infiltration within ovarian murine tumors. With high-throughput, accurate, and automated detection of platelets, our DLDP platform can serve as a powerful tool for characterization of CAT by evaluation of platelet density as a potential prognostic biomarker for ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Platelet Segmentation,Cancer-associated thrombosis,Digital Pathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ju Young Ahn<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wendolyn Carlos-Alcalde<sup>2<\/sup>, Matthew Vasquez<sup>3<\/sup>, Min Soon Cho<sup>2<\/sup>, Vahid Afshar-Kharghan<sup>2<\/sup>, Stephen  T.

Histological imaging via hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) staining is performed on PDX samples for routine assessment and, in principle, captures the complex interplay between tumor and stromal cells. Deep learning (DL)-based analysis of large human H&#38;E image repositories has extracted inter-cellular and morphological signals correlated with disease phenotype and therapeutic response. Here, we present an extensive, pan-cancer repository of nearly 1,000 PDX and paired human progenitor H&#38;E images. These images, curated from the PDXNet consortium, are associated with genomic and transcriptomic data, clinical metadata, pathological assessment of cell composition, and, in several cases, detailed pathological annotation of tumor, stroma, and necrotic regions. We demonstrate that DL can be applied to these images to classify tumor regions with an accuracy of 0.87. Further, we show that DL can predict xenograft-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, the unintended outgrowth of human lymphocytes at the transplantation site, with an accuracy of 0.97. This repository enables PDX-specific investigations of cancer biology through histopathological analysis and contributes important model system data that expand on existing human histology repositories. We expect the PDXNet Image Repository to be valuable for controlled digital pathology analysis, both for the evaluation of technical issues such as stain normalization and for development of novel computational methods based on spatial behaviors within cancer tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Image analysis,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brian S.

Artificial intelligence (AI) enables discriminating and extracting morphological features reflective of the underlying genomic alterations at visual and subvisual levels. We have built a morphology-based and AI-powered platform for cancer genotyping, risk stratification and outcome prediction that addresses the needs for treatment decision-making in a cost effective and timely fashion. A cohort of 390 prostate and 742 invasive breast cancer patients with known molecular status of key genes, such as TP53, PIK3CA, MYC, ERBB2, TMPRSS2-ERG and PTEN from The Cancer Genome Atlas were included in this study. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) stained whole slide images (WSI) of the cancer tissue sections were available at 20x or 40x. The WSI from the two cancer cohorts were split 2:1 into a training and test dataset, respectively. Our platform involved two different deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures. The platform first divided each WSI into multiple tiles. Each tile was then analyzed using a DCNN that graded the tile and generated a high dimensional vector to provide a mathematical representation of the morphology. The combination of high dimensional vectors across the WSI was then fed into a second DCNN that generated a morphological score, which predicted whether the gene under consideration was wild type or modified.

For histopathological image analysis, nucleus segmentation represents one of the initial steps in quantitative data analysis pipelines. Recently, deep learning methods for nucleus segmentation on histopathological images become the mainstream in digital pathology. However, adopting these pre-trained models in digital pathology or clinical research remains limited. Two main factors limit the usage of deep learning methods in routine research: 1) many models required some technical background to execute the programs, and 2) the speed of returning the results to the users. To overcome these limitations, we have developed and implemented NuKit, a deep learning platform which accelerates nucleus segmentation and provides prompt results to the users. NuKit platform consists of two deep learning models coupled with an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) to provide fast and automatic nucleus segmentation &#8220;on the fly&#8221;. The two deep learning models are: 1) the whole image segmentation model and 2) the click segmentation model. Both deep learning models provide complementary tasks in nucleus segmentation in the NuKit platform. The whole image segmentation model performs whole image nucleus whereas the click segmentation model supplements the nucleus segmentation with user-driven input to edits the segmented nuclei. We used PanNuke as the training data set which contains 160,368 nuclei extracted from 7,901 image tiles. The sources of this data set were curated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and included a very few in-house data. For test sets, we used several popular data sets such as TCGA (not used in the training set). We used DICE coefficient as the metric for comparisons of NuKit with other deep learning methods. For the results, we observed that NuKit achieved comparable results with the state-of-the-art deep learning methods and outperforms those non-deep learning methods. For TNBC and CoNSeP data sets, NuKit achieved DICE 0.793 and 0.854 comparing to HoVer-Net 0.749 and 0.664. For CoNSeP test data set, NuKit achieved DICE 0.860 comparing to Cell Profiler 0.434 and QuPath 0.588. In addition, both pre-trained models were embedded in the NuKit GUI, which provides interactive and prompt response to users in analyzing their histopathological images. The outputs of NuKit are interoperable with other quantitative image analysis tools to facilitate the ecosystem of computational pathology to many formats to combine with other software to construct pipelines.<br \/>In summary, we have introduced NuKit, an innovation platform which combines two deep learning models coupled with interactive GUI to accelerate nucleus segmentation task in histopathological images. We believe that NuKit provides a new platform to bridge the pre-trained deep learning models into digital pathology and clinical usage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Machine learning,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ching-Nung Lin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christine H.

However, the question of which disease model best represents the response\/ resistance mechanisms of an oncology patient remains challenging.<br \/>In this study we present a machine learning (ML) based computational technique for integrating omics from preclinical dose-response studies with clinical treatment-naive samples to create putative predictive biomarkers, and exemplify its application 2 case studies - PARP or AKT inhibitors.<br \/>We utilize the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) as a resource for in-vitro dose response data for PARPi and AKTi, coupled with multi-omic molecular data.

Multi-omic analysis of these datasets derived 2 putative predictive biomarkers for PARPi and AKTi. The multi-omic analysis resembles the data availability at the critical drug development stage of transition from preclinical response models to a clinical trial. These biomarkers are tested on a validation dataset obtained from the iSPY adaptive clinical trial and achieve superior results compared to the original enrolment biomarkers and even the retrospectively derived biomarkers.<br \/>This study presents a novel computational approach to bridge the gap between preclinical dose-response and clinical datasets and suggests an efficient way to discover predictive biomarkers based on data accessible in a preclinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Machine learning,Akt,PARP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"David Futorian<sup><\/sup>, Oren Fischman<sup><\/sup>, Gali Arad<sup><\/sup>, Nitzan Simchi<sup><\/sup>, Omri Erez<sup><\/sup>, Eran Seger<sup><\/sup>, Rozanne Groen<sup><\/sup>, <b>Kirill Pevzner<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Protai, Tel Aviv, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"84bb8703-a1e9-4186-93d2-7c2a1edf2353","ControlNumber":"7571","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

This methodology is ubiquitous in statistical literature and in the analysis of cancer outcomes, but its use in high-dimensional analyses tends to be limited as the methods are difficult to implement in a machine learning environment. Additionally, development of certified prognostic clinical tests using proteomic biomarkers for detecting future cancer risk can be time-consuming, prone to overfitting issues, and difficult to navigate.

In addition to standard machine learning techniques, statistical methods include elastic net AFT models, subsampling survival techniques, and metrics for assessing predictive survival models. The pipeline takes the analyst from data processing and QC through identification of optimal models for prediction of clinical endpoints, and then through validation on a hold-out test set. The tools include an assessment of model robustness against sample handling issues, longitudinal stability, the impacts of assay noise on model performance, effects of putative interferents, and risk of failure during CLIA validation in the lab.

Many inflammatory mediators within the tumor microenvironment (TME) determine its progression. Unfortunately, no ubiquitous prognostic markers reveal the intricacy between TME and chronic inflammatory responses (CIRs). CIRs used to vary among individuals affecting prognosis. And opting for the best-optimized treatment remains challenging.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b>We proposed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to redefine CIRs as prognostic markers for glioma using 694 and 693 patients&#8217; data derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), respectively. First, using five curated databases, we identified CIR-related genes those enriched nine HALLMARK pathways using gene set variation analysis (GSVA). Then, we trained the XAI model to characterize the personalized inflammatory mediators (PIMs) using multimodal factors such as transcription factors (TFs) network and cell infiltration markers. It resulted in rationalized typified CIRs. Finally, we used overall survival (OS) analyses to validate them as potential prognostic markers and showed a personalized co-drug discovery strategy by optimizing CIRs.<br \/>Results: The proposed XAI model deciphered the PIMs and endorsed the typified CIRs as efficient prognostic markers. It characterized five unique CIR types (p-value&#60;0.0001). The OS analyses indicated the differential prognostic ability of the typified CIRs for glioma, lower-grade glioma (LGG) at p-value&#60;0.0001, and glioblastoma (GBM) at p-value&#60;0.22. We found that patients with higher CIRs had significantly shorter OS than those with lower CIRs. We showed that CIR type 4 and type 2 were highly inflamed and had poor OS for LGG, and GBM, respectively. Chronic pro-inflammatory responses were positively correlated with the poor OS of glioma patients. GSVA indicated lower activation of apoptotic pathways and higher activation of the hypoxia pathway as likely causes. We identified the effector genes within the personalized CIR networks, which demonstrated prognostic ability and may offer potential targets for optimizing the patient-specific CIRs through co-drug intervention. Additionally, we identified their transcriptional regulatory networks comprising TFs (e.g., SMAD3, HIF1A, NFKB1, GATA3, RORA, JUN) contributing to the inflammatory pathways (e.g., TNF&#945;, NF-k&#946;, IFN-&#947;, hypoxia).<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Our findings highlight a new strategy to redefine CIRs as prognostic markers for glioma and show that optimizing CIRs improves the OS.

For example, according to APESS score in lung cancer, we can find out the feasibility of structure transformation of H-bond in EGFR protein (L858R) tyrosine kinase and also show the differences of tyrosine kinase affinity between each lung cancer patients. However, for the T790M mutation of EGFR protein, there was no significant difference compared with the wild type (790). The execution time of AIVE (GPU based web server platform) depends on the length of the input sequence, and it completes such an example case in an average of 2-3 hours. AIVE can suggest anti-cancer candidates in protein-level and present a precision medicine model which is available to implement close to real time.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dongwan Hong<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ff413c2d-e683-4b69-bbd9-77a34c9ebdf6","ControlNumber":"2620","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

In cytopathology practice, urine cytology specimens are examined manually with a light microscope to identify morphologic features associated with different diagnostic categories based on the Paris System (TPS) for Reporting Urinary Cytology. Specifically, the diagnosis of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC) requires the identification of &#38;gt; 5-10 cells with a nuclear\/cytoplasm ratio of 0.7 or greater and hyperchromasia together with coarse chromatin or irregular nuclear membranes. However, the task of identifying HGUC involves a substantial degree of manual review and is often associated with intra-and inter-observer variability. To address this, we have designed an accurate and efficient deep learning system capable of automatically distinguishing between HGUC and non-HGUC using digitized cytology slides. Our model has been developed using a retrospective cohort of 158 digitized urine ThinPrep cytology slides consisting of HGUC (n=98) and negative for HGUC (n=60). The model was then prospectively validated on a cohort of 105 urine cytology slides that were also independently reviewed prospectively in a blinded manner by a cytopathologist and cytotechnologist. Our system uses Otsu&#8217;s method for automatic image thresholding followed by dividing images into non-overlapping tiles of 500X500 pixels at the highest magnification. Subsequently, we use a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features which are used for training our attention-based multiple instance learning framework. For the training task, our retrospective cohort (158 slides) has been divided into 10 different splits each consisting of training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets. The training and validation sets were used for the model training and optimalization, respectively, while the testing set was used for assessing the performance. This process yielded 10 different models with an average Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.80 in the testing set. The best performing model had an AUC of 0.90 and an accuracy of 0.88. This model was subsequently validated prospectively in an independent testing cohort with 105 slides. In the prospective testing cohort, the model was able to accurately distinguish between HGUC and non-HGUC with an AUC of 0.83, accuracy of 0.76, sensitivity of 0.89, and specificity of 0.62. Additionally, our system can detect slide regions with high attention score for HGUC which are enriched in atypical urothelial cells. These findings show that our system can be utilized to assist cytopathologists in assessing urine cytology slides and to detect regions with high-diagnostic relevance for further assessment which is expected to reduce the time needed for manual review.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Bladder cancer,Urine,Cancer detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mohamed Omar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, David Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Luigi Marchionni<sup>3<\/sup>, Momin  T.
