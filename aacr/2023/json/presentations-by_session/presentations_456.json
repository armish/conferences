[{"Abstract":"Integration of viral DNA into the host genome has been implicated in human papillomavirus (HPV) associated tumorigenesis, and studies in HPV associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) attempting to classify viral integration status have reported associations among HPV status, viral load, and overall survival. However, few genomic studies have correlated HPV structure with commonly occurring somatic mutations in HNSCC. Here, we conducted hybrid-capture DNA sequencing using a panel of over 800 cancer related genomic targets, as well as probes specific for the full HPV16 and HPV18 genomes, in a novel cohort of 525 HNSCC cases. Paired reads were aligned to a human reference containing complete viral genomes, including all high-risk HPV types, which allowed for robust identification of HPV(+) tumors and specific HPV type. Variant calling and filtering, followed by pathway analysis of significantly mutated genes, defined the catalog of somatic driver alterations in HNSCC. Viral genome structure, integration status, and viral load were determined via initial copy number analysis of HPV-specific reads, followed by identification of viral\/human breakpoints and indels with variant calling algorithms. Manual review was required in some cases due to variability in read coverage and alignment to HPV genome. We identified 252 HPV(+) tumors, the majority of which were HPV16 (n=228, 90%). Analysis of HPV16(+) tumors revealed five classes with variable viral loads: pure episome (EPI, n=54), episomal rearranged (EPI-R, n=51), episomal chimeric (EPI-C, n=22), integrated (INT, n=92), and integrated deleted (INT-A, n=12). Integrated tumors had at least one integration event (INT) and a few exhibited recurrent deletions in the viral genome (INT-A). Episomal samples had either complete HPV genomes (EPI), circular genomes with one or more indels (EPI-R), or circular genomes with HPV and human DNA (EPI-C). Interestingly, PIK3CA, the most frequently mutated gene in HPV(+) HNSCC, was mutated at a higher frequency in all integrated samples compared to all episomal types (44% vs 23%, p=0.005). We also noticed more deleterious mutations in innate immunity genes (HLA-A\/B, B2M, TRAF3, BIRC3) in the episomal samples (16% vs 8%), which may allow cells with intact HPV genomes to evade anti-viral immune responses. Additionally, mutations in oxidative stress response genes that lead to the constitutive activation of NRF2 (NFE2L2, CUL3, KEAP1) were more frequent in integrated samples (11% vs 4%), which could confer radiotherapy resistance and a worse prognosis. Overall, using DNA sequencing and integrative genomic analysis in the largest cohort of HPV(+) HNSCC to date, we developed a novel classification method based on viral genome structure which associates with host somatic alterations that may contribute to variable outcomes in HNSCCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Genomics,Somatic mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeremiah Ray Holt<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaobei Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyo Young Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul Little<sup>3<\/sup>, Angela  L.

While modern NSCLC-directed agents yield excellent systemic response, most patients require focal BM treatment. Prior reports of BM genomics have been limited by low numbers and a lack of matched specimens. Here, we report the largest cohort to date of molecularly-profiled NSCLC BM samples with comprehensive clinical follow-up.<br \/>Methods: Clinical data and outcomes for 244 patients with NSCLC and resected BM were identified. Samples were assessed using MSK-IMPACT, a custom tumor-normal next generation sequencing assay. 51 (20.9%) patients had matched primary site tissue, and 44 (18%) patients had matched tissue from another metastatic site or CSF. Genomic alterations were filtered for driver variants using OncoKB. Publicly available genomic data for NSCLC primary samples was used for comparison against the primary samples from our BM cohort.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>The most frequently altered genes in BM tumors were <i>TP53<\/i> (72%), <i>CDKN2A<\/i> (34%), <i>KRAS<\/i> (31%), <i>KEAP1<\/i> (26%), and <i>EGFR<\/i> (21%). <i>CDKN2A<\/i> was more frequently altered in BM samples compared to NSCLC primary lesions (34% vs 14%, p = 0.003). Additionally, cell cycle pathway alterations were enriched in BM (56% vs 31%, p = 0.002). BM samples also had a significantly higher fraction of genome altered (FGA) relative to primary samples (p &#60; 0.0001). We then compared primary samples from BM patients against primary samples from metastatic NSCLC patients without BM and primary samples from non-metastatic NSCLC patients. We found an enrichment of alterations in <i>TP53<\/i> (68.6% vs 27.7%, p &#60; 0.0001), <i>NKX2-1<\/i> (11.4% vs 1.7%, p = 0.006), <i>SMARCA4 <\/i>(11.4% vs 2.1%, p = 0.01), <i>RB1 <\/i>(11.4% vs 1.7%, p = 0.006), and <i>FOXA1<\/i> (11.4% vs 0.9%, p = 0.001) in the primary samples from BM patients compared to non-metastatic patients. Next, we grouped patients based on CNS progression patterns and found that <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations were enriched in patients with leptomeningeal progression when compared to patients without progression (42% vs 18%, p = 0.03).<br \/>Conclusions: In our cohort of molecularly-profiled NSCLC BM, we found an enrichment of cell cycle pathway alterations and a higher FGA in BMs compared to their primary tumor controls. Additionally, several genes were enriched in the primary tissue of patients that developed BM compared to primary tissue from non-metastatic patients. <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations were enriched in patients who develop leptomeningeal disease (LMD). Our work herein characterizes the genomic profiles of NSCLC patients with BM and identifies specific genes enriched in the primary tissue of BM patients compared to primary tissue from both non-BM metastatic patients and non-metastatic patients. Finally, our finding that <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations were enriched in patients with LMD suggests specific biologic underpinnings driving patterns of CNS progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,NSCLC,Brain metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Henry Walch<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Skakodub<sup>1<\/sup>, Kathryn  R.

Due to its rarity, to date, no large-scale studies have been done to systematically identify ASC-predisposition genes and the broader landscape of pathogenic germline variants in patients with ASC remains unclear.<br \/>Methods: Through the Angiosarcoma Project, an ongoing patient-partnered research approach that allows patients living anywhere in the U.S. or Canada with angiosarcoma to participate through a website, blood and saliva samples were collected from more than 300 patients and whole-exome-sequencing was performed. Machine-learning frameworks were used to identify germline short variants (SNPs, indels) and rare germline copy number variants (CNVs). The pathogenicity of variants in 107 curated cancer-predisposition and sarcoma-related genes were evaluated according to the ACMG guidelines. A short-variant-based gene-burden analysis was then performed using 223 unrelated ASC patients and 4557 ancestry-matched unrelated cancer-free controls.<br \/>Results: In total, 38 patients (17.04%) carried at least one pathogenic short variant, including 37 carrying germline heterozygous pathogenic variants in POT1 (9, 4.04%), BRCA2 (3, 1.35%), CHEK2 (3, 1.35%), MUTYH (3, 1.35%), BRCA1 (2, 0.90%), PRF1 (2, 0.90%), ERCC3 (1, 0.45%), TP53 (2, 0.90%), ATM (1, 0.45%), TSHR (1, 0.45%), TSC2 (1, 0.45%), SDHA (1, 0.45%), SBDS (1, 0.45%), MSH6 (1, 0.45%), MITF (1, 0.45%), MET (1, 0.45%), LZTR1 (1, 0.45%), FH (1, 0.45%), ERCC2 (1, 0.45%), XPC (1, 0.45%). In addition, one patient harbored pathogenic short variants in both BRCA1 and ERCC3. In the 8 unique CNVs detected in 10 (4.55%) patients, 6 were classified as pathogenic including 3 heterozygous duplications overlapping MSH2, LZTR1, SMARCB1, and 3 heterozygous deletions overlapping NF1, MSH2, and WRN. Two unique heterozygous duplications met VUS criteria including one overlapping ERCC2 and one overlapping SMARCB1. In a comparison between ASC patients and cancer-free controls of predominantly European ancestry, we found ASC patients tobe 40 times more likely to carry a pathogenic variant in POT1 (OR: 42.91, CI: [15.40-174.08], q &#60; 0.001, p &#60; 0.001), while TP53 was nominally significant (OR: 7.37, CI: [1.19 - 41.13], p = 0.037).<br \/>Conclusion: We confirmed prior observations of POT1 being responsible for ASC and called for attention to investigate the effect of germline CNVs in ASC. Overall, the elucidation of various germline elements associated with ASC risk highlighted the value and importance of patient-partnered research, particularly for rare cancers, and the analysis support using germline testing of patients for more precise clinical management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Cancer genomics,Copy number variation,Whole exome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hoyin Chu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Marissa Hollyer<sup>1<\/sup>, Seunghun Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Sabrina  Y.

Given the high incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in hemodialysis patients, suggesting a relationship between tissue remodeling by chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. However, little is known about the genetic background of cancer development from remaining tubules and cystic lesions in hemodialysis patients.<br \/>Method: We enrolled 5 patients under hemodialysis who were accompanied by acquired cystic kidney disease and underwent radical nephrectomy for RCC. Surgical specimens were fixed with alcohol-based solution and paraffin-embedded, and after H&#38;E staining, subjected to laser capture microdissection (LCM) to collect remaining tubules and cysts containing approximately 200 cells. DNA was extracted and analyzed for somatic mutations and copy number alteration by whole-exome sequencing.<br \/>Result: In total, we collected 161 LCM samples, including 118 from proximal tubules, 17 from collecting ducts, and 26 from cysts. Median variant allele frequencies of detected mutations were 0.237 in proximal tubules, 0.133 in collecting duct, and 0.381 in cysts, indicating larger clonal expansion in proximal tubules and cysts than in collecting ducts. Proximal tubules and cysts contained recurrent mutations in <i>FAT1 <\/i>(11% and 8%, respectively), <i>STAG2 <\/i>(5% and 8%), and <i>PTEN <\/i>(3% and 4%), whereas no recurrent driver mutations were identified in collecting ducts. In copy number analysis, 26% of proximal tubules, 35% of collecting ducts, and 80% of cysts had copy number alterations. Of note, samples from cysts had more copy number alterations compared to remaining tubules (on average, 2.3 vs. 1.1). Proximal tubules had recurrent copy number gains of chromosomes 3, 7, 10, 18, and 20, and loss of chromosome 22 and samples from collecting ducts showed gains of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 18. In cysts, gains of chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 10, 12, and 16 and loss of chromosomes 15, 16, 21, and 22 were frequently observed. Copy number profile in cysts was similar to that of papillary RCC and acquired cystic disease-associated RCC.<br \/>Conclusion: In the end-stage cystic kidney, proximal tubules and cysts showed an enrichment of driver mutations commonly found in papillary RCC and RCC with acquired cystic disease, reflecting the fact that the incidence of these two types of RCC increases as the duration of dialysis becomes longer. In addition, clear cell RCC drivers, such as <i>VHL<\/i> mutation and loss of chromosome 3, were not observed, possibly explaining the rare occurrence of clear cell RCC in hemodialysis patients. Since cysts had more frequent copy number alterations than remaining tubules, cysts in the end-stage kidney might be precursor lesions of RCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Tumorigenesis,Mutations,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kosuke Ieiri<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nobuyuki Kakiuchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomonori Hirano<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomomi Nishimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Koichi Watanabe<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroko Tanaka<sup>2<\/sup>, Satoru Miyano<sup>2<\/sup>, Dai Takamatsu<sup>3<\/sup>, Keisuke Monji<sup>3<\/sup>, Eiji Kashiwagi<sup>3<\/sup>, Masaki Shiota<sup>3<\/sup>, Junichi Inokuchi<sup>3<\/sup>, Masatoshi Eto<sup>3<\/sup>, Seishi Ogawa<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Kyoto Univ.

Using whole genome sequencing (WGS), we recently characterized the SV landscape of 752 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients, identifying 68 SV hotspots and 152 recurrent copy number aberrations (CNA; Rustad et al. Blood Cancer Discovery 2020). Despite comprehensive annotation, more than half of SVs were not linked to any known MM genomic driver. The biological impact of these SV events, here defined as rare SV, occurring in 93% (702\/752) of patients, is unknown.<b><\/b><b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To study the biological impact of rare SVs, we interrogated WGS (n=752) and RNAseq (n=591) in the CoMMpass trial. Recurrent SVs identified by involvement in canonical Ig translocations, recurrent CNAs, or SV hotspots were excluded. All SVs within an event must not involve a recurrent region to be defined rare. To determine SV class-specific gene relationships, breakpoint enrichment was compared against a permuted background model for each SV class and gene expression direction, up to 1 Mb. Genes were considered affected if expression was above a gene specific outlier Z-score of +\/- 2. Lastly, we modeled breakpoint density to the nearest MM superenhancer up to 10 MB, and compared to permuted background rates.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the total 8,942 SVs, 4,959 (55%) were identified as rare. 201 (34%) patients had at least 1 enriched rare SV event associated with gene expression outliers. Amongst over-expressed gene outliers, rare templated insertions and duplications were enriched within the gene body and up to 1 MB away. Rare inversions were enriched in genes 100kb and 1MB away, and rare translocations were associated with outliers 1 MB away. Amongst under-expressed gene outliers, rare complex SVs were enriched within the gene body, while deletion SVs were enriched in the gene body and up to 1 MB away. Rare duplications, translocations and templated insertions were enriched up to 1 MB of superenhancers. Rare templated insertions were significantly enriched against the background model (p &#60; 0.001, Fisher Exact).

There remains a significant difference in outcomes among black women, whose mortality\/incidence ratio is 0.68 - the highest among all ethnic groups. Little is known about racially-defined biological key determinants of OC disparity. We recently characterized transcriptomic and methylomic profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors (HGSOC) from black vs. non-Hispanic white women (NHW) to understand the observed disparity in survival.<br \/>Methods: Nucleic acids were extracted from treatment-na&#239;ve HGSOC specimens (30 black and 26 NHW) and used for DNA methylation (EPIC array) and RNA-sequencing. Differential expression was performed using EBseq; pathway enrichment was performed using Enrichr. TIMER was used to deconvolute immune cell infiltration based on RNA-seq results, and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) was used for validation. Top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by qRT-PCR and studied functionally.<br \/>Results: 191 and 825 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in HGSOC tumors from black vs. NHW women (FDR-adjusted p-value &#60; 0.10). Significantly enriched pathways among these DEGs included multiple classes of <i>GPCRs <\/i>-<i> Class A, Monoamine GPCRs, and Peptide GPCRs<\/i>. Among DEGs, calmodulin like-5 gene <i>CALML5, <\/i>involved in GPCR signaling, was significantly downregulated in tumors from black patients (0.086 fold-change). <i>CALML5<\/i> downregulation in tumors from black vs. NHW women was validated by qRT-PCR. <i>CALML5<\/i> knockdown by using shRNA disrupted colony and tumor sphere formation (p&#60;0.05). Analysis using TIMER predicted that CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> memory-resting T-cells were enriched in tumors from black patients. mIHC validated increased infiltration by CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FOXP3<sup>+<\/sup> lymphocytes in humors from black women, as well as increased expression of PD-L1, supporting an immunosuppressive phenotype. Global, modest hypermethylation was discovered in tumors from black vs. NHW patients: 47 CpGs were hypermethylated (FDR-adjusted p-value &#60; 0.10) and 19 regions were differentially methylated between the two groups.<br \/>Conclusions: We identified significant transcriptomic and modest methylation differences in HGSOC tumors from black and NHW patients. Pathway enrichment within GPCR-signaling was observed and an immunosuppressive phenotype was identified. Further exploration of the contribution of these differences to clinical outcomes and treatment response in black women is needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Ovarian cancer,Methylation abnormality,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hao Huang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Russell Keathley<sup>1<\/sup>, Ping Xie<sup>1<\/sup>, JianJun Wei<sup>2<\/sup>, Ernst Lengyel<sup>3<\/sup>, Bin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniela Matei<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medicine; Hematology\/Oncology Division, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology\/Section of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9ca4eb09-97e9-4e0a-a910-0343c361f7b6","ControlNumber":"2437","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

It features relatively aggressive biologic behavior among thyroid cancers, but its genomic landscape has not yet been fully explored. Here, we conducted multi-omics data (whole genome sequencing (WGS), and bulk (bulk RNA-seq) or single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)) on &#8203;&#8203;MTC, and found genetic characteristics of MTC and a new gene signature predicting aggressiveness of tumors. WGS was performed for 35 pairs of tumor specimens and normal thyroid tissues from 30 patients. And bulk RNA-seq for 59 samples (20 normal thyroid tissues, 26 primary MTCs, 9 recurred lymph nodes, and 4 metastatic lymph nodes) and snRNA-seq for 3 primary MTCs, and 2 recurred\/metastatic lymph nodes were also performed. In WGS results, we verified driver mutations, including RET, RAS, and BRAF. Four patients were classified as germline RET mutations based on familial history. Somatic RET M918T mutations were occurred in 8 patients, 9 patients were observed other RET mutations. Also, we observed other somatic mutations such as HRAS and BRAF. Seven patients occurred somatic HRAS mutations (Q61L, Q61R, G13R, A11 and G15), and somatic BRAF mutations (G469A, K601E) were observed in two patients. We found broad-level copy-number alterations in ~50% of patients, and we also found a patient who shows whole-genome duplication. The copy-number alteration was associated with aggressive phenotype in MTC. In addition, we found complex rearrangements such as microhomology-mediated break-induced replication in five patients. Interestingly, we found intra-tumoral heterogeneity of several genes related to C cell differentiation through snRNA-seq analysis by comparing clusters of tumor cells. Using the genes, we calculated the C cell differentiation score of the samples with bulk RNA-seq by GSVA algorithm. This score was related to poor clinical characteristics such as recurrence. In conclusion, multi-omics profiling of MTC reveals that copy number alterations and C cell differentiation status are the important biomarkers for cancer aggressiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Gene profiling,Medullary thyroid cancer,Single nucleus RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seong Eun Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Seongyeol Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Shinae Yi<sup>1<\/sup>, Joonoh Lim<sup>2<\/sup>, Na Rae Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, JungHak Kwak<sup>3<\/sup>, June-Young Koh<sup>2<\/sup>, Boram Yi<sup>2<\/sup>, Jaemo Koo<sup>2<\/sup>, Jae Won Chang<sup>4<\/sup>, Young Seok Ju<sup>2<\/sup>, Bon Seok Koo<sup>4<\/sup>, Jin Man Kim<sup>5<\/sup>, Young Joo Park<sup>6<\/sup>, Minho Shong<sup>7<\/sup>, Eun Kyung Lee<sup>8<\/sup>, Jae Kyung Won<sup>9<\/sup>, Yea Eun Kang<sup>7<\/sup>, Kyu Eun Lee<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chungnam National University, College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>GENOME INSIGHT THECNOLOGY Inc, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Seoul National University Hospital & College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chungnam National University, College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Chungnam National University, College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital & College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Chungnam National University, College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea, Republic of,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital & College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8a439aeb-1aa7-4113-a0b3-80846b898cb8","ControlNumber":"5804","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

These patients are eligible to and usually receive untargeted, first line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and\/or chemotherapy with heterogeneous outcomes. To identify potential predictive biomarkers for the stratification of nsqNSCLC patients without actionable genetic alterations, a comprehensive molecular profiling of this subpopulation was performed using the Foundation Medicine genomic database.<br \/>Methods: Molecular profiles from 53,119 nsqNSCLC patients were analyzed using the FoundationInsights<sup>TM<\/sup> web platform. After the patients with known and likely functional short variants for EGFR and fusions for ALK and ROS1 were excluded, the prevalences for commonly altered genes were determined. Pathway analysis was conducted with Metascape. Statistical significance and enrichment in PD-L1 and tumor mutation burden (TMB) biomarker overlap with altered genes was calculated using a fisher exact test against an alteration negative cohort.<br \/>Results: nsqNSCLC patients without actionable genetic alterations can be described as a heterogenous population with different genetic alterations. We found a total of 103 genes with an individual, minimal prevalence of &#62;1% to be the major descriptors that collectively were found in most patients of the nsqNSCLC subpopulation. These genes relate to pathways involved in cell cycle, cell proliferation, response to growth factors or chromatin organization. Out of the most frequently altered genes, we identified those that are associated with PD-L1 or TMB high status for which ICI treatment is most effective in nsqNSCLC.<br \/>Conclusions: The results supported the lack of a general association with high PD-L1 and high TMB calls for biomarker informed treatment options for nsqNSCLC patients. We reported a subpopulation of nsqNSCLC patients that can be described by certain genetic alteration, of which some were associated with ICI-related biomarkers for which patients might benefit from a future precision oncology approach utilizing combined targeted and ICI treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Real-world data,Biomarker,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andreas Kloetgen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Danyi Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Coenen-Stass<sup>1<\/sup>, Ioannis Gounaris<sup>3<\/sup>, Julia  F.

SS are characterized by a pathognomonic t(X:18) translocation leading SS18: SSX1\/2\/4 fusion. Small studies (n&#60;100) described molecular background beyond this fusion in patients and the transcriptomic profile of SS remains poorly known. The aim of our study is to provide a large cohort analyzing transcriptomic and co-alterations to better understand and treat SS.<br \/>Methods: We present a clinico-biological cohort study including all adult patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of afvanced SS from January 2000, registered in the French Sarcoma database (NETSARC+) and with available formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) archival tumor samples and clinical data. FFPE tumor samples were analyzed by dedicated whole-exome RNA-sequencing (WERS) to assess transcriptomic, small nucleotide variation (SNV) and fusions.<br \/>Results: 122 patients (133 samples) met the study criteria, including 11 patients with paired primary-metastatic tumor samples. Clinical characteristics (age, sex, tumor grade, primary and metastasis site distribution) were consistent with expected SS population. The SS18:SSX1\/2\/4 fusion was found in all patient (90% by WERS and if negative, by FISH). Unsupervised analyses of transcriptomic data by principal component analyses, hierarchical sample clustering or UMAP revealed heterogeneity in gene expression. Clinical factors (age, sex, grade, tumor type, complete response to treatment, survival) did not correlate with transcriptomic profiles. Immune cell analyses confirmed a low infiltration of immune cells, notably poor in CD8+ T cells. Cancer testis antigens such as NYESO-1, MAGE-A4 were both expressed with a heterogeneous co-expression of other CTAs across samples. In the 11 primary-metastatic paired- samples, no gene pathway was found differentially expressed between primary and metastatic samples cohort with the exception of lung tissue specific genes. Comparing chemotherapy-na&#239;ve versus pre-treated samples did not identify differential expression of specific genes across samples. Single Nucleotide Variant analyses was reliable on 84% FFPE samples and revealed an overall low Tumor Mutational Burden with some samples harboring canonical oncogene pathogenic mutations of BTK, RAS, NF1, RB1 as well as in DNA repair pathway(15% spanning over ATM ATR,CHK2, BRCA1\/2 PALB2 CHK2, FANCM, RAD51), PI3K pathways (PI3KCA E545K) and other poorly described in SS.<br \/>Conclusion: Investigating the largest cohort of metastatic SS by whole-exome RNA-sequencing, revealed Synovial Sarcoma, usually classified as &#8220;simple genomic sarcoma&#8221; is a translocation-related sarcoma harboring heterogeneous transcriptomic and numerous SNV co-alterations including targetable mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Molecular profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Helene Vanacker<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mehdi Brahmi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yannick Le Meitour<sup>2<\/sup>, Julien Bollard<sup>2<\/sup>, Valery Attignon<sup>3<\/sup>, Alexandra Meurgey<sup>4<\/sup>, Myriam Jean-Denis<sup>5<\/sup>, Laurie Tonon<sup>3<\/sup>, Shibani Pokras<sup>6<\/sup>, Erika Klohe<sup>7<\/sup>, Michael Nathenson<sup>8<\/sup>, Kristin Blouch<sup>9<\/sup>, Ioanna Eleftheriadou<sup>10<\/sup>, Jean-Yves Blay<sup>1<\/sup>, Franck Tirode<sup>2<\/sup>, Armelle Dufresne<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medical Oncology Department, UNICANCER Centre LÃ©on BÃ©rard, Lyon, France,<sup>2<\/sup>CITI department, Centre de Recherche contre le Cancer de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Department Of Clinical Research And Innovation, UNICANCER Centre LÃ©on BÃ©rard, Lyon, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Bio-pathology platform, UNICANCER Centre LÃ©on BÃ©rard, Lyon, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Department Of Translational Research And Innovation, UNICANCER Centre LÃ©on BÃ©rard, Lyon, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Oncology Cell & Gene Therapy, Global Medical, GSK, Collegeville, PA,<sup>7<\/sup>Oncology Experimental Medicine Unit, GSK, Collegeville, PA,<sup>8<\/sup>Oncology Cell & Gene Therapy, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA,<sup>9<\/sup>Oncology Clinical Development, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA,<sup>10<\/sup>Oncology Experimental Medicine Unit, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6c61cfdf-0c8e-4f3c-9837-a9f3eb1e067b","ControlNumber":"6072","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Certain SVs, such as chromosomal aneuploidy, whole-genome doubling (WGD), have specific therapeutic implications. The underlying cellular processes present in the tumor are reflected in mutational signatures. Here, we describe the landscape of chromosomal aneuploidy, WGD and mutational signatures in the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Patient-Derived Models Repository (NCI PDMR) to facilitate the investigation of their roles in therapeutic responses of the preclinical models.<br \/>Method: Chromosome arm-level aneuploidy was called by scoring at the individual arm level if &#62;90% of the arm copy number (CN) was gained\/lost based on whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. Aneuploidy score was defined as number of arms with aneuploidy. WGD was determined by derived allelic specific CN, purity and ploidy from tumor\/normal matched samples and permutation test. Mutational signatures (COSMIC v3) including single base substitutions (SBS), doublet base substitutions (DBS), small insertions and deletions (ID) and CN signatures were derived using SigProfiler for specimens with somatic mutations and CNs.<br \/>Results: A large fraction (85%) of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (N=755) have at least one arm -level aneuploidy. Certain chromosomes and arms (7, 8, 17p and 18) are more frequently aneuploid, which might be biased due to the overrepresentation of gastrointestinal cancer in the cohort. Histology specific differences were observed in the frequency of arm level aneuploidies. For example, synovial sarcoma (SYNS) and endometrioid carcinoma (UEC) have much lower level of aneuploidy than non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) models. 61% of PDX models (N=277) have WGD, in which certain histologies have more WGD [NSCLC: 81%, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC): 71%] than others. Samples having WGD have a higher degree of aneuploidy and chromosomal instability. WGD and aneuploidy remain stable along the passages in 78% PDX models. Intra-model heterogeneity of WGD was observed due to lineage difference. Mutational signatures (SBS6,15,20) indicating concurrent DNA polymerase epsilon (<i>POLE<\/i>) mutation and defective DNA mismatch repair were highly enriched in microsatellite instability-high models (p&#60;0.01, Fisher&#8217;s exact test). Among 30 PDX models where the patients had known platinum-based chemotherapy history, 40% of them had an identifiable platinum chemotherapy treatment signature (SBS31 or DBS5). Chromothripsis associated amplification signature (CN8) was enriched in models with WGD (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: We have characterized chromosomal aneuploidy, WGD and mutational signatures in NCI PDMR models. The models with SVs can be utilized in preclinical drug studies to understand their role in therapeutic response in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,chromosomal aneuploidy,whole-genome doubling ,mutational signatures,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Li Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Biswajit Das<sup>1<\/sup>, Ting-Chia Chang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yvonne  A.

UC relapse and progression are common and impose a significant negative impact on the lives of patients and healthcare resources. To elucidate the biological mechanisms of UC and find novel biomarkers, we analyzed the clinical and genomic data in the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN). We conducted gene-based and gene-set based association tests on rare germline variants comparing the exome sequencing of 336 UC patients and genome sequencing of 366 healthy controls (42 unrelated individuals from the Centre d'Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain [CEPH] families and 324 from the University of Utah Heritage 1000 [H1K] Projects). The analysis of loss-of-function (LoF) variants revealed that the forkhead box (FOX) J2 gene set was significantly associated with UC at the genome-wide level (Bonferroni-corrected p-value=0.01). Genes in this gene set contain a motif that matches the FOXJ2 transcription factor binding site. Firth-penalized Cox proportional hazard regression on overall survival identified LoF variants in genes down-regulated in naive CD8 T cells to be associated with worse prognosis (Bonferroni-corrected p-value=0.032, hazard ratio=28.2, and 95% confidence interval 6.66 to 119.0). In exome sequencing of tumor tissues, we searched for driver genes and pathways by testing for higher variant allelic fractions than the genome average.

Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC) are largely orphan for integrative genomic studies. Large studies are needed to delineate the genomic complexity and heterogeneity of NMIBC.<br \/>Methods: A total of 438 patients with NMIBC were analyzed, 296 of which were part of the UROMOL cohort (PMID: 27321955). The median follow-up was 5 years. The progression rate was 13% (n= 56). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on DNA from tumor (~150x) and matched germline samples to call somatic mutations. Additionally, shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS; ~2x) was performed on DNA from 362 of the tumors to quantify CNAs. RNA-sequencing was available for 414 of the samples, and tumors were classified according to the UROMOL2021 transcriptomic classes. We identified significantly mutated genes by mutsigCV and significantly amplified or deleted regions by GISTIC2.<br \/>Results: The median tumor mutation burden (TMB) was 3.7\/Mb. TMB was not associated with progression (<i>p<\/i>=0.28). A total of 61 genes were significantly mutated in the cohort, the most frequent being <i>FGFR3<\/i> (61%), <i>KDM6A<\/i> (44%) and <i>KMT2D<\/i> (38%). Mutations in<i> EP300<\/i> and <i>RHOB<\/i> were significantly associated with an increased risk of progression after adjusting for grade and stage (<i>p<\/i>=0.040 and 0.044, respectively). Several mutations showed a strong transcriptomic class dependent occurrence: mutations in <i>RB1, TP53, ERCC2<\/i> and <i>ERBB2<\/i> were enriched in the aggressive class 2a, <i>FGFR3<\/i> and <i>STAG2<\/i> in class 1 and class 3, and <i>KMT2C<\/i> and <i>KMT2D<\/i> in class 3.<br \/>Genome doubling was identified in 15% of the tumors. These tumors were enriched in the aggressive classes 2a and 2b and were associated with increased risk of progression (p=0.0049). In addition, we observed several significantly altered genomic regions, the most significant being deletions in 9p21.3 (<i>CDKN2A<\/i> &#38; <i>CDKN2B<\/i>, 64%), 2q37.1 (<i>GIGYF2<\/i> &#38; <i>EIF4E2<\/i>, 28%) and amplification in 11q13.3 (<i>CCND1<\/i>, 9%). Class 2a tumors were enriched for genomic alterations in most of the significant regions. 9p21.3 was the only region with frequent homozygous losses (22%). High-level gains were prognostic of progression, independently of ploidy, stage and grade, for several regions, including 4p16.3 (<i>FGFR3<\/i>, <i>p<\/i>=0.00013), 17q23.2(<i>TBX2<\/i>, <i>p<\/i>=0.0004) and 8p11.23(<i>ZNF703, p<\/i>=0.011). In addition, we observed an enrichment of uniparental disomy in 4p16.3 (<i>FGFR3<\/i>, 8%).<br \/>Conclusion: Here we investigated the landscape of DNA alterations in NMIBC in a large patient cohort of NMIBC samples with paired transcriptomic data and detailed clinical follow-up. We identified several novel genomic alterations; specifically, we showed that 15% of the tumors had genome doublings, and we identified a complex underlying copy number landscape of the region containing <i>FGFR3<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Copy number variation,Bladder cancer,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Frederik Prip<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Philippe Lamy<sup>1<\/sup>, Iver Nordentoft<sup>1<\/sup>, Sia Viborg Lindskrog<sup>1<\/sup>, Trine Strandgaard<sup>1<\/sup>, Karin Birkenkamp-DemtrÃ¶der<sup>1<\/sup>, Gregers G.

Risk of relapse and death is high across all patient groups, including those diagnosed at early stage. OCS is biphasic, comprising both carcinomatous and sarcomatous populations, leading to its historic consideration alongside true sarcomas. However, we now recognize that OCS in fact represent metaplastic carcinomas, with the sarcomatous component having undergone complete epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) from carcinoma. Detailed understanding of shared and compartment-specific OCS biology has the potential to identify therapeutic opportunities to improve patient survival.<br \/>Methods: We recently curated the largest pathologically-confirmed OCS cohort to date. Here, we perform compartment-specific profiling of 12 cases by mRNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing, microRNA (miRNA) profiling and quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These data paint a detailed picture of shared and compartment-specific biology between matched carcinomatous and sarcomatous compartments.<br \/>Results: The sarcomatous compartments harbored significantly fewer infiltrating CD8+ cells (P=0.006), with a significantly lower CD8+:CD3+ cell ratio compared to the carcinomatous components (P=0.002). In 11 of 12 cases, identical <i>TP53<\/i> mutations were identified in both cell populations; the remaining case was <i>TP53<\/i> wild-type in both compartments. Paired analysis of mRNA sequencing identified 1477 significantly differentially expressed transcripts at FDR&#60;0.01. The sarcomatous compartments demonstrated significantly higher MAPK activity, as determined by the MPAS transcriptomic score (P=0.042). Principal component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering of miRNA expression grouped samples by compartment (carcinomatous versus sarcomatous), rather than by patient, suggesting global differences in the miRNA landscape. Paired analysis identified 131 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs between the two populations (FDR&#60;0.01). Significantly enriched miRNA gene targets were identified using The MiRNA Enrichment Analysis and Annotation Tool (miEAA), identifying key EMT-associated gene targets, including <i>SIRT1<\/i>, <i>PRDM16<\/i>, <i>ZEB1<\/i>, <i>ZEB2<\/i> and TGFB signaling components, among other biological processes.<br \/>Conclusions: Carcinomatous and sarcomatous compartments of OCS demonstrate marked differences in transcriptomic profiles, immune engagement and miRNA expression patterns. Identification of shared <i>TP53<\/i> mutations between compartments supports the notion that OCS represent metaplastic carcinomas. Shared biological events represent opportunities for targeted interventions that may be efficacious against both cell populations, while compartment-specific biological events allude to mechanisms by which the carcinomatous population undergoes EMT to form the sarcomatous compartment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Gene expression analysis,MicroRNA,Whole exome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Robert L.

These lesions possess a propensity for local invasion into adjacent structures including the skull base, brain, and orbit. Owing to relatively mild symptoms during early stages, which resemble benign sinonasal disease, most patients are already in clinically advanced stages when diagnosed. Therefore, despite improvements in endoscopic surgical approaches, radiotherapy and imaging techniques, the 5-year overall survival for advanced SNSCC patients remains poor (~40%).<br \/>Inverted sinonasal papilloma (IP) is a locally aggressive, benign epithelial neoplasm arising in the paranasal sinuses which has a high recurrence rate and transforms to SNSCC in 10%-25% of cases. As some IP evolve to malignant neoplasms, it has been presumed that they represent an intermediate step in SNSCC progression. However, the current tools for detecting altered epithelial cells, such as clinical examination and histological characteristics, have limited prognostic value for predicting which IP will progress to malignancy, and the link between IP and invasive disease remains unclear.<br \/>Activating mutations in EGFR and PIK3CA genes as well as loss-of-function mutations in TP53 have been reported in a few very small cohorts of IP and SNSCC lesions, suggesting their role in IP pathogenesis and progression to invasive malignancy. Other observed alterations potentially associated with malignant transition include KRAS mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 9p21 locus (containing p16INK4a), mismatch repair genes deficiency, amplification of FGFR1 and SOX2 genes, as well as NF&#954;B, COX2 and HOXA9 overexpression. While these studies provide a snapshot of molecular changes in SNSCC, genetic alterations critical to the development of SNSCC are poorly understood, and the exact mechanism underlying malignant transformation remains unknown.<br \/>In this study we have used PandaOmic, a multi-omic data analysis and visualization algorithm, to perform a first comprehensive integrative analysis of WES, mitochondrial sequencing and transcriptomic data obtained from 11 IP lesions, matched invasive SNSCC tumors and histologically normal paranasal sinus epithelium collected from the same patients. Our analysis reveals heterogeneous mutational patterns, gene expression changes and signaling pathways features associated with SNSCC pathogenesis, and provides crucial insights that may aid in the development of novel means of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this rare, aggressive and poorly characterized malignancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Genomics,Malignant progression,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alka Singh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nikita Babushkin<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Korzinkin<sup>3<\/sup>, Viktoria Sarkisova<sup>3<\/sup>, Vasudha Mishra<sup>1<\/sup>, Ari Rosenberg<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Lingen<sup>4<\/sup>, Justin Bishop<sup>5<\/sup>, Alex Zhavoronkov<sup>3<\/sup>, Nyall London<sup>6<\/sup>, Nishant Agrawal<sup>7<\/sup>, Xuanyao Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Evgeny Izumchenko<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>Medicine, Section of Section of Genetic Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>3<\/sup>InSilico Medicine, Pak Shek Kok, Hong Kong,<sup>4<\/sup>Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>5<\/sup>University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX,<sup>6<\/sup>Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD,<sup>7<\/sup>Surgery, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6dbbbfeb-7b86-4953-8ad4-cceee159b7bb","ControlNumber":"5747","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

However, the comprehensive profiling of FBXW7 in CRC is largely underrepresented in current studies. Herein, we present molecular profiling of FBXW7 in human CRC cohorts and clinical outcomes.<br \/>Methods: 7626 colorectal cancer patients were retrospectively enrolled. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or fresh tumor samples using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel covering 425 cancer-related genes, and matching plasma samples were sequenced to exclude germline mutations. The patients&#8217; microsatellite instability (MSI) score, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and chromosomal instability (CIN) score were measured. 3541 colorectal cancer patients in the MSK MetTropism cohort with survival data were analyzed for survival outcomes and risk factors. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. 263 patients in the TCGA COAD cohort with RNA sequencing data were analyzed for immune cell infiltration and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). P values in multiple comparisons were FDR (false discovery rate) adjusted. Tests with P values or FDR less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.<br \/>Results: The cohort had a median age of 59 (20-93), with 60.45% male patients. The median TMB of the cohort was 7.78 muts\/Mb (1.11-655.56). There were 1227 (16.1%, &#62;12 muts\/Mb) hypermutated and 187 (2.5%, &#62;100 muts\/Mb) ultrahypermutated tumor-carrying patients. Within the cohort, a total of 7442 (97.6%) patients had identifiable microsatellite status, of which 548 (7.4%) were MSI. The FBXW7 mutation carrying rate was 17.9% (1365). Compared to FBXW7 wild type (WT) patients, FBXW7 mutated patients had higher TMB (P &#60; 0.001), higher MSI score (P &#60; 0.001), and lower CIN score (P &#60; 0.001). In the MSK cohort, 500 (14.1%) patients with FBXW7 mutations showed better overall survival (HR: 0.67; 95%CI: 0.55-0.80, P &#60; 0.001). The most mutated sites of FBXW7 were R505C (54), R465H (47), R465C (44). Among them, R465C showed worse OS in multivariate cox analysis when compared with other FBXW7 mutations (HR: 1.6; 95%CI: 1.13-3.1, P = 0.015), and when compared with all other mutations (HR: 1.87; 95%CI: 0.99-2.5, P = 0.053). In the immune cell infiltration analysis using the TCGA COAD cohort, patients with FBXW7 mutations displayed higher M1 macrophage (P = 0.014), CD8+ T cell (P = 0.008), and regulatory T cell (P = 0.011) infiltration rates. In the GSEA analysis, in MSI patients, 11 hallmark gene sets are significant enriched in FBXW7 mutated patients, including interferon gamma response (FDR = 0.031), allograft rejection (FDR = 0.026), etc.<br \/>Conclusions: Comprehensive profiling of FBXW7 in colorectal patients revealed that FBXW7 mutations were associated with better OS, except the FBXW7 R465C mutation was identified as an indicator for worse OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),FBXW7,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hanlin Chen<sup><\/sup>, Hua Bao<sup><\/sup>, <b>Haimeng Tang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xue Wu<sup><\/sup>, Yang Shao<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc., Nanjing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b7405d7e-1067-410d-88f0-284f1a39fb6d","ControlNumber":"2309","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

We characterize novel LGRs based on predicted pathogenicity and take a closer look at genes that acquire both germline and somatic mutations within our samples. Detection method was validated using ddPCR assay of commonly investigated LGR genes.<br \/>Results: In total, 15,659 samples from across 22 cancer types were retained for analysis after filtering. We observed that, in our cohort, the cancer type with the highest proportion of LGRs are ovarian cancer (4.7%), renal cell carcinoma (2.5%), breast cancer (2%), glioma (1.8%), and thyroid carcinoma (1.8%). Annotation of detected germline variants revealed several genes containing novel LGRs including <i>MSH2<\/i>, <i>FANCA<\/i>, and <i>PMS2<\/i>. We observed co-mutational events between LGR in <i>MSH2<\/i> and somatic mutations in <i>BRCA2, KTM2B, KDM5A, CHD8<\/i>, and <i>HNF1A<\/i>. Furthermore, our analysis shows that samples with pathogenic and likely pathogenic germline LGR mutations tended to also have higher mutational burden, chromosomal instability, and microsatellite instability ratio compared to other samples with non-LGR germline mutations.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated the prevalence of LGRs beyond that of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> and <i>RB1<\/i> in breast and ovarian cancer. Our profiles of these pathogenic\/likely pathogenic alterations can potentially fuel further investigations and highlight new understanding of LGRs in multiple cancer types.<table border=\"1\"

However, the molecular underpinnings that lead to the initial steps of metastasis have not been well characterized. We have performed integrative whole exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of primary prostate tumor foci and corresponding lymph node metastases (LNM).<br \/>Design: Primary tumor foci (PTF) and LNM from 40 patients with high-risk PCa were analyzed by RNAseq. Two or more PTF and all available LNM greater than 0.4cm were subjected to sequencing. Of these 40 patients, 17 (42.5%) had LNM and 23 (57.5%) had benign LNs. A total of 155 tissue samples (97 PTF, 39 benign LNs, and 19 LNM) were sequenced and mapped to the human transcriptome with STAR mapper after QC trimming and removal of adapter sequences using TrimGalore. Differentially expressed genes between PTF, LNM, and benign LNs were identified using DESeq2, and gene set enrichment analysis was performed using WebGestalt. WES data was analyzed using GATK pipelines including Mutect2.<br \/>Results: A median of 57 million paired-end reads were obtained per sample, with a median of 10 million total readcounts per sample across the transcriptome, and 39,021 transcripts were detected in at least 5% of samples. Comparing PTF to LNM, 6203 transcripts were differentially expressed (p-adj &#60; 0.01). PTF were enriched relative to LNM in gene sets associated with Wnt signaling, hormone signaling, Hippo signaling, <i>KRAS <\/i>signaling, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Comparing PTF from metastatic patients to non-metastatic patients, 1265 transcripts were differentially expressed (p-adj &#60; 0.01). PTF from metastatic patients were enriched in gene sets associated with cell cycle progression, oxidative phosphorylation, ER stress, fatty acid metabolism, and DNA repair. LNM gene sets were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative phosphorylation. The top 500 upregulated genes in malignant tissues were significantly enriched in genes related to androgen and estrogen signaling as expected. We also identified a set of 193 genes whose expression was significantly increased in primary tumor over benign LNs and in LNM over primary tumors.

Surgery and chemotherapy are the primary treatments for OvCa, but 80% of late-stage OvCa patients experience chemo-resistant recurrence, which necessitates the development of new treatment strategies. The genomic diversity within a tumor and the interactions among various cell types within its microenvironment are considered key factors contributing to therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, women who harbor germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk of developing high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). To understand the genomic consequences, including somatic alterations, associated with defective DNA repair, tumor DNA and RNA was isolated from fresh frozen OCT embedded sections from 15 HGSC patients with BRCA1\/2 mutation and 10 without any alterations in the BRCA genes (BRCA-wt). Whole exome sequencing (WES) and total RNA-seq was performed to determine the association of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair gene defects with tumor mutation burden (TMB), neoantigen load (NL), and immunological assessment of tumor microenvironment. TMB was calculated from mutation rates of somatic WES. Germline exome analysis was used to validate inherited BRCA mutations. To identify the somatic mutations, somatic single nucleotide variants and InDels were detected using Strelka. TP53 mutations were most common with several other genes showing only modest mutation frequency. Mutation signatures were also detected with maftools and compared to the COSMIC mutational signature database. BRCA-mutated samples displayed a unique mutational signature associated with defects in HR DNA repair pathway. We also observed heterogeneity in copy number variation profiles amongst cases, as determined by the tool Sequenza. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis indicated differential enrichment of P53 pathway, MAPK pathway, and PTEN pathway, in addition to numerous pathways related to immune cell signaling and immune response. RNA-seq data was analyzed with CIBERSORTx and revealed different proportions of 22 immune effector cell types that accompany tumor cells within the HGSC microenvironment. Additional analyses are underway, including measuring differences in NL in BRCA-mutated versus BRCA-wt cases.

However, sourcing cell donors, editing cells and generating large batches of clinical grade allogeneic CAR-T and CAR-NK can be challenging. To overcome these difficulties, we are developing NK and T cell-based therapies derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs have the capacity to be genetically engineered, enabling precise edits that can enhance the function of cell therapies, and indefinitely expanded in culture, allowing for the production of highly uniform master cell banks. Yet, an open question of this system is the extent to which the donors&#8217; genetic background shapes the phenotype of the iPSC-derived NK and T cells. To answer this question, we measured the genome-wide landscape of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in iNK cells generated from multiple donors. Donor background was linked to significant changes in chromatin accessibility (~30% of regions tested) and expression (~15% genes). We found accessibility changes at binding sites for transcription factors regulating various aspects of NK cell function, including differentiation (GATA2, EOMES, and ETS1), activation (AP-1, T-bet), and cytokine production (STAT3, STAT5), indicating that the donor background could impact the functionality of iPSC-derived NK cells. In particular, we noted that iNK cells derived from one donor, which had decreased effector functions compared to other cell lines, showed increased accessibility at BACH2 binding sites, a key negative regulator of NK cell function. iNK cells derived from this donor also showed an increase in expression of genes linked to NK cell differentiation and cell development, and a decrease in genes involved in cell cycle, cell proliferation, and inflammatory response pathways. Taken together, these data indicate the importance of assessing the impact of donor background on iPSC derived cell therapies through a variety of functional and genomic assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,Genomics,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rohith Srivas<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Snehal Nariya<sup><\/sup>, Melissa Rojsza<sup><\/sup>, Barry  A.

Slow progress in OS and LMS is partially due to insufficient characterization of the genomic landscape. Generating large genomic datasets in OS and LMS is challenging because of the rarity of these sarcomas and recruitment barriers such as care fragmentation between institutions and specialties. The OS and LMS Project research studies aim to: 1) establish a network of engaged pediatric and adult participants with OS and LMS who will co-create a shared database of clinical, genomic, molecular, and patient reported data to enable research; 2) define the clinicogenomic landscape of OS and LMS; and 3) optimize the approach to direct patient engagement in cancer research. Count Me In, a research initiative with prior success in angiosarcoma, working with patients and advocates created websites (OSProject.org and LMSProject.org) where patients register and consent to participation. Within two months of launching, 233 patients age 6-79 from 149 Institutions have consented. Blood and saliva are collected from consented participants, tumor samples are obtained from pathology departments and medical records are requested from treating hospitals. WES and WGS of tumor and normal, and RNASeq of tumor is performed. ctDNA is obtained and sequenced. Results are shared with patient, advocacy, physician and research communities in several ways. Individual participants receive a shared learning report describing the somatic variants identified in their tumor from paired tumor-normal WES and are offered genetic counseling and clinical germline testing. Registered participants receive updates via email and Project websites. There are regular pre-publication data releases to the genomic data commons and to cBioPortal. A physician engagement committee meets regularly to discuss clinical insights and conundrums from shared learning reports and germline testing. Patient accrual over the next 3 years is anticipated to result in sequencing of 750 tumor-normal pairs and 500 ctDNA samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Pediatric cancers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katherine A.

DNA and RNA extraction was performed from FFPE samples using Quick-DNA &#38; RNA FFPE MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research). Next Generation Sequencing analysis was performed using SOPHiA Solid Tumor Solutions Kit (SOPHiA GENETICS, Saint Sulpice, Suiza) , which detects 42 DNA genes and 137 fusion genes with the platform MiSeq System (Illlumina, San Diego, California). Data underwent QA and QC and variants were analysed through Sophia commercial pipeline for somatic aberrations.<br \/>Results: Among 231 patients, 82% were women, average age 45 +\/- 13 y-o, 97% from Colombia, with institutional pathologic diagnosis of PTC. The most frequent histological subtypes were Classic PTG (33%), Follicular Infiltrative (29%) and Tall cell (23%). Identification of clinically relevant molecular alterations was done (see table 1). The most frequent SNV mutations were BRAF-V600E (72%), TP53 (9%) and IDH1-R132H (8%). The most frequent insertions or deletions (INDELS) were found in KIT (75%). We identified 8 fusion genes (most frequent were RET-CCD6 and ETV6-NTRK3). Interestingly, we detected 3 MSI positive cases.<br \/>Conclusions: PTC molecular profile by NGS can allow us to improve molecular understanding of the disease and identify possible prognostic factors and treatment targets.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{4D6F6045-A65B-4FE5-B8D2-2F2A7E8B03B8}\"><caption>Table 1.

However, the prevalence and clinicopathological association of <i>PALB2<\/i> germline PV\/LPV in Middle Eastern breast and ovarian cancers is not fully identified.<br \/>Purpose: We retrospectively screened a cohort of 918 cancer patients (791 breast cancer and 127 ovarian cancer) from Saudi Arabia using targeted capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) method for <i>PALB2<\/i> germline variants regardless the family history of these patients or the presence of other hereditary cancer susceptibility genes mutations. Clinicopathological criteria were also fully analyzed.<br \/>Results: Five heterozygous PVs or LPVs were identified in six cases, accounting for 0.65% (6\/918) of entire cohort. Two cases (33.3%) harbored PVs and four cases (66.7%) carried LPVs. Four PVs\/LPVs (80%) were frameshift along with one novel splicing LPV (c.2835-1 C&#62;A). One recurrent LPV (c.3425delT) was identified in two cases. All six affected carriers have breast cancer diagnosis with median age of 39.5 years (range 34-49 years). Only two cases (33%) have documented family history of cancer.

Here, we present the landscape of <i>ERBB2<\/i> genetic alterations (alts) and co-mutations, and the comparison between ERBB2 and EGFR exon 20 insertions in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Two large retrospective cohorts were analyzed. In the Geneplus (China) cohort, 1,281 newly diagnosed NSCLC patients (pts) harboring <i>ERBB2<\/i> alt were analyzed based on tissue and\/or ctDNA. In the Guardant360 (Guardant Health, Redwood City, USA) cohort, 1719 ctDNA profiles of newly diagnosed NSCLC samples harboring <i>ERBB2<\/i> alts were evaluated, with clonal alterations defined as those with &#8805;50% ratio of the maximum somatic variant allele fraction.<br \/>Results: In the Geneplus cohort of 1,281 pts with <i>ERBB2<\/i> alts, 55% were female with a median age of 58 years. <i>ERBB2<\/i> mutations or insertions were identified in 930 pts, <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification(amp)-only in 351 pts, with mutation and co-amp at 7.5%. Most common alterations were in the tyrosine kinase domain exon 20 (85%), with Y772_A775dupYVMA to be the most frequent (57.4%), followed by G776delinsVC\/LC\/VV\/IC (10.6%), and S310X (10.4%). <i>EBRR2<\/i>-mutation NSCLC were frequently having PDL1&#60;1% (63%) and low TMB (mean 3.5). <i>TP53 <\/i>and <i>EGFR <\/i>were most frequent co-mutations. <i>CDK12<\/i> amp was frequently co-occurring with <i>ERBB2<\/i> amp as both were located to Chr17q12. In the Guardant360 cohort, 54% were female with a median age of 70 years. 634 had COSMIC\/OncoKB annotated oncogenic mutations. Similar to Geneplus, Y772_A775dupYVMA (39.4%), S310F (10.7%), G776delinsVC\/LC\/VV (9.7%) were the most common alterations. Using Y772\/G776\/G778 insertion as the control, a clonality cut-off of 50% had a positive prediction value of 87.5%. When this clonality cut-off was applied to all the other variants of unknown significance (VUS), 335 (19%) samples had clonal mutations with S335 (n=9), D277Y (n=6), R499W (n=4), and G222C (n=4) being most frequent. Comparison between ERBB2 Exon20 (n=370) to EGFR (ERBB1) exon20 insertions (n=323) showed a different distribution of patterns with greater heterogeneity in EGFR exon20 insertions.<br \/>Conclusion: In two large independent cohorts, Chinese and Western, <i>ERBB2<\/i> mutation and co-mutation patterns were similar. <i>ERBB2<\/i> exon 20 insertions\/mutations were dominant at over 80% with Y772_A775dupYVMA being the most common driver mutation; <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>EGFR<\/i> were the most frequently co-occurred genes. <i>ERBB2<\/i> mutation lung cancers had low TMB and PDL1, as expected in female dominant lung adenocarcinomas, similar to EGFR exon 20 NSCLC. Clonal VUSs may represent a novel subset of mutations to functionally characterize.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,ErbB2,EGFR,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lingzhi Hong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Leylah Drusbosky<sup>2<\/sup>, Yinyi Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuanyuan Xiong<sup>4<\/sup>, Rongrong Chen<sup>4<\/sup>, Simon Heeke<sup>1<\/sup>, Monique  B.

The Cancer Dependency Map Initiative aims to dramatically accelerate PCM by systematically identifying the landscape of cancer vulnerabilities across all tumors. Genome-wide knockout screens have been performed in over 1000 cancer cell lines, but these have been sourced from historically derived models, leaving many cancers underrepresented. Advances have been made in model derivation by growing cells in 3D formats, such as organoids or spheroids. These models present an opportunity to screen new cancer types, but come with challenges that require a new pipeline. Here, we present a set of screens using a genome wide CAS12 library in organoid tumor models representing novel subtypes of pancreatic, esophageal, and gastric cancer, along with treatment-resistant breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer organoids. We show that genome-wide screening of these models is feasible and can be achieved with quality comparable to 2D cell lines. Our work uncovered a set of novel dependencies associated with cell-ECM interactions that have not previously been identified in 2D models. Our methods provide a framework for screening future patient derived 3D culture models and discovering vulnerabilities in new tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Organoids,Pancreatic cancer,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  V.

Dysregulation of this pathway has been observed across a range of cancer types and results in an altered activity of its primary downstream effectors, the oncogenic transcription factors YAP\/TAZ. For example, both germline and somatic loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF2,<\/i> a component of Hippo, induce hyperactivation of YAP\/TAZ, transcriptional changes and ultimately result in tumor growth. The Hippo signaling pathway is an attractive target for drug discovery efforts, however, it is highly complex and still incompletely understood. Hence it is indispensable to get a deeper insight into the Hippo - YAP\/TAZ signaling axis. To this end, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB231 (<i>NF2<\/i><sup>LOF<\/sup>) expressing a YAP\/TAZ reporter construct. We identified both negative and positive regulators of YAP\/TAZ in breast cancer cells. In a second step, screening hits were further characterized in a focused single-cell CRISPR screen (Perturb-Seq), aiming at better understanding of the effects on YAP\/TAZ activity regulation and downstream effects on gene expression. Here we present the technical details of our screening approaches and the results of perturbing known and novel regulators of YAP\/TAZ on single cell level. We discuss the use of Perturb-Seq in the initial validation of hits from genome-wide screens and provide data that may serve as a basis for future drug discovery efforts, seeking for novel and effective treatments for triple-negative breast cancers and other malignancies with Hippo pathway alterations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,CRISPR,Single cell,YAP\/TAZ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mareike Berlak<sup>1<\/sup>, Zuzanna Makowska<sup>1<\/sup>, Filippos Klironomos<sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Kuehnlenz<sup>2<\/sup>, Atanas Kamburov<sup>2<\/sup>, Andreas Steffen<sup>2<\/sup>, Martin Lange<sup>3<\/sup>, Barbara Nicke<sup>3<\/sup>, Ralf Lesche<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Staller<sup>1<\/sup>, Charlotte Kopitz<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Jan Naujoks<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Functional Genomics, NUVISAN ICB GmbH, Berlin, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>NUVISAN ICB GmbH, Berlin, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"606307c1-91cc-44b6-ab09-d508084ffa69","ControlNumber":"6343","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.
