[{"Abstract":"African American (AA) men have the highest incidence and mortality rate from Prostate cancer (PCa) than any other racial\/ethnic group. To understand this racial disparity, molecular features of different types, including gene expression, DNA methylation and other genomic alterations, must be carried out in tumor samples from these 2 populations. To date, PCa genomic studies have largely under-represented tumor samples from AA men due to lack of inclusion of significant numbers in such studies. In this study we carried out genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in 63 clinically annotated fresh-frozen PCa and 50 normal prostate tissues from AA men using the Illumina Infunium 850K Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip array. mRNA expression database from a sub-set of the AA biospecimen were used to assess correlation of transcriptome and epigenomic datasets. Using bioinformatic analysis to integrate a comprehensive set of genomic datasets we identified probesets that were significant (p&#60;0.01) and differentially methylated in AA PCa compared to normal prostate tissues and were significant (p&#60;0.01) and inversely correlated with AA mRNA expression. GO analysis in this AA cohort showed significant differential methylation that were mostly hypermethylated genes with corresponding down-regulated mRNA expression for top genes associated with biological pathways in hemidesmosome assembly, mammary gland development, epidermis development, hormone biosynthetic process and cell communication. On the other hand, few significant differential top hypomethylated genes and corresponding up-regulated mRNA expression were identified in biological pathways of negative regulation of macrophage differentiation, cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor activity, protein destabilization, transcription corepressor activity and fatty acid biosynthetic process. Furthermore, we identified significant and differential methylated genes in our AA PCa cohort that were associated with PCa progression when compared to the TCGA EA and AA dataset. These genes were <i>AMIGO<\/i>3, <i>IER<\/i>3, <i>UPB<\/i>1, <i>GRM<\/i>7, <i>TFAP<\/i>2C, <i>TOX<\/i>2, <i>PLSCR<\/i>2, <i>ZNF<\/i>292, <i>ESR<\/i>2, <i>MIXL<\/i>1, <i>BOLL<\/i> and <i>FGF<\/i>6. Overall, IPA of differential methylated promoter region are genes enriched for network involved in sex-steroid hormonal signals and tumor microenvironment signaling pathways. <b>Our integrative analysis provides new candidate genes associated with prostate cancer progression in AA men as potential targets for <\/b>improving prostate cancer treatment and addressing the racial disparity problem.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,DNA methylation,Gene expression profiling,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bernard Kwabi-Addo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Somiranjan Ghosh<sup>2<\/sup>, Chad Creighton<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Ittmann<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Howard University, Washington, DC,<sup>2<\/sup>Biology, Howard University, Washington, DC,<sup>3<\/sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4b83b7e9-71d5-4c67-8dd2-2d4db6d78a76","ControlNumber":"913","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

We have performed global DNA methylation profiling using the Illumina EPIC array (&#62;800K loci) of 32 dermoscopically ('globular' vs 'non-globular' pattern) and histopathologically classified nevi, together with matching adjacent perilesional skin, and discovered that methylation patterns can accurately decompose the proportion of cell types present in the tissue. In this study, we sought to assess whether there are differences in the DNA methylation profiles of histologically normal skin samples that surround nevi, independent of cellular composition. Among the 739,270 CpG loci included in the analysis, there were a total of 8,200 CpG loci identified as significantly differentially methylated (Q &#60; 0.05) in &#8216;globular skin&#8217; vs &#8216;non-globular skin&#8217; adjusted for age, sex, and the estimated relative proportions of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and melanocytes in each sample. After imposing a more stringent threshold (M value of &#8805;0.5) a total 816 CpG loci were found to be DM, with 696 loci identified as significantly hypermethylated, and 120 loci significantly hypomethylated (Q &#60; 0.05 and &#916;M &#62; 0.5) in &#8216;globular&#8217; vs &#8216;non-globular&#8217; skin. Mapping of the DM (Q &#60; 0.05 and |&#916;M| &#60; 0.5) CpG loci to their respective genes revealed that eight of the top 20 DM genes, by proportion of differentially methylated loci, were positioned in proximity to suggest regulation of members of the HOX gene family. We next assessed the differential gene expression of the eight DM HOX genes in the perilesional skin as well as the matching adjacent nevus. After adjusting for age, sex, and sample cellular composition, none of the assessed HOX genes demonstrated statistically significant (P &#8804; 0.05) differential expression in the nevi, however, &#8216;non-globular skin&#8217; demonstrated a statistically significant (P &#60; 0.05) increase in the expression of five of the eight <i>HOX<\/i> genes relative to &#8216;globular skin&#8217;. Importantly, this increased gene expression corresponds to the methylation status of the DM loci. HOX genes are known to be involved in limb and axial development as well as the positioning of dermal fibroblasts. Moreover, melanocytes from different anatomic positions have distinct transcriptional profiles and the anatomical position of melanocytes plays a key role in determining whether genetic alterations will subsequently drive melanoma formation. This positioning of melanoma subtypes (cutaneous vs acral) was recently shown to be related to interaction of specific <i>HOX<\/i> genes with site-specific oncogenic alterations. The distinct <i>HOX<\/i> gene family members we have revealed, differ to those related to melanoma development and positioning, as such we propose that these may contribute to the positioning of acquired melanocytic nevi, and in combination with common somatic alterations in <i>BRAF<\/i>, may contribute to nevus formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,DNA methylation,Epigenetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Meghan  E.

Bevacizumab, a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, is approved for treatment of patients with ovarian and other cancers. Despite the wide use of anti-VEGF therapy for cancer treatment, most patients develop resistant disease. Therefore, new combinations\/strategies are needed to reduce adaptive resistance to anti-VEGF antibody (AVA) therapy. Our aim is to determine the potential role of epigenetic changes in AVA-adaptive resistance. We identified and characterized epigenetic changes in BARD1, a tumor suppressor, at the emergence of AVA resistance.<br \/>Methods: To define epigenetic changes during AVA therapy induced resistance, we performed series of in vitro (methylation array, RNA sequencing) and in vivo (orthotopic OC (PDX-MDA-OVCA1, immunocompetent-IG10, and immunocompromised-SKOV3) and fibrosarcoma-HT1080, an inherently VEGF resistant model) experiments. The biological effects of DNA methylation agent (5`-Azacytidine; 5`-Aza) with B20 (murine anti-VEGF antibody) treatment were subsequently tested using in vivo models.<br \/>Results: To determine whether 5`-Aza can enhance the efficacy of AVA therapy and overcome resistance to AVA in OC, we established AVA-resistant SKOV3 model. In AVA-resistant mice treated with B20 + 5`-Aza, there was a statistically significant reduction in tumor weight (p=0.03). Next, we performed a Human 450k methylation and mRNA arrays from xenografts of SKOV3 tumors. Based on both analyses, we demonstrated that BARD1 was one of the top candidate which was highly expressed (p=0.02) and less methylated (p&#60;0.05) in the combination of B20 and 5`-Aza group compared to B20 alone. Our data also showed that BARD1 expression was restored in the combination therapy. The sequential treatment with 5`-Aza reverted the resistance towards the AVA therapy in SKOV3 model. Furthermore, the combination of B20 and 5`-Aza significantly decreased tumor weight in SKOV3 (p=0.005), IG10 (p&#60;0.05), MDA-OVCA1 (p=0.01), and HT1080 (p&#60;0.05). BARD1 expression levels were substantially increased in combination therapy compared to the B20 alone group (&#62;4-fold, p=0.006). Tumor weight and BARD1 expression were inversely correlated. To determine the biological significance of BARD1, we knockdown BARD1 using Tet-inducible shRNA system. Our data showed a significant reduction in tumor weight in the BARD1 knockdown group in SKOV3 model (p=0.021). RNA-sequencing of BARD1 knockdown showed an enrichment of the angiogenesis pathway. Moreover, BARD1 expression levels were decreased in hypoxic conditions both in vitro and in vivo.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings indicate a previously unrecognized role for BARD1 in mediating resistance to AVA therapy. Use of epigenetic drugs to control the expression of tumor suppressor genes may enhance the efficacy of AVA therapy in OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bevacizumab,Ovarian cancer,Epigenetics,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emine Bayraktar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cristian Rodriguez-Aguayo<sup>1<\/sup>, Sudhir Kumar<sup>2<\/sup>, Elaine Stur<sup>1<\/sup>, Lingegowda  S.

Advances in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) have enabled profiling methylomes at full resolution and stimulated interest to explore dynamics of DNAm across tumor sites and cancer treatment. A major challenge in the analysis of patient data is that a surgically removed tumor sample represents a mixture of cancer cells and microenvironment, and that the insights on DNAm changes are intertwined due to mixed effects from patient epigenomic background, tissue context, and treatment pressure. By using a computational approach, these effects can be decomposed into patient background, tissue site, and treatment phase specific changes, and controlled for natural microenvironment variation. retion, and action, as well as in several oncogenic signaling cascades. The analysis of the tissue profiles indicated that the progression of HGSC from the tissues-of-origin to the metastatic deposits is accompanied by drastic changes in DNAm profiles. Thus, when comparing ovaries and peritoneum, intra-abdominal tissues mesentery and omentum featured prominent change of promoter DNAm: loss in 10% and gain in 20% of genes. Interestingly, the genes with aberrant DNAm included ABC transporters implicated in pumping drugs across the cell membrane, as well as the members of MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades. The joint analysis of both treatment and tissue contributions suggests that the overall modest effect of NACT is further reduced in metastases, mediated via DNAm changes in genes involved in multidrug resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Ovarian cancer,DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexandra Lahtinen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Giovanni Marchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Daria Afenteva<sup>1<\/sup>, Susanna Holmström<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaisa Huhtinen<sup>2<\/sup>, Anni Virtanen<sup>1<\/sup>, Johanna Hynninen<sup>2<\/sup>, Antti Häkkinen<sup>1<\/sup>, Sampsa Hautaniemi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Turku, Turku, Finland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6e7a9096-4e89-42e6-9e19-6ebd7f1b0430","ControlNumber":"2862","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

Breast cancer (BC) is the main malignant neoplasm in women and has the highest incidence and mortality rates worldwide. About 10% of all BC cases are hereditary and its most common form is Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC).In a study conducted by our research group in a cohort of 300 Mexican women with HBOC using a panel of 143 genes of susceptibility to different types of cancer (Quezada-Urban et al., 2018), we found that 74% of patients were negative for variants in the coding regions and only 15% of patients had at least one pathogenic variant in 18 different genes<i>.<\/i> In several types of hereditary cancer syndromes, it has been shown that germline genetic alterations such as single nucleotide variations, and indels in <i>cis <\/i>of the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes modify the methylation pattern and cause epigenetic silencing and the concomitant somatic loss of heterozygosity. These events are known as secondary <i>cis <\/i>epimutations and represent an alternative mechanism of molecular pathogenesis in patients with hereditary cancer syndromes. In this work we are investigating in germline gDNA the methylation profile in the promoter region of 18 tumor suppressor genes in 231 patients negative for pathogenic variants and 156 matched controls by using direct bisulfite massive parallel sequencing. So far, we have extracted gDNA and treated with sodium bisulfite from all patient and control samples. From the converted gDNA, we amplified the promoter region of the 18 study genes by PCR (9,675 endpoint PCR products). We have prepared a total of 387 genomic libraries from which we perform massive sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of 229 patients, 74 controls and 2 positive controls. Currently, we have found 4 patients with promoter hypermethylation in the <i>RAD51C<\/i>, <i>POLH<\/i>, <i>EPCAM<\/i>, and <i>BRCA1<\/i> genes that can be generated by a secondary <i>cis<\/i> epimutation. We have found statistically significant differences in the methylation levels of the promoter regions of the <i>BRCA1\/2, PMS2, FANCI, MLH1, PALB2, POLH, ERCC3, ATM, MSH2, BRIP1, <\/i>and <i>EPCAM <\/i>genes in patients compared with controls. This result suggests that low level basal methylation marks could be potential biomarkers of HBOC pathogenesis. Interestingly, our studies indicate that hypermethylation at the promoter of <i>MSH2, PALB2, BRIP1,<\/i> and <i>EPCAM <\/i>are associated with HBOC risk, and that specific hypermethylation at the CpG sites of <i>MSH2 <\/i>and <i>PALB2<\/i> (cg47630224 and cg23652916, respectively), could be potential biomarkers in HBOC risk. Lastly, according to preliminary <i>in silico<\/i> results, the co-occurrence of site-specific hypermethylation in <i>MSH2 <\/i>and <i>PALB2<\/i> is possibly due to the absence of interaction of the common transcription factor SP4 in a GC-box site.

We have developed a new anion-exchange column for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrostatic and hydrophobic properties. Both cytosine and thymine, corresponding to methylated and unmethylated cytosine after bisulfite modification, respectively, are captured by electrostatic interaction and then discriminated from each other by their hydrophobic interactions. This method is expected to be very suitable for quantification of DNA methylation levels of cancer cells in urine samples with contamination of various cell lineages.<br \/>Purpose: The aim of this study was to establish a less invasive and more accurate method for UTUC diagnosis based on DNA methylation quantification by our newly developed HPLC.<br \/>Methods: Urine samples were collected by urinary catheterization during surgery for 218 urological cancer patients. Our previous studies have identified 4 CpG sites showing differences in DNA methylation levels between non-cancerous urothelium and UTUC based on genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using tissue specimens. In the present study, DNA methylation levels of these marker CpG sites were quantified by HPLC using the urine samples.<br \/>Results: The thresholds have been set for the retention time by HPLC and the area under the chromatogram. Diagnostic criteria have been established to distinguish cases with current UTUC from non-urothelial cancer cases, bladder cancer cases and post-urothelial cancer treatment cases by combining marker CpG sites. The sensitivity and specificity were 90.9% and 87.0% respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Since HPLC-based DNA methylation diagnostic system was able to discriminate UTUC cells from blood cells and other contaminating cells in urine samples, application of our criteria will ultimately allow non-invasive diagnosis of UTUC in the clinical setting. It may be possible to at least partially replace highly invasive procedures such as ureteroscopy and to enable early initiation of treatment for UTUC resulting in improved prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Urine,Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mao Fujimoto<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eri Arai<sup>1<\/sup>, Takuya Kikushima<sup>2<\/sup>, Naotaka Nishiyama<sup>2<\/sup>, Tomofumi Nakamura<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuriko Yamada<sup>3<\/sup>, Hiroaki Taira<sup>3<\/sup>, Takuya Yotani<sup>3<\/sup>, Hiroshi Kitamura<sup>2<\/sup>, Yae Kanai<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Sekisui Medical Co., Ltd., Ryugasaki, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"baa3e440-0a10-4381-981f-c4cb4ba37909","ControlNumber":"2554","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

In this study, we analyzed somatic mutations of tumor-related genes and promoter methylation of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) in oral malignancies\/premalignancies, and analyzed their association.<br \/>Materials and Methods: 39 oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and 2 oral epithelial dysplasias (OEDs) were obtained as fresh-frozen?. Somatic mutations of 46 tumor-related genes, 13 TSGs and 33 oncogenes, were analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS).

More comprehensive studies of key molecular alterations in CRC progression were urgent. DNA methylation promotes tumor progression. However, the mechanism of the ANKRD13 gene methylation that drives colorectal cancer evolution remains largely unknown. This was the first study focused on the role of ANKRD13 and the hypermethylated mechanisms in colorectal cancer.<br \/>Methods: Chi-Square tests were utilized to the comparison of the baseline characteristics of patients with hypomethylation ANKRD13B and hypermethylated ANKRD13B. Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to estimate the difference of overall survival between the two groups patients. The methylation level of ANKRD13B was quantified by qMSP in colorectal cancer, normal colon epitheliums and colorectal adenoma tissues. CRISPR\/dCas9-DNMT3A and CRISPR\/dCas9-TET1-CD methylation editing tools were applied to enable targeted and specific CpG methylation at the CpG loci near stop codon of ANKRD13B. Transwell-migrated assay, wound scratch assay and colony formation assay were preformed to ascertain the abilities of viability, migration and invasion in the editing CRC cell lines. The methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and 5-AZA treatment assays were performed combined with qPCR to quantify the m6A levels of ANKRD13B mRNA following hypermethylated-editing.<br \/>Results: Here, we identified a novel oncogenic gene, ANKRD13B, encoding ankyrin repeat domain 13B. This gene was frequently hypermethylated in CpG islands surrounding the stop codon region of colorectal cancer. This hypermethylation was associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Compared with normal tissue (4.2%), this type of epigenetic alteration upregulated ANKRD13B expression in both adenoma (73.0%) and adenoma cancer tissues (83.3%) (P&#60; 0.0001), and it also promoted colorectal cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration. Demethylation treatment can reduce the ANKRD13B expression and the growth, migration, and invasion of the cancer cell. Moreover, we found that the aberrant ANKRD13B methylated surrounding the stop codon, and it can promote RNA N6-methyladenosine methylation modification, suggesting that aberrant DNA 5mC methylation promotes ANKRD13B expression and tumor progression in an RNA m6A-dependent manner.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, our findings illustrated that ANKRD13B is an oncogenic gene of colorectal cancer that is commonly methylated and overexpressed in colorectal cancer whose function in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer depends on RNA m6A-dependent manner.

Two DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are currently in clinical use with several others undergoing clinical evaluation, and the pharmacodynamic response of DNMT enzymes is a crucial aspect of understanding therapeutic effects in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Vigorous fit-for-purpose validation of research-grade reagents and the application of effective quality control testing procedures to assess lot-to-lot variability (and reject unacceptable lots) are essential to assure robust and reproducible pharmacodynamic assay performance. During the antibody validation process for the DNMT3B enzyme target, two commercial monoclonal antibody clones were found to exhibit significant cross-reactivity to another cellular protein and inappropriate subcellular localization via immunohistochemistry (IHC) , including diffuse cytoplasmic staining and significant staining in a DNMT3B knock out (KO) cell line. Two other commercial monoclonal antibody clones showed the expected nuclear expression in the HCT116 parental cell line and lack of staining in the DNMT KO cells. Further evaluation via western blot revealed that the cross-reacting antibodies detected a band of the approximate expected molecular weight (MW) of DNMT3B but of a protein that was expressed equivalently in the parental and DNMT3B KO cell line pair, whereas the two other antibody clones only detected a significant band of correct MW in the parental but not the KO cell line. These results suggest that some commercial antibody clones are binding to a protein other than DNMT3B and that they are unsuitable for use with IHC and western blot to evaluate subcellular localization and expression levels of DNMT3B protein. We presume that these non-specific antibody clones were chosen for commercial development based on target screening via Western blot that did not include evaluation of a validated DNMT3B knock out cell line, as is not uncommon for research-grade antibody clones. This data highlights the critical importance of thorough fit-for-purpose validation and quality control for crucial reagents used for pharmacodynamic biomarker studies.

Specific changes in CpG methylation occur in many human cancers, making them a promising biomarker for early cancer detection. However, existing assays can be costly, lack specificity to regions of interest and often provide only semi-quantitative estimates of the methylation fraction. Here, we present a targeted methylome panel to decrease costs associated with next generation sequencing (NGS), methylation controls to calibrate quantitative assays and UMIs for accurate deduplication in low-diversity samples.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Genomic DNA (gDNA) was prepared for sequencing using the Twist Methylation Detection System consisting of enzymatic methylation conversion and hybrid capture using the Twist Human Methylome Panel. Twist&#8217;s synthetic CpG methylation level controls were spiked-in to gDNA and taken through the Twist Methylation Detection System to demonstrate their utility in calibrating methylation assays. Additionally, libraries were generated using cell free DNA (cfDNA) and either conventional or UMI-containing adapters to investigate the impact on quantitative detection and total unique coverage.<br \/>Results: Using the Twist Human Methylome Panel at 150x raw coverage achieves uniform coverage with low off-bait Picard metrics. 6.59 million CpG sites were detected using a minimum depth of 10X. Target capture with the Human Methylome Panel allows for informative CpG calling of up to 82 samples on a single Illumina Novaseq S4 flowcell, compared to 3 samples per flowcell with a tradition whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) assay. The Twist CpG methylation specific controls are constructed of 48 unique contrived sequences that contain a total of 8 different levels of methylation, ranging from 100% to 0%. Including these controls allows for quantitation of methylation levels in the experimental samples and qualification of the enzymatic conversion process.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Our study leverages the Twist methylation detection portfolio to interrogate genome-wide methylation patterns for various applications.

Furthermore, different from genetic mutations, which are irreversible, epigenetic mutation is reversible and could be restored to normal status. The potential reversibility of epimutation presents new therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.<br \/>Methods and Results: We utilized an epigenetically engineered mouse cancer model in which the expression of <i>p16<\/i> (also known as Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) is silenced by accumulating DNA methylation at the promoter region (<i>p16<sup>meth<\/sup><\/i>). To investigate whether <i>p16<\/i> epimutation functionally contributes to the lung cancer initiation and progression, we obtained Cre recombinase inducible <i>K-ras<sup>+\/LSL-G12D<\/sup><\/i> mice from the Jackson Laboratory and crossed them with <i>p16<sup>meth<\/sup><\/i> mice to produce <i>K-ras<sup>+\/LSL-G12D<\/sup>; p16<sup>meth\/meth <\/sup><\/i>mice (with combined <i>K-ras<\/i> mutation and <i>p16<\/i> epimutation). These mice have been maintained on the C57BL\/6J background. We administered 5x10<sup>7<\/sup> pfu of adenovirus-Cre (Ad5-CMV-Cre) to mice at 20 weeks (wk) of age through intranasal instillation to activate oncogenic <i>K-ras<\/i>. We monitored the lung tumor development at 6, 8, 12, and 16 wk post-infection. Remarkably, as early as 6 wk post-infection, we found substantially increased tumor numbers and sizes in the <i>K-ras<sup>+\/LSL-G12D<\/sup>; p16<sup>meth\/meth <\/sup><\/i>mice compared with the <i>K-ras<sup>+\/LSL-G12D <\/sup><\/i>mice (n=4 per group). Histopathological analyses confirmed the tumor progression to adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, the <i>K-ras<sup>+\/LSL-G12D<\/sup>; p16<sup>meth\/meth <\/sup><\/i>lung tumors exhibited distinct papillary and intraluminal growth patterns, which were not observed in mice with <i>K-ras<\/i> mutation alone. In addition, to investigate the therapeutic effects of reversing <i>p16<\/i> epimutation, we generated MEFs from these mice and compared the efficiency of <i>p16<\/i> reactivation by either a standard hypomethylating agent 5-Aza-2&#8217;-Deoxycytidine (DAC) or a first-in-class reversible DNMT1-selective inhibitor GSK3685032. We found that GSK3685032 induced <i>p16<\/i> demethylation more effectively than DAC. Treatment of GSK3685032 at 1.5&#181;M for 6 days resulted in robust <i>p16<\/i> hypomethylation (58% loss) and three-fold increase in gene expression.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study validates that <i>p16<\/i> epimutation functionally contributes to lung cancer initiation and provides an ideal <i>in vivo<\/i> preclinical platform for testing epigenetic therapeutic strategies","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Targeted therapy,p16,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaomin Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Brisnna Lawrence<sup>1<\/sup>, Leah Farmer<sup>1<\/sup>, Li Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Craig Perry<sup>1<\/sup>, David Joel Sequeira<sup>1<\/sup>, Lanjing Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Lanlan Shen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>USDA Children’s Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Princeton Medical Center, Plainsboro, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"53dcc17e-67f8-474f-b2d2-ee2d3ecd85d2","ControlNumber":"3833","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Somatic loss of heterozygosity in the remaining <i>NF1<\/i> allele in Schwann lineage cells gives rise to benign tumors known as plexiform neurofibromas. These tumors have a high risk of developing into cancerous lesions known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) through the sequential deletion of <i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i> followed by recurrent mutations in <i>SUZ12<\/i> or <i>EED, <\/i>constituting the inactivation of polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 is a transcriptional repressor complex involved in the silencing of several genes throughout cell development and differentiation. Loss of this complex leads to a depletion in trimethylation marks on Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and the subsequent gain of acetylation marks on the same lysine residue (H3K27Ac). However, full range of epigenetic consequences of these events are currently not well characterized, especially with respect to MPNST formation and development. The Largaespada lab has developed Schwann cell lines engineered to harbor deletions in <i>NF1<\/i> and either <i>SUZ12<\/i> or <i>EED<\/i> and assayed the methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites using the EPIC array. The resulting methylation profiles reveal a large degree of change in promoter methylation between cell lines with and without PRC2 inactivation. These changes, however, appear to be inconsistent. To further understand this phenomenon, I have analyzed differential methylation patterns between lines with <i>SUZ12\/EED <\/i>deletions on top of <i>NF1<\/i> deletion compared to those with <i>NF1<\/i> deletion alone. Pathway analysis of genes whose promoters are differentially methylated upon PRC2 reveals a bias towards developmental modules such as morphogenesis and neuronal differentiation, suggesting that DNA methylation is a mechanism by which PRC2 loss promotes stemness in Schwann lineage cells prior to MPNST formation. Additionally, differentially methylated regions were overlapped with functional non-coding elements in the genome to understand potential ripple effects in the epigenome. These findings underline the importance of DNA methylation in contributing to tumor formation and define unique functions by which PRC2 specifically leverages diverse methylation states to drive malignant transformation in Schwann lineage cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Peripheral nerve sheath tumors,Chromatin remodeling,Stemness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher M.

CtDNA carries not only tumor- specific changes in its sequence but also distinctive epigenetic marks, namely DNA methylation patterns similar to the patterns in the primary tumor. Deregulation of tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns is an early event in carcinogenesis holding great promise to be exploited for early detection of cancer. However, in contrast to mutation detection, targeted DNA methylation sequencing of cfDNA remains a challenge due to low concentration and heavy fragmentation. The limiting step in detection of any analyte is the recovery of the DNA molecules. The pre-analytical steps in the DNA methylation detection pipeline include extraction of cfDNA molecules and their conversion using sodium bisulfite. Bisulfite conversion is a harsh chemical reaction that induces further fragmentation and degradation of already scarce cfDNA. In this study we compared commercial methods for cfDNA extraction and for bisulfite conversion to evaluate the yield, degradation and procedural loss. We compared five commercial kits for cfDNA extraction from blood plasma, three column-based (Qiagen&#8217;s QIAamp Circulating nucleic acids kit, Norgen&#8217;s Plasma\/Serum Cell-Free Circulating DNA Purification and Macherey-Nagel&#8217;s NucleoSpin&#174; Plasma XS) and two based on magnetic beads cleanup (Bioo Scientific&#8217;s Next Prep magnetic Cell-Free Circulating DNA isolation kitand Applied Biosystems&#8217; Magmax Cell-Free Circulating DNA isolation kit. The kits used for bisulfite conversion were Zymo EZ DNA Methylation Lightning with column based purification and with magnetic beads purification, Zymo EZ DNA Methylation Direct with column based purification and with magnetic bead purification, Qiagen Epitect Fast DNA Bisulfite and Diagenode Premium Bisulfite kits. Same samples were processed by each of the kits, Sample degradation was determined using Agilent Bioanalyzer dsDNA kit.

In countries with high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, such as Nigeria, HIV-associated HCC causes a great health burden due to its early onset, late diagnosis, and poorer prognosis. HIV infection is involved in inflammation of the liver, which may determine an increased risk of hepatocyte neoplastic transformation. Inflammation-related DNA methylation signatures obtained in liquid biopsy, such as circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) extracted from serum\/plasma are promising minimally-invasive biomarkers that may inform HCC among people living with HIV.<br \/>Methods: A total of 289 Nigerian participants with information on ccfDNA and other covariates were included. Participants were classified into three groups by their HCC\/HIV status: 1) HCC+\/HIV+ (n=28); 2) HCC-\/HIV+ (n=185); and 3) HCC+\/HIV- (n=76). We constructed ccfDNA methylation inflammation scores using 49 CpGs previously linked to circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, and higher scores represented elevated CRP concentrations with lower methylation levels. To compare the ccfDNA methylation inflammation score across the groups, we performed multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, alcohol consumption, smoking status, body mass index, study sites, and technical variables.<br \/>Results: Participants with HCC+\/HIV+ presented the highest ccfDNA methylation inflammation scores (mean=-0.03, standard deviation [SD] =0.01). Participants with HCC-\/HIV+ presented the lowest scores (mean=-0.05, SD=0.01). In the multivariable logistic regressions, one SD increase of inflammation score was associated with 2.5 times higher odds of having HCC among HIV-infected participants (HCC+\/HIV+ vs. HCC+\/HIV-; OR=2.56, 95% CI=1.39-4.73, P=0.002). No evidence was found for the association between the inflammation score and HIV status among HCC patients (HCC+\/HIV+ vs. HCC+\/HIV-; OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.59-1.70, P=0.991). In the secondary analysis comparing HCC+ vs. HCC- adjusting for HIV status, one SD increase of inflammation score was associated with 3.2 times higher odds of having HCC (OR=3.22, 95% CI=1.39-7.46, P=0.006).<br \/>Conclusions: We observed that ccfDNA methylation inflammation score is associated with HCC status among people with HIV. Our findings suggest that ccfDNA methylation-based inflammatory profiles may serve as a potential biomarker for early detection and risk stratification of HCC in resource-constrained countries with a high prevalence of HIV.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Inflammation,Cell-free DNA,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kyeezu Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yinan Zheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia Hawkins<sup>1<\/sup>, Edith Okeke<sup>2<\/sup>, Olufunmilayo Lesi<sup>3<\/sup>, Yishu Qu<sup>1<\/sup>, Lewis R.

In this study, we attempted to predict the risk of primary gastric cancer by performing a new multicenter prospective study. We recruited 1,880 healthy people, after <i>Helicobacter pylori<\/i> eradication, with a clinically high risk of gastric cancer. Biopsy specimens were obtained from the antrum and body, and the methylation level of <i>RIMS1<\/i>, which is a preselected epigenomic risk marker for this study, was measured in 1,757 participants. The participants are annually being followed-up to detect primary gastric cancer, for 5-8 years. Currently, the median follow-up is 4.05 years, and 27 people have developed primary gastric cancers (as of September 2022). The results of statistical analysis are being determined. This study will establish the clinical utility of a cancer risk diagnosis by epimutation burden in normal tissue, and is promising for application in various inflammation-associated cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,DNA methylation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Harumi Yamada<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Masahiro Maeda<sup>2<\/sup>, Seiichiro Abe<sup>3<\/sup>, Taichi Shimazu<sup>4<\/sup>, Takayuki Ando<sup>5<\/sup>, Kazunari Murakami<sup>6<\/sup>, Shinji Tanaka<sup>7<\/sup>, Takao Maekita<sup>8<\/sup>, Osamu Inatomi<sup>9<\/sup>, Ken Sugimoto<sup>10<\/sup>, Tetsuro Kawagoe<sup>11<\/sup>, Nobutake Yamamichi<sup>12<\/sup>, Toshikazu Ushijima<sup>13<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Epigenomics, Hoshi University, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Center for Epigenetics, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Science and Technology for Endoscopy, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Prevention, Center for Public Health Science, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterology, Oita University, Oita, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of General Internal Medicine, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan,<sup>8<\/sup>Second Department of Internal Medicine, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan,<sup>9<\/sup>Division of Digestive Endoscopy, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan,<sup>10<\/sup>Center for Clinical Research, Hamamatsu University Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan,<sup>11<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>12<\/sup>Center for Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>13<\/sup>President, Hoshi University, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"129c4e93-ac62-4174-8916-7db8f96165b5","ControlNumber":"4345","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

So far, <i>BRCA1<\/i> methylation with a PARP inhibitor is known as a synthetic lethality [Kawachi <i>et al<\/i>., Breast Cancer Res Treat, 181:323-329, 2020]. In this study, we aimed to identify a novel methylation synthetic lethal combination in gastric cancers. Founder methylation was searched for in 8,008 genes with putative promoter CpG islands (CGIs), and 137 genes which were 1) heavily methylated and 2) frequently methylated in primary gastric cancers (10 or more of 50 cases) were selected. The association analysis between DNA methylation and gene expression showed that 10 of 137 genes were completely silenced in gastric cancer cell lines with methylation of their promoter CGIs, but were expressed in those without. Among these 10 genes, we focused on <i>CHFR<\/i>, a known tumor-suppressor gene in gastrointestinal cancers, and genes lethal for <i>CHFR<\/i> methylation were screened for using the sgRNA screening database (The Cancer Dependency Map, DepMap). Comparison of gene dependencies of 17,645 genes between four cell lines with <i>CHFR<\/i> methylation and 12 cell lines without revealed that knockout of <i>KRAS<\/i> reduced cell growth specifically in cell lines with methylation. This synthetic lethality could be experimentally confirmed in two cell lines with <i>CHFR<\/i> methylation, AGS and 44As3, and three cell lines without, HSC41, HSC42, and MKN74. These cell lines included those not used in the screening, validating the usefulness of the combination. These results showed that gastric cancers with <i>CHFR<\/i> methylation were sensitive to KRAS inhibition, and that methylation synthetic lethality is a promising therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Epigenetics,Synthetic lethality,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hideyuki Takeshima<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takahiro Ebata<sup>1<\/sup>, Yumi Furuichi<sup>1<\/sup>, Satoshi Yamashita<sup>2<\/sup>, Toshikazu Ushijima<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Epigenomics, Institute for Advanced Life Sciences, Hoshi University, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Life Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Maebashi Institute of Technology, Maebashi, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3e7564da-bd21-41d4-88c2-8e0a58a8301d","ControlNumber":"4098","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

The intestine is a highly dynamic tissue with high turnover of intestinal epithelial cells throughout the life span of an individual making intestinal stem cells (ISCs) critical for normal gut homeostasis. Currently, there exists a lack of knowledge in how the gut microbiota regulates DNA methylation to influence the behavior of these ISCs. Aberrant DNA methylation is now documented to be critical in the disease pathogenesis of intestinal disorders such as colorectal cancer, thus understanding how the gut microbiome influences DNA methylation and ISCs is fundamental for improving human health.<br \/>Methods: We utilized the Lgr5-GFP mouse model in which endogenous GFP expression is driven by the bonafide intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5. These mice were maintained under two different housing conditions, conventional and germ free. We collected mice under the two conditions and performed dissociation of the colon and small intestine epithelial cells using EDTA dissociation. We then analyzed cell populations using flow cytometry, and collected two cell populations: the differentiated cell population (EpiCam +, GFP -) and intestinal stem cell population (EpiCam +, GFP +). To perform a genome wide comprehensive DNA methylation analysis we performed Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) which included both stem cell and differentiated cell populations of females and males at the two age groups points (postnatal day 21 (p21) and p100).<br \/>Results: There was no significant difference in CpG methylation at the global level between the two housing conditions. Next, we analyzed age matched samples from germ free and conventional mice to determine if there are differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with the presence of intestinal microbiota. We have identified DMRs that are maintained in germ free stem cells from p21 to p100 compared to conventional mice, as well as DMRs in the differentiated cell population at both ages. Interestingly in our analysis several genes displayed robust hypomethylation of control mice versus germ free mice at the p100 time point in both the stem cell and differentiated cell populations. One such gene, Ifitm3, has been heavily associated with chronic inflammation in the colonic epithelium and a poor risk factor for colonic cancer (Li D et. Al, Clin Cancer Res. 2011). We validated Ifitm3 methylation and expression changes between cohorts using pyrosequencing and RT-PCR respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: This comprehensive analysis has yielded top candidate genes for studying functional consequences of DNA methylation changes that have been previously linked to severe patient diseases including cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,DNA methylation,Gut microbiota,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Robert Craig Peery<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jiejun Shi<sup>2<\/sup>, Leah Farmer<sup>3<\/sup>, Li Yang<sup>3<\/sup>, Emily Lawrence<sup>3<\/sup>, Yumei Li<sup>4<\/sup>, Wei Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Lanlan Shen<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>USDA Children's Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>\u0009 USDA Children's Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>5<\/sup>Pediatrics, \u0009 USDA Children's Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e81e9a18-f990-416c-a33c-3043e14b1f9f","ControlNumber":"4580","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

We have investigated DNA methylation and gene expression alterations in mammary glands of Sprague Dawley rats induced by treatment with the weight-loss drug lorcaserin, a drug that increased the cancer incidence in a human clinical trial (CAMELLIA-TIMI 61) and in rats. Female Sprague Dawley rats received lorcaserin by gavage 7 days\/week for 12 weeks, at doses previously used in a 2-year rodent cancer bioassay (0, 30, and 100 mg\/kg bw\/day). DNA methylation changes were investigated in mammary glands, a target organ for lorcaserin carcinogenicity in rats, by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Gene expression changes were analyzed by RNA sequencing. Lorcaserin exposure resulted in dose-dependent DNA methylation alterations in the mammary glands, as evidenced by the presence of 1832 and 2352 significantly differentially methylated CpG (dmCpG) sites in the 30 and 100 mg\/kg bw\/day treatment groups, respectively, as compared to the control group, among which 593 sites were hypomethylated or hypermethylated in common. Similar to DNA methylation changes, lorcaserin treatment resulted in dose-dependent changes in gene expression. Pathway enrichment analysis of the dmCpG-containing genes demonstrated a strong representation of genes associated with cell morphology, cellular function and maintenance, and cellular growth and proliferation. Analysis of dmCpG sites indicated an increase in the number of hypermethylated sites compared to the number of hypomethylated sites in both 30 (1.9 fold) and 100 (2.6 fold) mg\/kg bw\/day treatment groups. Furthermore, while the number of hypomethylated CpG sites did not differ between treatment groups, the number of hypermethylated CpG sites in rats treated with 100 mg\/kg bw\/day of lorcaserin was 1.4 times greater than in rats treated with 30 mg\/kg bw\/day. By combining the analysis of differentially expressed genes and dmCpG sites, we identified 13 genes (11 hypermethylated and 2 hypomethylated) the expression of which was inversely correlated with DNA methylation in the mammary glands of rats treated with 100 mg\/kg bw\/day of lorcaserin. We also identified 41 hypermethylated and 17 hypomethylated genes containing more than two dmCpG sites. In summary, we have demonstrated that lorcaserin induces extensive DNA methylation and transcriptomic changes in mammary glands at early preneoplastic stages of lorcaserin-induced rat carcinogenesis. These findings suggest the importance of these non-genotoxic alterations in the carcinogenicity of lorcaserin.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Gene expression,Mammary gland,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Volodymyr  P.

The modified cytosines, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are identified using Illumina sequencing. Libraries are generated using either NEBNext&#174; EM-seq&#8482;, an enzyme-based workflow, or by using sodium bisulfite conversion. These methods, however, cannot differentiate between 5mC and 5hmC. Distinguishing these modifications is important as there is increased interest in 5hmCs role in regulating gene expression. Methods currently exist to enable discrimination of 5mC and 5hmC, for example, oxBS-seq and TAB-seq. These methods still rely upon sodium bisulfite conversion and have reduced data quality due to fragmentation and loss of DNA. Here we describe an enzymatic method that enables specific detection of 5hmC. 5hmC is detected using two enzymatic steps. Firstly, 5hmCs are glucosylated, which protects them from subsequent deamination by APOBEC. In contrast, cytosines and 5mCs are deaminated resulting in their conversion to uracil and thymine, respectively. During Illumina sequencing deaminated cytosine and 5mC are read as thymine and the glucosylated 5hmC are read as cytosine. Subtractive analysis of 5hmC data from EM-seq data, which detects both 5mC and 5hmC, permits the identification of individual 5mC and 5hmC sites. 5hmC data were generated for inputs of 0.1 ng to 200 ng DNA isolated from E14 mouse embryonic stem cells and human brain. The 5hmC libraries had similar characteristics to EM-seq libraries, including expected insert sizes due to intact DNA molecules, low duplication rates and minimal GC bias. T4147 phage DNA was used as an internal control, as all cytosines are 5-hydroxymethylated, with 98-99% of cytosines identified as 5hmC. 5mC and 5hmC levels were also profiled during E14 cell differentiation for 10 days. Interestingly, 5hmC levels decreased whereas 5mC levels increased particularly during the first five days of differentiation. LC-MS\/MS quantification of this same DNA mirrored the changes observed by sequencing. The ability to discriminate between 5mC and 5hmC will provide key insights into the role of these cytosine modifications in development and disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Epigenetics,Epigenomics,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Daniel  J.

Here, we aimed to discover distinctive potential factors to influence the prognosis in HBV-associated follicular lymphoma (FL). Retrospective investigation from multiple clinical centers showed that patients with HBsAg+ FL were featured with a higher incidence of disease progression within 24 months (POD24, <i>P<\/i>=0.031), shorter progression-free survival (PFS, <i>P <\/i>= 0.004) and overall survival (OS, <i>P <\/i>= 0.039). The patients with high HBV-DNA load (&#62;10^5 copies\/mL) had worse PFS (<i>P <\/i>&#60;0.001) and OS (<i>P <\/i>= 0.007). Methylation detection identified that POD24 in HBsAg+ FL were contributed by pro-tumoral methylated <i>KMT2A<\/i>,<i> EP300-AS1, <\/i>and<i> ARID1B<\/i>. The majority of MHC I class molecular retained hypermethylated status with silencing expression to promote immune escape and progression in HBsAg+ FL. Hypermethylated <i>TNFRSF1A<\/i> significantly contributed to prevent the POD24 of HBsAg+ FL, whereas hypermethylated <i>LTA<\/i> promoted progression. Regarding the unsatisfactory prognosis guidance based on FLIPI in patients with HBsAg+ FL, we proposed new scoring combined with HBV-related clinical parameters, contributed gene methylation and FLIPI to define a high-risk group with worse prognosis than FLIPI in our study (mean OS, 67.7 vs 69.8). It exhibited good performances in internal cohort and external validation cohort from other three clinical centers. Taken together, chronic HBV infection may affect methylation of the immune-related genes to promote progression in FL. The combination of clinical features and genes methylation with FLIPI could provide a better prognostic model for HBV-related FL.<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{87202686-D37A-4A81-8F42-028B760CA6E1}\"><caption>Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis with respect to progression-free survival of c<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun:'yes';font-family:'Times New Roman';mso-fareast-font-family:&#20223;&#23435;;

These tumors present high rates of recurrence and metastasis, and the patients&#8217; survival rates are very low (20% in five years). It is known that somatic mutations and modifications in the DNA methylation levels are associated with several types of neoplasms. Previously, our group identified missense and loss of function mutations in <i>KMT2D<\/i>, <i>CREBBP<\/i>, <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>TSC2<\/i>, and <i>GNAS, <\/i>using a<i> <\/i>genetic screening method in LMS samples. Based on these results, we decided to investigate whether a genetic and epigenetic crosstalk could help to understand the biological processes involved in the LMS origin, development, and pathogenesis. The present study aimed to evaluate the <i>KMT2D<\/i>, <i>CREBBP<\/i>, <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>TSC2<\/i> and <i>GNAS<\/i> gene expression profile in LMS cell line, and their methylation levels in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patients&#180; samples.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We selected 15 LMS - FFPE samples obtained via surgical procedures performed between 2012 and 2019 at the Instituto do Cancer do Estado de S&#227;o Paulo (ICESP). Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit and we evaluated methylation levels using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip system 850k, including samples treated with bisulfite-treated DNA. Leiomyoma (LM) (THESCs CRL-4003) and LMS (SK-UT-1) cell lines were cultivated for gene expression analysis. Cells were growth for 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours, and the total RNA was extracted by TRIzol. High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit was used for cDNA synthesis and for gene expression evaluation, real-time PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and inventoried TaqMan probes.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b><i>KMT2D<\/i> and <i>TSC2<\/i> showed increased expression in LMS compared to LM (cut-off &#8804; -2 and &#8805; 2 for down and upregulation, respectively), with higher expression in 24 hours of <i>KMT2D<\/i> [Fold Regulation (FR): 2.77] and <i>TSC2 <\/i>(FR: 2.58). In contrast, <i>CREBBP <\/i>was downregulated, with lowest expression in 72 hours (FR: -6.57). <i>ATM<\/i> was upregulated at 24, 48 with higher expression in 72 hours (FR: 2.32), and <i>GNAS<\/i> was downregulated, with lowest expression in 96 hours (FR: -4.31). Moreover, the methylation analyzes showed an expressive hypomethylation in LMS samples, compared to myometrium, for <i>KMT2D<\/i> (&#946; value: 0.45; p= 0.004); <i>CREBBP<\/i> (&#946; value: 0.51 p &#60; 0.0001); <i>ATM <\/i>(&#946; value: 0.47 p &#60; 0.0001); <i>TSC2 <\/i>(&#946; value: 0.53 p &#60; 0.0001) and <i>GNAS <\/i>(&#946; value: 0.41 p &#60; 0.0001). In conclusion, our study showed that potentially pathogenic mutations may be associated with an aberrant hypomethylation profile, as well as increased expression of <i>KMT2D<\/i>, <i>TSC2<\/i>, <i>ATM<\/i> and loss expression of <i>CREBBP<\/i> and <i>GNAS<\/i> in LMS. The interconnection of these genetic and epigenetic events is essential for understanding the complex biology of these tumors, in addition to enabling identification of biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Mutations,Gynecological cancers: other,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Laura  G.  dos Anjos<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniela Bizinelli<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Katia C.

Prevention of BC through administration of epigenetically active dietary phytochemicals has received increased interest in recent years due to its relatively low cost, few side effects and potential to reduce the financial and healthcare burdens associated with BC. Many phytochemicals&#8217; anticancer functions are thought to arise from their effects on the epigenome, although the relative importance of specific genes&#8217; epigenetic states remain unclear. To elucidate this, we utilized human BC cell lines in combination with CRISPR-dCas technology tied to methylation modifiers to explore the importance of gene specific DNA methylation to cancer cell phenotype in both na&#239;ve BC cells and BC cells treated with the phytochemical Withaferin A (WA). We found that demethylation of promoters of the tumor suppressors <i>p21 <\/i>and <i>p53<\/i> results in increased gene expression, while methylation of the promoter of the oncogene <i>CCND1<\/i> results in decreased in gene expression. Additionally, changes to biological processes were associated with tumor suppressor promoter methylation state, including increases in cell cycle arrest for a demethylated <i>p21<\/i> promoter and decreases in cell viability for a demethylated <i>p53 <\/i>promoter. We also found that downregulation of <i>p21<\/i> through targeting DNMT3A to its promoter was able to ablate the anticancer function of WA in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these results highlight the potential importance of DNA methylation changes for cancer cell phenotype and a possible mechanism of action for the phytochemical WA in BC prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,DNA methylation,CRISPR,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew Brane<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Trygve O.

Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer detected in plasma at different stages of progression and its effect on clinical outcomes has not been determined. In a cohort study across different stages of prostate cancer (PC) progression, we performed plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based epigenomic profiling for determining the landscape of methylation and Differentially Methylated Region (DMR) classifiers and the potential impact on clinical outcomes in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) state.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Plasma was collected prospectively in a longitudinal cohort study of 108 PC patients (pts) of which 24 had non-metastatic Local PC; 28 had mHSPC; 56 had mCRPC. cfDNA was used for enzymatic methylation sequencing (EM-seq) of a targeted panel of genes (N=441) implicated in prostate cancer biology. Methylation status at CpG islands of these genes were examined using Twist targeted cfDNA methylation assay. The Bismark program was used for methylation calls. Temporal trends of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in different states of progression by comparing the methylation status of target genes in localized PC, mHSPC and mCRPC states using a False Discovery Rate (FDR-q-value) of 0.2 or less.

The presence of intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a risk factor for gastric cancer. However, it is still controversial whether IM itself is a precancerous or paracancerous lesion. Here, we aimed to explore the precancerous nature of IM in terms of epigenetic alterations.<br \/>Design. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted by EPIC BeadArray using IM and non-IM crypts isolated by Alcian blue staining. Organoid establishment, ChIP-seq for H3K27ac, and single-cell ATAC-seq were conducted using IM mucosa. <i>NOS2<\/i> was induced using a Tet-on gene expression system in normal cells.<br \/>Results. IM crypts had a methylation profile unique from that of non-IM crypts, showing extensive DNA hypermethylation in promoter regions with CpG islands, including those of tumor suppressor genes. Also, the IM-specific methylation profile was carried into a fraction of gastric cancers (GC), and the frequency of the IM-type GCs was higher than the fraction of IM cells in the adjacent mucosa, indicating that IM cells have a higher chance of developing into cancer cells than non-IM cells. Moreover, the patients with IM-type GCs showed better overall survival than those without, and IM-type GCs showed good response to chemotherapy. As for the mechanism of accelerated methylation induction, IM organoids had remarkably high endogenous <i>NOS2<\/i> expression, and <i>NOS2<\/i> induction in normal cells was shown to accelerate aberrant DNA methylation by increasing DNMT activity. IM mucosa underwent dynamic enhancer reprogramming, including the regions involved in abnormal <i>NOS2<\/i> expression. Single-cell ATAC-seq also showed <i>NOS2<\/i> open chromatin in IM cells but not in gastric cells, and frequent closed chromatin of tumor-suppressor genes in IM cells. <i>NOS2<\/i> expression in IM-derived organoids was up-regulated by IL-17A, a cytokine secreted by extracellular bacterial infection.<br \/>Conclusions. IM cells were considered to have a strong precancerous nature with an increased chance of converting into cancer cells in terms of the specific methylation profile and the accelerated DNA methylation induction due to abnormal <i>NOS2<\/i> expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Intestinal metaplasia,Single cell,Nitric oxide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chihiro Takeuchi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Satoshi Yamashita<sup>2<\/sup>, Yu-Yu Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Hideyuki Takeshima<sup>1<\/sup>, Toshikazu Ushijima<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Epigenomics, Hoshi University, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biotechnology, Maebashi Institute of Technology, Gunma, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"33fffd4d-b4d9-4aa9-9054-5e32f313d7e7","ControlNumber":"5677","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.
