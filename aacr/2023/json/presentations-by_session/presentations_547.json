Resistance is postulated to arise from certain clonal populations that enter a slow cycling persister state, evade treatment with relative dormancy, and repopulate the tumor when reactivated.<i> Via longitudinal profiling we define expression states of clonal populations and track their evolutionary progression.<\/i> <i>BRAF<\/i> mutant patient derived melanoma xenografts were treated with <i>BRAF\/MEK<\/i> inhibitors through maximum tumor size reduction and re-growth. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) was performed at 5 timepoints across 94 days of treatment, tracking clonal populations with intact tissue structure. Deep learning on H&#38;E-stained images automatically detected histological features that co-localize with expression levels. A novel computational pipeline performed clustering, differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis, copy number variation detection, and pseudotemporal ordering, allowing spatial recreation of clonal phylogenies and cell fate trajectory inference during the treatment course. Three clonal categories were defined; <i>Sensitive<\/i>: predominant in treatment-na&#239;ve samples, <i>Persister<\/i>: remaining clusters in maximally shrunken specimens, <i>Resistant<\/i>: re-emergent, fast-proliferating. Analysis of clonal composition identified <i>GAPDH<\/i> and <i>CCND1<\/i> as highly expressed in <i>sensitive<\/i> clones, suppressed in <i>persisters<\/i>, and reactivated in <i>resistant<\/i> clones; <i>TYRP1, DCT, MITF<\/i>, and <i>NGFR <\/i>showed an opposite pattern. <i>Persister<\/i> clones evolved from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis and MAPK regulation. Spatial analysis showed increased glycolysis:oxidative phosphorylation ratio in centrally located <i>sensitive<\/i> clusters, with more balanced peripheral expression. <i>Resistant<\/i> clones showed upregulated <i>DUSP6<\/i> expression and enrichment in Orexin signaling and MAPK regulation. Imaging- and expression-based clones were highly concordant. Spatial profiling during melanoma treatment identified transient persister and emergent resistant clones, defining expression profiles and phenotypic features. Altered ratio of oxidative to glycolytic metabolic pathways was a hallmark of clonal evolution in both space and time. Specific MAPK pathway re-entry points were identified as candidate resistance mechanisms, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Deep learning features derived from histological images showed good correlation with ST profiles, providing a promising method for clonal tracking via images alone. This longitudinal experiment mimics a tumor&#8217;s clinical course, inducing persistence and resistance via treatment that parallels that seen by patients. Combining ST and imaging techniques, we provide insight into clonal dynamics with novel spatiotemporal resolution, defining an evolutionary roadmap to acquired treatment resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Deep learning,Targeted therapy,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jill Carol Rubinstein<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sergii Domanskyi<sup>2<\/sup>, Todd  B.

PDAC has limited response to current cytotoxic, targeted and immunotherapies. Thus, it is crucial to explore the molecular underpinnings of this disease in order to identify expression patterns and intercellular dialogue that are limiting the effectiveness of current therapies. Here, we dissected the single-cell spatial transcriptomic landscape of untreated (<i>n<\/i>=7) and treated (chemoradiation, <i>n<\/i>=7) primary resected human PDAC tumors using spatial molecular imaging with a custom 990-plex panel. We recovered 719,965 high-quality single cells of 20 distinct types, including epithelial, immune, endothelial, endocrine, and diverse stromal cells. We further dissected the malignant, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), and endothelial cells by applying single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)-derived signatures. We explored how treatment altered the intraglandular heterogeneity of malignant programs and intratumoral composition of multicellular neighborhoods, for which we developed a Gaussian-based computational model. In concordance with previous studies, we found that myofibroblastic CAFs spatially localized with malignant cells. Treatment-enriched neural-like progenitor malignant cells spatially localized with CD8+ T cells, which combined with other findings suggests that different malignant subtypes may employ distinct mechanisms of immune evasion. We further investigated receptor-ligand interactions associated with therapeutic resistance at subcellular spatial resolution. To this end, we developed an optimal transport-based computational method to infer cell-cell communication at the cancer-stromal interface. We functionally validated a subset of predicted interactions using a murine stromal tumoroid model, in which we co-cultured transformed pancreatic ductal cells and CAFs in a solubilized extracellular matrix. We evaluated the strength of predicted interactions in response to <i>ex vivo<\/i> chemotherapy using snRNA-seq. Moreover, we modulated the expression of select ligand-receptor pairs in the malignant-CAF co-cultures using CRISPR-mediated genetic engineering. We tested the effects of these perturbations on therapeutic resistance using cell viability assays, including live-cell label-free phase nanoscopy. In conclusion, we integrated single-cell spatial transcriptomics and novel computational methods to identify mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in PDAC at both cellular and molecular levels. We functionally validated a subset of cancer-stromal receptor-ligand interactions predicted to associate with treatment resistance using genetically-engineered stromal tumoroids, demonstrating the translational potential of spatial biology for guiding therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Single cell,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carina Shiau<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jingyi Cao<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Gregory<sup>3<\/sup>, Tae Kyung Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Youngmi Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Jason  W.

Most solid tumors harbor different levels of somatic mutations attributed to the off-target activities of APOBEC3A (A3A) and\/or APOBEC3B (A3B). However, how APOBEC3A\/B interact with exogenous mutagenic processes in shaping tumor development is largely unknown. Here, by combining deep whole-genome sequencing with multi-omics profiling of 309 lung cancers from smokers with detailed tobacco smoking information, we identify two subtypes defined by low (<i>LAS<\/i>) and high (<i>HAS<\/i>) APOBEC mutagenesis. LAS are enriched for A3B-like mutagenesis and <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations, whereas HAS for A3A-like mutagenesis and <i>TP53<\/i> mutations. Unlike <i>APOBEC3A<\/i>, <i>APOBEC3B<\/i> expression is strongly associated with an upregulation of the base excision repair pathway. Hypermutation by unrepaired A3A and tobacco smoking mutagenesis combined with <i>TP53<\/i>-induced genomic instability can trigger senescence, apoptosis, and cell regeneration, as indicated by telomere shortening, high expression of pulmonary healing signaling pathway and stemness markers in HAS. The expected association of tobacco smoking exposure with genomic\/epigenomic changes are not observed in HAS, a plausible consequence of frequent cell senescence or apoptosis. HAS tumors have slower clonal expansion and older age at onset compared to LAS, particularly in heavy smokers, consistent with high proportions of newly generated, unmutated cells in HAS. These findings show how heterogeneity in mutational burden across competing mutational processes and cell types contributes to tumor development, with important clinical implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,APOBEC mutagenesis,Tobacco smoking,Age at onset,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tongwu Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jian Sang<sup>1<\/sup>, Phuc H.

This process mediates acquired resistance to <i>EGFR<\/i>-targeted therapies in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), through transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), an aggressive cancer type of neuroendocrine (NE) histology. This transformed SCLC has worse clinical outcomes than either its LUAD or <i>de novo <\/i>SCLC counterparts, with less than one-year overall survival following transformation. Classical SCLC itself can display plasticity through interconversion between classical, variant, and non-NE transcriptional subtypes, with non-classical subtypes displaying increased metastasis and chemoresistance. It is poorly understood what factors drive SCLC transformation or subtype switching. Prior studies poorly model intratumoral heterogeneity because they profile tumors in bulk, which only estimates the average phenotype. However, SCLC transformation often results in admixed LUAD\/SCLC tumors. We sought to capture the full intratumoral heterogeneity of SCLC transformation and identify potential molecular determinants of plasticity by applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to 41 tumors and patient-derived xenografts from 22 patients with transformed or combined LUAD\/NE histology, with matched targeted DNA sequencing and 17 <i>de novo<\/i> SCLC tumors, 10 LUAD tumors with concurrent <i>EGFR\/RB1\/TP53 <\/i>mutations, and 4 tumor-adjacent normal lung samples for comparison. Of 234,322 single transcriptomes assessed, we found 89,113 NE cancer cells and 18,197 LUAD cancer cells. We confirmed that NE and LUAD components within the same tumor shared clonal mutations and common ancestry. Compared to <i>de novo<\/i>, transformed SCLC harbored greater phenotypic diversity across patients (p &#60; 1 x 10<sup>-10<\/sup>), driven largely by enrichment of variant and non-NE subtypes (p &#60; 0.02), including <i>NEUROD1<\/i>, <i>POU2F3<\/i>, and <i>YAP1<\/i>-high subtypes, the latter of which was completely absent in <i>de novo<\/i>. Within each tumor, transformed SCLC displayed higher intratumoral subtype diversity than <i>de novo <\/i>SCLC (likelihood ratio p &#60; 0.025). After adjusting for SCLC subtype, differential expression and pathway analysis demonstrated that transformed SCLC is a distinct phenotype from <i>de novo<\/i> and shares features of the ancestral clone that include residual EGFR and NSCLC gene signatures, as well as pathways in neuronal stemness, MYC targets, AKT\/MTOR signaling, JAK\/STAT inflammation, and chromatin remodeling. In sum, we find increased intratumoral phenotypic diversity in transformed SCLC, including variant and non-NE subtypes, that may explain worse clinical outcomes. We show that transformed SCLC is a distinct phenotype from <i>de novo<\/i>, marked by pathways that may offer new potential drug targets<b> <\/b>to constrain plasticity, with the goal of restoring original sensitivity to targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,Lineage Plasticity,SCLC transformation,Single cell sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joseph Minhow Chan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alvaro Quintanal-Villalonga<sup>1<\/sup>, Amin Sabet<sup>2<\/sup>, Parvathy Manoj<sup>2<\/sup>, Ojasvi Chaudhary<sup>2<\/sup>, Tianhao Xu<sup>2<\/sup>, Ignas Masilionis<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacklynn Egger<sup>2<\/sup>, Noor Sohail<sup>2<\/sup>, Jaeyoung Chun<sup>2<\/sup>, Tal Nawy<sup>2<\/sup>, Linas Mazutis<sup>2<\/sup>, Triparna Sen<sup>1<\/sup>, Ronan Chaligne<sup>2<\/sup>, Helena Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Dana Pe'er<sup>3<\/sup>, Charles Rudin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Computational and Systems Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d56547fc-d35f-48b4-857b-dbc7bee7c4fd","ControlNumber":"7966","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Distinct mutational signatures have recently been detected by &#8220;Mutographs&#8221; in Renal Clear Cell Carcinomas (RCC) from different parts of the world. However, whether the detected mutational signatures are present in normal tissues or are initiated after tumorigenesis remains unknown.<br \/>In general, there has been a lack of knowledge of somatic mutations in normal cells primarily due to technological barriers to detection of somatic mutations in highly polyclonal normal tissues. However, a recently developed duplex sequencing technology, NanoSeq, uses copies of both strands of each DNA molecule to reduce sequencing errors to 10<sup>-9<\/sup>. With NanoSeq, we are able to detect somatic mutations in polyclonal tissues including the normal kidney. In this study, we used NanoSeq to sequence 288 tumor-adjacent normal kidney samples from multiple countries with varying RCC incidence. Subsequently, we conducted agnostic signature extraction using a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process to investigate whether the region specific mutational signatures found in cancers can be extracted from normal kidney tissue. The normal kidney tissues we sequenced have paired RCC whole genome sequencing data from the same individual. Therefore, the mutational profiles of normal kidney can be compared to paired cancer samples to ascertain the timing of the mutational processes causing the mutational signatures found in the cancers.<br \/>We confirmed that a predominantly T&#62;C mutational signature that is highly enriched in Japanese RCC is present in normal kidney samples. A strong transcriptional strand bias in this signature provides circumstantial evidence that it is likely to have been caused by DNA damaging agents causing bulky DNA adducts which may be of environmental origin. A subset of RCC samples from Serbia and Romania had mutational signatures caused by aristolochic acids (AA). We found different dominant AA-related signatures in tumors compared to their matched normal tissues, potentially indicating different mutagenic or repair mechanisms between normal and cancer cells. Levels of SBS40, which is of unknown cause, were elevated in normal kidneys from the Czech Republic compared to other countries, and may contribute to the high RCC incidence in this country. In summary, this study provides the first systematic investigation of somatic mutations in normal kidney, revealing different mutational processes in different geographic regions and in cancer versus normal kidneys.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Mutation detection,Mutations,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yichen Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Moody<sup>1<\/sup>, Behnoush Abedi-Ardekani<sup>2<\/sup>, Calli Latimer<sup>1<\/sup>, Saamin Cheema<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingwei Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen Fitzgerald<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Humphreys<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Brennan<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael R.

But as clonal evolution happens at the single-cell level, one must rely on strong assumptions when making conclusions with bulk-sequencing results, which fails in capturing clonal heterogeneity to its fullest.<br \/>Herein we have developed and optimized a high-throughput, high-depth targeted single-nucleus DNA-seq (snDNA-seq) technique (doi.org\/10.1101\/2022.03.06.483206) for archival primary solid tumor samples. We focused on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), well known as one of the most lethal cancers, and sequenced over 200,000 single nuclei from 80 archival primary samples of 25 PDAC patients. The samples included both early- and late-stage diagnoses and multiregional sampling from primary tumors and metastasis to capture clonal heterogeneity on both temporal and spatial scales.<br \/>With significant increase in sensitivity than bulk (down to mutations in 0.1% cells), we discovered thousands of novel mutations per sample on our 120,000 base-pair-long panel regions, suggesting a mutation rate higher than previously estimated. A small fraction of these mutations is in 1-10% single cells and are enriched in early-stage samples. They form mutually exclusive clones which functionally target key pathways including TGF-&#946;, homologous recombination, suggesting subclonal evolution under positive selection at the early stage of cancer. Most novel mutations are in &#60;1% single cells sampled and enabled us to measure convergent evolution and positive\/negative selection within each tumor.<br \/>We next revisited PDAC&#8217;s genomic evolution model established by bulk studies. It posits that PDAC often arises when <i>KRAS<\/i> hotspot mutation-bearing precursors acquire <i>TP53<\/i> and\/or <i>CDKN2A <\/i>inactivation through stepwise and punctuated evolution. While it assumes that TGF-&#946; inactivating mutations are present in all cancer cells (clonal), we found that they are targeted in a highly subclonal manner; moreover, short mutations and focal copy number variations occur in a stepwise manner over time leading to the most &#8220;fit&#8221; genotype. In many PDACs whose bulk results show no alteration to the TGF-&#946; pathway, snDNA-seq shows focal deletions that are likely below bulk&#8217;s sensitivity.<br \/>Ongoing studies have begun to extend these analyses to longitudinal samples to study treatment response; normal pancreas tissues to study pancreas cells&#8217; clonal evolution in aging and chronic disease conditions; blood samples to investigate circulating tumor cells in PDAC patients. Computational pipelines and analysis tools are being built as platform for more in-depth analyses. Overall, the high-throughput snDNA-seq technique brings genomic study of PDAC to a much higher resolution and holds the promise to not only inform precision medicine but also shed light on many fundamental questions on cancer evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Pancreatic cancer,Evolutionary biology,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Haochen Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Palash Sashittal<sup>2<\/sup>, Elias-Ramzey Karnoub<sup>3<\/sup>, Benjamin  J.

Such an assay would provide new insights into the relationship between genetic alterations and tumor cell phenotype. However, simultaneously measuring the genomic and transcriptomic content of individual cells at high throughput remains challenging. Here we present single-cell lithium assisted nucleosome depleted sequencing (scLAND-seq), a scalable method for co-sequencing RNA and DNA from single nuclei that uses the widely available 10x Genomics microfluidics platform. In scLAND-seq, nuclei are treated with a mild detergent, lithium diiodosalicylate, which denatures protein and renders gDNA free of nucleosome packing while preserving the nuclear membrane. The nuclei are then tagmented with Tn5 transposase, which randomly fragments gDNA and integrates universal sequencing adapters. Tagmented nuclei are loaded into a microfluidic droplet generator which co-encapsulates nuclei with beads containing barcoded primers for reverse transcription of mRNA and replication of gDNA. Ultimately two libraries are created: one for nuclear mRNA and one for gDNA. Each library contains barcodes linking it to its nuclei of origin, thus allowing simultaneous analysis of the transcriptome and genome of each nucleus. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, all steps can be performed using a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller and 10x Multiome Kit without further experimental modification. We characterize LAND-seq with BJ fibroblasts, a human diploid cell line, and demonstrate the detection of rare subpopulations with copy number variants (CNVs) associated with specific transcriptional clusters. Analysis of transcription start site enrichment indicates near-complete disruption of chromatin structure, resulting in high-complexity libraries that could not be sequenced to saturation even with &#62;1M reads\/cell. The corresponding gene expression library is of high-quality, containing ~20,000 gene counts per nuclei. Finally, to demonstrate scLAND-seq&#8217;s compatibility with primary cells, we applied scLAND-seq to cryopreserved, human glioblastoma (GBM) surgical specimens, enabling direct investigation into the relationship between phenotype and genotype in thousands of individual cells.<br \/>Character limit: 2,600","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,,Single cell,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Timothy  R.
