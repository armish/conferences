[{"Abstract":"Background: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists are increasingly used in diabetics due to their cardiac and renal benefits along with their actions as antihyperglycemics. They also showed inhibitory effects in ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers in preclinical studies. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined whether GLP-1 agonists have a similar effect in multiple myeloma. Using a population-based study design, we aimed to assess the association of GLP-1 agonist use in the progression of MGUS to MM in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).<br \/>Methods: Patients diagnosed with MGUS from 1999-2021 in the Veterans Health Administration were identified via ICD codes and further confirmed by a natural language processing (NLP)-based algorithm. Progression to smoldering MM (sMM) or MM was also confirmed by another NLP-based algorithm. Only patients with DM, IgG, IgA, or light chain MGUS, and black and white patients were included. We excluded patients who experienced progression within 1 year of MGUS diagnosis or within 2 years of DM diagnosis, and patients diagnosed with MGUS before DM diagnosis. We performed 1:2 matching for patients with and without GLP-1 agonist exposure based on their follow-up time. Gray&#8217;s test was performed to detect the difference between the two cumulative incidence functions (CIF) for progression stratified by GLP-1 agonist use status. The association between GLP-1 agonist use and progression was estimated by multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) using Fine-Gray distribution hazard model with death as a competing event and time-varying GLP-1 agonist use. The covariates included age, BMI, monoclonal protein (M-spike) level (&#8805;1.5g\/dL), creatinine (&#62;1.5 mg\/dL), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; &#60; 7%, 7% - 9%, and &#62; 9%) at MGUS diagnosis, metformin and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SLGT2i) use, as well as sex, race, MGUS heavy chain subtype, light-chain MGUS, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and months from diagnoses of DM to MGUS.<br \/>Results: Our NLP algorithm confirmed 19,551 patients with DM and MGUS. After applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we had 14,832 patients, of which 1,303 had GLP-1 agonist use. After matching, our analytic cohort included 1,303 patients with exposure, and 2,606 patients without. There is no evidence to show that CIFs were different between the exposed and unexposed groups. However, the multivariable analysis showed that GLP-1 agonist use was associated with decreased progression to MM: aHR 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.90, <i>p<\/i> = 0.03.<br \/>Conclusions: For DM patients with MGUS, GLP-1 agonist use is associated with a 65% reduction in risk of progression from MGUS to sMM\/MM. Prospective studies examining whether GLP-1 agonists can be used as possible chemoprevention in MGUS patients with DM should be explored.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,GLP-1 Agonists,MGUS,Diabetes Mellitus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nikhil Grandhi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lawrence Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Mei Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Theodore Thomas<sup>3<\/sup>, Akhil Kumar<sup>3<\/sup>, Kristin Vargo<sup>3<\/sup>, Kristen Sanfilippo<sup>1<\/sup>, Grahm Colditz<sup>1<\/sup>, Su-Hsin Chang<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Washington University In St. Louis, St. Louis, MO,<sup>2<\/sup>City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>St. Louis Veterans Affairs Medical Center, St. Louis, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4375ad96-f77c-42f1-a658-76f33b5ba8f2","ControlNumber":"3851","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Despite its importance, pathologic nodal (pN) staging of lung cancer remains poor. We evaluated the quality and survival impact of two interventions to improve pN staging.<br \/>Methods. Using a non-randomized stepped-wedge design, we implemented use of a lymph node (LN) specimen collection kit to improve intraoperative LN collection (surgical intervention) and a novel gross dissection method for intrapulmonary LN retrieval (pathology intervention) in 12 hospitals in five contiguous Hospital Referral Regions in AR, MS and TN (2009-2021). With appropriate statistical methods we compared surgical quality and survival of patients among: neither (Group 1), pathology only (Group 2), surgical only (Group 3), and both (Group 4) interventions.<br \/>Results. Of 4,019 patients, 50%, 5%, 21% and 24%, were in Groups 1-4 respectively. Rates of non-examination of LNs and non-examination of mediastinal LNs: 11%, 9%, 0% and 0%; 29%, 35%, 2% and 2% respectively in Groups 1-4 (p&#60;0.0001). Attainment of American College of Surgeons Operative Standard 5.8: 22%, 29%, 72%, 85%; International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer&#8217;s stringent definition of &#8216;complete resection&#8217;: 14%, 21%, 53%, 61% (p&#60;0.0001).

Consequently, adequate and equitable pain management are hallmarks of quality cancer care. Unfortunately, up to one-third of patients with cancer consider their pain symptoms poorly managed. Objective To characterize clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with opioid, non-opioid, and non-pharmacological pain management among individuals with a history of cancer. Methods We used the 2018 to 2020 full-year consolidated data files of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), linked to the medical conditions, prescribed medicines, outpatient visits and office-based medical provider visits files. We estimated adjusted relative risk (aRR) of receipt of opioid, non-opioid, and non-pharmacological pain management (acupuncture, chiropractor, and massage\/occupational\/physical therapy), based on clinical (cancer site, comorbidities, depression status) and sociodemographic (race, sex, age, marital status, education, insurance, income, English speaking ability) factors, accounting for complex survey design in quasi-Poisson regression models. Results The study cohort was composed of 7,035 individuals with cancer, with 19.2% (0.65%; weighted proportions (standard error) receiving opioids, 51.09% (0.9%) receiving non-opioids, and 20.56% (0.75%) receiving non-pharmacological pain management. In our final models, compared to Other cancers, patients with bladder cancer were more likely to receive opioids (aRR 1.52; 95% CI 1.06, 2.17), while those with lung cancer were less likely to receive non-pharmacological pain management (aRR 0.46; 95% CI 0.25, 0.84). Also, depression was associated with increased risk of both opioid (aRR 1.26; 95% CI 1.09, 1.46) and non-opioid (aRR 1.26; 95% CI 1.18, 1.34) , but not non-pharmacological pain management. There were no statistically significant differences in risk of opioid prescription between Black vs. White patients with cancer; however, Asian patients were significantly less likely to receive opioids (aRR 0.18; 95% CI 0.05, 0.67) as were patients who did not speak English well (aRR 0.22; 95% CI 0.11, 0.43). Female patients with cancer were significantly more likely to receive non-opioids (aRR 1.21; 95% CI 1.12, 2.31) and non-pharmacological pain management (aRR 1.49; 95% CI 1.27, 1.75) than males. Conclusions There are clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with opioid, non-opioid, and non-pharmacological pain management among individuals with cancer, and those who are depressed are at highest risk for opioid prescription, while those who cannot speak English well are less likely to receive opioids. For equitable pain care in patients with cancer, it is important that barriers associated with pain management are eliminated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-06 Supportive care, palliation, and pain management,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Survival,Palliative care,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Oyomoare  L.

This study investigated whether a previously validated 27-plasma protein prognostic model for four-year cardiovascular (CV) events could have such a utility. We used the 27-plasma protein model to predict the four-year risk of a CV event (myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, heart failure hospitalization, death) in 906 participants with a prior history or active malignancy of any type of cancer and compared predictive results to follow-up CV outcome data. The participants were from the BASEL VIII or ARIC (visit 3) studies with a medically adjudicated prior diagnosis of cancer. BASEL VIII is an observational cohort study in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. ARIC is a multi-site cohort study funded by the NHLBI, NCI, and NPCR investigating risk factors for CV health. A subset analysis was conducted to assess model performance in participants with no prior history of CVD and those with stable CVD. The 27-plasma protein model accurately stratified participants into 4 distinct and non-overlapping (95% CI) risk bins. The median time to event for all cancer survivors who had an event in this study was 1.3 years. Observed 4-year event rates across the 4 risk bins (low, medium-low, medium-high, and high) were 10.4%, 16.8%,31.5% and 58.2%, respectively, which were higher than stratified event rates from our previously published metacohort analyses (5.6%, 11.2%, 20.0% and 43.4%, respectively) in participants with elevated CVD risk factors (e.g., prior events, diabetes, kidney disease and suspected coronary artery disease). The plasma protein model accurately predicted 4-year CVD risk with a C-index of 0.71 (0.68, 0.74) and 4-year AUC of 0.74 (0.69, 0.79). Performance of the protein model was comparable between participants with no prior history of CVD (C-Index: 0.69; AUC: 0.71) and stable CVD (C-Index: 0.69; AUC: 0.72), demonstrating the model accurately predicts CV event risk in cancer survivors regardless of cardiovascular history. Cancer survivors in this cohort can be distinguished with 4-year CV event rates as high as 58.2%, underscoring the urgent need for an easy and accurate risk stratification tool for this population. Prognostic protein testing may provide a novel tool for CVD risk assessment in adult cancer survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cardio-oncology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Emma V.

It is challenging to disentangle variation of DNAm at cell-type specific levels from the effects of age-dependent cell type composition, and bulk measurements may obfuscate the links between EAA and age-related outcomes (e.g., cardiomyopathy). Methylation profiling was generated using Infinium EPIC BeadChips on PBMC-derived DNA from CCS in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. Tensor composition analysis was employed to deconvolute bulk DNAm and infer DNAm at each leukocyte subtype level, i.e., a single n (individuals) by m (DNAm sites) matrix of observed DNAm data was deconvoluted into multiple n by m matrices of DNAm data. Epigenetic age (EA, using Levine&#8217;s clock) and EAA (residuals from the fit of a simple linear regression of EA on chronological age at blood draw) were calculated for bulk PBMCs and each cell subtype (CD4T, CD8T, B, natural killer, and monocyte). Cardiomyopathy (CMP) was assessed by echocardiography, and severity graded (2 = moderate, 3 = severe\/disabling, 4 = life-threatening and 5 = fatal) using a modified version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Cumulative doses of anthracyclines and mean heart radiation doses (heart-RT) calculated through radiation dosimetry were abstracted from medical records. Associations between EAA and CMP were evaluated by multivariable Cox regression. Cell-type specific EA was highly correlated with bulk EA with Pearson r2 between 0.63 (CD8T) and 0.79 (CD4T), but the linear regression lines of cell-type specific EA against bulk EA differed in both intercept and slope, suggesting heterogeneity across leukocyte subtypes. Cell-type specific EAA was moderately correlated with bulk EAA with Pearson r2 between 0.23 (monocyte) and 0.29 (CD8T). Among 2,044 CCS (median age = 33.7 years), 104 (5.1%) developed CMP (&#8805;grade 3). Among bulk EAA and five cell-type specific EAAs, monocyte EAA was the only one significantly associated with CMP (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase in EAA = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.04-1.50, P = 0.018). Cell sorting of PBMC followed by DNAm is currently underway for further validation. We showed an in-depth view of the variability of EAA across leukocyte subtypes, and more importantly, demonstrated that monocyte EAA was associated with CMP risk.

All clinical data and utilities were derived from the literature and clinical trial: monarchE. Notable adverse events such as neutropenia, leucopenia, anemia, and diarrhea were included. Age-specific mortality risk was calculated from the U.S. life tables. The outcomes were measured by costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).

Abemaciclib plus ET treatment produced 4.5 QALYs, while the ET treatment alone produced 4.31 QALYs. Overall, abemaciclib plus ET was marginally more effective than ET with an additional 0.20 QALYs but much costlier with an ICER of $417,780.18\/QALY. For utilities ranging from 0.41 to 0.69, the ICERs ranged from USD 36,5950 to USD 4,463,866.59 per QALY, which exceeded the WTP threshold.

We evaluated the association between medical comorbidities and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) outcomes in a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from the TriNetX Research Network Database, a global de-identified federated health research network. Study participants included pediatric (&#8804;21 years) patients newly diagnosed with ALL or LL from July 2009-June 2019 and followed through June 2022. The main outcomes included progression\/relapse, toxicity, overall mortality and cancer-specific mortality. Comorbidities included chronic lung disease; congenital heart disease; neurologic, immune, hematologic, vascular and genetic disorders; renal disease; gastrointestinal disease; prematurity and hepatobiliary disease. Patients with any comorbidity were matched with patients with no comorbidity on age at diagnosis, gender, race\/ethnicity, and treatment using propensity score matching. We identified 5,375 patients diagnosed with ALL\/LL with comorbidities and 5,375 without comorbidities after propensity score matching. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.7 years (standard deviation=6.2). A higher proportion of the patients were male (56.9%), White (63.6%) and Not Hispanic or Latino (63.4%). Patients diagnosed with comorbidities had a higher risk for progression\/relapse (73% vs 51%; Relative Risk, RR=1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.38-1.47) and treatment related toxicity (80% vs 50%; RR=1.59, 95% CI=1.54-1.64), compared to patients diagnosed with no comorbidities. Similarly, overall mortality (Hazard ratio, HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.37-1.91) and cancer-specific mortality (HR=4.39, 95% CI=2.28-8.46) were higher among patients diagnosed with comorbidities than those without comorbidities.

Patients are transitioned to Survivorship if they have completed treatment with curative intent, are in remission, and past the period of highest relapse risk, as determined by disease experts [average ~ 3 years past treatment].<br \/>Methods: The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) is a validated cancer specific symptom burden questionnaire. It was integrated into the electronic health record (EHR), and sent via the patient portal to patients 7 days prior to their clinic visit. High alerts (&#38;gt= 7) were set for four key symptoms (pain, distress, sadness, and shortness of breath). Alerts triggered an automated message to the provider. From November 2019 to October 2022, 4322 patients completed PRO surveys.<br \/>Results: Table 1 summarizes the frequency of moderate (4-6) and high (7-10) level responses. Categories with more than 5% of respondents endorsing a moderate symptom value are bolded with those more than 10% bold and italic. There is significant variation of severity for the four key symptoms amongst patients with different disease types. Lymphoma and thyroid cancer patients have higher symptom severity, while prostate cancer patients report relatively low symptom severity. Overall, for this cohort of responders, the totals of moderate and high levels symptoms are: distress =12.5 %; pain = 9.5 %; sadness = 8.7 %; and shortness of breath = 8 %.<br \/>Conclusion: A subset of cancer survivors still experience moderate to high level symptoms, as measured by the MDASI survey, even years after treatment. There are notable differences across patient populations. Further study can identify at-risk patient groups who may require additional intervention.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{F7D7B3B8-6A33-4EBA-9B4F-1B8099839DE9}\"><caption>Table 1.

CRC patients have a high prevalence of depression and experience various symptoms such as bowel problems. However, previous studies analyzing network analysis has not yet been conducted to understand the association between symptoms with chronic anxiety and depression.<br \/>Methods: In this study, symptom network and centrality analysis were conducted to confirm the interaction between symptoms and functioning (e.g., pain, fatigue, physical functioning, etc.) of patients diagnosed with CRC according to the higher risk of anxiety and depressive groups ahead of surgical treatment. In this study, symptom and functioning variables in a total of 939 CRC patients were measured using EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-CR29. Network analysis, visualization, and centrality analysis were performed to determine the connectivity between anxiety, depression, and other correlated symptoms amongst CRC patients using the qgraph R package.<br \/>Results: As a result of confirming the difference in anxiety and depression according to socio-demographic characteristics, there was a significant difference in the education level in the group with anxiety(Ps&#60;0.05). The group with depression showed significant differences in Fasting blood sugar and education level(Ps&#60;0.05). There were significant differences in symptoms according to anxiety and depression, the group with high risk of anxiety showed significant differences in 30 symptoms such as urological frequency and physical function. The group having depression showed significant differences in 26 symptoms such as fatigue and physical function. In the result of performing symptom network analysis and centrality analysis without any stratification of anxiety or depression, fatigue was found to be a central symptom in all patients. In both the anxious and depressed groups, pain was estimated as the central symptom.<br \/>Conclusion: In conclusion, the study compared and analyzed symptom networks to confirm the interaction between symptoms of CRC patients according to anxiety and depression. The symptom network of CRC patients showed different patterns according to anxiety and depression. Pain appeared as a central symptom in both the anxious and depressed groups. This indicates that pain is a key role because it is related to other symptoms and affects the flow of the symptom network the most. Therefore, intensive pain management is expected to be important in treating CRC patients with anxiety and depression. It is expected that the basis for the management of colorectal cancer patients and survivors can be prepared toward the long term of cancer treatment and survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-05 Psycho-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jinah Sim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ji Won Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Nan Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Ae Sun Shin<sup>3<\/sup>, Ji Won Park<sup>4<\/sup>, Seung Yong Jeong<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hallym University, Chuncheon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>College of Pharmacy,, Chungbuk National University, Chungbuk, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c06e7e9c-d25e-4d9e-bebf-0db0a1b81efc","ControlNumber":"3357","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Previous studies indicate that Asian patients were proportionally more likely to be treated surgically. However, studies on the outcome of this preference are very limited.<br \/>Methods:We examined data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database to identify patients diagnosed with HCC between 2004 and 2017.The disease specific and relative five year survival rates as well as 95% Cl were calculated.<br \/>Results:Among the total of 6,716 Asian or Pacific Islander (A\/P) patients diagnosed with localized HCC, 45.9% of them received surgical resection. The localized HCC surgical resection rates for White (27,360 total cases) and Black (4,546 total cases) were 35.6% and 33.1% respectively. This pattern remained the same for patients with regional and distant site involved HCC: Highest percentage of A\/P patients received surgical resections. For patients with localized HCC, five year cause specific survival rate was statistically higher for A\/P patients than White and Black (P&#60;0.05) 24 months after the surgery. These trends continued until the end of the study. For patients with regional HCC, surgical resection played no significant role for the five year cause specific survival rate among the different races. However, for patients with distant involved HCC, five year cause specific survival gap between White and A\/P gradually increased after surgery and reached a statistically significant level on month 48 (23.9% with 95% CI 18.6% to 29.6% for White and 9.7% with 95% CI 4.4% to 17.5% for A\/P). The pattern remained the same between Black and A\/P patients without statistical significance, most likely due to the limited sample size for both.. Our research also indicated that surgical resection may play a similar role for the five year relative survival rate. After localized HCC surgical resection, A\/P patients had the highest five year relative survival rate compared to White and Black patients (P&#60;0.05). For the patients with regional HCC, surgical resection played no significant role on five year relative survival rate among different races. However, for the patients diagnosed with distant involved HCC, five year relative survival gap between White and A\/P gradually increased after surgery and reached a statistically significant level on month 48 (23.7% with 95% CI 18.3% to 29.4% for White and 10.5% with 95% CI 5.2% to 18.0% for A\/P). The pattern remained the same between Black and A\/P patients without statistical significance due to the limited sample size in both categories.<br \/>Conclusion: A\/P primary HCC patients were more likely to be treated surgically. However, the benefits of surgical resection for A\/P patients can only be appreciated for those with localized HCC. For A\/P patients diagnosed with distant site node involved HCC, surgical resection may cause more harm than good.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Surgical resection,Survival,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jingwei Song<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Gharavi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA,<sup>2<\/sup>Honors College, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c57c1d9f-5f43-49d2-a82a-16384438bfd1","ControlNumber":"8081","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Participants in diverse environments can use electronic devices to report their experiences with the drug by completing patient reported outcome assessments (ePROs). Quality of life (QOL) reports describe how a patient feels or functions during a treatment with a new drug. For oncology trials, QOL data is needed to prove the treatment effect and support a labeling claim.<br \/>Methods: The literature search in the Web of Science for articles containing QOL keyword found ten articles with the highest number of citations. QOL instruments relevant to cancer research were identified based on the literature search. Form completion times corresponding to the cancer-specific instruments were identified and analyzed using a metadata of 948 instruments and 17,234,458 assessment submissions.<br \/>Results: Three general QOL measures in oncology trials were identified: the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F), and SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Median times of form completion in seconds (s) increased in the following order: FACIT-F &#60; EORTC QLQ-C30 &#60; SF-36v2 and were equal to 105 s &#60; 213 s &#60; 386 s. Metadata analysis showed that participants spent less than two minutes on completion of the FACIT-F assessment, which is only 18% of the estimated completion time of 10 minutes. Metadata analysis showed that it took participants three and a half minutes to complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 assessment, which is roughly one third of the estimated completion time of 11 minutes. The completion time for SF-36v2 fell within the estimated range of 5 to 10 minutes.<br \/>Conclusions: Properly selected QOL instruments facilitate collection of the right data for demonstration of a treatment benefit. It is recommended to include a general oncology and a disease specific QOL instrument to show the treatment&#8217;s success of improving patient&#8217;s QOL. At the same time, the completion of the instruments should not be burdensome considering disease progression characteristic for oncology studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Outcome,Quality of life,Metadata,eCOA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jowita Marszewska<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lindsay Hughes<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Individual, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"47d685da-f042-4471-8c67-219fe1533b46","ControlNumber":"5072","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

This complex phenomenon remains poorly understood, especially at the point of a prostate cancer diagnosis. Newly diagnosed Black men report initial feelings ranging from being &#8220;shocked,&#8221; to &#8220;receiving a death sentence,&#8221; and both an ineptness of asking questions and a reliance on physicians for treatment options due to lack of knowledge. The psychological distress from prostate cancer uncertainties affects health management and treatment decisions, though it is unclear to what extent the role of social determinants of health factor in making informed healthcare decisions.<br \/>Aim: In this scoping review, we examined the influence of the social determinants of health at point of prostate cancer diagnosis among Black men seeking to make an informed decision about their treatment plans.<br \/>Methods: We followed the methodological framework: the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Five electronic databases, Emabase, Pubmed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for quantitative and qualitative primary studies from the period 2005 until March 2022. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full texts, against predefined criteria: empirical research, post 2000, in English-language peer-reviewed journals; participants included Black prostate cancer survivors and research explored social determinants of health at point of prostate cancer diagnosis. Studies were quality assessed for data charting.<br \/>Results: The search yielded 283 studies, with 45 included studies for synthesis. Traditional social determinants of health were frequent. However, identification of themes such as social support, masculinity and stigma, fear of abandonment by medical staff, and cost of diagnostic procedures were prominent determinants. Notably, sub-themes emerged that included coping factors such as emotional distress, perceptions of normalcy, and poor prostate cancer knowledge.<br \/>Conclusion: Understanding the social determinants of health impact on Black men, especially at point of prostate cancer diagnosis will allow survivors, physicians, and researchers to work at solving these health disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-07 Translational survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Social determinants of health,Black men ,Survivorship diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dottington Fullwood<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, AJ Merriweather<sup>1<\/sup>, Che Ngufor<sup>1<\/sup>, Deidre Pereira<sup>2<\/sup>, KC Balaji<sup>3<\/sup>, Roxana Dronca<sup>4<\/sup>, Gerardo Colon-Otero<sup>5<\/sup>, Jennifer Crook<sup>1<\/sup>, Parisa Fathi<sup>1<\/sup>, Emelina Asto-Flores<sup>1<\/sup>, Shannon Pressey<sup>1<\/sup>, Folakemi Odedina<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Florida, Jacksonville, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>Urology, University of Florida - Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL,<sup>4<\/sup>Oncology, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Florida, Jacksonville, FL,<sup>5<\/sup>Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Florida, Jacksonville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e0884f25-aaa9-489f-8419-2c81a43642ab","ControlNumber":"8003","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

However, results from prospective studies in relapsed refractory (R\/R) AML remain scarce. Here, we compare the outcomes in ND and R\/R pts treated with VEN-based therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed a retrospective analysis of ND and R\/R pts with AML diagnosed between 2016 and 2021 who were treated with VEN-based therapy at the University of Iowa. We used ANOVA and chi-square test to compare variables between ND and R\/R pts. Logistic regression analyses and Cox regression models evaluated the effects of ND vs. R\/R AML on objective response rate (ORR defined as complete remission (CR) + complete remission with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) and overall survival (OS), respectively. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of 53 pts, 31 pts had ND AML, and 22 pts had R\/R AML. Median age was 67 years (range 26-85). Among total pts, 52% were treated with VEN + AZA, 48% were treated with VEN+ DEC, 25% had prior exposure to HMA, and 19% had an allogeneic transplant before treatment with VEN-based therapy. Eleven pts had <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation (7 pts in ND, 4 in R\/R group), 13 had <i>NPM1 <\/i>mutation (ND- 8, R\/R-5), and 7 had <i>FLT3 <\/i>mutation (ND-5, R\/R-2). ORR was 53% in total pts (CR- 34%, CRi- 19%), of which 11% did not have minimal residual disease. There was no statistically significant difference in ORR between ND and R\/R pts (Odds ratio [OR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-6.4, p=0.2). Treatment with VEN + DEC conferred a similar ORR compared to VEN + AZA (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.1-1.2, p=0.1). Prior HMA use did not affect ORR (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.08-2.2, p=0.3). ND pts had longer 6-month OS than R\/R pts (82% vs. 55%), but 12-month OS was similar (59% vs. 55%). ND or R\/R status did not affect OS (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.3-1.6, p=0.4). Treatment with VEN + DEC conferred similar OS compared to VEN + AZA (HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7-3.7, p=0.2). Age, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>NPM1, <\/i>and <i>FLT3<\/i> mutations, and adverse cytogenetics, did not affect ORR or OS.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our real-world analysis shows no significant difference in ORR or OS among pts with ND or R\/R AML indicating effective response to VEN-based therapy regardless of treatment status. We report similar 12-month OS for ND and R\/R pts despite a higher 6-month OS for ND group. Treatment combination with either AZA or DEC had comparable outcomes, and prior HMA use did not predict worse outcomes in our study. These results are important clinically as AZA and DEC are often used interchangeably, and a significant proportion of pts with prior myelodysplastic syndrome are treated with HMA. Subsequent studies are required to understand the similarities and differences in factors predicting response to VEN-based therapy in ND and R\/R AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Venetoclax,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aditya Ravindra<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Luna Acharya<sup><\/sup>, Bradley Loeffler<sup><\/sup>, Sarah  L.

To address this gap, this study assesses the prevalence of patient-provider communication about the use of medical cannabis for cancer symptoms. Three types of communication are examined: 1) patient-provider discussions; 2) provider recommendations; and 3) provider instructions for how to use medical cannabis. We administered a survey from August to November 2021 with adult cancer patients who completed treatment from July 2017 to December 2019 at a National Cancer Institute designated Comprehensive Cancer Center; 1,592 individuals participated (response rate: 17.6%). About half of participants were female (52.1%). The age distribution of participants included 18-44 (9.4%), 45-54 (12.8%), 55-64 (25.3%), 65-74 (35.4%), and 75 and above (17.3%). Participant&#8217;s racial and ethnic background included Hispanic\/Latinx (6.5%), African American\/Black (4.0%), Asian American (1.0%), additional or multiple racial categories (3.5%), and White (91.5%). About a third (33.5%) of participants (530\/1584) reported discussing medical cannabis for cancer symptoms with a healthcare provider. Participants who had discussed cannabis with a provider reported discussions with multiple providers including their oncology physician (62.3%), primary care provider (45.7%), oncology advanced practice provider (APP) (34.3%), dietician (7.4%), pharmacist (2.8%), and other healthcare provider (34.3%). Fewer (15.6%) participants (248\/1592) reported receiving a recommendation for medical cannabis from a healthcare provider for their cancer symptoms. Participants who had received a recommendation reported recommendations from their oncology physician (32.7%), primary care provider (26.6%), oncology APP (13.7%), dietician (4.8%), pharmacist (1.6%), and other healthcare provider (56.9%). About a third (33.7%) of participants (537\/1592) reported using medical cannabis during their cancer treatment and most often reported receiving instructions on how to use cannabis from no one (36.9%) or from a cannabis store or dispensary worker (23.8%). Less commonly, participants reported receiving instructions from their healthcare provider including their primary care provider (3.7%), oncology APP (2.0%), oncology physician (1.5%), pharmacist (&#60;1%), or dietician (&#60;1%). Based on this survey, about a third of cancer patients discuss medical cannabis with a healthcare provider but fewer receive a recommendation and\/or instructions for how to use medical cannabis from a healthcare provider. Additional interventions may be needed to ensure that cancer patients interested in or currently using medical cannabis receive guidance from oncology care providers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-06 Supportive care, palliation, and pain management,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kea Turner<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jessica  Y.

Since these trials are not powered for statistical significance, Go\/No-Go decisions are largely driven by observed trends in ORR relative to historic control. Here we develop a bootstrapping method to systematically compare secondary endponts, such as the waterfall plot, to historic control data. In addition, we identify an actionable Go threshold and estimate the expected false positive and false negative rates associated with that threshold.<br \/>Method: A proprietary mathematical model was used to simulate thousands of single-arm trials (n = 30) with a combination of pembrolizumab and a novel agent with miserable (Rx0), modest (Rx1), moderate (Rx2) or magnificent (Rx3) efficacy. A bootstrapping method was used to compare waterfall plots from these trials to a simulated Phase III pembrolizumab monotherapy control arm (n = 511).<br \/>Results: The bootstrapping method provides a visualization of the observed waterfall plot for the single-arm combination trial relative to the range of possible outcomes from historic control data (5<sup>th<\/sup>, median, 95<sup>th<\/sup> percentile). The method also provides a score reflecting the probability that the observed data is different from the historic control. An ROC analysis showed a strong ability to separate drugs with modest (AUROC = 83%), moderate (AUROC = 96%) and magnificent combination efficacy (AUROC = 99%) from drugs with miserable efficacy. The method was shown to effectively move drugs with a range of efficacy through an <i>in-silico<\/i> pipeline while rejecting drugs without combination efficacy.<br \/>Conclusion: This bootstrapping method allows comparisons of secondary endpoints from early clinical trials to historic control data. The visualization is intuitive, and the quantification provides an actionable Go-threshold. The method also provides an estimate of the risk associated with that recommendation. We suggest incorporation of this as a component of Go\/No-Go decision making in early oncology trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Statistical approach,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Phase I,Pharmacodynamics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aparna Mohan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Raunak Dutta<sup>1<\/sup>, Jacqueline Buros-Novik<sup>2<\/sup>, Omobolaji Akala<sup>3<\/sup>, Brian Gregory Topp<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Vantage Research, Chennai, India,<sup>2<\/sup>Generable, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Merck, Rahway, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"67e14765-6418-41a4-bfa9-92d0bf989089","ControlNumber":"3841","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

In recent years, the landscape of treatment options has rapidly evolved. With the success of checkpoint inhibitors in triple negative IBC, immunotherapy has become standard of care highlighting the strength of T cell-based strategies for anti-tumor therapy. Naturally, the targets of T cell-mediated immune responses are represented by short peptides presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. For several years, huge effort has been made to analyze and characterize HLA-presented tumor antigens to further understand anti-tumor immunity and to identify suitable targets for novel immunotherapy approaches. Aside from membrane-bound HLA molecules, soluble HLA-peptide complexes (sHLA) can be found in a variety of body fluids. These molecules are suggested to impact cellular immune responses, but it is still a matter of debate, whether shifts in sHLA levels contribute to disease outcome or are observed as a consequence of disease. Whereas the role of the non-classical sHLA-G in IBC has been studied showing elevated levels in patients compared to a healthy cohort, data on classical sHLA class I molecules is not yet available. Here, we report on sHLA class I serum levels in patients with IBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or combined chemotherapy with antibody treatment (n = 52). We observed higher serum levels of sHLA in neoadjuvant-treated IBC patients without histopathological complete response after neoadjuvant therapy (n = 36) compared to healthy volunteers (n = 84). Patients with locally advanced tumors, according to TNM classification, had a tendency towards lower sHLA levels than patients with small size tumors. Furthermore, sHLA levels were decreased in patients with sentinel node or disseminated axillary lymph node metastases compared to non-metastatic patients. Of note, sHLA levels tended to be elevated in patients with Her2-overexpression (based on immunohistochemistry staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization), whereas for histological hormone receptor expression a tendency towards lower sHLA levels in patients with high expression was observed. Furthermore, sHLA levels were reduced in patients with disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow aspiration. No significant difference in sHLA levels were seen in terms of grading of tumor, prevalence of distant metastasis, menopausal status and elevated tumor markers. Interestingly, we observed a tendency to prolonged progression-free survival in patients with high serum concentrations of sHLA, which will be updated with data from additional patients at the AACR meeting. Taken together, these data provides first insights about sHLA class I in patients with IBC after neoadjuvant treatment suggesting an impact of sHLA and T cell-mediated immune surveillance on survival in patients with IBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,HLA class I,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christian M.

Many patients present to the emergency department (ED) for septicemia and pneumonia, which leads to long hospital stays. However, there is little data on the annual trends of hospital charges and risk factors for a high charge for these patients.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We utilized the 2006-2012 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample to analyze the charges of lung cancer patients. Multivariate linear regressions were used to identify factors associated with higher ED and inpatient (IP) costs. The 20 most common primary diagnoses of these patients were included in the analysis to take into account the reason for the ED visit. Charges were corrected for inflation by normalizing to 2012 US Dollars.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>During this time period, 1,344,817 lung cancer patients presented to the ED. Lung cancer patients were charged a cumulative of $3.06 billion in the ED and $38.6 billion in the IP setting. Annual cumulative ED charges increased by a factor of 2.5 from $575 million in 2006 to $1.42 billion in 2012 (p&#60;0.001). Annual cumulative IP charges increased by a factor of 1.4 from $10.8 billion in 2006 to $14.6 billion in 2012 (p&#60;0.001). Furthermore, annual per-patient ED and IP charges increased significantly during this time period. Per-patient annual ED charges increased by a factor of 1.6 from $2,169 in 2006 to $3,522 in 2012 (p&#60;0.001). Per-patient annual IP charges increased by a factor of 1.2 from $41,835 in 2006 to $49,051 in 2012 (p&#60;0.001).

Most melanoma patients who died in the ED were over the age of 70 years (60.0%), male (63.8%), Medicare beneficiaries (65.6%), of the highest income quartile (31.0%), presenting to a hospital in the South (35.3%), presenting to non-trauma hospitals (48.3%), and presenting to metropolitan non-teaching hospitals (43.4%). The most common reasons for patients who died upon presentation to the ED were a secondary malignancy (20.7%), septicemia (10.8%), acute cerebrovascular disease (7.5%), pneumonia (5.2%), and congestive heart failure (2.6%). The top 3 factors associated with high risk of death were septicemia (odds ratio (OR)=7.39, 95% confidence interval (CI)=5.79-9.43; p&#60;0.001), acute cerebrovascular disease (OR=3.44, 95%CI=2.62-4.51; p&#60;0.001), and age &#62;70 years (OR=2.50, 95%CI=1.24-5.03; p=0.010).

This study aims to examine survival differences between sAML and AML arising de novo (dnAML) in relation to antecedent cancer types and the receipt of prior cancer treatment.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Individuals aged &#8805;20 years and diagnosed with sAML or dnAML between 2001 and 2018 and followed for vital status through 2019 were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 17 database, covering 27% of the US population. The differences in AML-specific survival between individuals with sAML and dnAML were examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Trends in five-year age-standardized relative survival from 2001-2014 were assessed using Joinpoint survival model for sAML and dnAML, separately.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 7,306 individuals diagnosed with sAML and 40,398 individuals with dnAML were included. During a median follow-up of 6 months, 78% of individuals with sAML died from AML compared to 71% of those with dnAML. In multivariable models, the risk of AML-specific mortality was 8% higher in individuals diagnosed with sAML than in those diagnosed with dnAML (hazard ratio [HR]=1.08, 95%CI=1.05-1.11), with the elevated risk more pronounced among those with younger ages at diagnosis (HR<sub>20-54 years<\/sub>=1.60, 95%CI=1.46-1.75 versus HR<sub>65+ years<\/sub>=0.99, 95%CI=0.96-1.03; P<sub>interaction<\/sub>&#60;0.0001) and those who received chemotherapy (HR<sub>chemotherapy yes<\/sub>=1.14, 95%CI=1.10-1.19 versus HR<sub>chemotherapy no\/unknown<\/sub>=0.95, 95%CI=0.90-0.99; P<sub>interaction<\/sub>=0.0004).

Further subgroup analysis by the receipt of chemotherapy for antecedent cancers showed that the elevated risk was generally restricted to individuals with a history of chemotherapy receipt with some variations by cancer types. Five-year relative survival significantly increased from 2001 to 2014 for both sAML and dnAML; though the increase was slower for sAML (annual percent change [APC]=0.30%, 95% CI 0.20-0.40) compared with dnAML (APC=0.77%, 95%CI=0.69-0.84). Likewise, five-year survival for the most contemporary period (2010-2018) was substantially lower for sAML (9.8%, 95%CI=9.3-10.3) than for dnAML (22.8%, 95%CI=22.3-23.2).<br \/><b>C<\/b><b>onclusion: <\/b>Individuals with sAML had in general worse AML cause-specific survival compared with their dnAML counterparts, with the differences most pronounced among those diagnosed at younger ages and who received chemotherapy.

Emerging evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota might play a critical role in the development of postoperative complications after gastrointestinal surgery. Here, we studied changes in fecal microbiota composition comparing samples collected before and after colon cancer surgery. Moreover, we examined whether the microbiota composition before surgery was associated with postoperative complications, and we explored potential determinants of the preoperative microbiota in colon cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: For this study, two fecal samples were provided by 78 patients with colon cancer. The first (preoperative) sample was collected shortly after diagnosis and before (median and interquartile (IQR) range of 4 (2-6) days) colon cancer surgery. The second (postoperative) sample was collected approximately 6 weeks (median and IQR of 42 (37-47) days) after surgery and before start of adjuvant chemotherapy (whenever applicable). Based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, the fecal microbiota diversity and composition were determined. Preoperative microbiota composition of patients who developed postoperative complications in the 30 days following surgery (n=18, 23%) was compared to those who did not (n=60, 77%) using univariate and multivariate analyses. Explorative random forest analyses were conducted to identify predictors of complication status, with relative abundance of the core genera, sex, age, fecal calprotectin levels, dietary fiber intake, body mass index, smoking status, ASA classification, cancer stage and tumor location being considered as potential predictors.<br \/>Results: After surgery, microbial alpha diversity was reduced compared to the preoperative situation, whereas compositional changes over time only reached statistical significance for <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136<\/i> and <i>Coprococcus 1<\/i>, which both decreased in relative abundance after surgery. Already before the start of surgery, relative abundance of the genera <i>Bacteroides <\/i>(10% vs 6%) and<i> Lachnoclostridium<\/i> (0.6% vs 0.2%) appeared to be higher in patients with complications versus those with uncomplicated recovery. In a prediction analysis, current smoking and relative abundance of <i>Lachnoclostridium<\/i> were identified as most profound predictors of complication status. Fecal calprotectin levels and current smoking status explained most (together 6%) of the overall variation in microbiota composition before surgery.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, higher relative abundances of the genera <i>Bacteroides <\/i>and<i> Lachnoclostridium <\/i>before surgery were associated with postoperative complications in patients with colon cancer. Future studies should expand on the potential causal and pathogenic routes underlying these observations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Colon cancer,Postoperative complications,Surgical resection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dieuwertje E.

To bolster clinical trial infrastructure, it is critical to have a comprehensive, sensitive and reliable PRO that accurately tracks LC multifactorial disease burden. This research describes the development and validation of the Lung Cancer-Health Index (LC-HI) as an efficient mechanism for assessing how patients with LC feel and function in response to therapeutic treatment. We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews with 15 individuals diagnosed with LC and collected 653 direct participant quotes to determine the most frequent and important symptoms in LC. Based upon participant responses, we designed a survey that inquired about 162 symptoms from 14 symptomatic themes. This survey was implemented in a cross-sectional study with 139 participants with LC. The collected data was used to generate the first version of the LC-HI, which contained symptom questions showing the highest impact to the population and the potential to respond to therapeutic intervention. Symptom questions were grouped into distinct subscales using factor analysis. We beta-tested the LC-HI with 15 patients with LC to evaluate its usability, clarity, and applicability. Based on patient feedback, we modified the instrument and evaluated its test-retest reliability with 22 individuals with LC. Known groups testing was performed with the final instrument.<br \/>Results: The final version of the LC-HI contains 45 symptom questions grouped into 10 subscales that measure the following areas of LC health: 1) fatigue, 2) physical function, 3) emotional health, 4) sleep and daytime sleepiness, 5) activity participation, 6) breathing function, 7) gastrointestinal function, 8) cognitive function, 9) social performance, and 10) pain. Total LC disease burden is measured using a weighted composite of these subscale scores. During beta interviews, individuals with LC deemed the instrument to be easy to use, clear, relevant, and comprehensive. Statistical and psychometric analyses confirmed that the LC-HI is reliable, valid, sensitive, specific, of high internal consistency, and able to differentiate between groups with known varying levels of disease burden (based on disability status and smoking history).<br \/>Conclusions: Our research demonstrates the validity of the LC-HI as a marker of the multifaceted disease burden in LC. This disease-specific PRO provides researchers and clinicians with a reliable tool to use in patient monitoring, clinical trials, and to support FDA drug labeling claims.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Outcome,Lung cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anika Varma<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Spencer Rosero<sup>1<\/sup>, Jamison Seabury<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Weinstein<sup>1<\/sup>, Charlotte Engebrecht<sup>1<\/sup>, Christine Zizzi<sup>1<\/sup>, Nuran Dilek<sup>2<\/sup>, John Heatwole<sup>3<\/sup>, Megan Baumgart<sup>4<\/sup>, Deborah Mulford<sup>4<\/sup>, Ronald Maggiore<sup>5<\/sup>, Lainie Conrow<sup>6<\/sup>, Jennifer King<sup>7<\/sup>, Jacinta Wiens<sup>7<\/sup>, Chad Heatwole<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Center for Health + Technology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Neurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Pittsford Sutherland High School, Rochester, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY,<sup>5<\/sup>Hospice of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>6<\/sup>Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY,<sup>7<\/sup>Go2 Foundation for Lung Cancer, Washington DC, DC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4e2e531e-c11d-44e8-b393-ddac4a54391e","ControlNumber":"4639","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

It is unclear if these patients should remain on PD1 inhibitors while new therapies are added on top or if PD1 should be discontinued when new therapies are initiated. Here we simulate a randomized controlled study comparing pembrolizumab + a checkpoint inhibitor (P+C) to a checkpoint inhibitor (C) in virtual patients that are refractory to PD1 therapy.<br \/>Methods: An IO QSP model was developed that includes intra-patient heterogeneity in tumor dynamics (target, non-target, and new metastatic lesions). The model was calibrated to individual lesion data from a large multicentre, open-label phase III study (Keynote-001) in patients with metastatic melanoma. A two year phase III study comparing P+C to C was simulated with 310 virtual patients in each group. Virtual patients were removed from the trial at the time of RECISTv1.1 progression or dropout due to AE or loss to follow-up.<br \/>Results: Virtual patients in the P+C arm displayed deeper (-11.5% vs 24.5%) and longer response (186.4 days vs 96.5 days) than virtual patients in the CPI arm. The percent of virtual patients displaying low prevalence progression (&#60; 50% of the target lesions with PD) was 86% vs 52% for P+C vs. C. Median progression free survival was also longer in the P+C arm (3.8 vs 2.1 months). Difference in progression free survival were driven mainly by virtual patients that displayed oligoprogression during the pembrolizumab monotherapy run-in period.<br \/>Conclusions: Simulations presented here show that virtual patients that continued pembrolizumab treatment beyond RECISTv1.1 progression (as part of a combination) did better than virtual patients that discontinue pembrolizumab (and switch to a new therapy).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Resistance,Combination therapy,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kannan Thiagarajan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Madhav Channavazzala<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Gregory Topp<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Vantage Research, Chennai, India,<sup>2<\/sup>Merck, Rahway, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d07b8302-f418-4e9c-8c41-f2d7f7f45d14","ControlNumber":"3705","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Progressive disease (PD), however, is an undisputed indication of treatment failure. Immune Oncology (IO) trials reporting individual patient outcomes using swimmers' plot (SP) suggest substantial OS subsequent to PD, unprecedented pre-IO.<br \/>Hypothesis: Unrecognized phenomenon of OS benefit in the setting of radiographic PD, is tissue-agnostic and prevalent (&#62;15%).<br \/>Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of IO monotherapy trials in 3 cancers if SP were reported. Percentage of PD patients (Pts) surviving beyond defined time landmarks is reported (Table).<br \/>Results: Realizing that 3rd or subsequent Rx lines rarely provide &#62; 6 months OS duration in most cancers, our results indicate that 2\/3rd of IO-treated pts, regardless of histology, or line of therapy are performing significantly better than expected; 1\/3rd surviving &#62; 1 year beyond PD.<br \/>Discussion: In IO, radiographic bulk may increase despite undeniable OS benefit (in years). We likely underestimated this phenomenon since pts with PD at 1st assessment aren't included in the SP, and with longer follow up, OS of PD pts is likely to improve with longer time to manifest it. This phenomenon--we term 'Disguised Responders' (DRs)--challenges an oncology principal. DRs needs to be considered by clinicians and future drug developers to accurately identify putative novel drugs. A plausible mechanism of DRs posits that 'virulence' of a given subclone, regardless of size or bulk, dictates Rx outcome. Virulence may operate through cachexia-induction, propensity to metastasize or metabolic adaptability, to name a few. Novel experimental approaches are desperately awaited to probe and measure virulence of different tumor subclones in future drug evaluations.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"

One of the mechanisms of MTX cytotoxicity is by inhibiting the topoisomerase II enzyme, which is crucial for maintaining cellular processes like replication. The aim of the study is to investigate if an alternative analog of MTX, named KP71 would be a suitable antineoplastic drug with reduced cardiovascular side effects. Cytotoxicity of both drugs in breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, the non-neoplastic breast cell line MCF10, cardiac human fibroblasts (HFB), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was assessed by MTT at 96h. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> values (nM) for MTX\/KP71 were as shown in table below. DNA decatenation assay demonstrated topoisomerase II inhibition with values of IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 2.9\/12.3 &#181;M for topoisomerase II&#945;, and 2.1\/7.0 &#181;M for topoisomerase II&#946; for MTX\/ KP71 respectively. Western blotting showed DNA damage by the gradation in &#947;H2AX expression at different concentrations of MTX and KP71 at 6 h and 24 h treatment. KP71 was found to retain the ability to inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cell lines in vitro with a slower profile of cytotoxicity on non-neoplastic cell lines as compared to MTX. KP71 partly exerted cytotoxicity by damaging DNA and inhibiting topoisomerase II enzyme activity. Organotypic HFB-HUVEC co-cultures were used to investigate the effects of anthracycline drugs in angiogenesis. Although both drugs reduced the number of tubules (and branches) compared to control (absence of drug), there were not significant differences between MTX and KP71.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{474EAE40-96CD-47E9-AD26-A26EA230F8C9}\"><caption>MTT IC50 (nM)<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MTX<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">KP71<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MDA-MB-468<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">27<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MDA-MB231<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">38<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">169<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCF7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">63<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">150<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCF10<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HFB<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">160<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1177<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HUVEC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">56<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">93<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cardio-oncology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Anthracycline analog,Cardiotoxicity,H2AX,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mitali Singhal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jacobo Elies Gomez<sup>1<\/sup>, Sanjit Nayak<sup>2<\/sup>, Kirsten Riches Suman<sup>2<\/sup>, Amalia Ruiz Estrada<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of Bradford, Bradford, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Chemistry and Biosciences, University of Bradford, Bradford, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dff69fd0-c0d1-4943-8ff6-2bd56d441b3c","ControlNumber":"3061","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

However, ICI-based treatment has resulted in the rise of unique immune-related adverse events (irAEs). To date, very little information is available on the frequency, significance, and management of single-organ or multiorgan irAEs in clinic. In this study, the irAEs associated with the treatment of seven FDA-approved ICIs, including three PD-1 inhibitors (cemiplimab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab), three PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab), and one CTLA4 inhibitor (ipilimumab), were analyzed based on the data of 149,303 report cases (January 1, 2015 - June 30, 2022) collected from FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) public dashboard. Our data reveal that irAEs associated with the treatment of anti-PD-1 ICIs (e.g., pembrolizumab) require less hospital care resources compared with anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4 ICIs. Tissue and organ toxicity of ICIs are age and gender specific. &#8216;Cardiac disorders&#8217; is the main disorder caused by these ICIs in cancer patients aged 65-85, while &#8216;reproductive system and breast disease&#8217; is the main disorder in cancer patients aged 18-64. There are risks of respiratory and urinary system toxicity in male patients and reproductive system toxicity in female patients when they receive the treatment of ICIs. Studies such as this one provide the statistical data for understanding patients at risk of developing irAEs, which will underscore the importance of further exploring research strategies to predict, detect, and mitigate toxicities from ICIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Toxicity,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Fan Yang<sup><\/sup>, Chloe Shay<sup><\/sup>, Zhaohui Qin<sup><\/sup>, Nabil Saba<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yong Teng<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Emory University, Atlanta, GA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dc11d236-f60b-4fda-8bbf-46665c864ca1","ControlNumber":"191","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.
