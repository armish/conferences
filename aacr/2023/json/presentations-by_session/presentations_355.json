[{"Abstract":"Background: Mutations in RAS is reported in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). Upregulation of IGF2\/IGF1R axis and IGF2 overexpression is a common finding. Targeting RAS downstream is associated with high toxicity. Combination therapies targeting parallel pathways is necessary to overcome treatment resistance. Dual inhibition of RAS downstream and IGF2\/IGF1R axis can be a potential mechanism of targeted treatment. The efficacy of this mechanism was studied using a microcancer 3D <i>exvivo<\/i> tumor cell viability assay in a KRAS mutant ERMS.<br \/>Design: Tumor was collected for a high-risk pediatric ERMS patient. Comprehensive genomic analysis, for identification of targetable genomic alterations, was performed by integrating WES, MPseq and RNAseq. Tumor spheroids grown in 3D environment were tested against multiple single drugs and combinations. The tumor viability was assed employing the Cell Titer Glow Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Results were expressed as nMATP and were shown as drug-response curve exhibiting the ATP concentration changes at Cmax.<br \/>Results: Genomic findings included an oncogenic KRAS (G12D) mutation. BAY-293 has a partial cell killing response as a single agent. Given to the presence of IGF2 over-expression, IGF2\/IGF1R pathway was targeted by linsitinib. Addition of BAY-293 to linsitinib led to enhanced effectiveness of this agent (Table 1).<br \/>Conclusion: Combination of comprehensive genomic profiling and a laboratory-based 3D micro-cancer model using the patient&#8217;s own tumor is an effective way to determine drug efficacy. Targeting RAS pathway by single agents, increases the possibility of resistance. Dual targeting of downstream pathways by MEK and PI3K pathway inhibition is highly toxic, and the clinical usage of this combination is limited. Our results have indicated inhibition of IGF-1R\/IGF2 axis in combination with other agents targeting RAS pathway, can be a potential method to address these limitations.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{876EE055-3462-4124-8B1D-CB4A7AB702FD}\"><caption>Table 1.

Recently, we identified a novel G3BP stress granule assembly factor 1 (G3BP1)-colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) fusion gene by RNA sequencing in a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). G3BP1-CSF1R (GC) juxtaposed exon 8 of G3BP1 to exon 12 of CSF1R and was predicted to encode a fusion protein containing the disrupted juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and the intact kinase domain of CSF1R. A similar CSF1R rearrangement has been reported in an AMKL cell line, MKPL1, which harbors the RBM6-CSF1R fusion. As the second CSF1R fusion discovered in AMKL, it remains unclear whether GC is a novel oncogenic driver and whether it is involved in dictating megakaryocytic phenotype. The aim of this study was to characterize the GC fusion and to investigate its role in AMKL pathogenesis and its targetability. Immunofluorescence studies showed that GC and G3BP1 were located in the cytoplasm, unlike the wide-type CSF1R which exhibited vesicular localization. Co-IP studies indicated that GC could exist as dimers in the absence of ligand stimulation. Two cytokine-dependent cell lines (TF1 and M07E) transduced with GC lentivirus showed cytokine-independent growth and constitutive activation of CSF1R and its downstream signaling, indicating the transforming ability of GC. Consistently, NSG mice transplanted with GC-expressing TF1 cells developed AML. In vitro drug studies revealed that GC-transformed TF1 (TF1-GC) and MKPL1 cells were sensitive to dasatinib and pexidartinib, as demonstrated by inhibition of kinase activation, reduced cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Moreover, in NSG mice transplanted with TF1-GC cells, dasatinib and pexidartinib significantly decreased leukemia burden and prolonged survival. Using flow cytometry, we observed that GC increased cell size, granularity, and megakaryocytic markers (CD41 and CD61) in M07E, TF1, and human cord blood CD34+ stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that GC could promote megakaryocytic skewing. Taken together, we identified and characterized a novel targetable GC fusion in AMKL. These findings may provide insights into the role of CSF1R in AMKL pathogenesis and a rationale for CSF1R-targeted therapy in AML patients with CSF1R activating alterations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Tyrosine kinase receptors,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xi Luo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chi Keung Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Hoi Yun Chan<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuet Fong Kam<sup>2<\/sup>, Kam Tong Leung<sup>1<\/sup>, Chi Kong Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Margaret Heung-Ling Ng<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f1b01638-69e0-4ce9-93a4-238debc2f078","ControlNumber":"885","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-9\/Syntenin-1\/Syndecan Binding Protein (MDA-9) is a pro-metastatic gene robustly and differentially expressed in cancer cells in comparison with corresponding adjacent normal\/primary cells and represents an attractive therapeutic target to inhibit cancer cell dissemination and tumor growth. MDA-9 contains two tandem PDZ domains that provide a nexus for interactions with multiple proteins that can initiate the transcription of metastasis-associated genes. The goal of this project was to evaluate the efficiency of a unique first-in-class, second-generation MDA-9 dual-PDZ targeted pharmacological inhibitor generated using a combination of a PDZ1 small molecule and a PDZ2 selective peptide.&nbsp;<br \/>Fragment-based drug discovery and NMR identified PDZ1i, an inhibitor of the PDZ1 domain, that effectively blocks cancer invasion&nbsp;<i>in vitro<\/i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>in vivo<\/i>&nbsp;in multiple experimental animal models. To maximize the disruption of MDA-9 signaling an inhibitor has now been developed that simultaneously binds and blocks the activity of both PDZ domains. PDZ1i was joined to the second PDZ binding peptide (TNYYFV) with a PEG linker, resulting in IVMT-Rx-3 that simultaneously engages both PDZ domains of MDA-9. Mechanistic studies involved a combination of molecular and cell biology approaches and included both established and early passaged patient-derived melanoma cell lines. To test the efficacy of potential combinatorial effects <i>in vivo <\/i>we used a murine syngeneic model and B16F10, an immunotherapy-resistant murine cell line.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/>After confirming synthesis using multiple analytical methods, e.g., HPLC, LC\/MS, and NMR, the dissociation constant (determined by microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis, of the IVMT-Rx-3 recombinant MDA-9 complex was 63 +\/- 11 &#956;M. This compound is not toxic to normal melanocytes or melanoma cells, but significantly inhibits invasion <i>in vitro <\/i>in a wide range of melanomas. IVMT-Rx-3 interrupts c-Src binding to MDA-9 and downregulates NF-kB activation. Inactivation of this transcription factor causes suppression of MMP2\/MMP9 and inhibits the secretion of cytokines\/growth factors. These molecular changes block cellular invasiveness and facilitate immune cytotoxicity by converting an unfavorable into a favorable tumor microenvironment<br \/>culminating in the repression of melanoma metastasis. In addition, the&nbsp;<i>in vivo<\/i>&nbsp;anti-metastatic properties of IVMT-Rx-3 are enhanced when combined with an immune-checkpoint inhibitor.<br \/>IVMT-Rx-3 is a unique MDA-9 antagonist in terms of composition that effectively inhibits melanoma metastasis as does our small molecule PDZ1i and holds potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies effectively targeting melanoma and in principle, a broad spectrum of human cancers that also overexpress MDA-9.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,PD-L1,Invasion,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Anjan  K.

(FMI).<br \/>Methods: We identified four patients with FGFR2 fusion positive metastatic pancreatic cancer through tumor RNAseq (OSU-SpARKFuse) which identifies gene fusions from cell free DNA (cfDNA). We assessed two tumor markers (Ca19-9 and FGFRDx, an FGFR-focused cell free DNA liquid biopsy assay) and various clinical outcomes (Best overall response, duration, and side effects to their treatments). Additionally, 10,146 tumor-tissue clinical cases of pancreatic cancers were assayed by hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (Foundation Medicine, Inc.) to identify genomic alterations in &#62;300 cancer-associated genes, MSI, and tumor mutation burden (TMB).<br \/>Results: All four patients demonstrated durable clinical responses to various FGFR inhibitors. Patient 1 harbored an FGFR2-USP33 fusion and exhibited a partial response to pemigatinib for 25 months following progression on gemcitabine\/abraxane and FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Patient 2 harbored an FGFR2-INA fusion with 12 months of stable disease to pazopanib after experiencing progression from chemotherapy. Patient 3 harbored an FGFR2-INA fusion and exhibited a 12+ month on-going, partial response to pemigatinib.

While the EGFR C797S substitution is a frequently reported post-osimertinib resistance mutation, real world evidence indicates the emergence of additional EGFR alterations that can drive drug resistance: kinase domain mutations (e.g., S768I), extracellular domain alterations (e.g., EGFRvIII, A289X), and EGFR amplification. Moreover, while osimertinib targets the classical EGFR mutations, primary NSCLC tumors are also driven by other oncogenic kinase domain mutations including G719X, S768I, and L861Q, which confer de novo (intrinsic) resistance to 3rd generation EGFR TKIs. A family of extracellular domain alterations occurs in nearly 50% of GBM patients, and these alterations are clinically resistant to all current generation inhibitors. Real world data in GBM demonstrate these EGFR alterations often co-occur and persist throughout treatment with current standard of care therapy. Of critical importance is the observation that the oncogenic isoform of EGFR in GBM is a covalent homo-dimer which can be formed and paradoxically activated by the binding of reversible 1st generation EGFR inhibitors. There is a significant clinical need to develop a potent CNS penetrant EGFR inhibitor that would target both acquired and intrinsic resistance mutations expressed in NSCLC and co-occurring EGFR alterations in GBM. An effective inhibitor should meet four design principles; 1) potent and selective against a broad family of intracellular, extracellular EGFR oncogenic alterations and amplification, 2) wild type EGFR sparing, 3) irreversible to avoid paradoxical activation, and 4) CNS penetrant. BDTX-1535 is a 4th generation irreversible CNS penetrant EGFR MasterKey inhibitor targeting a family of oncogenic EGFR extracellular domain alterations and amplification in GBM patients and EGFR resistance mutations in NSCLC. BDTX-1535 meets all four criteria for a highly effective EGFR inhibitor and was designed using the MAP Discovery Engine to target the activated conformations used by oncogenic EGFR to drive tumorigenesis. BDTX-1535 achieves potent anti-tumor activity against EGFR alterations and amplification across models including NSCLC and GBM PDX and intracranial tumors. BDTX-1535 is currently in a phase I clinical study in patients with NSCLC and GBM harboring sensitive EGFR alterations (NCT05256290).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,EGFR TKI resistance,NSCLC,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Matthew O'Connor<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew Lucas<sup>2<\/sup>, Sherri Smith<sup>3<\/sup>, Anthony Trombino<sup>3<\/sup>, Sudharshan Eathiraj<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Elizabeth Buck<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Black Diamond Therapeutics, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Gandeeva Therapeutics, Vancouver, BC, Canada,<sup>3<\/sup>Black Diamond Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"29d4aac3-27cf-4a2e-b30b-57212091b5a2","ControlNumber":"4942","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Despite initial response to standard-of-care therapy, a significant proportion of CRC\/PDAC cancers relapse and progress to metastatic disease with poor overall survival (<b>OS<\/b>). Thus, better treatment options are urgently needed. Genetic alterations in the tumor suppressor p53 gene (TP53) are found in most CRC and PDAC cases and contribute to cancer relapse, progression, and metastasis. Even though the functional consequences of p53 mutations have been extensively studied, there are no FDA approved drug or their combination targeting p53 mutant (p53<sup>mut<\/sup>) cancers. Here we present a novel inducer-amplifier strategy for selective targeting p53-deficient<sup> <\/sup>CRC and PDAC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) and high expression levels of Base-Excision Repair (BER) in p53<sup>mut<\/sup> CRC and PADC. Assessment of the BER activity in CRC and PADC cells by a new methodology with deoxyuridine analogues ethynyl-deoxyuridine (EdU) and trifluorothymidine (TFT) revealed a significant delay in removal of genomic EdU and TFT in p53-deficient cells compared to isogenic p53 wildtype (p53<sup>wt<\/sup>) cells. Notably, p53-deficient cells accumulated in late S\/G2 phase. Further, deoxyuridine analogues such as TFT-containing TAS102 induced buildup of DNA damage in p53-deficient cancer cells. Mechanistically, TAS102 did not block DNA replication but rather provoked activation of DNA Damage Response (DDR) resulting in DNA breaks in p53-deficient cells, while p53<sup>wt<\/sup> repaired the DNA lesion. This response was further enhanced by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) leading to elevated cell death selectively in p53-deficient cancer cells, along with accumulation of cells in G2 phase. PARPi alone did not induce DNA damage in cancer cells. In preclinical in vivo models, the TAS102-PARPi combination was far more effective than either drug alone in the p53<sup>mut<\/sup> Cell-Derived Xenograft (CDX) and Patient-Derived xenograft (PDX) models. Immunohistochemistry data showed that the two-drug combination increased DNA damage and cell death while decreasing cell proliferation in p53-mutant models. In comparison, the two-drug combination and TAS102 exhibited comparable effectiveness in p53<sup>wt<\/sup> PDX model. Notably, the two-drug therapy did not exhibit significant toxicity in mouse models. In summary, this work demonstrates that our novel inducer-amplifier strategy provides effective treatment option for aggressive p53-deficient CRC and PDAC cancers while limiting adverse toxic events and improving the quality of life for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,DNA damage,Colorectal cancer,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mohammed  M.

DNA-based NGS panel testing was started in April 2018, and RNA panel was added from January 2022. Single nucleotide variants\/small insertions and deletions (SNV\/INDEL), fusion, copy number alteration (CNA), microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were evaluated.<br \/>Results: A total of 140 patients were analyzed between August 2018 and March 2022. The median age at diagnosis was 8.5 (range 0.0-31.8) years. The diagnoses were CNS tumors in 56 (40.0%), sarcoma in 45 (32.1%), other solid tumors in 36 (25.7%) and histiocytosis in 3 (2.1%) patients. At the time of NGS testing, 115 patients (75.2%) were newly diagnosed and 38 patients (24.8%) were in relapsed or refractory status. In all patients, 85.7% had at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. Diagnosis was refined or changed in five patients (3.6%) after the NGS panel results were reported. Oncogenic gene fusions were discovered in 45 (32.1%) patients. <i>EWSR1<\/i>, <i>BRAF, NTRK<\/i> and <i>RET<\/i>-related fusions were the most common. Frequent SNV\/INDEL included <i>BRAF<\/i>, <i>CTNNB1<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> mutations. Common CNA were <i>CDKN2A<\/i> and <i>CDKN2B<\/i> loss, <i>MYCN <\/i>amplification, <i>CCND3<\/i> amplification and <i>PTEN<\/i> loss. Nine (6.4%) patients were identified with germline alteration, additionally. No patient had MSI, and two patients had high TMB. Fifteen patients (10.7%) were enrolled in clinical trials or compassionate use program according to molecular profiling (DAY101 [BRAF inhibitor] in 3, selpercatinib in 3, palbociclib in 2, olaparib in 2, alectinib in 1, repotrectinib in 1, larotrectinib in 1, atezolizumab in 1 and erdafitinib in 1). Two (1.4%), one (0.7%) and one (0.7%) patients received vemurafenib, larotrectinib, and pembrolizumab with non-reimbursement. Best responses included two complete response (1 high grade glioma [HGG] and 1 renal cell carcinoma), five partial responses (2 low grade glioma, 1 HGG, 1 Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and 1 papillary thyroid carcinoma), two stable disease and six progressive diseases. Four patients were not evaluable due to short duration of drug administration. One-year progression free survival and overall survival was 54.5% and 52.7%, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Application of NGS panel in pediatric cancer aid in diagnosis, treatment decision, clinical trial enrollment and germline risk determination.

In this study our objectives were to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of organoid based drug testing in the clinical setting; 2) highlight the clinical utility and the predictive value of the PARIS<sup>&#174;<\/sup> test; and 3) identify new therapeutic options for OVCA patients.<br \/>Methods: 93 patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 55 years (range 25-82) were selected as eligible for the PARIS<sup>&#174;<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>test at the discretion of the oncologists. The cohort included 74.1% high grade serous tumors, 6.9% low grade serous tumors, 6.0% clear cell carcinomas, 3.4% granulosa cell tumors, 2.5% Mullerian tumors, 1.7% carcinosarcomas and 2.5% fallopian tumors. 16.1% of patients were treatment na&#239;ve and 83.9% received one or more previous lines of treatment. 116 patient derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) were derived from surgical excisions, biopsies, or body fluids and subjected to functional testing with a panel of chemo- and targeted therapies that are FDA-approved or in clinical development. Drug responses were evaluated using a proprietary score ranking drugs from exceptional responses to no response. The median turnaround time from biopsy to report delivery was 19 days.<br \/>Results: The success rate for deriving OVCA organoids was 92%; 81.0% of samples demonstrated exceptional\/good response to at least one drug. PDTO drug sensitivities were highly concordant with both retrospective and prospective clinical response. Drugs that frequently showed exceptional\/good responses included WEE1 inhibitors (28.4%), HDAC inhibitors (25.0%), and Pan-DNMT inhibitors (11.2%). Further, 12.9% of cases showed responses to the BTK\/EGFR inhibitor ibrutinib and 23.3% to HER2 inhibitors lapatinib and neratinib.

Kinase assay results suggest that TY-2136b grants similar potency to TPX-0005 inhibiting ROS1 G2032R mutant activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 1.6 nM vs 2.4 nM ), confers significantly stronger potency than LOXO-101 inhibiting TRKA activity with G595R substitution (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.8 nM vs 460.1 nM ). The cell proliferation assay results with Ba\/F3 cells suggest that TY-2136b is similar potent as TPX-0005 inhibiting cell proliferation of the Ba\/F3 strain expressing mutant ROS1 bearing G2032R mutation, a major resistance mutation. TY-2136b also shows potent inhibition towards ROS1, ERK and AKT phosphorylation and downstream signaling in Ba\/F3-CD74-ROS1-G2032R cells. Meanwhile, TY-2136b, TPX-0005, and TRK-selective second-generation LOXO-195 inhibitors had similar activity against TRKA G595R and TRKC G623R resistance mutations, but TY-2136b was better than TPX-0005 and LOXO-195 against TRKA G595R\/F589L dual mutations <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies, TY-2136b showed dose-dependent anti-tumor effect at the dose of 5, 10, and 20 mg\/kg, bid, in xenograft tumor models carrying ROS1 G2032R and TRKA G595R mutation, and was more effective than Crizotinib and LOXO-101 at testing dose, and showed better efficacy than TPX-0005 in higher dose. Next, <i>in vivo<\/i> activity of TY-2136b was examined with xenograft model of KM-12 expressing TPM3-NTRK1 fusion proteins. The results show that TY-2136b and TPX-0005 demonstrate more effectiveness than LOXO-195, and the animals tolerated TY-2136b better than TPX-0005. In the ALK-G1202R xenograft model, TY-2136b showed a significant anti-tumor effect in a certain dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our preclinical data demonstrate that TY-2136b can treat cancers caused by ROS1\/TRK\/ALK mutations and overcome drug resistance due to acquired solvent-front mutations. Currently, TY-2136b is under first-in-human clinical investigations in the US and China. * To Whom Correspondence should be addressed to: Jun Li, Chengshan Niu and Yusheng Wu","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Multidrug resistance,ROS1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chengshan Niu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Apeng Liang<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuge Dou<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaige Ji<sup>1<\/sup>, Meihua Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Yanchao Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yan Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhongwei Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Aishen Gong<sup>3<\/sup>, Mingyu Jiang<sup>3<\/sup>, Shaoqing Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Xiugui Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Jun Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Yusheng Wu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>TYK Medicines, lnc., Zhengzhou, China,<sup>2<\/sup>TYK Medicines, Inc., Huzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>TYK Medicines, lnc., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fbbdc311-b140-4799-8d8f-78998994d988","ControlNumber":"4312","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Its dysregulation may lead to cancer progression, metastasis, cancer therapy resistance, and immune evasion. Diverse genetic aberrations leading to YAP\/TAZ hyperactivation have been elucidated over the last 20 years. Almost all the pro-tumor mutations lead to constitutive TEAD transcription factor activation, suggesting that targeting TEAD transcription factors could offer an important therapeutic opportunity. Employing structure-based drug design, we have discovered GH658, a novel allosteric TEAD inhibitor that selectively targets the auto-palmitoylation pocket of TEAD proteins. <i>In vitro<\/i>, GH658 displayed a low nM potency in TEAD-based reporter assays, which translated to specific low nM inhibition of NF2 deficient mesothelioma proliferation. <i>In vivo<\/i>, GH658 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties in different species and showed acceptable safety profile. Furthermore, daily oral dosing of GH658 led to complete growth inhibition of NF2 mutant xenograft tumors without adverse effect on body weight. More importantly, GH658 displayed significant <i>in vivo<\/i> effect on drug tolerant persistent cancer cells and drug resistance against inhibitors targeting EGFR&#8210;RAS signaling pathways in combination studies. In summary, with potent <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of targeting YAP\/TAZ&#8210;TEAD transcriptional complex, GH658 not only showed consistent monotherapy activity in selected cancer models, but also demonstrated significant synergistic effects in diverse drug combination studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Yes-associated protein (YAP),TEAD,palmitoylation pocket,drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jie Jack Li<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Guiping Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jiapeng Li<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Suzhou Genhouse Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1ac49a8b-2c93-402f-be5a-84ff95ff123b","ControlNumber":"1959","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Recently, LGSC has been found to often contain mutations in KRAS (~30%), NRAS (~10%), and BRAF (~8%). Avutometinib (VS-6766) is a RAF\/MEK clamp that induces dominant negative complexes of RAF with MEK, and inhibits proliferation of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and CRAF mutant cell lines. VS-4718 is a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor that has shown synergistic anti-tumor activity with avutometinib in other cancer models, as it blocks the potential of FAK to function as an adaptive resistance mechanism to RAF\/MEK inhibition. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of the RAF\/MEK clamp avutometinib with FAK inhibition <i>in vivo<\/i> in LGSC patient derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/>Methods: Whole-exome sequencing was used to evaluate mutations in two primary ovarian LGSC PDX models (OVA(K)250 and PERIT(M)17). OVA(K)250 and PERIT(M)17 cells were injected into SCID mice and animals were treated with either vehicle control (CTRL), RAF\/MEK clamp avutometinib (MEKi), FAK inhibitor VS-4718, or the combination (MEKi\/FAKi). Tumor volumes were measured twice per week.<br \/>Results: Both the OVA(K)250 and PERIT(M)17 PDX models express wildtype KRAS and express RAF1 mutations at position 12641679 A&#62;C, V207G. In PDX OVA(K)250 mice treated with MEKi\/FAKi, day 9 tumor volume was significantly lower compared to mice treated with CTRL (p=0.0002). At day 9, tumor volume was also significantly lower in mice treated with MEKi alone compared to CTRL (p=0.0007). Mice treated with FAKi alone had tumor volumes that were significantly smaller than CTRL by day 12 (p=0.009). By day 23, CTRL mice had reached tumor volume characteristics requiring sacrifice. Combination MEKi\/FAKi treatment resulted in improved overall survival (OS); median OS for combination or MEKi alone was not reached by 60 days. Treatment with FAKi led to median OS of 35 days; CTRL mice had median OS of 23 days (p=0.001). In vivo experiments with PDX PERIT(M)17 and PDX OVA(K)250 are ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: Combination of avutometinib with FAK inhibition showed improved in vivo preclinical anti-tumor efficacy relative to either agent alone in an LGSC PDX model with wildtype KRAS and with a RAF1 mutation. These data support an ongoing registration-directed study with avutometinib &#177; the FAK inhibitor defactinib for patients with recurrent LGSC (NCT04625270).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RAF kinase,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),MEK inhibitor,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Blair McNamara<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Cem Demirkiran<sup><\/sup>, Stefania Bellone<sup><\/sup>, Levent Mutlu<sup><\/sup>, Margherita Zipponi<sup><\/sup>, Miguel  S.

Inactivation of the <i>TP53<\/i> tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the p53 transcription factor, is observed in ~50% of human LUADs and is associated with poor prognosis and therapeutic responses. Hence, pharmacological restoration of p53 is an appealing strategy for LUAD treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated that p53 reactivation in mouse LUAD models leads to tumor regression. Here, we seek to understand the molecular mechanisms through which p53 restoration promotes tumor regression. To this end, we sought to better understand the transcriptional programs underlying tumor regression by leveraging an allelic series of transcriptional activation domain (TAD) mutants. We generated mouse models of LUAD initiated by oncogenic <i>Kras<\/i> and loss of <i>p53<\/i>, followed by reactivation of wild-type <i>p53<\/i> or p53 TAD mutants, including the TAD1 (p53<sup>25,26<\/sup>), TAD2 (p53<sup>53,54<\/sup>), and TAD1\/2 (p53<sup>25,26,53,54<\/sup>) mutants. We find that restoration of wild-type <i>p53<\/i> induces significant regression of established tumors. Interestingly, we find that restoration of the p53<sup>53,54 <\/sup>mutant induces tumor regression even more potently than wild-type p53, reminiscent of our previous findings showing this mutant is a &#8220;super&#8221; tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer. In contrast, the transcriptionally-dead TAD1\/2 mutant, p53<sup>25,26,53,54<\/sup>, is unable to drive tumor regression. To understand the basis of tumor suppression, we are currently analyzing antiproliferative cellular responses in tumors, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy and differentiation. We have also developed a complementary <i>in vitro<\/i> system to further explore the molecular mechanisms of p53 action in LUAD regression. RNA-sequencing analysis in this system has revealed transcriptional programs underlying the enhanced tumor regression with the p53<sup>53,54 <\/sup>mutant. Collectively, these findings have illuminated the individual contributions of each p53 TAD to LUAD regression. In particular, elucidating the mechanisms by which the &#8220;super&#8221; tumor suppressor p53<sup>53,54 <\/sup>mutant induces tumor regression will provide great insight for developing therapeutic strategies to restore and amplify p53 function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Lung adenocarcinoma,Therapeutic target,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mengxiong Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alyssa Kaiser<sup><\/sup>, Kathryn Bieging-Rolett<sup><\/sup>, Colleen Brady<sup><\/sup>, Laura Attardi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b5a07001-98bf-4c9b-9f21-97314e6b1152","ControlNumber":"3166","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

This study evaluates the tumor pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of combined CDK4\/6 and mTOR inhibition in recurrent HGG patients. Furthermore, single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) provides further insight on the transcriptomic and cell state change in all patients enrolled in the Phase 0 trial.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients had recurrent HGG with (1) RB+, (2) CDKN2A\/B deletion or CDK4\/6 amplification, and (3) PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutations. Six patients received five days of ribociclib (400mg QD) plus everolimus (2.5mg QD) and underwent tumor resection at 2, 8 or 24 hours following the last dose. Six dose-escalation cohorts (n=3 each) reached a dose-level of ribociclib (600mg QD) plus everolimus (70mg QW). Tumor tissue, CSF, and plasma were collected. Total and unbound drug concentrations were determined using validated LC-MS\/MS methods. Tumor PD effects were compared to matched archival tissue. A PK &#8216;trigger&#8217; (i.e., unbound concentration &#62; 5-fold biochemical IC<sub>50<\/sub>) and a PD &#8216;trigger&#8217; (&#62;30% decrease in both pRB and pS6) in Gd-nonenhancing tissue were set to qualify patients for expansion. Single nuclei cell analysis was performed on 21 fresh frozen surgical tumor samples to capture transcriptional and cell state changes.<br \/>Results:<b> <\/b>24 patients with WHO Grade III (n=2) and Grade IV (n=22) gliomas were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Following presurgical drug, all patients demonstrated marked decrease in Gd-enhancement on preoperative MRI. In Gd-nonenhancing tumor regions, the median unbound concentration of ribociclib was 561 nM whereas no unbound everolimus concentrations were detected. Across all dose-levels, 57% (13\/23) and 43% (10\/23) of tumors demonstrated RB and S6 phosphorylation decrease, respectively. snRNAseq analysis revealed significant downregulation of mTOR signaling only in endothelial cells at higher dose levels of everolimus. Amongst the tumor cells, the neural progenitor-like cell state was decreased whereas oligodendrocyte progenitor-like cell state was increased compared to standard-of-care cohort, suggesting a possible inhibition of CDK4-driven neural progenitor-like cell state.<br \/>Conclusion: In adult HGG, ribociclib achieves pharmacologically-relevant concentrations in Gd-nonenhancing tumor. Everolimus exhibits limited penetration into human glioma tissue. Phase 0 surgical tumor tissue is shown to be great resource for identifying pharmacodynamic treatment effect at the single nuclei level.

All resectable and locally advanced cases were evaluated using resected specimens, and all metastatic cases were evaluated using biopsy specimens. In patients from whom both pre- and post-chemotherapy specimens were collected, changes in HER3 expression status before and after treatment were immunohistochemically evaluated by using HER3\/ErbB3 (D22C5) XP Rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) as a primary antibody. IHC scoring (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) of membranous staining intensity was performed according to HER2 IHC gastric scoring guideline.<br \/>Results: Post-chemotherapy HER3 expression was evaluable in 41 patients, comprising 12, 14, 14, and 1 case as HER3 3+, 2+, 1+ and 0, respectively. In the HER3 3+\/2+ and 1+\/0 groups, tumor localization was 69%\/67% in the pancreatic head, 23%\/13% in the pancreatic body, and 8%\/20% in the pancreatic tail; tumor stage was resectable (post-neoadjuvant status) 46%\/20%, locally advanced 42%\/47%, and metastatic 12%\/33%; the median tumor size was 30 mm\/35 mm; CEA elevation was 23%\/20% and CA19-9 elevation was 69%\/73%; treatment regimens were FOLFIRINOX 23%\/40%, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel 19%\/0%, gemcitabine + S-1 (neoadjuvant setting) 42%\/27%, and the other chemotherapy 4%\/20%, respectively. HER3 expression was able to be evaluated before and after chemotherapy in 5 cases: HER3 IHC score changed from 3+\/2+ to 1+\/0 for 1 case, from 1+\/0 to 3+\/2+ for 1 case and maintained at 3+\/2+ for 3 cases. The median overall survival was 19.6 and 20.5 months in the HER3 3+\/2+ and HER3 1+\/0 groups, respectively (P = 0.965).<br \/>Conclusion: HER3 expression with 3+\/2+ is observed in 63% of pancreatic cancer patients, and HER3-expressing pancreatic cancer is of great interest as a therapeutic target. HER3 expression status may change before and after cytotoxic combination therapy in some cases of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB3,Pancreatic cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tomoyuki Satake<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chigusa Morizane<sup>2<\/sup>, Mao Okada<sup>2<\/sup>, Mariko Nishioka<sup>2<\/sup>, Nobuyoshi Hiraoka<sup>3<\/sup>, Satoshi Nara<sup>4<\/sup>, Tomoya Kakegawa<sup>5<\/sup>, Maki Kobayashi<sup>5<\/sup>, Kumiko Koyama<sup>6<\/sup>, Minoru Esaki<sup>4<\/sup>, Takuji Okusaka<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Chiba, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Pathology and Clinical Laboratories, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Translational Research Department, Daiichi Sankyo RD Novare Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Translational Science Department I, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"45c1686f-f5f8-4a1f-97f6-abbd8efe4931","ControlNumber":"3972","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

It is independent of AR signaling and characterized by upregulation of neuroendocrine markers like CHGA, SYP, EZH2, MYCN, and CD56. Despite of therapeutic advances, this lethal subtype of PC remains undruggable and has a shorter survival period. Our lab, as well as others, have previously reported several critical functions of GATA2 in AR signaling in PC progression, but the role of GATA2 in NEPC, remained unclear. Here we investigated the role of GATA2 in NEPC using our Patient Derived Xenografts (PDXs), 3D organoid, and 2D cell line models and characterized the pharmacological potency of K-11706, a small molecule inhibitor (SMI) for GATA2 against those NEPC models.<br \/>To overcome the absence of suitable <i>in vitro<\/i> models for NEPC, first, we developed 3D organoid and 2D cell line models from NEPC PDX models generated and shared by Dr. Nora Navone at MDACC (mdpc 155-2 and mdpc 144-13). Molecular and histological characterization of these newly developed models showed retention of parent molecular and histological features of their corresponding PDXs. Immunohistochemical characterization of NEPC patient samples and PDXs shows a strong expression of GATA2 protein. Similarly, enzalutamide sensitive cells (16DCRPC cells) showed a significant upregulation of GATA2 mRNA along with neuroendocrine marker genes upon treatment with enzalutamide suggesting upregulation of GATA2 during progression from Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) to NEPC.<br \/>Pharmacological inhibition of GATA2 by a previously reported SMI, K-11706, efficiently reduced 3D organoid growth and cell viability <i>in vitro,<\/i> suggesting GATA2 as a potential therapeutic target for NEPC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) involving our RNA seq data from NEPC cell lines after both K-11706 treatment as well as silencing GATA2 using siRNA (siGATA2) shows a high enrichment score with respect to EZH2 inhibition in curated datasets involving EZH2 inhibition. MTT assay involving a combination of K-11706 and EPZ6438 (EZH2 inhibitor) reduced NEPC cell viability more efficiently than used alone, suggesting a combinational strategy for the treatment of this lethal aggressive PC. NEPC cell line transcriptional profiling and functional pathway analysis of the K-11706 and siGATA2 transcriptomic footprint against curated databases delineated a biological network composed of genes involved in the epithelial mesenchymal transition, hypoxia, genes regulated by NF-kB in response to TNF and KRAS signaling.<br \/>Based on these results, we propose GATA2 as an actionable therapeutic target for the treatment of NEPC, and pharmacological inhibition of both GATA2 and EZH2 by small molecule inhibitors is effective in NEPC models <i>in vitro.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen independence,3D models,GATA2,Endocrine\/neuroendocrine cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amit K.

Tumors and bone marrow-infiltrating NB cells underwent to histological (selection panel: CD45, CD56, TH, PHOX-2B, S100) and to flow cytometry (selection panel: CD45, CD56, GD2, B7-H3) immunophenotyping, respectively. The biological material was then used for: 1) DNA extraction for subsequent DNAseq (Whole Exome Sequencing, 100X mean coverage, or Deep Targeted Gene Panel Sequencing, 1000x mean coverage, when the percentage of the neoplastic counterpart within the sample was over or down 60%, respectively); 2) RNA extraction for subsequent RNAseq (30 millions of reads per sample); 3) Development of primary NB cell culture (3D\/tumor-spheres) and of Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX) models in mice (both stored in local Bio-banks).<br \/>Results: 14 out of 18 patients (77.7%) had one or more potentially actionable somatic alterations in primary tumors. Among those, 4 had also one pathogenic germline variant in known cancer predisposition genes. In 11 of the 14 cases the Molecular Tumor Board identified molecular alterations potentially targetable by an approved or investigational agent, and 4 of those received the treatment. Out of 11 tumor samples implanted in mice, 5 gave rise to PDX, all preserved in a local PDX Bio-bank. Comparing all genomic variants of the 5 tumors with developed PDX samples up to second generation, we observed a high grade of similarity among primary tumors and subsequent PDX tumor models (Pearson coefficients&#62;0.8). Considered the allele frequency distribution, a significant increase in the PDX tumor models at first generation (G1) (median=0.008) and second generations (G2) (median=0.038) with respect to the primary tumors (G0) (median=0.034) was observed. The validity and reproducibility of our PDX models was further demonstrated from high rates of conserved somatic variants at G1 compared to G0 tumors (mean=81.93%), at G2 compared to G1 (mean=84.04%) and at G2 compared to G0 tumors (mean=78.31%). Finally, we were able to identify all the potentially actionable genetic alterations of G0 tumors in the PDX generations G1 and G2. A high grade of similarity was confirmed when the histological, the immunophenotypic and the transcriptomic profiles among primary tumors and PDX generations were compared. Also, NB cells grown as 3D demonstrated good rates of conserved somatic variants, paving the way to the creation of a Bio-bank of patient-derived tumor-spheres. The development of a bioinformatics pipeline for RNAseq data analysis is ongoing.<br \/>Conclusions: Until now, PREME program has reported a large number of NB patient samples, which harbor targetable genomic alterations and has allowed the development of a Bio-banks to be used for translational research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Precision medicine,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mario Capasso<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiara Brignole<sup>2<\/sup>, Veronica Bensa<sup>2<\/sup>, Vito Alessandro Lasorsa<sup>3<\/sup>, Enrico Sebastiani<sup>4<\/sup>, Sueva Cantalupo<sup>1<\/sup>, Angela Rita Sementa<sup>5<\/sup>, Katia Mazzocco<sup>5<\/sup>, Barbara Cafferata<sup>5<\/sup>, Valerio Gaetano Vellone<sup>5<\/sup>, Michele Cilli<sup>6<\/sup>, Enzo Calarco<sup>2<\/sup>, Elena Giusto<sup>2<\/sup>, Eleonora Ciampi<sup>2<\/sup>, Patrizia Perri<sup>2<\/sup>, Maria Valeria Corrias<sup>2<\/sup>, Sanja Aveic<sup>7<\/sup>, Doriana Fruci<sup>8<\/sup>, Alessandro Quattrone<sup>4<\/sup>, Annalisa Tondo<sup>9<\/sup>, Roberto Luksch<sup>10<\/sup>, Rossella Mura<sup>11<\/sup>, Marco Rabusin<sup>12<\/sup>, Francesco De Leonardis<sup>13<\/sup>, Monica Cellini<sup>14<\/sup>, Paola Coccia<sup>15<\/sup>, Massimo Conte<sup>16<\/sup>, Loredana Amoroso<sup>16<\/sup>, Alberto Garaventa<sup>16<\/sup>, Mirco Ponzoni<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Fabio Pastorino<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Molecolare,, Università di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Laboratorio di Terapie Sperimentali in Oncologia, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate, Napoli, Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>Dipartimento CIBIO, Università di Trento, Trento, Italy,<sup>5<\/sup>UOC Anatomia Patologica, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy,<sup>6<\/sup>Stabulario, IRCCS Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy,<sup>7<\/sup>Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Città della Speranza, Padova, Italy,<sup>8<\/sup>Ematologia-Oncologia Pediatrica e Terapia Cellulare e Genica, IRCCS Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Roma, Italy,<sup>9<\/sup>Ematologia-Oncologia, Anna Meyer Children's Hospital, Firenze, Italy,<sup>10<\/sup>Unità di Oncologia Pediatrica, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Italy,<sup>11<\/sup>Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Ospedale Pediatrico Microcitemico “Antonio Cao” Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu, Cagliari, Italy,<sup>12<\/sup>Dipartmento di Pediatria, Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy,<sup>13<\/sup>Oncologia Pediatrica, Azienda Ospedale Policlinico di Bari, Bari, Italy,<sup>14<\/sup>UOC Oncoematologia Pediatrica Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria, Modena, Italy,<sup>15<\/sup>Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria delle Marche, Presidio Ospedaliero “G.

The relationship(s) between obesity and the TNBC is crucial because the obesity prevalence in the USA is on the rise. Obese patients are generally diagnosed with large primary tumors, more lymph node metastases, and obesity effects on tumor microenvironment (TME) are suspected to accelerate the development of TNBC, but the exact mechanism(s) by which this occurs remain unknown. The goal of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that obesity enhances leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) oncogenic signaling in TNBC and to test the utility of LIFR inhibitor in blocking obesity driven progression of TNBC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Established TNBC cell lines were co-cultured with human primary adipocytes, incubated with adipocyte conditioned media, or exposed to high glucose (HG), then treated with the LIFR inhibitor EC359. Cell viability, colony formation, and invasion assays were used to analyze the impact of obesity on TNBC cells and to test utility of EC359. RT-qPCR, Western blotting, reporter gene assays, and RNA-seq analyses were used in the mechanistic studies. Xenografts and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the EC359.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The cell proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells were accelerated by adipocyte conditioned media or when exposed to HG. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analysis revealed a correlation between elevated LIFR expression and downstream LIFR signaling, including STAT3, as well as the subsequent activation of STAT3 target genes. The cell viability, colony formation, and invasion of TNBC cells under HG and adipose conditions were all markedly decreased after treatment with LIFR inhibitor EC359. Results from Western blotting demonstrated that co-culture with adipocytes or incubation with HG dramatically increased LIFR downstream signaling in TNBC model cells, and that this signaling is effectively suppressed by EC359 therapy. In addition, administration of EC359 prevented organoid proliferation that was mediated by the adipose conditioned media. Importantly, co-implantation of adipocytes greatly increased the growth of the TNBC xenograft tumor; however, therapy with EC359 significantly reduced the growth of TNBC caused by adipocyte co-implantation.<b><\/b><br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Conclusions:<\/b> Collectively, these findings suggest that obesity conditions promote the activation of LIF\/LIFR pathway, which in turn enhances TNBC cell proliferation. The LIFR inhibitor EC359 may be employed as a new therapeutic drug to treat obesity driven TNBC and LIF\/LIFR axis represents a potential therapeutic target for obesity driven TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),Adipocytes,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lois Randolph<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alondra Rodriguez Sanchez<sup>1<\/sup>, Logan Blankenship<sup>1<\/sup>, Uday  P.

CDK9 coordinates signaling events that regulate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pause-release state and is considered an important co-factor for oncogenic transcription factors that drive transcription in an addictive manner. CDK9 modulation offers an approach for attenuating transcriptional dysregulation driven by amplified or overexpressed transcription factors, such as c-MYC. However, targeting CDK9 in the clinic has proven very challenging. This stems from the often highly intolerable cytotoxic effects likely due to off-target effects. Targeted protein degradation offers a novel approach for engineering enhanced selectivity and mitigating other liabilities of the conventional inhibition-driven approach that have been applied to date. Here, we present the design and characterization of a focused library of highly selective CDK9 degrader molecules with rapid kinetics and potency (half-degrading concentration of &#60;1nM). We carry out transcriptional and phosphoproteomics profiling to comprehensively characterize the downstream effects and cellular adaptations resulting from CDK9 degradation. We gain new insights into adaptive responses to CDK9 modulation and the biological contexts most responsive for therapeutic application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Precision medicine,Myc,Proteasome-mediated degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mohammed  A.

With recent advances in genome sequencing technology, it was anticipated that identifying specific genetic alterations would contribute greatly to the realization of precision medicine. However, most cancer patients do not benefit from genomic precision medicine, as shown in recent Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-driven clinical trials. Functional precision medicine directly uses patient tumor cells to test their ex vivo responses to diverse drugs to predict the most effective drugs. Functional precision medicine is emerging because it provides immediate translatable information to select drugs among clinically available therapeutics. AVATASCAN&#174;, developed by Samsung Medical Center and AimedBio Inc., is a robust and accurate high throughput functional precision medicine platform with more than 1,500 historical sample data. AVATASCAN&#174;<sup> <\/sup>has tested more than 1,500 cancer patient samples across 14 different tumor types, including glioblastoma, lung, colorectal, stomach and breast cancers. We achieved a tissue culture success rate and a drug screening success rate of more than 90% in most tumor types. A retrospective analysis of the clinical outcomes of patients given matched drugs demonstrated actual complete\/partial response in 85% of AVATASCAN&#174; screening responders.

However, it has been shown that &#8216;genomics only&#8217; approach is often insufficient for best drug selection. Functional precision medicine has been recently emerging as it provides directly translatable information on which drug to choose among available drugs. Traditionally, cancer drugs are tested in cancer cell line models, but cell lines cannot represent individual clinical patients and are too biologically pronounced to be useful for drug screening purposes. Our patient-derived cell (PDC) drug screening system overcomes these points and can generally also correlate with genome changes. AVATAMED and CBmed, together with AimedBio, are collaborating in a Precision Cancer Project, set out next generation drug screening platform to screen Austrian glioma patients for proof-of-concept study. Fresh native tissue from both low- and high-grade glioma are collected. Tumor tissue is used for PDC isolation using mechanical and enzymatic tissue dissociation. To preserve the original tumor similarity, tissue is short term cultured under two weeks, and PDCs are seeded and treated with a panel of clinical- and preclinical drugs followed by viability assessment. We have cultured 65 PDCs from both low- and high-grade glioma. Tissue culture success rate and drug screening success rate was &#62;85% suggesting that specimen logistics and tissue processing are well-established and conducted. PDCs were treated with 79 drugs that are commonly used in clinical setting. In order to evaluate the quality of the results, the screening was conducted at two different sites, AimedBio and CBmed, and the data were compared. Overall, high accuracy and reproducibility were confirmed by low Coefficient of Variation (CV) between replicates and high Z-factor between negative and positive controls. In addition, data generated from both sites showed high correlations. Collectively, our next-generation drug screening platform shows the potential to give the best therapeutic options to glioma patients. To this end, we are moving forward use this platform in clinical study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Glioma,Pharmacogenomics,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nam-Gu Her<sup>1<\/sup>, Amin El-Heliebi<sup>2<\/sup>, Gi Ju Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, San Ha Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Barbara Prietl<sup>2<\/sup>, Stephanie  S.

Selecting the right agents and right drug combination is thus of critical importance and an area of unmet need. We currently lack patient-derived MM models that can enable functional precision medicine to help real-time clinical decision-making to guide individual patient treatment. We have created a method to grow MM patient avatars in MicroOrganoSheres (MOS), microscale droplet ECM that sustain the original tumor microenvironment (TME) including both stromal and immune compartments. MOS enable reliable testing of available drug combinations and experimental drugs within 10 days of bone marrow (BM) biopsy, making it feasible to guide treatment decisions in the clinic. In the current study, BMB-derived MM MOS were<b> <\/b>generated via droplet microfluidics and cultured <i>in vitro<\/i>, followed by live MOS staining and flow cytometry. Drug screen was performed on MOS with FDA-approved single agents and combinations. Responses of tumorspheres within MOS to drug treatments were quantified by AI-based live imaging algorithms to generate robust drug response curves and derive IC50 and EC50. We successfully established from all 6 MM BM biopsies, MOS conserved CD138\/CD38 tumor cell, stromal (e.g., osteoblast) cells, and all major immune cell populations, including T, NK, B, macrophage, dendritic, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells till at least 11 days after the drug assays were completed. The vast number of MOS generated from a single BM biopsy enabled high-throughput drug screening within 10 days. We tested standard-of-care drugs and their combinations applicable to the patient in 9-dose titrations. Live\/dead dye fluorescence signal was obtained after 5 days drug dosing and analyzed using Xilis AI analysis pipeline. We generated MOS drug response curve and IC50s from each biopsy. Drug responses from the first 6 MM patient MOS correlates well with their clinical outcome. Furthermore, this MOS platform enabled us to evaluate experimental therapies currently in Phase I-III clinical trials, which revealed responsive patients and insights into optimal combinations that will further improve efficacy. Based on this groundbreaking study, a clinical trial including 40 patients is starting in a month to further validate the predictability of the MM MOS assay for therapeutic decision-making in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Drug-discovery screen,Organoids,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rui Xi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaobei Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Robert Moseley<sup>1<\/sup>, Renuka Raman<sup>1<\/sup>, Ray Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shaima Jaibbar<sup>2<\/sup>, Shaun Steele<sup>1<\/sup>, Shengi Ding<sup>1<\/sup>, Yubing Kang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiling Shen<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Xilis Inc., Durham, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Duke University, Durham, NC,<sup>3<\/sup>Teresaki Institute, Durham, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3f462ff0-a7c0-4ca4-8dde-ebd924d3cce1","ControlNumber":"3017","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

However, RAS mutants have long been considered undruggable, and therefore efforts have been predominantly focused on targeting downstream MAPK signaling. We and others have shown that, MAPK inhibition using MEK inhibitors (MEKi) have limited effectiveness in such tumors due to adaptive resistance. A major mechanism of adaptive resistance involves relief of negative feedback that promotes reactivation of RTK signaling, which in turn activates RAS and results in MAPK rebound. The recent development of direct (i.e. RAS(G12C)) and indirect (i.e. SHP2i, SOSi) inhibitors of RAS have uncovered the dependence of activity of RAS(G12C) and of other RAS mutants on upstream signaling.<br \/>We and others have previously characterized sensitivity of various RAS mutants in cancer to either SHP2 inhibition (SHP2i), or to combination of SHP2i with MEKi, but a systematic characterization of most RAS mutants commonly expressed in cancer has been lacking. In this study, by combining biochemical and chemical genetic approaches we identified two classes of RAS-mutants, based on their degree of dependency on RTK\/SHP2 signaling and adaptation to MEK inhibition. One class of RAS mutants, including most RASQ61X, show complete independence from RTK\/SHP2 signaling and are fully resistant to either SHP2i alone or in combination with MEKi. The other class includes the majority of RAS mutants and is characterized by relative resistance to SHP2i, or the combination of SHP2i plus MEKi, compared to cells expressing wild-type RAS, including normal cells. Early clinical data using single agent SHP2i or combinations of SHP2i with MEKi for the treatment of patients with RAS-mutant tumors suggested modest activity as well as dose-limiting on-target (i.e. MAPK pathway related) toxicities. Our findings predict that achieving an acceptable therapeutic index by either approach for treatment of RAS-mutant tumors will be challenging, and they support instead SHP2i-based therapeutic efforts in patients with MAPK-driven tumors expressing wild-type RAS, or in combination with RAS-mutant selective inhibitors.<br \/>Collectively this work provides a framework for the design of SHP2i-based treatments for patients with MAPK-driven tumors, the majority of which currently have no effective targeted therapeutic options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras oncogene,Targeted therapy,Therapy resistance,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Beau Baars<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Christos Adamopoulos<sup><\/sup>, Ana Orive-Ramos<sup><\/sup>, Stuart A.

Patients with pLGG often have significant lifelong disabilities due to the location of the tumor and tumor treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The most common mutations in pLGG are in the mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK pathway, including the neurofibromin, and the BRAF oncgene. Tovorafenib (pan-RAF inhibitor) has demonstrated promising pre-clinical results in multiple cancers. Tovorafenib targets monomeric and dimeric forms of wild-type and BRAF mutants. Our objective is to investigate the effects of tovorafenib in pLGG, comparing the response of cells with BRAFV600E compared to NF1-mutant cells with wild-type RAF. JHH-NF1-PA1 is a neurofibromin (NF1) mutant line derived from a patient with germline type 1 neurofibromatosis, and JHH-PXA-1 has the BRAFV600E mutation. In addition to tovorafenib, we also tested TAK632, a tool compound that targets RAF and has a different structure . We measured readouts such as pERK and pMEK, pS6 and pAKT473 by Western blot. We treated our cells with 100 nM tovorafenib for 2 hours and 4 hours, and we found an increase of pERK (P=0.0037) and pAKT473 in JHH-NF1-PA1 but a significant decrease pERK in JHH-PXA-1 &#8220;BRAF mutant&#8221;. We also, tested TAK632 at 100 nM for 4 hrs, and found a decrease of pERK and pAKT protein level in both cell lines. Tovorafenib caused an increase of growth in JHH-NF1-PA1 cells at 100 nM and 200 nM by eighteen percent (P&#60;0.05) and twenty-five percent (P&#60;0.05), respectively. We detect the IC50 value at 600 nM for NF1 mutant cell line. The JHH_PXA1 cell line did not show cell growth increase in any of the lower concentrations and the IC50 was approximately 400 nM. In JHH-NF1-PA1, we observe activation in AKT and ERK in Western blot at concentrations of 500nM, 1000nM and1500nM, but downregulation at 2000nM. We further investigated the relationship between AKT and ERK phosphorylation, and the cell growth inhibition in NF1 mutant cells. FOXO1 protein induces cell cycle arrest at G1 by modulating the expression of the CDK. FOXO1 status can be regulated by AKT and ERK phosphorylation. We observed increases of total FOXO1 as well asFOXO1 phosphorylation and acetylation with increasing tovorafenib concentrations in NF1-mutant glioma. Phosphorylation and acetylation are associated with increased activity and DNA binding of FOXO1. We also detected an increase of p21CIP1 with tovorafenib treatment, suggesting the induction of senescence, which is a known effect of activated FOXO1. Additional studies investigating the induction of senescence downstream of tovorafenib are underway. We are currently planning to test tovorafenib against orthotopic xenografts of NF1 mutant glioma compared to BRAFV600E mutant glioma. Our data suggest that tovorafenib may act differently in NF1 mutant cells compared to BRAFV600E mutant cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,Akt,Glioma cell lines,p21,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lujain  A.

Currently approved BRAF inhibitors are selective against monomeric BRAF V600 mutants. These drugs are largely inactive against non-V600 dimeric BRAF mutants and have poor brain penetration. Although there is an FDA-approved KRAS G12C mutant-selective inhibitor, there are no approved inhibitors for cancer patients who harbor other (non-G12C) KRAS and NRAS mutations which promote tumor growth likely through constitutively active RAF dimers. There remains a high unmet clinical need for a highly CNS penetrant oral RAF inhibitor that targets a broad spectrum of BRAF mutations and constitutively active RAF dimers without paradoxical activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. BDTX-4933 is a potent, reversible, CNS penetrant RAF MasterKey inhibitor designed to target a large family of oncogenic BRAF mutations including BRAF monomers and RAF dimers. The compound inhibits not only all classes (I, II, and III) of BRAF mutations but also targets constitutively active RAF dimers promoted by upstream oncogenic MAPK pathway alterations, such as RAS mutations. In a panel of cancer cell lines that endogenously express BRAF or RAS mutations, BDTX-4933 demonstrates inhibition of the MAPK pathway signaling without paradoxical activation, resulting in potent inhibition of cellular proliferation. BDTX-4933 shows target engagement, inhibiting ERK phosphorylation, in tumor models in vivo, achieving strong anti-tumor efficacy and tumor regression across tumor models driven by either BRAF or RAS mutations. Furthermore, BDTX-4933 exhibits high CNS exposure leading to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition, and survival benefit in mice implanted intracranially with xenograft BRAF mutant tumors. BDTX-4933 has a best-in-class profile to treat cancer patients harboring BRAF mutations or RAF dimer-promoting upstream genetic alterations. IND-enabling studies for BDTX-4933 are on-going.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Ras oncogene,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),Brain metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoon-Chi Han<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pui-Yee Ng<sup>2<\/sup>, Luisa Shin Ogawa<sup>2<\/sup>, Shao Ning Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Miao Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Noboru Ishiyama<sup>2<\/sup>, Tai-An Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Buck<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Black Diamond Therapeutics, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Black Diamond Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"38959ad2-3871-4d0e-b517-fc58ce194928","ControlNumber":"1828","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

To search the roles of AXL in immune tolerance of tumor, we generated AXL knockout (KO) mice. These AXL KO mice showed the reduced tumor growth in syngeneic LLC-1 model compared to wild type mice. To validate the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of AXL KO-derived tumor growth, we examined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Compared with tumor-bearing wild type mouse, CD45-positive cells were significantly enhanced in tumor-bearing AXL KO mouse. Especially, these results were dominant in CD8-positive cells and dendritic cells (DCs). Tumor-infiltrating DCs showed the reduction of PD-L1 and Tim3 expression. In addition, the inhibition of AXL led to induce the DCs migration. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that targeting AXL may inhibit tumor growth through the activation of DCs including the enhancement of migration and reduced expression of immune check point proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,Dendritic cells,Cancer immunotherapy,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Da-Som Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cha Won Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyungtaek Im<sup>2<\/sup>, Yun Jung Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Dong Ha Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Chang-Min Choi<sup>3<\/sup>, Wonjun Ji<sup>4<\/sup>, Jae Cheol Lee<sup>5<\/sup>, Jin Kyung Rho<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, and Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6466c52e-100f-4427-aef1-a26550accaaf","ControlNumber":"3356","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

This is primarily due to its metastatic abilities to organs such brain, liver, bones, and adrenal glands leading to death of the patient. And there are no clinically approved drugs that can target metastasis. NSCLC with EGFR T790M overexpressing HER2 shows resistance to osimertinib and trastuzumab starting 10-18 months after therapy. For these patients, prospects are grim. To address the challenge of HER2+ drug resistant NSCLC, we have developed an innovative approach based on genome engineering of the 3&#8217; untranslated region (3&#8217;UTR) of the HER2 gene to destabilize and degrade HER2 transcript, protein expression, HER2 dependent kinases and interactome. We report the development of two very effective HER2 destabilizing constructs which when transfected into cells lead to the specific loss of HER2 transcript, protein, downstream kinases, and loss of cell viability.<i> In vivo<\/i>, we administered the constructs complexed with a nanocage to mice bearing NSCLC. We achieved very significant control of primary tumors p=0.0001 and inhibited liver and lung metastasis and prevented hepatomegaly in mice bearing tumors that received our engineered constructs. Mechanistically, the destabilized mRNA creates premature termination codon which triggers the upregulation of nonsense mediated decay proteins UPF3B and then there is subsequent uncapping of the mRNA and the exonucleases XRN1 and CNOT1 degrades the transcript specifically and the proteins are not made available. The exogenous destabilized constructs are continuously transcriptionally active dominant negative which outcompetes the native endogenous HER2 and co-opts its mRNA for degradation. The loss of HER2 leads to loss of WNK1 and YES1 leading to activation of caspase 3,9 mediated cell death. The migration and invasion of the tumor is impaired. The constructs safely integrated into non-coding regions of the genome and caused no genome rearrangements, and we found no blood, renal, liver or electrolytes toxicities in the animals that received them. Taken together, we have developed a novel therapeutic agent that inhibits the growth of primary NSCLC and metastasis to the liver and lung.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,ErbB2,Oncogene,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chidiebere  U.

Given the efficacy of next generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against on-target mutations, their first-line administration could increase the relevance of off-target resistance mechanisms. Activating <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutations and PTEN loss have been described as putative off-target resistance mechanisms across generations of EGFR TKIs. The role of these alterations in the development of resistance to ALK TKIs has been less described.<br \/>MATCH-R trial (NCT02517892) is an ongoing prospective study whose objective is to understand mechanisms of acquired resistance to cancer therapies and develop strategies to overcome it.<br \/><b>Materials and methods: <\/b>We collected clinical and molecular data of patients (pts) with NSCLC enrolled in the molecular target group (MTG) of MATCH-R trial. We identified pts with <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations or <i>ALK<\/i> rearrangements who developed <i>PIK3CA\/PTEN <\/i>alterations in tissue biopsy and\/or circulating tumor DNA upon progression to first-line osimertinib\/alectinib. We established patient-derived cell lines (PDCL) from the identified MATCH-R pts and we engineered commercial cell lines (CCL) harboring <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation (PC9) or <i>ALK<\/i> fusion (H3122) to constitutively express <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations and\/or to have a permanent loss of PTEN. Cell viability assays and Western blot studies with different EGFR\/ALK\/PI3K\/mTOR inhibitors were performed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of the 186 pts with advanced NSCLC included in the MTG of MATCH-R, 110 (59.1%) harbored <i>EGFR <\/i>mutations (EGFR+) and 27 (14.5%) <i>ALK <\/i>rearrangements (ALK+). Among them, 19 received first-line osimertinib and seven first-line alectinib. Five and two pts developed <i>PIK3CA\/PTEN <\/i>alterations in the EGFR+ and ALK+ groups, respectively. In the EGFR+ group, <i>PIK3CA<\/i> E545K (n=2), R108H, N345K and R357Q mutations were detected. <i>PTEN<\/i> mutations (F437fs*5 and Y27C) were concomitant with E545K and R357Q mutations, respectively. In both ALK+ pts, a <i>PIK3CA<\/i> E545K mutation was identified, together with <i>PTEN <\/i>exon 5 splicing in one case. We confirmed on CCL that <i>PIK3CA <\/i>E545K<i> <\/i>mutation, alone or in combination with PTEN loss, confers resistance to second-\/third-generation EGFR\/ALK TKIs. PTEN loss alone had a moderate<br \/>impact on TKIs sensitivity. Overcoming strategies combining EGFR\/ALK TKIs with PIK3CA\/mTOR inhibitors are being evaluated and will be disclosed at the meeting.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Activating <i>PI3KCA<\/i> mutations and molecular events leading to PTEN loss are frequent events at resistance to first-line EGFR\/ALK TKIs, and can be detected concomitantly. Functional assays confirmed that these alterations act as resistance mechanisms. These observations are of interest as PI3KCA\/mTOR inhibitors may have a role in overcoming resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,PIK3CA,Resistance,PTEN,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giorgia Guaitoli<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Francesco Facchinetti<sup>2<\/sup>, Juan David Flórez-Arango<sup>2<\/sup>, Floriane Braye<sup>2<\/sup>, Hayato Mizuta<sup>2<\/sup>, Santiago Ponce-Aix<sup>2<\/sup>, Damien Vasseur<sup>3<\/sup>, Ken André Olaussen<sup>2<\/sup>, Stefan Michiels<sup>4<\/sup>, Mihaela Aldea<sup>5<\/sup>, Jordi Remon<sup>5<\/sup>, Fabrice Barlesi<sup>2<\/sup>, Benjamin Besse<sup>2<\/sup>, David Planchard<sup>5<\/sup>, Luc Friboulet<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>PhD Program Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Université Paris-Saclay, Gustave Roussy, Inserm U981, Villejuif, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Medical Biology and Pathology Department, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Université Paris-Saclay, Inserm, CESP, Villejuif, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Département de Médecine Oncologique, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7fc8485a-35aa-4190-99ed-c4ab6dcfd214","ControlNumber":"7288","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

RET fusion proteins and gatekeeper mutations represent strong cancer drivers involved in the development of a variety of cancers. Although selective RET inhibitors selpercatinib (LOXO-292) and pralsetinib (BLU667) were recently marketed for patients with RET-dependent NSCLC and thyroid cancers, RET solvent front mutations G810R\/S\/C\/V and other secondary mutations such as Y806C\/N and V728A have been identified as mechanisms counting for acquired resistance to the two drugs and limits the applications of the kinase inhibitors. To provide novel RET inhibitors effective to a broader spectrum of RET fusions and mutations, we identified TY-1091 as a novel next-generation RET inhibitor through the in-house RET program and systemic screening of RET compound candidates. TY-1091 was characterized for its anti-tumor activity through <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> testing of a variety of RET-dependent tumor models including a panel of 17 engineered RET mutant Ba\/F3 cell lines and 2 cancer cell models. The results show that TY-1091 inhibits wild type and major RET mutants (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, nM): RET G810S (9.5 nM), RET V804M\/L\/E (2.8-12.6 nM), and double mutants RET V804M\/G810S (23.5 nM) and M918T\/G810S (47.0 nM) through a biochemical screening against a panel of 17 engineered RET mutant Ba\/F3 cell lines. Importantly, the inhibitory activity of TY-1091 is much higher than that of first-generation RET inhibitor Cabozantinib, and comparable to other second-generation compounds LOXO-292 and BLU-667. Consistent with its mode of action, TY-1091 grants extraordinary inhibition effects to tumor cell proliferation compared to its peer compounds LOXO-292 and BLU-667 (including TT (thyroid cancer, RET C634W) and LC2\/ad (NSCLC, CCDC6-RET)), and the inhibition of the RET pathway activation, i.e., inhibition of RET phosphorylation (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 1 nM), SHC phosphorylation (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 4.6 nM) and ERK phosphorylation (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 9.8 nM) in Ba\/F3-KIF5B-RET cells further validated the above <i>in vitro<\/i> phenotype. The therapeutic potential of TY-1091 was then further validated through mouse pharmacology in that TY-1091 demonstrated remarkable anti-tumor efficacy in a variety of xenograft models including Ba\/F3 KIF5B-RET (wt), Ba\/F3 KIF5B-RET (V804L), TT (thyroid cancer, RET C634W), and LC2\/ad (NSCLC, CCDC6-RET). Detailed data will be presented. In summary, TY-1091 is a highly potent, orally available, and safe small molecule inhibitor to pan-RET mutations in cancer, and may attenuate SFMs-mediated resistance to existing RET therapy. The IND clearance from the US FDA was received and Phase I clinical investigations of TY-1091 shall be launched in the US soon. *To Whom Correspondence should be addressed to: Jun Li, Chengshan Niu and Yusheng Wu","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RET,Kinase inhibitors,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Thyroid cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chengshan Niu*<sup>1<\/sup>, Maolin Zheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Huan Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Kaige Ji<sup>1<\/sup>, Meihua Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Guohui Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Rongzhen Ni<sup>2<\/sup>, Apeng Liang<sup>3<\/sup>, Aishen Gong<sup>2<\/sup>, Yazhen Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Su<sup>2<\/sup>, Mingyu Jiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Shaoqing Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiugui Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Jun Li<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Yusheng Wu<\/b><sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>TYK Medicines, Inc., Zhengzhou, China,<sup>2<\/sup>TYK Medicines, Inc., Shanghai, China,<sup>3<\/sup>TYK Medicines, Inc., Huzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1d18d49d-83fe-4900-9178-e36ecb28d301","ControlNumber":"4380","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.
