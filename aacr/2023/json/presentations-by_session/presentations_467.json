[{"Abstract":"Deregulated gene expression is a major driver of melanoma metastasis, a process that results in the majority of melanoma-related deaths. Importantly, these alterations are not limited to protein-coding mRNAs, but also include noncoding RNAs. Despite many recent studies implicating circular RNAs (circRNAs) in cancer development, it is unknown if their deregulation contributes to melanoma metastasis. To identify circRNAs with putative roles in melanomagenesis, we performed RNA sequencing on a panel of melanoma and melanocyte cell lines. 21 differentially expressed circRNAs were validated by qPCR and Sanger sequencing of the backsplice junction. Further analyses of the ratio of the circular and cognate linear RNA transcripts and expression in a larger panel of cell lines identified <i>circPMS1<\/i> as a circRNA that is upregulated in melanoma through enhanced backsplicing of the linear <i>PMS1<\/i> mRNA. Using transposon-mediated delivery, we examined the effects of stable <i>circPMS1 <\/i>overexpression on melanoma cells. While proliferation and focus formation were not impacted, migration and invasion were enhanced by <i>circPMS1<\/i>. Moreover, tail vein injection of <i>circPMS1<\/i> overexpressing melanoma cells increased lung metastasis. In addition to this transplant model, we generated the first genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma overexpressing a pro-tumorigenic circRNA. These mice are currently being analyzed. Mechanistically, we find that circularization is required for the pro-migratory effects of the <i>circPMS1<\/i> overexpression construct. Additionally, <i>circPMS1<\/i> harbors the canonical <i>PMS1<\/i> start codon, a predicted ORF spanning over the backsplice junction, and a predicted IRES sequence. Indeed, inserting a flag-tag in the overexpression construct revealed <i>circPMS1<\/i> to be translated into a truncated 25kD PMS1 protein as well as a 20kD protein likely arising from an in-frame downstream start codon. Importantly, these truncated circPMS1 proteins are endogenously expressed and increased in melanoma compared to melanocytes while the full-length PMS1 protein is evenly expressed. These findings suggest that <i>circPMS1<\/i> promotes melanoma metastasis, at least in part, by coding for truncated circPMS1 proteins. Further work will establish the functions of the <i>circPMS1<\/i>-encoded proteins and their roles in driving melanoma progression and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metastasis,Noncoding RNA,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nicol Mecozzi<sup><\/sup>, Olga Vera<sup><\/sup>, <b>Florian Karreth<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5aa2b222-4f98-4987-8fae-0561ab212f69","ControlNumber":"3764","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard for care of LUAD patients who have undergone surgical resection with a high risk of recurrence. However, adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with increased risk of toxicity including chemotherapy-related death, with only a modest survival benefit. Therefore, there is an unmet need of biomarkers for assessment and identification of those in an early stage who would likely benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Circulating miRNAs are stably present in blood and potentially reflect different expressions in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, making them attractive biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to identify circulating miRNAs useful for predicting recurrence in early-stage LUAD.<br \/>Materials and Methods: miRNA microarray analysis was performed with pooled pretreatment plasma samples from stage I LUAD patients who developed recurrence within two years after curative surgery or remained recurrence free over a six-year follow-up period, as well as from healthy controls. miRNA biomarker candidates were assayed in two independent plasma sample sets from 85 stage I LUAD (validation set) and from 57 stage I and II LUAD (test set) patients.<br \/>Results: Based on miRNA microarray data and previous reports, predictive performance of miR-23a-3p, miR-23b-3p, miR-191-5p, miR-185-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-320c, miR-21-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-30d-5p, and miR-197-3p was evaluated in the validation set. Plasma levels of miR-23a-3p, miR-185-5p, miR-320c, miR-21-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-30d-5p, and miR-197-3p were significantly higher in those with recurrence as compared to those without. A miRNA panel comprised of miR-23a-3p, miR-320c, and miR-125b-5p was developed based on a logistic regression, with yielding an AUC of 0.776 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.660 to 0.893). The three-miRNA panel with fixed coefficients yielded an AUC of 0.804 (95% CI = 0.688 to 0.920) with a sensitivity of 45.8% at 95% specificity in the test set. The miRNA panel score was a significant and independent factor for predicting disease-free survival (DFS; P &#60; 0.001, HR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.51-4.22) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.001, HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.17-1.94).<br \/>Conclusion: This circulating miRNA panel may serve as a noninvasive blood test for predicting DFS and OS in early-stage LUAD patients. Our findings provide rationale for further investigation to stratify early-stage LUAD patients using blood-based biomarkers to increase the ability to provide more personalized care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-04 miRNA-based diagnostics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Recurrence,MicroRNA,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mei-Chee Tai<sup>1<\/sup>, Leonidas  E.

However, the detailed biological mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate cellular processes are still poorly understood. We identified a set of growth regulator non-coding RNAs based on data mining of CRISPR\/Cas9 screens and high-throughput sequencing studies from patient normal and tumor cells. We hypothesized that growth regulator lncRNAs play a role in cancer development by recruiting effector proteins to regulate gene expression. In our screen, the Growth Regulator Antisense 1 RNA (GRAS1) was identified as a key factor controlling growth in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Loss of GRAS1 resulted in altered expression of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and p53 and NF-&#922;B signaling pathways. Extensive DNA damage occurred within 48 hours after GRAS1 knockdown, with a significant increase in the number of &#947;H2AX loci visualized by immunofluorescence assay. We used RNA antisense purification combined with mass spectrometry to identify the NF-&#922;B activating protein (NKAP) as the top directly interacting partner of GRAS1 lncRNA. NKAP stability decreased after GRAS1 knockdown, and this phenotype could be reversed with proteasome inhibition. Further, RelA levels were decreased in GRAS1 knockdown cells. We found that GRAS1 lncRNA binds and stabilizes NKAP to enable survival and protect against DNA damage in lung cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell growth,NF-&#954;B,Genomics,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tong Su<sup><\/sup>, Bobby Kong<sup><\/sup>, Jonathan Zhu<sup><\/sup>, <b>Colleen A.

However, there is an urgent need to find novel biomarkers that to reliably stratify good responders to immunotherapy. Currently, the available biomarkers are not specific enough. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with sizes of 30-100 nm secreted by most cell types including cancer cells. Exosomes operate as an intercellular communication system by sending proteins, mRNA and miRNAs among other relevant RNA molecules. Exosomes enriched with miRNAS are involved in proliferation, differentiation, maduration and immune cell activation. Moreover, in cancer cells miRNA and other small RNA molecule expressions are dysregulated. Exosomes produced from cancer patient's plasma have been shown to be accurate diagnostic tools for the disease. In this study we profiled miRNAs and other small RNA cargo by exosome of plasma samples from 77 Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) metastatic patients before and after the first cycle of immunotherapy to evaluate the potentiality of predicting response to immunotherapy. We perform exosomes together with RNA isolation and small RNAseq sequencing from plasma samples before and after the first ICB cycle. Two independent softwares were used to identify small RNAs (RNAtoolbox and mirMaster). Prior ICB treatment we did not find differentially expressed miRNAs or other small RNA between good and bad responders. Interestingly we identified 12 exosomal miRNA differentially expressed between good and bad responders after the first cycle of ICB. Intriguingly, levels of miR-134-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-143-3p among others previously associated with NSCLC were found to be considerably higher in the good responder group than the bad responder group. Regarding other smallRNA molecules we observed a great variety and variability of piRNA, rRNA, scaRNA, lncRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, miscRNA and circRNA. To address the function of miRNA and other differentially expressed RNA molecules, we consulted KEGG, GO and Reactome for gene regulatory networks. Interestingly, KEGG results show pathways in cancer as top hit and Reactome highlight Immune System and cancer hits. In conclusion, we observed that patients that have favorable response to ICB have distinctive plasma exosomal miRNA patterns that could be used as possible biomarkers for predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-02 miRNA profiling in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer: non-small cell,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria Garrido-Barros<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Javier Oliver<sup><\/sup>, Juan Luis Onieva<sup><\/sup>, Beatriz Martinez-Galvez<sup><\/sup>, Jaime Duddelman<sup><\/sup>, Antonio Rueda<sup><\/sup>, Elisabeth Perez<sup><\/sup>, Emilio Alba<sup><\/sup>, Inmaculada Ramos<sup><\/sup>, Juan Zafra<sup><\/sup>, Manuel Cobo<sup><\/sup>, Isabel Barragán<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UGCI, Inst of Biomedical Investigation, Malaga, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2d550b9d-f3f2-4f4d-8097-18fdd7e148be","ControlNumber":"2389","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Particularly, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadliest malignant brain tumor. Most glioma research has focused on protein-coding genes and much less on the non-coding transcripts that make up 98% of cellular RNA. Transcribed Ultra-Conserved Regions (TUCRs) represent an understudied class of molecules that are found highly conserved across multiple species, including 100% conservation in mouse and rat genomes. These 481 transcripts are highly resistant to variation and are commonly deregulated in cancer, which suggests regulatory and functional importance when considered along with their high degree of conservation. We performed the first-ever characterization of TUCRs in gliomas <i>in silico.<\/i> Using an elaborate workflow, we annotated and identified TUCRs that are deregulated in GBM and low-grade glioma (LGG), associated with patient outcomes, and predicted their function in glioma initiation and progression. Most TUCRs were long non-coding RNAs. Of these, we investigated the most highly upregulated intergenic TUCR, uc.110, <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> in glioma cell lines. Knockdown of uc.110 expression via siRNA resulted in reduced glioma cell accumulation, viability, and invasion <i>in vitro <\/i>while reducing tumor volume and increasing overall survival <i>in vivo<\/i>. Concurrent lentiviral overexpression of uc.110 partially rescued wild-type expression, accumulation, viability, and invasion <i>in vitro<\/i>.

Among these EBV associated tumors, EBV genome is found in 100% of NPC tumor cells. EBV establishes a latent infection in NPC cells, expressing few viral proteins, but elevated levels of non-coding RNAs transcribed from the <i>BamHI<\/i>-A region of the EBV genome, designated <i>BamHI<\/i>-A rightward transcripts (BARTs). The family of EBV BART RNAs comprises BART-microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lnc-BARTs). While versatile functions of BART miRNAs have been revealed, little is known about the role of EBV lnc-BARTs. Here, we provided evidence to show that BARTs mRNA which derived from multiple exons of BART function as regulatory long non-coding RNA, namely <i>lnc-BARTs<\/i>, in modulating the core network for maintaining EBV latency and promoting NPC oncogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms. Our results showed that the apoptosis rate of NPC cell lines with knockdown of EBV <i>lnc-BARTs<\/i> was significantly increased, suggesting that <i>lnc-BARTs<\/i> have an anti-apoptotic effect in EBV associated tumors. MS analysis was performed to identify host factors which interact with EBV <i>lnc-BARTs<\/i> in NPC cells. <i>Lnc-BARTs<\/i> were shown to directly interact with several transcriptional regulators, including BRD4 and SC35. Notably, RNA-FISH assays demonstrated that lnc<i>-BARTs<\/i> co-localize with BRD4 and SC35 complexes in nuclear speckles, with these complexes being disrupted by treatment with JQ1, a BRD4 competitive inhibitor. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pulldown assays confirmed that <i>lnc-BARTs<\/i> bind to BRD4. ATAC sequencing analysis and transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that knockdown of BARTs in the EBV-harboring NPC cell line, C666-1, resulted in globally reduced chromatin accessibility downregulation of oncogenes like MYC and BCL2. In addition, ChIP sequencing analysis revealed that <i>lnc-BARTs<\/i> interfere PolII phosphorylation on promoters of genes. Our findings suggest that EBV <i>lnc-BARTs<\/i> are involved in epigenetic modulation of host gene expression through functional interaction with elongation regulatory machinery to maintain EBV latency and drive tumorigenesis in NPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Noncoding RNA,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>LIU JIAYAN<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Bobo Wing-Yee Mok<sup><\/sup>, Songtao He<sup><\/sup>, Honglin Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ddd21289-7012-4567-bafc-775bbf5d2c13","ControlNumber":"4396","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Despite our expanding knowledge regarding GBM at the genomic\/molecular level, we still don&#8217;t fully comprehend the molecular mechanisms responsible for GBM recurrence. Current knowledge implicates tumor-propagating Glioma Stem Cells (GSCs) in the evolution of treatment resistance and tumor recurrence. Understanding these cellular\/molecular events will inform strategies for preventing and\/or treating recurrent GBM (rGBM). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNA sequencing datasets obtained from GSCs and clinical rGBM specimens identified TGFBR2 signaling as a high frequency and potentially targetable pathway in rGBM. We show that SMAD2\/3 signaling, a downstream effector of TGFBR2, is enriched in rGBM and that patients with elevated TGFBR2 have statistically shorter long-term survival outlooks. The functional relevance of these findings was supported using ITD1, a selective TGFBR2 inhibitor, which decreased the GSC phenotype and cell viability of cells derived from clinical rGBM (rGBM cells), while simultaneously re-sensitizing them to temozolomide (TMZ) in-vitro. Since GBM is known to efficiently develop resistance to receptor-targeting monotherapies, we sought to simultaneously target multiple putative oncogenic drivers downstream of TGFBR2. To achieve this, we applied an unbiased miRNA-based network analysis that identified miR-590-3p as an inhibitor of SMAD2\/3 signaling at multiple nodes and thus a potential tumor suppressor in rGBM. Transgenic miR-590-3p robustly decreased the expression of &#62;30 putative oncogenes, reduced the GSC phenotype and cell viability, as well as re-sensitized rGBM cells to TMZ. These results predict that blocking TGFBR2 signaling will negatively impact the tumor phenotype of rGBM as well as its GSC capacity. Ongoing directions for this research include comparing the efficacy of ITD1 monotherapy with miR-590-3p therapy in rGBM models in-vivo. These results identify a significant role of TGFBR2 signaling in both TMZ resistance and the GSC phenotype in rGBM and provide a miRNA-based strategy for simultaneously targeting multiple oncogenic nodes within the TGFBR2 and potentially other oncogenic signaling pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,MicroRNA,TGF-&#946;,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sophie Sall<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jack Korleski<sup>2<\/sup>, Amanda Johnson<sup>2<\/sup>, Maya Johnson<sup>1<\/sup>, Hernando Lopez-Bertoni<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Kennedy Krieger Research Institute, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"285d2612-a730-4348-9a77-7c78f41f36c4","ControlNumber":"2853","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

A major issue for clinicians and patients alike is inherent resistance to radiation therapy. Recently, certain long non-coding RNAs (lnc-RNAs) have been shown to regulate pathways involved in resistances to lung cancer treatments. Our group recently published that a group of long non-coding RNAs, named the linc-SPRY3 family, play an important role in radiation therapy sensitivity. Originating from the Y-Chromosome, these long non-coding RNAs have been shown in vitro and in vivo to decrease the tumor burden after radiation. Interestingly, certain male Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines have been shown to have complete loss of the Y-chromosome (LOY), showing a radiation resistant phenotype. To test this, the DYZ1 region of the Y-chromosome, where the linc-SPRY3 family is expressed, was artificially introduced into radiation resistant male NSCLC cell lines with LOY. Remarkably, by adding the DYZ1 region of the Y-chromosome into these cells, they became more sensitive to radiation and had increased apoptosis. Based on this preliminary data, we hypothesize the linc-SPRY3 family interacts with important pathways in the cell to increase sensitivity to DNA double strand breaks. Through RNA-Sequencing and other preliminary experiments, we found that the linc-SPRY3 family regulates the expression of Cell Division Cycle 6 (CDC6) and Cell Division Cycle 25A (CDC25A) genes. Preliminary data suggests these interactions play a role in influencing NSCLC ability to invade and metastasize. We are currently characterizing this family of linc-RNAs by flow cytometry, in vivo metastasis models, and fluorescent in situ hybridization. We will characterize the mechanism of the linc-SPRY3 family in radiation resistance through genetic modifications and further downstream analysis via the over-expression and knockdown of these linc-RNAs. The characterization of these linc-RNAs will be critical for the development of potential diagnostic or therapeutic therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Long noncoding RNA,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Radiation therapy,Y-chromosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emily  S.

Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulates protein expression, has been linked with cancer development. Specifically, the miR-200 family has been postulated to control the balance between epithelial and mesenchymal cell states through Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a critical process for tumor metastasis. Previous results showed that miR-200c, a member of miR-200 family, is downregulated in ATC, but the biological effect of its deregulation remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the antitumor effect of miR-200c on ATC cell aggressiveness. Using plasmid overexpression, we induced miR-200c upregulation in KTC2 (KTC2-200c) and SW1736 (SW-200c) cells to analyze its role in cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and EMT markers expression. Light microscope images showed that KTC-200c and SW-200c cells presented an epithelial morphology in contrast with the control group which displayed mesenchymal morphology. Analysis by qPCR and western blot of KTC-200c and SW-200c cells showed that upregulation of miR-200c expression enhanced mRNA and protein expressions of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, while diminished the mRNAs and protein levels of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and ZEB1\/2. Additionally, KTC2-200c and SW-200c presented reduced cell colony formation and cell proliferation, and reduced cell migration visualized by wound healing assay and transwell assay. In conclusion, this study evidences the tumor suppressor role of miR-200 in controlling ATC cell aggressiveness.

Therefore, an alternative strategy should be investigated to further improve clinical benefits. Macrophages are the abundant immune cells related to the progression of melanoma and resistance to drugs. In this study, we explored the novel roles of miR-567 in the progression of melanoma and effects of macrophages.<br \/>Methods: miR-567 expression in nevus and melanoma tissues was analyzed by in situ hybridization. miR-567 was transfected into melanoma cells to investigate its biological effects through functional assays such as proliferation, colony formation, soft agar, and migration assays. In addition, miR-567-related signal transduction pathways in the melanoma cells were studied by western blot and next-generation sequencing analyses. Different phenotypes of macrophages polarized from THP-1 monocyte cells were used as <i>in vitro<\/i> model to investigate the effects of miR-567 on macrophages.<br \/>Results: Our results showed that miR-567 expression levels were decreased in melanoma cells compared to melanocyte cells. Consistently, expression of miR-567 was 0.403-fold lower in melanoma tissues (n=118) as compared to nevus tissues (n=40). In addition, the receiver operating characteristic presented that the area under the curve value of miR-567 is 0.9495. Importantly, higher expression of miR-567 enhanced the overall survival of melanoma patients. Overexpression of miR-567 significantly reduced proliferation, survival, anchorage-independent growth, migratory, and invasive abilities of melanoma cells and BRAF-inhibitor resistant cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that IGF1R, E2F1, and Cyclin B2 are direct targets of miR-567 and knockdown of these genes attenuated proliferation and survival of melanoma cells. Interestingly, introduction of miR-567 downregulated MAPK\/ERK and PI3K\/AKT pathways in melanoma cells and regulated multiple pathways related to immune response. Of note, overexpression of miR-567 reduced the promoting melanoma growth induced by M2 or melanoma-associated macrophages, indicating the involvement of miR-567 in regulation of macrophages.<br \/>Conclusion: miR-567 could be served not only as biomarkers but also as potential molecular target for prevention of melanoma progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,MicroRNA,Macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mai-Huong Thi Nguyen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chen-Huan Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu-Chi Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Mu-Shiun Tsai<sup>2<\/sup>, Ming-Hong Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Azusa Miyashita<sup>4<\/sup>, Satoshi Fukushima<sup>4<\/sup>, Nianhan Ma<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Landseed Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Saint Paul's Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>4<\/sup>Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e85cc159-4243-4b60-a61f-a84496b67ed1","ControlNumber":"2689","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Urothelial cancer-associated 1 (UCA1) is one such molecule and found to be dysregulated in the development of several cancer types, including those in bladder, colon, stomach, lung and breast. One previous study showed that an upregulation of UCA1 expression profile in hypopharyngeal cancer tissues relative to their adjacent normal counterparts significantly negated overall survival among these cancer patients. However, the molecular mechanism whereby UCA1 played any role in HPC, a subtype of head and neck cancer and often detected in advanced stages, remains elusive. In this report, we showed that ectopic UCA1 expression promoted cell migration and invasion while reducing cell proliferation. The increase of migration and invasion was accompanied by partial epithelial mesenchymal transition. By contrast, UCA1 depletion had the opposite effect. In addition to the presence of UCA1 in the culture medium (CM) and a stimulatory effect of CM derived from UCA1-OE cells on cell migration and invasion, we found a predominant nuclear localization of UCA1 in HPC cells. PTBP3, a RNA-binding protein, was identified as a novel interacting partner of UCA1 by RNA pulldown and mass spectrometry. PTBP3 silencing significantly reduced UCA1 mRNA expression, suggesting a regulatory role in UCA1 stability.

It has been demonstrated that ncRNAs have an important role in biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell migration. Changes in their expression have been associated with several diseases, including cancer. Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer, with high probability of metastasis and an unfavorable response to therapies. Our lab has developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> melanoma progression model, which was established by exposing nontumorigenic melanocytes (melan-a) to sustained stress conditions (cycles of adhesion blockage), sequentially generating different cell lines (i.e., 4C, premalignant melanocytes; 4C11-, non-metastatic melanoma cells; and 4C11+, metastatic melanoma cells), in which each cell line represents a distinct stage of tumor progression. Previous RNA sequencing data comparing these 4 cell lines identified a total of 3404 long non-coding transcripts which displayed differential expression (DE) levels when comparing two or more cell lines. We have clustered 531 of them into three distinct signatures: malignancy, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or metastasis, according to their expression profiles. We also analyzed the neighboring genes of those lncRNAs, as it is known that lncRNAs might regulate gene expression in <i>cis<\/i>. We identified the lncRNA<i> Dlx4os<\/i>, highly expressed in undifferentiated and mesenchymal-like 4C and 4C11- cells, and 6 neighboring genes whose expression correlate to the EMT signature and overall survival in human melanoma patients. Among these genes we found <i>Dlx4<\/i>, which shares the same promoter site with <i>Dlx4os <\/i>and whose expression correlates to a poor prognosis. We silenced <i>Dlx4os<\/i> in the 4C11- cells through interference RNA technology. The downregulation of <i>Dlx4os<\/i> led to expression changes in EMT-related genes, such as <i>Snail1<\/i>, <i>Sox10<\/i> and <i>Mitf<\/i>, indicating that it might play a role in EMT. <i>Dlx4os<\/i> downregulation also inhibited cell migration <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumorigenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>. These results overall indicate a role of <i>Dlx4os<\/i> in melanocyte malignant transformation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"lncRNA,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Malignant transformation,Cell plasticity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ana Luísa  P.

This study aimed to investigate the potential anticancer effect and tumor suppressive function of miR-145, to identify its gene targets, as well as to assess the role of its gene targets as prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC patients.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Cell proliferation, transwell migration, and invasion assays were performed on three miR-145 mimics transfected NSCLC cells. The effect of miR-145 in the cell cycle <i>in vitro<\/i> was assessed by flow cytometry analysis. <i>In vivo<\/i> transfection of miR-145 was performed to examine the cancer growth in eight BALB\/c nude mice. Luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the gene targets. To reveal the role of the identified gene targets in patient survival, the clinical data of 500 lung adenocarcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.<br \/>Results: Upregulation of miR-145 significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in NSCLC cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the transfection of miR-145 into NSCLC cells did not show any effect in the cell cycle. After 37 days, transfection of miR-145 showed a reduction in tumor size (49% smaller) and tumor weight (57% lighter) than mimic negative <i>in vivo<\/i>. MicroRNA target prediction database miRTarBase and luciferase reporter assays identified GOLM1 and RTKN as the direct targets of miR-145. TCGA survival analysis found that the high expressions of GOLM1 (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001) and RTKN (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0045) were significantly correlated with poor overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results revealed that miR-145 inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, but did not affect cell cycle regulation in NSCLC. It also caused a reduction in tumor growth and weight. Most importantly, we identified two direct targets (GOLM1 and RTKN) of miR-145, in which RTKN was first identified as a miR-145 target in NSCLC. Moreover, both GOLM1 and RTKN play an imperative role in patients&#8217; overall survival. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-145 may serve as a molecular therapeutic target for NSCLC, and its gene targets GOLM1 and RTKN may serve as prognostic biomarkers. Their potential clinical applications warrant further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-03 miRNA regulation of cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,miR-145,Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>William  C.

CAFs are regulated by diverse processes including regulation by miRNAs. To identify miRNAs involved in the regulation of CAF activation, we profiled miRNA expression within mouse lung normal fibroblasts (LFs) and CAFs using the NanoString nCounter method. Among numerous miRNAs differentially expressed between CAFs and LFs, miR-200 was selected for further investigation, which is more highly downregulated in CAFs. Overexpression of miR-200 in CAFs suppressed the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells in co-culture systems and inhibited metastasis in a mouse model. In addition, we verified that lung cancer patients with high miR-200 levels showed a good prognosis than those with low miR-200 levels. Next, we tried to identify novel miR-200 targets based on RNA sequencing data, lung adenocarcinoma TCGA, and TargetScan. NRP2 was confirmed to be a target of miR-200 by 3&#900;-UTR assay. NRP2 knockdown by siRNAs in CAFs suppressed cancer cell invasion, and NRP2 addback in CAF-200 restored cancer cell invasion inhibited by miR-200. NRP2 functions as a co-receptor with VEGFR, thus, CAF-200 was less responsive to VEGF than control CAFs. Collectively, this study suggests that downregulation of miR-200 in CAFs promotes lung cancer progression in tumor microenvironment; therefore, miR-200 will be a good therapeutic target or a biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-03 miRNA regulation of cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts,miR-200,NRP2,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Inyoung Cheon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sieun Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ba586336-f92a-4f66-89c7-beddb3054e56","ControlNumber":"4159","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Despite the recent improvements in imaging methodology resulting in earlier BM identification and advancements in treatment strategies, BMs are still a significant cause of patient morbidity. Furthermore, BMs frequency increases due to more prolonged survival of cancer patients and population aging. Since the most widely used prognostic scoring systems for BMs require prior knowledge of the primary origin and up to 14% of BMs are classified as BMs of unknown primary, there is an urgent unmet need for accurate biomarkers for identification of BM origin. MiRNAs are non-coding RNAs with an approximate length of 22 nucleotides, functioning as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Dysregulated miRNA expression profile has been observed in many pathological processes, including the complex and not fully understood metastatic cascade. These molecules are very stable and present not only in tissues but also in human body fluids, including blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Based on these facts, both tissue and circulating miRNAs are extensively studied as potential diagnostic biomarkers. Specific miRNA signatures of BMs were obtained using high-throughput miRNA profiling (Illumina small RNA sequencing) on 3 types of samples (metastatic tissue, blood plasma, CSF) from a cohort of 30 patients with BMs originating in the 5 tumor types &#8211; lung, breast, renal cell and colorectal carcinomas and melanomas (6 patients per group, 87 samples in total, only 3 CSF samples from RCC patients available). We identified significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in BM tissues with the ability to differentiate between primary origins. Tissue miRNAs could identify BMs originating from breast, colorectal and renal cell carcinomas and melanomas with high specificity and sensitivity. Interestingly, the heterogeneity of lung carcinomas was also characteristic for the corresponding BMs, making it challenging to distinguish accurately from other BMs. Even though the tissue-specific miRNA signature was the most precise, our results suggest a significant diagnostic potential of circulating miRNAs from CSF for BM patients. Therefore, these short and stable molecules could potentially help identify the origin of BMs of unknown primary.

In our previous work, we identified two miRs, miR-143 and miR-506, whose transient transfection induced apoptosis, cell cycle inhibition, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1, 4, and 6 downregulations. Here, we developed stable deregulations of the miRs&#8217; expressions in A549 cells, individually or in combination, to evaluate their effect on LC cell behavior. To establish homogeneous populations of deregulated cells, A549 cells with stable up and downregulated miR-143 and miR-506, alone or in combination, were sorted according to marker expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). miR deregulations were confirmed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT -PCR) analysis, and the cells were analyzed for changes in cell proliferation through cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry and cell doubling time using Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI). With the same method, morphometric characteristics were quantified. Finally, we evaluated the motility of the cells using a scratch assay and determined the gene expression of CDKs. Taqman qPCR analysis indicated a &#62;5-fold increase of the respective miR&#8217;s basal expression due to the stable transfections. The cell cycle analysis indicated a complex behavior for the individual miRs, while, in contrast, the combined upregulation of the two miRs indicated a G2 inhibition, representing a well-defined behavior in comparison to both the control and downregulation groups. Furthermore, the combined miR upregulation increased the cell doubling time compared to the control and respective downregulations. Similarly, using QPI microscopy, we observed that the miR combination upregulation had higher cellular sphericity, perimeter, and area compared to the control group. The wound healing assay did not indicate statistically significant differences among the different groups, with miR-506 upregulation demonstrating the slowest closure rate, followed by miR -143. In contrast, the differences between the miR-combination and control group were small, although the anti-miR-combination indicated an accelerated closure. In conclusion, the combined upregulation of both miRs inhibited cell proliferation through a G2 arrest, while the deregulation of the individual miRs demonstrated a complex behavior. Thus, the miR-combination&#8217;s consistent, promising behavior would indicate potential benefits using the two miRs against LC that merits further evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Cell cycle arrest,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Archana Shrestha<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Behnaz Lahooti<sup>2<\/sup>, Mahboubeh Madadi<sup>3<\/sup>, Constantinos M.

The lack of potential drug targets limits targeted therapies for SCLC patients. To track down the potential therapeutic molecules in SCLC, we performed micro-RNA sequencing from the serum samples of SCLC patients and compared with the bulk RNA-sequencing data from SCLC tumor tissues. A consistent downregulation of microRNA-1 (miR-1) was observed in the SCLC patient serum samples, cell lines, and tumor tissues compared to their matched normal control. Overexpression of miR-1 in SCLC cell lines decreased cell growth and oncogenic signaling. Metastatic studies using the intracardiac injection model of SCLC cell lines showed that miR-1 overexpression decreases distant organ metastasis. Interestingly, the loss of function studies using miR-1Zip\/sponging showed increased tumorigenesis and metastasis in SCLC subcutaneous and intracardiac xenografts. Mechanistic investigations revealed the CXCR4\/FOXM1\/RRM2 axis as a unique downstream target of miR-1 in SCLC. We found that FOXM1 transcriptionally regulates the RRM2 expression by directly binding to its promoter site, and miR-1 modulates these interactions through CXCR4. The results of the present study provided a strong preclinical rationale that miR-1 has a high potential for developing innovative SCLC therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-06 miRNAs as tumor suppressors\/oncogenes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,MicroRNA,FOXM1,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Parvez Khan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jawed  A.

Our previous study established that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell-derived EV-RNA is an important mediator of this communication, since it significantly augments the invasive potential of recipient non-tumorigenic cells (BEAS2Bs). This led us to determine the EV-RNA cargo that is specific to NSCLC EVs. Our RNA sequencing analysis revealed preferential enrichment of specific repertoires of RNA in NSCLC EVs amongst which miR-10b, miR-100 and miR-155 show synergistic effects with regard to an invasive phenotype elicited in recipient BEAS2B cells. Interestingly, our RNA sequencing analysis also revealed a global decrease in specific subsets of microRNAs (miRNAs) in NSCLC (H358 and Calu6) cells in comparison to non-tumorigenic BEAS2B cells. In contrast, the dysregulated miRNAs were found to be exclusively abundant in the respective NSCLC cell derived EVs. This suggests a precise and active mechanism of RNA sorting and loading into EVs. A cohort of dysregulated miRNAs was shortlisted, and their cellular and EV expression was validated using RT-qPCR and flow cytometry analysis by conjugating each one of the candidates to a fluorophore. After confirming that inclusion of a fluorophore to the RNA does not disrupt RNA sorting into the EVs, we transfected the cohort of shortlisted miRNAs including miR-122, miR-451a, miR-486, miR-150, miR-200b, and miR-142 each conjugated with a separate fluorophore and evaluated the dynamics of export. As a control, one cell-retained miRNA was also transfected with the pool of candidate miRNAs and the fluorescence of transfected cells was monitored at different times. Our results indicate that of all miRNAs, the fluorescence specific to miR-122 and miR-150 diminishes in less than 72 hours while others are retained longer, indicating that all miRNAs are not sorted or exported similarly. EV-RNA release was validated by treating the cells with an inhibitor of EV biogenesis i.e., nSMase inhibitor Gw4869. The inhibitor caused the cells to retain the candidate fluorescence corresponding to the respective EV-RNAs. To investigate sequence similarities between the miRNAs exclusively enriched in EVs of NSCLC cells, multiple sequence alignment analysis (<i>STREME<\/i>) was conducted, and specific motif sequences overrepresented in EVs and lost in the cells were shortlisted. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that dysregulated RNA subsets are not only causal agents of cancer progression but also contribute to poor patient outcome. Hence, there is a <i><u>critical need<\/u><\/i> to evaluate EV export of these RNAs as a potential mechanism of RNA dysregulation in cancer. Resulting data from this study is expected to not only reveal mechanistic details of EV-RNA export but will also inform future therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,MicroRNA,Tumor microenvironment,Non-small cell lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Humna Hasan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nadia  A.

In this study, we identify a novel lncRNA, GTF2A1-AS1, and reveal its effects on cell cycle progression and cancer growth. Inhibition of GTF2A1-AS1 expression alters cell cycle distribution, leading to a decrease in the number of G1 cells and a concomitant increase in all other stages of the cell cycle, and in particular S phase, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of G1\/S transition. Accordingly, knock down of GTF2A1-AS1 enhances G1 phase exit upon release from a late G1 block. In agreement with its suggested role in G1\/S transition, prolonged silencing of GTF2A1-AS1 enhances proliferation of human cancer cells. GTF2A1-AS1 RNA is mostly nuclear and its gene is localized upstream to the protein-coding gene GTF2A1. GTF2A1-AS1 functions in trans to repress the expression of EIF5A2 and HOXA13. Knockdown of either EIF5A2 or HOXA13 rescues the effects of GTF2A1-AS1 silencing on cell proliferation, indicating that it functions mainly by modulating the levels of these two proteins. In agreement with the effect of GTF2A1-AS1 silencing on cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, low levels of GTF2A1-AS1 are associated with reduced survival in brain cancer patients.

Metastatic spread occurs in up to 80% of high-grade tumors and it is a strong predictor of poor outcome, however, the mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. Large-scale microRNA expression profiling studies of human cancers have demonstrated that dysregulation of miRNA is frequently associated with many cancer types. The aim of this study was to investigate the microRNA profile in metastatic versus non-metastatic MECs. Using Real Time RT-PCR (qPCR) we have analyzed the expression of 384 miRNAs and controls in 4 non-metastatic MECs, 3 MECs with lymph node metastasis, 3 MECs with distant metastasis, and 2 non-neoplastic human salivary gland samples. The microRNA profile was able to discriminate between non-neoplastic and tumor samples and between metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. Considering non-neoplastic samples and non-metastatic MECs, 12 microRNAs were differentially expressed. The non-neoplastic versus lymph node metastasis MEC analysis demonstrated that 10 microRNAs were differentially expressed. Considering non-neoplastic versus distant metastasis MECs, 3 microRNAs were differentially expressed: 1 down-regulated and 2 up-regulated. Comparing non-metastatic MECs versus lymph node metastasis MECs we observed 17 up-regulated microRNAs. Considering non-metastatic MECs versus distant metastasis MECs, 2 microRNAs were up-regulated. One microRNA is differentially expressed between lymph node metastasis MECs and distant metastasis MECs. Our results suggest that microRNA profiles could discriminate the metastatic potential of salivary MECs and might be helpful in diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-02 miRNA profiling in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Metastatic potential,Head and neck cancers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Maria Eduarda  S.

Despite this influence, the underlying biology driving tumor ulceration remains largely unexplored. One of the potential mediators of ulceration are microRNAs (miRNAs). These short, non-coding RNAs are frequently dysregulated in cancer and can impact tumor biology via mediation of gene expression. Distinct miRNA expression patterns have been identified in melanoma that can function as predictive biomarkers of disease progression and metastasis. However, the presence of a unique miRNA profile in ulcerated melanoma has not yet been assessed.<br \/>miRNA and mRNA expression was assessed in 35 ulcerated and non-ulcerated cutaneous melanomas using the NanoString Human miRNA and Tumor Signaling 360 mRNA assays and validated in an independent cohort. Linear models and moderated <i>t<\/i>-tests were used to detect differential expression between ulcerated and non-ulcerated tumors. Pathway enrichment and functional annotations were determined using public databases. Pearson correlations were employed to predict miRNA-mRNA binding pairs. Differentially expressed mRNAs were identified as miRNA targets using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.<br \/>Comparison between groups revealed significant upregulation of 13 miRNAs in ulcerated relative to non-ulcerated tumors (p &#60;0.03). 4 of these miRNAs were also significantly upregulated in the validation cohort (miR-363-3p, miR-196b-5p, miR-135b-5p and miR-223-3p, p &#60;0.02). Conversely, 11 miRNAs were significantly downregulated in ulcerated relative to non-ulcerated tumors (p &#60;0.05), of which, miR-376c-5p was also significantly downregulated in the validation cohort (p=0.009). 21 mRNAs were differentially expressed in ulcerated relative to non-ulcerated tumors, with 3 being significant in the validation cohort as well (FPR, IL-11, and ADM, p &#60;0.05). 9 of these 21 mRNAs were then identified as predicted targets of multiple differentially expressed miRNAs in ulcerated tumors. 2 of the differentially expressed mRNAs had an inverse correlation in expression with regulatory miRNAs in our tumor samples (SOCS3 and miR-218-5p, and IL7R and miR-376c-5p). Each of the mRNAs significantly upregulated in both the original and validation cohorts have been previously associated with angiogenesis, migration or pro-metastatic cell survival in the context of cancer and pathway analysis identified significant enrichment for &#8220;granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis&#8221; (p=0.02) in ulcerated tumors.<br \/>This study demonstrates that a unique subset of miRNAs and mRNAs are differentially expressed in ulcerated melanoma when compared to non-ulcerated.

The median survival of patients with GBM is only 12 to 16 months from diagnosis despite conventional therapy. It is, therefore, important to identify new therapeutic targets, which would allow a more effective treatment. In our present study, we focus on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the regulators of gene expression in both physiological conditions and GBM pathology, and their potential as targets for future therapy.<br \/>Material and Methods: Our study included 219 GBM patients and 29 intractable epilepsy patients as controls who signed an informed consent prior to treatment. Previously, cDNA libraries were prepared from 77 rRNA-depleted RNA samples and sequenced, and the expression of 11 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs was validated in 188 specimens by RT-qPCR. Results were newly validated in an independent TCGA-GBM cohort. Moreover, LINC00634 expression was upregulated in U251 and T98G cells. Cells transfected with an empty vector served as negative controls (NCs). The effect of upregulated LINC00634 expression on viability, migration, and clonogenicity was studied in vitro, and, in the case of U251-derived cell line, in vivo in immunodeficient mice with the focus on GBM growth and diffuse character.<br \/>Results: Out of the 538 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs (P &#60; 0.001) identified by transcriptome sequencing, a panel of 10 downregulated lncRNAs (SNAI3-AS1, LINC00882, RFPL1S, MIR137HG, TTLL7-IT1, PWAR6, LINC00634, LINC00632, DGCR5, LINC00982; logFC &#8804; -2; P &#60; 0.001) and 1 upregulated lncRNA (BTN2A3P; logFC &#8805; 2; P &#60; 0.001) in GBM was validated previously by qPCR in another cohort (P &#60; 0.0001 for all lncRNAs) and newly in an independent TCGA-GBM dataset. The upregulated LINC00634 expression in U251 and T98G cells was confirmed by qPCR to be approximately 11,000-fold and 600-fold, respectively, compared to the expression in NCs. Although no significant effect on viability, migration and clonogenicity was observed in vivo, a less diffuse growth pattern was observed in U251-derived GBMs with upregulated expression of LINC00634 in vivo compared with NCs.<br \/>Conclusion: A significant dysregulation of lncRNAs was previously observed in GBM compared to non-tumor controls using both transcriptome sequencing and RT&#8209;qPCR and was newly confirmed also by analyzing the TCGA-GBM dataset. We also showed possible effect of LINC00634 upregulation on the growth pattern of U251-derived GBM tumors in vivo. Our study shows that lncRNAs are dysregulated in GBM and could, therefore, serve as promising diagnostic biomarkers in GBM as well as potential therapeutic targets. The research was supported by the project National Institute for Cancer Research (Programme EXCELES, ID Project No. LX22NPO5102, funded by the European Union - Next Generation EU).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Long noncoding RNA,Profiling,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marek Vecera<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lenka Radova<sup>1<\/sup>, Radim Lipina<sup>2<\/sup>, Stefan Reguli<sup>2<\/sup>, Martin Smrcka<sup>3<\/sup>, Radim Jancalek<sup>4<\/sup>, Michal Filip<sup>5<\/sup>, Marketa Hermanova<sup>6<\/sup>, Leos Kren<sup>7<\/sup>, Dagmar Al Tukmachi<sup>1<\/sup>, Tana Machackova<sup>1<\/sup>, Petra Pokorna<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiri Sana<sup>8<\/sup>, Ondrej Slaby<sup>9<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, St. Anne's University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Tomas Bata Regional Hospital, Zlin, Czech Republic,<sup>6<\/sup>First Department of Pathological Anatomy, St. Anne's University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Pathology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic,<sup>8<\/sup>Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University & Department of Pathology, University Hospital Brno & Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic,<sup>9<\/sup>Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University & Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4322a787-05b8-45b4-8d37-fda6f8bbfa70","ControlNumber":"7269","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.
