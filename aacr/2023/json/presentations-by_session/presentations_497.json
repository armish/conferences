[{"Abstract":"Genetically defined mice are a cornerstone of cancer research. The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) offers more than 13,500 unique mouse lines to the scientific community, many useful in advancing cancer research. Available are mouse models for specific cancers, xenograft recipients, immunodeficient platforms for PDX studies and multi-purpose tool strains having CRISPR\/Cas9 expression, conditional\/inducible expression (Cre-lox, FLP-frt, Tet-On\/-Off), optogenetic function and calcium-sensing technologies. This poster will highlight some recently added models, more than 150 of which have cancer research applications. The portfolio of strains useful for transplantation\/engraftment and &#8220;humanized&#8221; mouse research continues to expand and complement the NSG (NOD scid IL2r&#947;c-\/-) model as ideal tools for engraftment with a wide range of malignant or non-malignant human or mouse tissues. Fluorescent protein-expressing strains include the Traffic Light Reporter models for tracking of DNA repair pathways and the Gene Editing Reporter models for detection of homology directed repair (HDR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair events. As a tool for gene targeting, the RosaBxb-GT\/GA mice are designed to allow insertion of ~40kb of desired DNA sequence into the <i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<\/i> locus. In addition to safeguarding each strain by cryopreservation, JAX has a comprehensive genetic quality control program that confirms mutation identity and genetic background, and screens for unwanted alleles (such as stray GFP, Cre, neo, etc.).

To date, immunotherapy and MAPK pathway-directed targeted therapies have been largely inactive in this molecularly defined cohort and immunogenic models that reflect the distinct co-mutation patterns found in NF1-mutant melanoma patients are lacking. Leveraging a population-scale tumor genomic profiling initiative, we identified TP53 as a gene significantly co-altered with NF1 in melanoma. We thus generated and molecularly characterized a cohort of genetically engineered mice with targeted deletion of NF1 in melanocytes. Melanocyte-specific, homozygous knockout of NF1 induced hyperpigmentation yet was insufficient for tumorigenesis. Addition of TP53 knockout and\/or conditional activating mutation in BRAF (BRAF<sup>VE<\/sup>), resulted in melanoma formation with variable and high penetrance, respectively, along with histologic features consistent with human melanomas. Tumor latency and overall survival in NF1\/TP53 double knockout mice was similar to NF1\/BRAF<sup>VE<\/sup> double mutants. NF1 knockout did not shorten the latency to tumor formation in the setting of BRAF<sup>VE<\/sup>\/TP53 mutation but did intensify melanocytic hyperpigmentation in all genetic backgrounds tested. To facilitate preclinical and functional studies, we derived 22 congenic cell lines from harvested mouse tumors from NF1 knockout mice, with and without BRAF<sup>VE <\/sup>mutation, and tested their sensitivity to targeted agents. As expected, loss of NF1 conditioned the response to BRAF inhibition, while NF1-mutant cells retained sensitivity to MEK inhibition. To abrogate the effects of adaptive RAS reactivation after MEK inhibitor therapy, combined MEK\/SHP inhibition in NF1\/TP53 knockout cells and BRAF\/SHP inhibition in NF1\/TP53\/BRAF<sup>VE<\/sup> mutant cells strongly blunted ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation better than single agent therapy. However, this response to the addition of SHP inhibition was transient and ERK rebound was driven by continued MEK activation and dependance. In syngeneic xenograft models of NF1\/TP53\/BRAF<sup>VE<\/sup> mutation, MEK inhibition alone, or in combination with RAF and\/or SHP inhibition, induced tumor regression and delayed the onset of resistance and progression as compared to doublet RAF\/SHP inhibitor therapy. Overall, we demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of vertical MAPK pathway targeting in a novel cohort of genetically relevant mouse and cell line models of NF1-mutant melanoma and provide justification for future studies of vertical MAPK pathway targeting to achieve maximal ERK pathway inhibition in this molecularly defined patient cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,MEK inhibitor,Cell lines,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexis  M.

To quantify the tissue-specific selective advantage of transcriptomic drivers of tumor progression and metastasis, we have developed a platform for <i>in vivo<\/i> CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) oncogene screening.<br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b>Our platform consists of an autochthonous CRISPRa-competent mouse tumor model (PPKS; P53(F\/F), Kras(LSL-G12D\/+), R26(LSL-SAM), coupled with<i> in vivo<\/i> delivery of Cre\/sgRNA lentiviral libraries. To evaluate tissue-specific differences in oncogene selection, we designed a CRISPRa library targeting 450 of the most frequently altered genes across human adenocarcinoma. We next generated lung and pancreas tumors through administration of controlled doses of Cre\/sgRNA library <i>in vivo<\/i>. Tumors and metastatic lesions were isolated and guide enrichment was determined using NGS. We also performed CRISPRa screening on proto-oncogenic (PPKS) pancreatic organoids orthotopically transplanted into syngeneic or immunodeficient mice (NU\/J). The results from our CRISPRa screening were confirmed using single-gene activation <i>in vivo<\/i> and in pancreatic organoids.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found that pancreatic tumors displayed dramatically higher levels of guide selection relative to lung tumors. While, on average, 99.7% of guides were represented in primary lung tumors at survival endpoint, only 40.4% of guides were detected in pancreatic tumors. We identified very strong selection for Egfr-activation in primary lung tumors, followed by MafB, Sox2 and Myc. In contrast, we found near-complete dominance of Myc-activation in pancreatic tumors. Since EGFR and MYC represent two of the most frequently altered genes in NSCLC and PDAC, respectively, this indicates our ability to recapitulate clinically observed oncogene selection. To determine if the selection for Myc-activation in the pancreas was driven by immune response, we performed screening in pancreatic organoids transplanted into immune competent and incompetent mice and found that Myc was uniformly the most highly enriched target. To confirm our findings, we generated Myc-activated proto-oncogenic organoids and autochthonous tumors, and both displayed accelerated tumor formation relative to non-targeted controls.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We present one of the first implementations of autochthonous <i>in vivo<\/i> CRISPR activation screening, allowing for direct observation and quantification of oncogene selection and competition <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our model faithfully recapitulated oncogene selection observed in patient tumors by identifying EGFR and MYC as dominating oncogenes in the context of KRAS mutant lung and pancreas tumors, respectively.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Lung cancer: non-small cell,CRISPR\/Cas9,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fredrik Ivar Thege<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sonja  M.

Most such models involve systemic engraftment of immunocompromised mice with human lymphoid and hematopoietic cells, often using normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), followed by inoculation with human tumor. The ability to control and modify immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), especially human NK cells, is limited in such models. Here, we report the development of a mouse model designed to control the number of human T cells and NK cells in the TME. 18 mice and pre-validated PBMCs were obtained from Charles River. Six groups of 3 mice each were inoculated with Raji lymphoma cells. Group 1 was inoculated with Raji cells only and received no PBMCs. Raji cells were mixed PBMCs for groups 2-4. Group 5 was systemically engrafted with PBMCs 12 days prior to Raji inoculation and Group 6 was systemically engrafted with PBMCs 10 days after Raji inoculation. All mice developed tumors with similar growth characteristics. Serial fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of the resulting tumors were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results of FNAs are summarized below.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{B2849F9E-79D0-4FEC-8A2F-920F847C0F32}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Group<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Description<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% T cells in tumor at 17 days<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% NK cells in tumor at 17 days<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No PBMCs<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBMCs mixed with Raji at 1:10 ratio<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBMCs mixed with Raji at 1:2 ratio<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBMCs and Raji in matrigel<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBMCs systemically engrafted 12 days before Raji inoculation<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBMCs systemically engrafted 10 days after Raji inoculation<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.2<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>Tumors were harvested at the end of experiment, typically 27 days after tumor inoculation, and evaluated by immunohistochemistry.

We conclude co-injection of tumor and PBMCs results in engraftment of both T cells and NK cells within the TME for up to 27 days, with T cells and NK cells distributed evenly within the tumor. Mixing higher numbers of PBMCs with tumor cells resulted in increased numbers of T cells and NK cells in the TME throughout the experiment. Matrigel did not improve engraftment or persistence of T or NK cells in the TME.

LUAD encompasses several pathologic histologies, some with important differing clinical outcomes and biological behaviors. However, the molecular and cellular underpinnings of the different subtypes are largely unknown. Understanding which cell populations in the distal lung contribute to LUAD could provide insights into the marked heterogeneity in pathologic features, clinical presentation and responses to therapy of LUAD. Differential expression analysis of LUAD transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed distinct alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cell signatures with significantly different survival outcomes between tumors expressing AT2 and AT1 gene signatures. The data suggests that AT1 cells might contribute to a subset of LUAD cases. To determine if AT1 cells could give rise to LUAD, we utilized transgenic mouse models to induce Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>, a known oncogenic driver of human LUAD, in Gram-domain containing 2 (Gramd2)<sup>+<\/sup> expressing AT1 cells. This gave rise to multiple LUAD lesions, as confirmed by micro computed tomography and pathologist-evaluated hematoxylin and eosin staining, primarily of papillary histology. In contrast, activation of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> in surfactant protein C (Sftpc<sup>+<\/sup>) AT2 cells resulted in LUAD lesions of exclusively lepidic histology. Immunohistochemistry established that <i>Gramd2<\/i>:Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> lesions were of primary lung origin and not metastatic events. Spatial transcriptomic profiling revealed distinct pathway alterations within Gramd2- and Sftpc-derived LUAD, including specific upregulation of TGF&#946;-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Gramd2<sup>+<\/sup> AT1 LUAD. Immunofluorescence confirmed differences observed in the spatial transcriptomic analysis in expression patterns and distribution of cell-specific markers depending on cell of origin, while universal upregulation of a Krt8<sup>+<\/sup> intermediate cell state marker was observed. Our results are consistent with Gramd2<sup>+<\/sup> AT1 cells serving as a putative cell of origin for LUAD and suggest that LUAD may be a collection of adenocarcinomas that share a common location within the distal lung but arise from different cells of origin, a finding with potentially important therapeutic implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Histopathology,Lung adenocarcinoma,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Minxiao Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hua Shen<sup>2<\/sup>, Per Flodby<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Koss<sup>3<\/sup>, Rania Bassiouni<sup>1<\/sup>, Yixin Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Theresa Ryan Stueve<sup>4<\/sup>, Daniel  J.

Depending on the degree of muscle invasiveness and disease spread at the time of diagnosis, 5-year survival rates can range from as high as 96% to as low as 6%. In recent years, use of checkpoint inhibitor treatments for bladder cancer has become more common. Currently, there are five PD-1\/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors approved by the FDA for treatment of bladder cancer and these treatments have been used across the spectrum of disease, from non-muscle invasive to metastatic disease. However, many patients still do not receive benefit from checkpoint inhibitor treatments. For example, clinical trials have shown response rates of only 20-30% in advanced disease. To improve treatment responses and identify patients who will benefit most from checkpoint inhibitor treatment, a deeper understanding of mechanisms of treatment response is needed. In an effort to explore mechanisms of response to combined PD-1\/CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor treatment, we generated single cell RNA expression sequencing from a carcinogen-induced mouse model of muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma that included three conditions: untreated tumor, tumor treated with combination treatment, and tumor treated with combination treatment after Cd4+ T-cell depletion. After classifying tumor cells based on per cell detection of somatic variants identified using exome sequencing and assigning non-tumor cell types using SingleR, we performed differential expression, overrepresentation, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) within each cell type, comparing each pairwise set of conditions. This analysis revealed that MSigDB&#8217;s hallmark interferon gamma response gene set was overrepresented across multiple cell types. Furthermore, GSEA indicated that with combined checkpoint blockade treatment, endothelial cells showed significant enrichment of upregulated interferon gamma response genes. Functional analysis demonstrated that knocking out Ifngr1 in endothelial cells inhibited the treatment response seen in wild type treated mice. Together, these results indicate that interferon gamma response in endothelial cells is a key mediator of combined PD-1\/CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Bladder cancer,Mouse models,Endothelial cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sharon  L.

Recent approaches to treatment, which aim to improve outcomes in refractory AML, include strategies to molecularly target specific receptor-mediated signaling pathways which regulate cell growth and proliferation. One target-specific approach is the inhibition of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). FLT3 is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic progenitor cells and plays an important role in regulating proliferation, survival, and differentiation of multipotent stem cells. The presence of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) at the juxta membrane domain within the FLT3 receptor are common driver mutations in 30% of AML patients. In this study, we utilized 3 luciferase-expressing human AML models, MV4-11, MOLM-13, and, OCI-AML3 to determine the prognostic impact of FLT3 inhibitor Gilteritinib on the allelic ratio of ITD versus wildtype allele. OCI-AML3 expresses wild-type FLT3 whereas MOLM-13 is heterozygous for FLT3-ITD mutations, and MV4-11 possesses a homozygous in-frame tandem repeat insertion in the FLT3 allele. Here we demonstrate that FLT3-ITD mutational status impacts the efficacy of Gilteritinib in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> AML models. The <i>in vitro<\/i> assays showed that treatment with Gilteritinib resulted in significant dose dependent reduction in overall cell viability and bioluminescence in the MV4-11 cell line, while MOLM-13 was only moderately sensitive, and OCI-AML3 was least sensitive to Gilteritinib treatment. Additionally, we evaluated the downstream MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways as FLT3-ITD oncogenic mutations result in ligand-independent constitutive activation of signaling pathways mediating leukemic transformation. For <i>in vivo <\/i>validation, MV4-11, MOLM-13, and OCI-AML3 luciferase expressing cells were implanted systemically into NCG mice and once tumors were established, we evaluated the survival benefit in response to Gilteritinib and various standard of care agents. In accordance with our <i>in vitr<\/i>o findings, the quantification of tumor progression by bioluminescent imaging showed the highest therapeutic activity of Gilteritinib in MV4-11 tumor bearing mice through selective targeting of FLT3-ITD mutations. Taken together, our <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> results demonstrate that differential FLT3-ITD mutational status in AML models impacts Gilteritinib treatment response and downstream signaling events with the highest activity in MV4-11 followed by MOLM-13, and lack of activity in OCI-AML3 harboring wild-type FLT3.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Tumor,Mouse models,Leukemias,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bincy John<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Pasupathi Sundaramoorthy<sup><\/sup>, Elizabeth Rainbolt<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Wong<sup><\/sup>, Zachary Ward<sup><\/sup>, Justin Avery<sup><\/sup>, Savannah Todd<sup><\/sup>, Shasta Kidder<sup><\/sup>, Diana Gietl<sup><\/sup>, Chassidy Hall<sup><\/sup>, David Harris<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Durham, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"96f23bad-069a-4577-b51a-5c823cfee667","ControlNumber":"3811","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Effective pre-clinical models are needed to accurately reflect NSCLC disease progression and improve basic NSCLC research. This work characterizes two genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that reflect human NSCLC. These mouse lines utilize a cre recombinase system to induce the expression of two oncogenic mutations (<i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>, Trp53<sup>fl<\/sup><\/i>) in club cells or alveolar epithelial cells based on cell type-specific promoters (<i>Scgb1a1, Sftpc<\/i>), thereby inducing NSCLC in mice. Furthermore, these mice harbor tumor cell-specific transgenes (<i>GFP<\/i>, <i>MetRS<\/i>) for cancer tracking. The MetRS transgene allows tumor cells to incorporate azide-bearing methionine analogs (ANL) into newly synthesized proteins which can then be detected via fluorescent noncanonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT). Cancer mutations were induced at 6 weeks of age and lung samples were collected for histological analysis at early, mid, and late time points. Histological analysis of the club cell model revealed that hyperplasias are most abundant at the early time point and develop into invasive carcinomas within the bronchioles and alveoli at later time points. Histological scoring of this model showed that tumor burden increased from 28% to 61% of the total lung area after 15 weeks. The alveolar cell model progressed rapidly and exhibited adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas throughout disease progression. Histological scoring of this model revealed that tumor burden rapidly increased from 55% to 89% of total lung area after 5 weeks. FUNCAT analysis demonstrated that the incorporation of ANL within tumor-bearing mice was cancer-cell-specific. These findings suggest that the GEMM models accurately represent human NSCLC based on their cellular profile, morphology, and localization within the lung. The results also confirm that the tumor cells, and not the normal cells\/tissues, are able to incorporate ANL into their proteins via the MetRS transgene. These models have the potential to identify biomarkers of NSCLC progression to improve patient prognosis.<br \/>*This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

We exploited the availability of fourteen histocompatibility-matched mouse hosts from the collaborative cross (CC) [PMID: 15514660] as hosts for a non-germline, engineered model of murine glioblastoma [PMCID: PMC4210043] to interrogate cell types, functional states and proximity <i>in situ<\/i> in tumors with varying growth rates. Specifically,&nbsp;Kaplan-Meier survival data was used to determine the rates of Nf1:TP53 null tumor growth in different cc host groups. Spatial transcriptomics and single nucleus RNA seq (sn-seq) analyses were conducted in tumor-bearing brain tissue from C57Bl\/6 (syngeneic) and 2 CC histocompatible allogeneic mouse strains with differential survival outcomes. Spatial analysis was conducted using a disease-focused multiplexed mRNA probe set assembled from annotations of GBM\/glioma specific genes reported in the literature. Cell segmentation of the data was performed to investigate the spatial pattern of single-cell level expression. The spatial transcriptomic dataset was also analyzed with a segmentation-free pipeline. In addition, to detect cell clusters, the probability of genes detected in close proximity (genes within a cell 5px radius [0.5 um]) was determined using Pdgfra as the tumor marker (anchor). We identified differential levels of spatially correlated expression of cell clusters expressing hypoxia markers such as HIF-1a and PDK1 between hosts with fast and slow growing tumors.&nbsp; Tumors from the 3 hosts were also processed for sn-seq.&nbsp; Integrated analysis of cell clustering was used to determine differences in clusters between the fast growing and slow growing groups. Enrichment of expression of Top2a, a gene associated with proliferation and poor prognosis in glioma, was detected in a unique cluster of cells in the slow-growing tumor when compared to the fast-growing group. This suggests that the host microenvironment may play a role in influencing the decelerated growth of this tumor. These results support the utility of spatial transcriptomics and sn-seq in understanding how differences in tumor:host cell interactions contribute to tumor growth. Future opportunities enabled by histocompatible allogeneic hosts for GEM and nGEM glioma models include unraveling host effects on drug sensitivity, tumor heterogeneity, molecular plasticity, angiogenesis, invasion, and lymphoid and myeloid microenvironmental dependencies, each with profound opportunities for clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor biology,Tumor hypoxia,Mouse models,Brain tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Angela S.

Mutations in the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway occur in up to a third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases, leading to constitutive activation of NRF2 and resistance to therapy in patients. To study the role of NRF2 activation in lung cancer, we developed murine alleles of the KEAP1 and NRF2 mutations found in human NSCLC and performed a thorough interrogation of how these mutations affect tumor initiation and progression. Following targeted activation of these alleles in the lung with adenoviral-Cre, immunohistochemical analysis of Nrf2 and its target Nqo1 revealed that the Keap1<sup>R554Q\/R554Q<\/sup> mutant was the most activating towards Nrf2, followed by the Nrf2<sup>D29H\/+<\/sup> and Keap1<sup>R554Q\/+<\/sup> mutants. We found that chronic Nrf2 stabilization by Keap1 or Nrf2 mutation was not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, even in the absence of tumor suppressors p53 or Lkb1. We also found that constitutive Nrf2 activation promotes lung tumor initiation and early progression of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> cells to low-grade tumors.<br \/>To analyze the influence of Keap1\/Nrf2 mutation on later progression, we crossed these mutations into the Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>; Trp53<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> model of lung adenocarcinoma. Surprisingly, we found that Keap1<sup>R554Q\/R554Q<\/sup> mutation blocked progression to advanced-grade tumors. We also found that advanced-grade tumors downregulated Nrf2 expression and activity, suggesting that excess Nrf2 activation is detrimental to tumor progression. Next, to test whether the progression block in the Keap1<sup>R554Q\/R554Q <\/sup>model was dependent on Nrf2, we performed single copy deletion of Nrf2. We found that lowering Nrf2 levels in this model rescued the impairment in tumor progression. Finally, using a NSCLC cell culture system of NRF2 overexpression, we found that high NRF2 levels impaired cell proliferation, viability, and anchorage-independent growth. In our <i>in vitro <\/i>studies, we observed that NRF2 expression was rapidly downregulated to basal levels to restore proliferation.<br \/>Our findings indicate that NRF2 promotes lung tumor initiation and early progression but impairs late progression in a dosage-dependent manner. Our preliminary data also suggests that NRF2 hyperactivation is detrimental to tumor cell proliferation. Collectively, our results establish the context-dependence and threshold for NRF2 during the tumorigenic process. Future work will include interrogating the mechanism of NRF2 downregulation <i>in vivo <\/i>and use of additional cell lines and systems to investigate how NRF2 overexpression can impair tumor cell proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Nrf2,K-ras,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Janine  M.

Although thousands of mouse models have been generated, finding relevant data and knowledge about these models is complicated by a general lack of compliance in the published literature with nomenclature and annotation standards for genes, alleles, mouse strains, and cancer types. The Mouse Models of Human Cancer database (MMHCdb; tumor.informatics.jax.org) is an expertly curated knowledgebase of cancer phenotypes reported for diverse types of mouse models of human cancer such as inbred mouse strains, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), Patient Derived Xenografts (PDXs), and mouse genetic diversity panels (e.g., the Collaborative Cross). MMHCdb includes data on more than 60,000 mouse models for over 1200 tumor classifications curated from more than 25,000 peer-reviewed publications.<br \/>One of the primary goals of the MMHCdb is to highlight the impact of genetic background on the incidence and presentation of different tumor types in mice. The same allele on different backgrounds can result in very different cancer characteristics and, therefore, impact the appropriateness of a model for a specific research application. In MMHCdb, users can review the impact of genetic background on the frequency of spontaneous tumors for inbred mouse strains using an interactive table generated from different published and unpublished data sources. In addition, color-coded tabular summaries of individual papers are available that allow researchers to quickly assess how genetic background affects cancer phenotypes in the mouse models reported in a specific publication. We will highlight examples of how genetic background can profoundly change the types and frequencies of tumor types that can be expected in mouse models of human cancer.<br \/>MMHCdb is supported by NCI R01 CA089713","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Genetic susceptibility,Databases,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Dale  A.

ADGRB3 has been shown to play diverse roles under physiological and pathological conditions which include dendritic morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, and myogenesis. Loss of ADGRB3 expression and point mutations in the gene have been observed in sporadic tumors, including brain tumors, but the significance of this observation has not been investigated. Moreover, no mouse models to understand the role of ADGRB3 in brain tumor susceptibility and pathobiology have been developed thus far. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused by a germline mutation in one <i>TP53 <\/i>allele, predisposing patients to the development of a variety of tumors from a pediatric age, including gliomas and medulloblastoma. The secondary molecular alterations that predispose LFS patients to brain tumors are currently unknown. Interestingly, a LFS patient was reported to carry a translocation in <i>ADGRB3 <\/i>and<i> HGMLL <\/i>genes. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying brain tumor formation in LFS patients and the role of p53 and ADGRB3 in the process, we have generated a LFS mouse model. The mice harbor a germline p53 deleted allele and a second floxed allele. Loss of the second allele is induced in the brain by crossing with mice harboring a Nestin promoter driven Cre recombinase, since Nestin is expressed along the craniospinal axis and in glial precursor cells. We observed that the majority of nestin-Cre p53<sup>m\/f<\/sup> mice all died between 8 and 10 months of age while nestin-Cre p53<sup>m\/+<\/sup> mice did not. About 20% of the mice developed hind leg paralysis and harbored large gliomas, which likely caused their demise. The remainder mice lacked brain tumors, but had other malignancies (sarcomas, etc.) as observed in patients. Remarkably, the addition of Adgrb3 deletion to the genotype led to a dramatic increase (from 20% to 60%??) in the number of brain tumors, including medulloblastoma formation, which are also reported in LFS patients. The Adgrb3<sup>-\/-<\/sup> p53<sup>+\/-<\/sup> Nestin-Cre mouse model constitutes a useful tool to understand the tumorigenic landscape caused by the loss of Adgrb3. We are now performing genomic analyses on the excised tumors and derived neurosphere cultures to further study the transformation process and the molecular changes induced by Adgrb3 loss.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Tumor suppressor,G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alex  B.

A multidimensional analysis of TCGA-LUAD patient data indicates that LKB1 mutation is one of the top sex-biased mutations, being more frequent in males than in females. A similar pattern was observed in other large LUAD cohorts. However, the underlying mechanism was unknown, partially due to a lack of an appropriate mouse model to represent this clinical phenomenon. We previously demonstrated a similar sex bias in a Lenti-Cre-induced KRAS\/LKB1-mutant genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) and a syngeneic tail-vein injection model. Here, we demonstrated that intravenous injection of the same cell line in male and female NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice does not exhibit a sex-bias pattern of lung metastasis formation (P=0.9746). However, sex bias was observed when we used CB17-SCID mice. This data suggest that innate immunity is partly responsible for the sex bias of LKB1-mutant lung cancer formation. We also characterized immune cells from the lung with LKB1-mutant tumors. Monocytes\/macrophages decreased from 23% to 19%, and neutrophils increased from 15% to 19%. Lymphoid cells remained the same at 58%, and T-cells account for 34% of all CD45+ cells. Interestingly, T-cells doubled to account for 81% of all CD45+ cells from the lung in female mice resistant to the formation of lung metastasis. Our data indicated that both the innate and the adaptive immunity are responsible for eliminating LKB1-mutant lung adenocarcinoma in female mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,Innate immunity,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yijian Fan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lenore Monterroza<sup><\/sup>, Rui Jin<sup><\/sup>, Xiuju Liu<sup><\/sup>, Periasamy Selvaraj<sup><\/sup>, Rabindra Tirouvanziam<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zhou<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Emory University, Atlanta, GA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"319b8acb-8d37-4449-8642-83389be214ab","ControlNumber":"4687","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Males are four times more likely to develop bladder cancer than females. Ninety percent of cases are diagnosed as urothelial carcinomas, and most cases are not muscle-invasive at the time of diagnosis. Even with treatment, there is a 50-80% chance of bladder cancer recurrence within five years of diagnosis. While non-invasive disease has a five-year survival rate of 77%, if recurrence leads to metastatic disease, the five-year survival rate is only 6%. Therefore, there is a need to predict which patients will recur and progress to metastatic disease. <i>N<\/i>-butyl-<i>N-<\/i>(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) is a cigarette smoke-mimicking carcinogen that can be used in mice to induce urothelial cell proliferation and progression to invasive bladder cancer. This study used a BBN-induced bladder cancer model to evaluate sex differences in urothelial proliferation and bladder pathologies in male and female mice treated with BBN (0.05%) in their drinking water for up to 12 weeks. Mice were then given a 2&#8211;20-week period of no treatment following BBN exposure. Bladder specimens were stained with Ki-67 to analyze urothelial proliferation and characterized based on pathology. Male bladder samples characterized as having reactive atypia showed greater proliferation rates than male bladder samples with urothelial dysplasia. Overall, compared to female bladder samples, male bladders showed greater urothelial proliferation in both reactive atypia and dysplasia categories. Additionally, male mice had more tumor initiation and aggressive disease at all examination timepoints, with the most pronounced difference seen at 10-weeks post-BBN exposure. The development of carcinoma <i>in situ<\/i> (CIS) and invasive disease was seen in 100% of males at 12 weeks post-BBN, while only 40% of female mice had CIS or invasive disease at the same timepoint. Overall, these findings indicate that mouse sex plays a role in bladder tumor progression, with females having delayed tumor initiation and less aggressive disease. This may be due, in part, to varied immune cell profiles in males versus females. A short 2-week exposure to BBN caused a similarly profound neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate in the bladder of both sexes but no changes in immunosuppressive populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs). In stark contrast, a 12-week exposure to BBN with a 2-week rest period resulted in significantly more macrophages and immunosuppressive PD-L1+ neutrophils and Tregs in the bladders of male mice when compared with females. Chronic exposure to BBN leads to an increase in immunosuppressive immune infiltrates in male bladders and may contribute to sex disparities observed in bladder cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Proliferation,Immune cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gabrielle  E.

This mouse model developed colonic neoplasia from 12 weeks of age. Despite the same genotype, 40% of the tumors were found mucinous adenocarcinoma and 28% were high-grade adenoma. For further investigation, we herein perform transcriptomic analysis to clarify the molecular differences in these two histologically different tumors.<br \/>Method: Total RNA were extracted from mucinous adenocarcinomas and high-grade adenomas in <i>CDX2P-G19Cre;Apc<sup>flox\/+<\/sup>;Tgfbr2 <sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice from fresh frozen tumors (n=3, each).

However, introducing BRAF(V600E) in B-lymphocytes fails to induce hematological malignancy, suggesting that BRAF(V600E) needs concurrent mutations for driving HCL ontogeny. To resolve this issue, here we surveyed the human HCL genomic sequence data. Together with previous reports, we speculated that tumor suppressor, Trp53, P27, or pTEN restricted the oncogenicity of BRAF(V600E) in B-lymphocytes, whose loss-of-function facilitates the BRAF(V600E)-driven HCL ontogeny. Using genetic mice models, we demonstrated that indeed BRAF(V600E)<sup>KI<\/sup> together with Trp53<sup>KO<\/sup> or pTEN<sup>KO<\/sup> in B-lymphocytes induced chronic lymphoma with pathological features of human HCL. To further understand cellular programs essential for HCL ontogeny, we next profiled the gene expression of leukemic cells isolated from BRAF(V600E)<sup>KI<\/sup> and Trp53<sup>KO<\/sup> or pTEN<sup>KO<\/sup> mice, and found that these leukemic cells had similar but different gene expression signatures that resemble that of M2 or M1 macrophages. In addition, we examined the expression signature of transcription factors\/regulators required for germinal center reaction and memory B cell versus plasma cell differentiation in these leukemic cells and found that most transcription factors\/regulators essential for these programs were severely inhibited, which illustrates why hairy cells are arrested at a transitional stage between activated B cells and memory B cells. Together, our study has uncovered concurrent mutations for HCL ontogeny, revealed the B cell origination of hairy cells as well as molecular basis that underlies unique pathological features of this disease, and hence has important implications in both HCL research and clinic treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,BRAF,Leukemias,Tumor suppressor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jiajun Yap, Jimin Yuan, Bin Gao Chen, Wan Hwa Ng,Yuen Rong M.

To address these issues, there is an urgent need for useful animal models with normal immune system. About half of the human muscle invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs) show p53 mutations in which over 60% are missense mutations. Additionally, the downregulation of tumor suppressor gene <i>PTEN<\/i> is known in human MIBC. We also investigated cell of origin of chemical-induced mouse bladder cancer using lineage tracing method and found that Krt5 expressing cells with <i>Trp53<\/i> alteration efficiently give a rise of high-grade MIBC with squamous differentiation. Based on these results, we have been working on establishing MIBC mouse model using genetically engineered mouse (GEM) in which Cas9 and target gene mutation express specifically in Krt5 expressing cells by Cre-LoxP system. We have also used CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing technique and 3D organoid culture system. We generated organoids from the GEM bladder urothelium with <i>Krt5<sup>CreERT2\/+<\/sup><\/i>; <i>LSL-Cas9<\/i>; <i>LSL-Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup><\/i>. For further gene editing, we infected adeno-associated virus with sg<i>RNA<\/i> to the organoids. The organoid with <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup><\/i> and <i>Pten<\/i> knock-out showed tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. The organoid-derived tumors are histologically similar with the basal-squamous subtype of human bladder cancer. Moreover, these tumors exhibited wild type (WT) <i>Trp53<\/i> loss of heterozygosity in genomic level. Similarly, we confirmed tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice with organoids from <i>Trp53<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i><i>; Pten<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup> and Trp53<sup>R172H\/flox<\/sup>; Pten<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice, but not from <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/flox<\/sup>;Pten<sup>+\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice or <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>; Pten<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice, suggesting that both loss of WT <i>Trp53<\/i> and <i>Pten<\/i> loss are required for tumor formation in this setting. RNA sequencing showed <i>Pten<\/i> loss is associated with up-regulation of metabolism related gene sets and loss of WT <i>Trp53<\/i> is associated with up-regulation of proliferation related gene sets. Furthermore, <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/flox<\/sup><\/i><i>; Pten<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> organoids showed higher engraftment rate in immunocompetent mice with less infiltration of CD8+ cells compared with <i>Trp53<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i><i>; Pten<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> organoids, suggesting that gain of function of mutant <i>Trp53<\/i> may affect immune microenvironment.

Given that human tumors express high levels of the oncofetal Cripto, our hypothesis is that Cripto might play a role in PCa initiation and progression, so we conditionally knock out Cripto in GEMMs models representative of early and late metastatic PCa to study its oncogenic potential.<br \/>Methods: Conditional Cripto knock out (CRIPTO<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>) was performed on N (<u>N<\/u>kx3.1<sup>CreERT2<\/sup>, R26 <sup>LSL-YFP\/LSL-YFP<\/sup>), NP <u>(N<\/u>kx3.1<sup>CreERT2<\/sup>; <u>P<\/u>ten<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>, R26 <sup>LSL-YFP\/LSL-YFP<\/sup>) and NPK<u> <\/u><u>(<\/u><u>N<\/u>kx3.1<sup>CreERT2<\/sup>; <u>P<\/u>ten<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>; <u>K<\/u>ras<sup>LSL-G12D\/+<\/sup>, R26 <sup>LSL-YFP\/ LSL-YFP<\/sup>) to generate respectively NC, NPC and NPKC. Normal epithelium is mirrored by N animals, whereas first stage of the disease, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)\/carcinoma lesions with local invasive epithelium, are seen in NP. The advanced stage of PCa with metastasis formation is developed in NPK. In vivo experiments presented the following workflow: 8-weeks old mice were castrated and induced one month later with 5 daily injections of tamoxifen, after 2.5 weeks animals were weekly treated with testosterone (10 weeks). Single cells were isolated from prostate tissue and the <sup>YFP+\/-<\/sup> population recovered by FACS sorting and cultured as organoids.<br \/>Results: Published PCa models N, NP and NPK were confirmed. The histopathological evaluation of newly generated NPC and NPKC shows presence of mPIN (100%, n<sub>NPC<\/sub>= 6, n<sub>NPKC<\/sub>=5), with a dominant cribriform morphology. NPKC presents invasive PCa with an extent dominant pattern of 100%. Invasive portions in NPKC present dense stroma forming whorl-like structures and occasional sheet-like accumulations of polygonal in stroma of regions with mPIN. Compared to the published models, NPC and NPKC feature a more reactive stroma with a mild\/moderate inflammation. Organoids<sup>YFP+<\/sup> recapitulate molecular prostate tissue features, expressing luminal and basal markers. Organoids&#8217; morphology varies consistently: N and NC organoids present a more cystic morphology, with lower densities which is consistent with low-grade PIN phenotypes, whereas NP and NPK organoids are smaller and denser which mimics an oncogenic transformation. In general, NC, NPC and NPKC organoids present a higher percentage of hollow organoids compared to N, NP and NPK respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Histopathological evaluation of NPC and NPKC phenotype specifically, showed important stromal alterations suggesting that Cripto might play a role not only on the epithelial compartment as well as in the stroma.

We and others have demonstrated that somatic mutations of <i>DICER1 <\/i>at its RNase IIIb domain metal binding sites, impairing its capability to produce mature miRNAs from the 5P strand of miRNA precursors, occur recurrently in a broad spectrum of cancers associated with the DICER1 syndrome that affects children and youths predominantly. The biallelic <i>DICER1<\/i> mutations in these cancers challenge the two-hit hypothesis theory of traditional tumour suppressors, but it remains unproven whether these mutations are sufficient to drive tumorigenesis. The lack of biology relevant preclinical models has also hindered the understanding the pathogenesis. Here, we developed a genetically engineered mouse strain that expresses an inducible knockin <i>Dicer1<\/i> missense mutation (<i>Dicer1<sup>+\/fl-D1693N<\/sup><\/i>), equivalent to the <i>DICER1 <\/i>RNase IIIb hotspot mutation D1709N in human cancers. This conditional strain behaves as a null allele due to an aberrant splicing event without Cre-mediated recombination. When crossed with a well-characterized conditional null <i>Dicer1<\/i> strain (<i>Dicer1<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup><\/i>), the resulting compound heterozygous strain (<i>Dicer1<sup>fl\/fl-D1693N<\/sup><\/i>), acts as a hemizygous wildtype allele that is converted to a hemizygous missense mutation allele upon Cre-mediated recombination, reflecting the genetic status of <i>DICER1<\/i> in DICER1 syndrome-associated cancer. When crossing with the anti-Mullerian hormone receptor 2 (Amhr2) driven cre strain (<i>Amhr2<sup>+\/cre<\/sup><\/i>), the biallelic <i>Dicer1<\/i> mutation resulted in infertility in females by impairing the development of oviduct and endometrium and ultimately drove the development of multicystic tubal and intra-uterine tumours. Histologically, these murine tumors resemble human M&#252;llerian adenosarcoma and other DICER1 syndrome-associated sarcomas. Molecular analysis of these murine tumours validated the miRNA biogenesis defects in 5P-miRNA production, uncovered the activation of the myc signaling and identified that loss of let-7 family miRNAs may drive the transcriptomic rewiring and malignant transformation. Thus, this first DICER1 syndrome-associated murine cancer model faithfully recapitulates the biology of human cancer and provides a unique tool for future investigation and therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,MicroRNA,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yemin Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shary Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Janine Senz<sup>1<\/sup>, Maxwell Douglas<sup>1<\/sup>, Shelby Thornton<sup>1<\/sup>, Yana Moscovitz<sup>1<\/sup>, C.

Although inflammatory signaling and metabolic reprogramming are highly integrated and play critical role in the development and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) . The role of inflammatory mediators in the regulation of metabolic reprogramming is not adequately studied in pancreatic cancer and remains to be explored. Here we show that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) collaborates with its downstream transcriptional factor nuclear-receptor-subfamily-3, group-C, member-2 (NR3C2) regulate metabolic reprogramming to support cancer growth and progression in PDAC. MIF enhances glucose uptake and lactate efflux through enhancing HK1 (hexokinase 1), HK2 (hexokinase 2) and LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase) expression in pancreatic cancer cell in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model. Furthermore, a decreased HK1, HK2, LDHA expression, pyruvate and lactate production are found in patient tumors with lower MIF expression and MIF-deficiency tumors from genetically engineered KPC mouse model. Conversely, NR3C2 suppresses HK1, HK2, and LDHA expression and decreases glucose uptake and lactate efflux in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, MIF-mediated regulation of glycolytic metabolism involves MAPK-ERK Kinase pathway while NR3C2 interacts with AP-1 transcriptional factor in regulation of glycolysis metabolism. Taken together, our result demonstrates an interactive role of MIF and NR3C2 signaling in regulation cancer metabolism and therapeutic approaches target this axis may improve disease outcome in patients with PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glycolysis,Metabolism,Pancreatic cancer,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shouhui Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Azadeh Azizian<sup>2<\/sup>, Philipp Ströbel<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuuki Ohara<sup>1<\/sup>, Helen Cawley<sup>1<\/sup>, Nader Hanna<sup>3<\/sup>, B.

Over-activation of these genes due to different mutation were found in up to 20% of all human cancers and about 90% in pancreatic cancer. The identification of RAS mutation, especially KRAS-G12S or G12D mutation, as cancer diver genes has recently led to rapid development of anti-tumor therapeutics agents such as sotorasib (AMG 510), adagrasib (MRTX-849) and MRTX1133, but there are still no good drugs for the cancer patients with other RAS mutations. Ba\/F3 line is a popular cell model for studying both kinases and their inhibitors, because some kinases can render the growth of Ba\/F3 cells to be depended on the over-activation of the kinases instead of exogenous IL-3 supplement, while their inhibitors can antagonize these effects. Our group has generated a Ba\/F3 RAS cell panel with 29 KRAS, 11 HRAS and 20 NRAS different single or double mutants for RAS inhibitor screening and development, all of these lines were well validated with PCR sequencing, Western Blot and KRAS G12C and G12D inhibitors.

LUSC patients suffer from poor therapeutic response, high relapse rate, and poor prognosis. A major reason for this bleak outcome is the lack of well characterized oncogenic drivers of LUSC. This has stalled the generation of relevant genetic pre-clinical mouse models amenable to studying LUSC tumorigenesis <i>in vivo<\/i> and developing targeted therapeutics to treat LUSC patients. Our group has identified concomitant 3q26 copy number gain (CNG) and <i>TP53 <\/i>loss as defining genetic alterations present in ~90% of LUSC tumors. Furthermore, we have identified three 3q26 oncogenes (<i>PRKCI<\/i>, <i>ECT2 and SOX2) <\/i>that genetically and biochemically collaborate to drive LUSC tumor formation. Coordinate overexpression of <i>Prkci<\/i>, <i>Ect2<\/i> and <i>Sox2<\/i>, and loss of <i>Trp53<\/i> in <i>ex vivo<\/i> cultures of lung basal stem cells (LBSCs; a potential cell of origin for LUSC) is both necessary and sufficient to transform these cells into orthotopic LUSC tumors in syngeneic mice. These findings indicate that 3q26 amplification and <i>TP53 <\/i>loss play a critical role in the initiation and progression of LUSC. Based on these data, we have developed the first autochthonous genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) to study the role of 3q26 CNG in LUSC tumorigenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our GEMM allows inducible overexpression of <i><u>P<\/u><\/i><i>rkci, <u>E<\/u>ct2<\/i>, and <i><u>S<\/u><\/i><i>ox2 <\/i>and knockout of <i><u>Trp53<\/u><\/i><i> (PES\/Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>) in lung tissue<i>. <\/i>Tumorigenesis will be initiated in <i>PES\/Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice using an established protocol to target transgene recombination to LBSCs <i>in vivo<\/i>. These mice will be assessed for tumor latency, survival, tumor burden, and metastatic potential. In related studies, we used bioinformatics analyses on primary LUSC tumors from the Cancer Genome Atlas&#8217; database to identify 13 genes in addition to <i>PRKCI<\/i>, <i>ECT2 and SOX2,<\/i> whose expression is driven by 3q26 amplification. These genes were functionally characterized by assessing the effect of shRNA-mediated gene silencing on soft-agar growth of human H520 LUSC cells, a cell line that harbors 3q26 amplification. Our results revealed that knockdown of each of these genes independently resulted in a significant decrease in soft agar colony formation. We further assessed these genes through RT-qPCR mRNA expression profiling comparing <i>PES\/Trp53<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>transformed LBSCs to non-transformed LBSCs. These genes were significantly upregulated in <i>PES\/Trp53<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>transformed LBSCs, suggesting that they play important roles in LBSC transformation. Future work will further assess the molecular mechanisms by which these additional 3q26 genes contribute to LUSC cell transformation and assess the role of alternate cells of origin (Club and AT2) in 3q26-driven LUSC tumor formation using our <i>PES\/Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>GEMM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Mouse models,Copy number alterations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kayleah M.

Due to innate or acquired drug resistance of tumors, most of these small-molecule inhibitors can only delay tumor progression. Next-generation kinase inhibitors with better specificity and lower drug resistance remain to be developed. Ba\/F3 is a mouse pro-B cell line which is dependent on IL-3 for survival and proliferation. Upon transduction of a driver gene such as kinase genes or their mutants, Ba\/F3 cells switch from IL3-dependent to driver gene-dependent, which makes Ba\/F3 cells a powerful tool for the discovery of new kinase inhibitors. Our group has constructed more than 500 Ba\/F3 engineered cell lines stably transfected with mutants of kinase genes. These Ba\/F3 kinase cell lines are well validated by sequencing, western blot and inhibitor test, and cover many hot kinases, including EGFR (151 cell lines), FGFR (45 cell lines), ERBB2 (38 cell lines), KRAS (36 cell lines), BCR-ABL (36 cell lines), EML4-ALK (33 cell lines), KIF5B-RET (30 cell lines), FLT3 (26 cell lines) et.al.

The discovery of new drugs and therapeutic strategies is underway, and to complement this, the development of superior animal models is required for preclinical studies. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) mimic <i>de novo<\/i> human tumor growth within an intact tumor microenvironment and are potent immunocompetent models for studying pathogenesis and immuno-oncology of intestinal cancers. GEMMs with dysfunctional DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, like <i>MHL1<\/i> and <i>MSH2<\/i>, manifest intestinal tumors related to microsatellite instability (MSI). However, the low incidence and distinct latency among individuals hamper the application of these GEMMs in preclinical research. In this study, a murine intestinal cancer homograft from GEMMs with MMR deficiency is established to enroll larger cohorts of mice for preclinical studies.<br \/>Methods: MMR-deficient GEMMs were generated by knockout of <i>Mlh1<\/i> gene with a CRISPR-Cas9 system. Intestinal cancer development was investigated in 16 GEMMs. The developed tumor in the intestine of GEMM was isolated by surgery and inoculated into C57BL\/6 mice subcutaneously to establish a murine homograft model. The tumor homograft was passaged and expanded <i>in vivo,<\/i> and stable tumor growth was established over consecutive passages. Histopathological studies were conducted for both the original and passaged tumors. Genomic mutations and gene expression were analyzed by whole exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors were evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> for tumor growth inhibition.<br \/>Results: The intestinal tumors or lesions were observed in two of the sixteen <i>Mlh1<\/i>-KO mice with an incidence of 12.5%. A murine homograft model of small bowel adenocarcinoma was successfully established using the tumor located in jejunum of a <i>Mlh1<\/i>-KO mouse. This model was stably passaged <i>in vivo<\/i> with semblable pathological features as the original lesion in <i>Mlh1<\/i>-KO mice. The various degrees of TILs and response to treatments revealed the potential of this model for <i>in vivo<\/i> investigation of immune response.<br \/>Conclusion: Our murine intestinal cancer homograft model presented rapid and stable subcutaneous growth in immunocompetent mice, providing an efficient approach for intestinal cancer researchers and a superior preclinical model for new drug discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-11 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"In vivo,Murine Intestinal Cancer,GEMM,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jinxi Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Leilei Chen<sup><\/sup>, Likun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jingqian Zhu<sup><\/sup>, Ludovic Bourre<sup><\/sup>, Jingjing Wang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Crown Bioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"588b27d6-9c9b-4721-996d-361ac1021e19","ControlNumber":"3280","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
