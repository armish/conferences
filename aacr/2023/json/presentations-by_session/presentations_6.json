And, like the antibody therapeutics field, we are beginning to realize the clinical impact of RNA therapeutics amiss these challenges. This is most clearly highlighted with the recent approval of mRNA vaccines to prevent against SARS-CoV-2 and the first FDA approved RNAi drugs targeted to the liver. Unfortunately, RNA-based drugs targeted to cancer cells is lagging behind, even with countless years of work that has revealed the power of using RNAi for treating oncological diseases. Lack of success in this space is attributed to inability to deliver RNAi safely and effectively. A successful delivery agent requires multiple features. First, the agent must deliver the RNA specifically to the intended cells. Second, the agent must have a large therapeutic window, meaning that toxicity, if observed, should occur at doses that are orders of magnitude higher than the therapeutic dose. Third, if delivery of the RNA is by way of a specific ligand and receptor pair, as is the case herein, the RNA must successfully escape the endosome. Simply swelling the endosome is not enough if noncovalent interactions between the ligand and the receptor cannot be disrupted. Fourth, the RNA should include appropriate stabilizing modifications to increase intracellular half-life that will reduce dosing and cost. Through hard work and dedication in this space, we have come up with an inclusive, easily synthesized, intramolecular molecule that achieves all of these essential features. Moreover, the ligand used to achieve successful delivery is also being evaluated for imaging tumors localized in the central nervous system. Here, the challenges we face, the hurdles we have overcome, and the barriers that still remain to achieve success in revealing the clinical potential of miRNA as anti-cancer therapeutics will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Folate,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrea L.

However, it has been hard to assess or exploit the opportunities that cryptic pockets present due to the inherent difficulty in identifying such pockets. Here, I will discuss progress from my lab on combining biophysical experiments, computer simulations, and machine learning to identify and target cryptic pockets. In one case study, we have used computer simulations deployed on the Folding@home distributed computing environment to predict a cryptic pocket that can allosterically control a protein-RNA interaction, and then experimentally confirmed our predictions. Based on data from this study and others in our lab, we have trained a machine learning algorithm to predict where cryptic pockets are likely to form from single protein structures, enabling us to assess how prevalent cryptic pockets are on a large scale.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gregory R.
