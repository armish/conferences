These long-lived T cells mount potent recall responses and are key contributors to immune checkpoint inhibitor responsiveness in patients. Whereas molecular cues that drive Trm generation have been defined in viral infection models, signals that promote Trm responses against cancer have remained poorly understood. We previously showed that tumor Ag-specific Trm populations in skin and draining lymph nodes can provide durable protection against melanoma. This seminar will highlight recent findings regarding the molecular requirements for priming and mobilizing Trm responses across tissue environments. With a focus on priming, studies will underscore a critical role for type-1 interferons in programming melanoma-specific Trm precursors in tumor-draining lymph nodes. With a focus on secondary responses, studies will illustrate how encounter with melanoma cells in the skin induces outside-in Trm egress to lymph nodes and circulation. A better understanding of Trm properties will support future strategies to therapeutically generate tissue-wide immunity to cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immune response,Migration,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mary Jo Turk<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
