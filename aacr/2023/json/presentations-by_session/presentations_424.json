[{"Abstract":"Background: Mucosal-Associated Invariant T cells (MAITs) are an abundant subset of non-conventional T-cells with potent cytotoxic capacity (up to 20% of circulating T-cells) that are naturally resident in many tissues and solid tumors. T-cell redirection is a clinically validated approach to treating haematological cancers but has limited success in solid tumors. Classical T-cell engagers (TCE) bind the epsilon chain of the TCR leading to activation of all T-cells. MAIT cells utilize a semi-invariant TCR and recognize bacterial metabolites presented in the context of the MR1 protein. Biomunex has generated bispecific antibodies that bind the MAIT semi-invariant TCR (iTCR) and the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on tumor cells. This enables the formation of an efficient immunological synapse and exclusive redirection of MAIT cells to directly kill cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: Using the Biomunex proprietary BiXAb&#174; platform, bispecific, tetravalent antibodies were generated that target the MAIT iTCR and HER2. Specific binding to the two targets was demonstrated by ELISA, DUAL ELISA and in FACS. In general, BiXAb&#174;-mediated MAIT-cell activation, proliferation and degranulation were followed by gating on MAIT cells within a purified CD8 cell population. Tumor cell lines expressing varying amounts of HER2 were co-cultured with MAIT cells (peripheral and tumor-resident) and the BiXAb&#174;s in several cytotoxic assays which were evaluated by measuring Chromium release, LDH release and FACS.<br \/>Results: The iTCR x HER2 BiXAb&#174; efficiently binds both target proteins with similar affinities to the parental Mabs and can bind both simultaneously, as judged by Dual ELISA. The iTCR x HER2 BiXAb&#174; binds the MAIT-cell TCR and can bind cancer cells over a wide range of HER2 expression. BiXAb&#174; engagement of MAIT cells and cancer cells leads to rapid activation, proliferation and degranulation of MAIT cells. In a population of PBMCs, only MAIT cells are activated by the BiXAb&#174;. Even at low effector to target ratios (E:T = 2:1), MAIT cells efficiently kill engaged cancer cells in a HER2-dependent manner (over 50% cytotoxicity in 18 hrs). The MAIT-directed BiXAb&#174; does not activate other T-cell subsets and hence has significantly reduced cytokine release when compared to a classical T-cell engager.<br \/>Conclusions: BiXAb&#174; mediated MAIT cell redirection leads to efficient killing of cancer cells and is a promising new approach for the treatment of solid tumors. The iTCR x HER2 BiXAb&#174; has no impact on the general CD8 or CD4 T-cell population which may address some of the clinical limitations of classical TCEs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,HER2,Innate immunity,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Simon Edward Plyte<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Marie Fraudeau<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonathan Grivel<sup>1<\/sup>, Paloma Hougron<sup>1<\/sup>, Katja Klausz<sup>2<\/sup>, Dorothee Winterberg<sup>2<\/sup>, Britta von Below<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexandre Ivagnes<sup>1<\/sup>, Claire Germain<sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastian Amigorena<sup>3<\/sup>, Eugene Zhukovsky<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthias Peipp<sup>2<\/sup>, Pierre-Emmanuel Gerard<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivier Lantz<sup>3<\/sup>, Julie Prigent<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biomunex Pharmaceuticals, Paris, France,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Institut Curie, Paris, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"42afc616-f1c9-4ba9-b8da-0bfdfdeea8e8","ControlNumber":"458","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

We propose to selectively deliver IL7 to PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells using a bispecific anti PD1\/IL7 mutein (BICKI&#174;IL7v) to reinvigorate PD1+IL7R<sup>+<\/sup> tumor specific T cells. RNAseq and TILs scRNAseq analyses (n=1036 patients) demonstrated that IL7R and IL7R pathway gene expression prior ICI treatment is significantly correlated with better long term OS and\/or PFS across several cancers. Importantly, IL7R expression is correlated with higher stemness and lower apoptosis markers, providing a strong rationale of cotargeting IL7 &#38; PD1 to sustain the durable tumor-specific T cell response. Despite low IL7R expression on tumor T cell clonotype, a high concentration of IL7 can rescue them. The anti PD1\/IL7v aims to cis-deliver IL7 and sensitize PD-1+ tumor-specific T cells to provide a long-term survival &#38; proliferative specific signal while simultaneously antagonizing PD1 inhibitory signal. The Anti PD1\/IL7v is constructed with a high affinity antagonist anti PD1 fused to a single IL7 mutein (IL7v) having lower affinity to IL7R complex to allow an optimal cis-potentiation and synergistic activation of PD1 expressing T cells. Using an <i>in vitro<\/i> chronic stimulation model (5 STIM) a,d scR, we demonstrated that anti PD1\/IL7v promotes long-term reinvigoration proliferation\/survival of stem-like memory TCF1+CD8+ T cells (&#62;5 weeks) whereas IL2 and IL15 promote short term survival. scRNAseq and phenotypic analyses confirmed that chronically stimulated Anti PD1\/IL7v treated T cells significantly expressed the hallmark of stemness genes while IL2 and IL15 treatments induced T cell differentiation into exhausted phenotype. Interestingly, higher tumor and lymph node retention markers were significantly induced on chronically stimulated T cells after anti PD1\/IL7v treatment. T cell engraftment into immunodeficient mice, confirmed the stem-like property of IL7 treated T cells capable of self-autorenewal compared to IL2 treated exhausted T cells that no longer proliferate and engraft in vivo. In an orthotopic HCC mouse model, we confirmed that anti PD1\/IL7v promotes intratumoral proliferation of TCF1+ stem-like CD8+T cell and migration into the tumor nest, associated with significant anti-tumor efficacy (&#62; 55% CR). In contrast, anti PD1 or IL7 treatment had no efficacy and induced T-cell exclusion. Anti PD1\/IL7v also showed significant anti-tumor efficacy in second-line treatment post-anti-PD-(L)1 treatment in the MC38 mouse model, highlighting the clinical potential of anti PD1\/IL7v in ICI resistant patients. Our data validate the rationale of selective delivery of IL7 to PD1 tumor-specific T cells to limit the risk of I-O\/I-O immunotoxicity and sustain a long lasting proliferation and survival of stem-like CD8 T cells to strengthen PD(L)1 therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,PD-1,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aurore Morello<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Margaux Seite<sup><\/sup>, Justine Durand<sup><\/sup>, Isabelle Girault<sup><\/sup>, Caroline Mary<sup><\/sup>, Virginie Thepenier<sup><\/sup>, Geraldine Teppaz<sup><\/sup>, Emmanuelle Wilhem<sup><\/sup>, Ariane Desselle<sup><\/sup>, Nicolas Poirier<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>OSE Immunotherapeutics, Saint-Sebastien-sur-Loire, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"175832ff-544d-4091-980c-0e1d30edb57d","ControlNumber":"4346","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

Numerous approaches to improve the specificity and activity profile of IL-2 are being evaluated. Using Tentarix&#8217;s propriety Tentacles&#8482; platform, which is based on fully human stabilized antibody VH domains, we generated TNRX-257, a novel multispecific biologic that effectively blocks LAG3 while simultaneously delivering IL2R&#947;\/&#946; agonism to LAG3<sup>+<\/sup> cells in a highly conditional manner. LAG3 expression is restricted to antigen-experienced and tumor-reactive immune cells with little expression on peripheral PBMC or immune cells in normal tissues. TNRX-257 was designed to combine LAG3 inhibition with an IL2R agonist moiety to activate and expand LAG3<sup>+<\/sup> tumor-reactive T cells in tumor microenvironment while enhancing their effector function and anti-tumor immunity with minimal systemic toxicity. TNRX-257 blocks the interaction of LAG3 with MHC-II and enhances TCR signaling with similar potency as Relatlimab. TNRX-257 also selectively induces pSTAT5 on LAG3<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells with little activity on LAG3<sup>-<\/sup> immune cells, including resting human PBMCs. Moreover, the lower level of pSTAT5 (Emax) induced by TNRX-257 than IL-2 indicates TNRX-257 mediates its activity as a partial agonist, a phenotype that preserves stemness. TNRX-257 induces higher and preferential activation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells over CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells due to higher expression of LAG3 on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells than CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, particularly within the tumor microenvironment. Unlike an undirected IL-15 agonist that induced total CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell proliferation, TNRX-257 selectively induced proliferation of LAG3<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in a human melanoma TIL stimulation assay without expansion of Tregs. TNRX-257 treatment also preserved the stem-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup> population compared to the undirected IL-15 agonist. TNRX-257 showed in vitro and in vivo molecular stability, as well as good pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties. TNRX-257 induced robust anti-tumor efficacy when tested in early and established tumor models using melanoma A375-CMV-pp65 or colorectal cancer HT-29 cells in humanized mice. In contrast, the corresponding untargeted IL2R&#947;\/&#946; Tentacle had no efficacy. Together, these data show that TNRX-257 has drug-like properties and elicits strong anti-tumor efficacy, supporting its clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,LAG3,Cancer immunotherapy,Multispecific biologic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rajesh K.

Novel immunotherapies are urgently needed to reduce polychemotherapy-related toxicities and to target relapsed\/refractory disease. The Interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) plays a pivotal role in the development of ALL through mutations leading to constitutive activation of the oncogenic IL7R pathway or through overexpression of the receptor. The IL7R&#945; chain (CD127)-targeting antibody OSE-127 is a full antagonist of the IL7R pathway with an excellent safety profile (NCT03980080), currently evaluated in phase 2 trials in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (NCT04882007, NCT04605978). We previously reported <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of OSE-127 in CD127+ ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and synergy with standard of care polychemotherapy, but we had not evaluated CD127 protein expression in ALL patient cells. Moreover, the mechanism of action underlying OSE-127&#8217;s anti-leukemic activity remained to be fully elucidated. Here we show that CD127 is expressed by &#62;84% ALL patients and that OSE-127 efficiently targets CD127 not only <i>via <\/i>its IL7R antagonist activity but also through macrophage-mediated antibody dependent phagocytosis (ADCP). First, CD127 surface expression was prospectively measured by flow cytometry in 372 diagnostic ALL patient samples. We detected CD127-positivity (defined as &#8805;10% CD127+ blasts) in 84.4% (314\/372) cases, of which 39.5% (147\/372) were CD127<sup>hi <\/sup>(<i>&#8805;<\/i> 50% CD127+ blasts). CD127 expression was higher in T- than in B-ALL. Among B-ALL, highest expression was detected in E2A-PBX1+ and BCR-ABL-like ALLs. Mechanistically, OSE-127 blocked STAT5 phosphorylation in IL7-responsive ALL-PDX cells, leading to decreased cell survival and proliferation. Surprisingly, we detected high <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy of OSE&#8209;127 therapy in IL7-unresponsive PDXs (<i>e.g., <\/i>unable to induce phosphorylation of STAT5 upon <i>ex vivo <\/i>IL7 stimulation or with IL7R mutation-induced constitutive phosphorylation of STAT5). We uncovered that OSE-127 induced macrophage-mediated ADCP of CD127+ ALL cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Accordingly, treatment of IL7-unresponsive, but OSE-127-sensitive models with an OSE-127-LALAPG variant (conserving IL7R-antagonistic properties but lacking ADCP activity due to Fc-inactivating mutations) did not impact leukemia development, thereby substantiating that ADCP contributes to the anti-leukemic efficacy of OSE-127. In fact, ADCP levels induced by OSE-127 treatment <i>in vitro<\/i> correlated with its capacity to reduce ALL blasts in the blood of PDX mice <i>in vivo<\/i>. Altogether, through its dual mode of action, OSE-127 may represent a powerful novel immunotherapy option for ALL patients, including cases with dysregulated IL7R signaling, particularly in combination with standard of care polychemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phagocytosis,Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Irene Baccelli<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lennart Lenk<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Laqua<sup>3<\/sup>, Dorothee Winterberg<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Dietterle<sup>2<\/sup>, Frederique Corallo<sup>1<\/sup>, Julien Taurelle<sup>1<\/sup>, Emma Narbeburu<sup>1<\/sup>, Beat Bornhauser<sup>4<\/sup>, Jean-Pierre Bourquin<sup>4<\/sup>, Fotini Vogiatzi<sup>2<\/sup>, Simon Raffel<sup>5<\/sup>, Martin Schrappe<sup>2<\/sup>, Gunnar Cario<sup>2<\/sup>, Monika Brüggemann<sup>6<\/sup>, Denis M Schewe<sup>7<\/sup>, Nicolas Poirier<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>OSE Immunotherapeutics, Nantes, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pediatrics I, ALL-BFM Study Group, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pediatric Hematology\/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Medicine II, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany, Kiel, Germany,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Pediatrics, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cd1a42c0-b70a-434a-9b20-3656f8048bf1","ControlNumber":"6797","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Although therapeutic regimens, including anti-CD38 monospecific IgG antibodies such as daratumumab and isatuximab in combination with chemotherapies, demonstrate clinical efficacy, most patients eventually develop resistance. Several bispecific (CD38xCD3) or trispecific (CD38xCD3xCD28) T cell engager (TCE) antibody therapies are currently in development to improve upon the efficacy of CD38 targeted therapies by leveraging T cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) of MM cells. However, CD38 is also expressed on some normal hematopoietic cells which could potentially lead to undesired pharmacological activity such as depleting CD38+ immune cells, including activated cytotoxic T cells (i.e., fratricide). IGM-2644 is a novel, pentameric IgM antibody engineered to have ten CD38 binding sites, and an anti-CD3&#949; single chain Fv domain fused to a joining chain to engage CD3 on T cells, and retains the potential for complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Here we report the functional characterization of IGM-2644 using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy studies with a safety evaluation of this novel IgM TCE. In vitro, IGM-2644 demonstrated significantly improved CDC activity in comparison with daratumumab and isatuximab, with &#62;30-fold increased potency on CD38+ MM and lymphoma cell lines. IGM-2644 induced TDCC similar to a bispecific CD38xCD3 IgG on low CD38 expressing cell lines resistant to daratumumab, while demonstrating significantly lower levels of cytokine release than the bispecific IgG. In ex vivo colony forming unit (CFU) assays, IGM-2644 was able to reduce MM CFUs using primary MM patient bone marrow samples containing autologous T cells and myeloma cells, while no effect was observed on erythroid, granulocyte and macrophage CFUs in normal bone marrow samples.&#8203; IGM-2644 dose dependently inhibited tumor growth in humanized xenograft models of CD38+ NCI-H929 (myeloma) and Raji (lymphoma). Importantly, IGM-2644 also demonstrated significantly reduced T cell fratricide compared to bispecific IgGs both ex vivo and in vivo. Significantly reduced activity of IGM-2644 on normal CD38+ innate immune cells was observed in ex vivo studies. CD38 expression has also been reported on human RBCs and platelets. However, minimal IGM-2644 binding was observed and at levels lower than daratumumab. In summary, IGM-2644 is a novel, potent, bispecific IgM TCE that has both CDC and TDCC mechanisms of cytotoxicity with the potential to be active in daratumumab resistant tumors. The balance of potent TDCC and CDC cytotoxic activity, along with an improved preclinical safety profile compared to other CD38xCD3 bispecific IgG TCEs, supports the clinical development of IGM-2644 in MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,CD38,T cell engager,Bispecific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Keyu Li<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rui Yun<sup><\/sup>, Min Chai<sup><\/sup>, Poonam Yakkundi<sup><\/sup>, Rodnie Rosete<sup><\/sup>, Gene Li<sup><\/sup>, Liqin Liu<sup><\/sup>, Mandy Li<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Santos<sup><\/sup>, Kevin  C.

Despite the emergence of new therapies, it is still an incurable disease. Safe, potent and innovative approaches with long lasting beneficial effects are required.<br \/>BCMA (B Cell Maturation Antigen) is a cell surface receptor selectively expressed on normal and malignant plasma cells and promote cell proliferation and survival upon binding of its ligands APRIL (A PRoliferation Inducing Ligand) and BAFF (B cell Activating Factor). BCMA expression is highly prevalent on myeloma tumor cells and is maintained after standard of care treatments such as anti-CD38 therapies, or even BCMA-targeting agents (Cohen AD et al. J Clin Invest 2019). The ability of NK cells to intrinsically kill tumor cells, leaving healthy cells unharmed, with minimal pro-inflammatory cytokine release induction as compared to T cell-based therapies makes NK cells ideal immune cells for a safe and efficacious therapeutic approach. We developed SAR&#8217;514, a trifunctional NK Cell Engager (NKCE) that activates NK cells through a dual engagement of NKp46 and CD16a, two major NK cell activating receptors highly expressed on NK cells in MM patients, and which redirects the activated NK cells to engage and kill BCMA+ tumor cells. We demonstrated that SAR&#8217;514 NK dual engagement was more potent than the single NK engagement with NKp46 or CD16a as well as the combination of NKp46 and CD16a engagement. SAR&#8217;514 leads to NK cell activation, degranulation and release of effector cytokines only in the presence of BCMA+ tumor cells. This antitumor activity is associated with very low IL-1&#946;, IL-6, TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; cytokine release as compared to a T cell engager targeting the same BCMA antigen, in PBMC and in whole blood settings in the presence of BCMA<sup>+<\/sup> tumor target cells. In addition, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of an anti-murine NKp46 surrogate NKCE molecule was investigated in huFcgR transgenic mice engrafted with the EL4-huBCMA murine thymoma model. SAR&#8217;514 induced a significant mouse survival at 0.5 to 5 mg\/kg with an overall survival of 90% as compared to the control group in which only 20% of mice survived. Importantly, SAR&#8217;514 exhibits ex vivo efficacy using bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) from MM patients in an autologous setting showing an active and efficient primary MM cell killing against MM cells from patients that have failed diverse therapies, including standard of care treatments. In summary, these results demonstrate the efficacy of SAR&#8217;514 for controlling MM tumors in vivo and ex vivo, and provide consistent support for its clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,BCMA,NK cell engager,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexandre Tang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Laurent Gauthier<sup>2<\/sup>, Jochen Beninga<sup>3<\/sup>, Benjamin Rossi<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicolas Gourdin<sup>2<\/sup>, Audrey Blanchard-Alvarez<sup>2<\/sup>, Céline Amara<sup>4<\/sup>, Jacqueline Courta<sup>5<\/sup>, Alexandra Basset<sup>6<\/sup>, Dorothée Bourges<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandre Desjonqueres<sup>1<\/sup>, Emmanuelle Menoret<sup>7<\/sup>, Catherine Pellat-Deceunynck<sup>7<\/sup>, Philippe Moreau<sup>7<\/sup>, Yannis Morel<sup>2<\/sup>, Marielle Chiron<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Vivier<sup>2<\/sup>, Angela Virone-Oddos<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Immuno-Oncology, Sanofi, Vitry-sur-Seine, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Innate Pharma, Marseille, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Large Molecules Research, Sanofi, Frankfurt, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Sanofi, Chilly-Mazarin, France,<sup>5<\/sup>TMED Biomarkers and Clinical Bioanalysis, Sanofi, Chilly-Mazarin, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Preclinical Safety, Sanofi, Chilly-Mazarin, France,<sup>7<\/sup>CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Nantes, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6c74b5c4-c5e3-4293-a70f-556ac93e5193","ControlNumber":"6482","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

TCBs have demonstrated efficacy in the clinic and are also approved. TCB mediated efficacy in solid tumors, however, has been more challenging to demonstrate. HLA-G-TCB specifically targets human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) on tumor cells and cluster of differentiation 3 epsilon chain (CD3&#949;) expressed on T cells. HLA-G is expressed in a broad range of solid tumor indications and its role in mediating immune suppression makes it an attractive cancer immunotherapy target.<br \/>Anti-tumor activity of HLA-G-TCB was demonstrated in vitro using different HLA G positive tumor cell lines. T-cell activation, IFN&#120574;; secretion, and cytotoxicity induced by HLA G-TCB were shown to be dose dependent and correlating to the HLA G density on cell surface and the percentage of HLA G positive cells. Administration of HLA-G TCB as monotherapy (5mg\/kg) to hematopoietic stem cell-humanized NSG mice (Humice) bearing SKOV3 HLA-G tumors resulted in strong tumor growth inhibition resulting in tumor-free animals (7 out of 8). Additionally, in a patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumor model with physiological (low\/patchy) HLA-G expression, a significant dose-dependent efficacy ranging from 10-90% was achieved in monotherapy (0.05-5 mg\/kg). Treatment of Humice bearing PDX tumors with a combination of HLA-G-TCB and a co-stimulatory immunomodulator resulted in remarkable anti-tumor activity resulting in tumor eradication in 100% of the mice treated with the combination (8 out of 8). A strong synergistic effect was also observed in checkpoint inhibitor resistant PDX tumor model, also resulting in tumor-free mice (5 out of 8) treated with a combination of HLA-G TCB and an immunomodulatory bispecific antibody. In line with the mode of action of TCBs, tumor growth inhibition was accompanied by increased cytokine secretion (including IFN&#120574;;), tumoral T cell infiltration and activation as reflected by increased expression of T cell activation markers including CD69, CD25 and Granzyme B. Evaluation of HLA-G expression on tumor cell lines upon IFN&#120574;; stimulation in vitro and in PDX tumors treated with HLA-G TCB revealed that HLA-G expression can be upregulated upon IFN&#120574;; stimulation and TCB treatment respectively and may positively impact the anti-tumor activity of HLA-G-TCB in vivo.<br \/>These promising preclinical findings reflect the potential and support the clinical evaluation of HLA-G TCB in treating patients with solid tumors in monotherapy and in combination. HLA-G TCB (RG6353) is being advanced to the clinic in BP44068, an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic HLA-G expressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Solid tumors,T cell engager,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meher Majety<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Carina Hage<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander Bujotzek<sup>2<\/sup>, Anneliese Schneider<sup>3<\/sup>, Martin Lechmann<sup>2<\/sup>, Nitya Nair<sup>4<\/sup>, Stefan Zimmerman<sup>3<\/sup>, Anthony Morel<sup>4<\/sup>, Christian Klein<sup>5<\/sup>, Pablo Umana<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Discovery Oncology, Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Munich, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Munich, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Zürich, Switzerland,<sup>4<\/sup>Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Basel, Switzerland,<sup>5<\/sup>Discovery Oncology, Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Zürich, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0eee8cbc-0e2e-440e-a905-5946ec308e83","ControlNumber":"1638","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

In normal tissue, CLDN18.2 is expressed exclusively on gastric epithelial cells. CLDN18.2 expression is maintained during malignant transformation of gastric epithelia. In addition, it is aberrantly expressed in other tumor types, including esophageal, pancreatic, and lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, CLDN18.2 is considered to be an attractive tumor target antigen for antibody-based cancer immunotherapy. ASP2138 is an immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based, asymmetric 2+1 format, T-cell bispecific antibody comprising bivalent humanized anti-CLDN18.2 antigen-binding fragments and a monovalent anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment. CD3 is a surface protein complex expressed on all T-cell populations and its clustering causes T-cell activation. Therefore, CD3 bispecific antibodies allow for simultaneous engagement with both CD3 and a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), resulting in retargeting of cytotoxic T cells specifically against TAA-positive tumor cells in a human leukocyte antigen-independent manner. ASP2138 is in development for the treatment of patients with CLDN18.2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma or pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is being evaluated in an ongoing phase 1\/1b clinical trial (NCT05365581). In this study, ASP2138 demonstrated selective binding to CLDN18.2 and CD3 without binding to other homologs and isoforms of CLDN18.2. Cytotoxicity and T-cell activation of ASP2138 were assessed using CLDN18.2-expressing tumor cells in combination with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as effector cells in a redirected T-cell cytotoxicity assay in vitro. ASP2138 showed cytotoxicity against CLDN18.2-expressing gastric or pancreatic cancer cells and increased interferon-gamma production and expression of T-cell activation markers. The cytotoxic activities were dependent on the effector cell to target cell ratio and CLDN18.2 expression on tumor cells.

Tumor expression of PD-L1 and ILT4 has been associated with poor clinical outcomes in several cancer types. Recently, ILT4 activation has been postulated as a resistance mechanism for PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade prompting the investigation of dual blockade of these pathways. Siu, L.L. et al. (2022 Clin Cancer Res 28: 57-70) reported encouraging results of the initial clinical study combining the ILT4 antagonist mAb MK-4830 with pembrolizumab. The combination was generally well tolerated and led to several durable responses including in PD-1\/PD-L1 refractory patients. We have combined novel PD-1 (mAb E1A9) and ILT4 (mAb 7B1) antagonist antibodies into a tetravalent IgG-scFv format bispecific antibody (bsAb, CDX-585). CDX-585 was engineered to avoid effector functionality by eliminating interaction with Fc&#947; receptors, and to increase its half-life by enhancing binding to FcRn. As expected, CDX-585 inhibits interaction of PD-1 and ILT4 with their ligands, results in potent inhibition of PD-1 signaling and enhances myeloid cell inflammatory responses to stimulation through toll like receptors (LPS) or CD40 (CD40 agonist mAb). In mixed lymphocyte reactions CDX-585 promoted greater T cell activation than the combination of the parental mAbs. Similarly, CDX-585 demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity over the combination of the parental mAbs in a humanized mouse model of melanoma. CDX-585 has completed GMP manufacturing and IND-enabling activities. Doses of CDX-585 up to 60 mg\/kg were well tolerated in cynomolgus macaques and displayed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Together these data demonstrate that CDX-585 effectively combines PD-1 and ILT4 blockade into one molecule with favorable biophysical and functional characteristics supporting the initiation of a dose-escalation clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Bispecific antibody,Macrophages,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lawrence J.

However, TAMs are phenotypically plastic and have the potential to be reprogrammed into immunostimulatory cells that enhance innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity. To this end, we developed BDC-3042, an agonistic antibody targeting an immune-activating receptor expressed on TAMs known as Dectin-2 (<i>CLEC6A<\/i>). Dectin-2 is a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) known best for its role in pathogen recognition and induction of protective immune responses against fungi and other microbes. We previously demonstrated that Dectin-2 agonism with natural ligands stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and antigen presentation by TAMs, resulting in robust CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity in syngeneic mouse models. Here we present our preclinical studies demonstrating the therapeutic potential of the Dectin-2 agonistic antibody, BDC-3042, as a novel TAM-directed immunotherapy for diverse human cancers.<br \/>BDC-3042 exhibits strong binding to Dectin-2-expressing macrophages generated in vitro and to primary human TAMs from a range of solid tumor types. In contrast, BDC-3042 binds weakly to peripheral monocytes and minimally to other immune cells in blood and tumor tissues. Macrophages exposed to cytokines and growth factors commonly found in the TME exhibit increased Dectin-2 expression and BDC-3042 binding. Treatment with BDC-3042 activates in vitro-generated macrophages and primary TAMs to produce an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with anti-tumor immunity. Consistent with low target expression, BDC-3042 elicits little to no activation of peripheral monocytes or cells in whole blood. BDC-3042 activity is dependent on both Dectin-2 and Fc&#947;Rs, as indicated through studies utilizing Fc variants with enhanced or attenuated effector function. In mice with humanized immune systems, BDC-3042 elicits activation of TAMs, as evidenced by modulation of key activation markers. Systemically administered BDC-3042 mediates anti-tumor efficacy as a monotherapy, and combination with checkpoint blockade therapy enhances anti-tumor efficacy. The data presented demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting Dectin-2 expressed by TAMs with the agonistic antibody BDC-3042 as a novel pan-cancer approach for myeloid cell-directed tumor immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,Immunotherapy,Novel anticancer agents,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Justin  A.

The extracellular part of MUC16 could be cleaved as CA125, which is well known as a diagnosis biomarker for ovarian cancer. Despite recent advances in therapies such as PARP inhibitors, advanced ovarian cancer remains a disease of high unmet need. Herein a novel bispecific antibody targeting MUC16 and CD3, LBL-033, is developed to specifically kill MUC16 positive tumor cells by engaging T cells.<br \/>Methods: LBL-033 was constructed using our unique T cell engager platform, which is a 2:1 format bispecific antibody with two arms targeting MUC16 membrane-proximal domain with high affinity and one arm targeting CD3 with fine-tuned affinity. The binding affinity of LBL-033 to MUC16 and CD3 was determined with Fortebio, while the activity was measured using several cell based assays including reporter gene and TDCC assays. The anti-tumor activity of LBL-033 was investigated in C57BL\/6-huCD3e mice implanted with MC38-huMUC16 cells. GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicologic study was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys.<br \/>Results: The binding affinity of LBL-033 to MUC16 and CD3 protein was 2.67 nM and 29.6 nM, respectively. The epitope that anti-MUC16 binds was identified at the C-terminal of MUC16 extracellular domain; and the activity was not affected in the presence of soluble CA-125. In CD3 reporter gene assay, LBL-033 could activate the NFAT reporter element through MUC16 antigen-dependent CD3 cross-linking with an EC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 1.068 nM. LBL-033 was shown a potent TDCC activity in OVCAR3 cells with T cell activation. In C57BL\/6-huCD3e transgenic mice implanted with MC38-huMUC16 tumor cells, LBL-033 was shown a dose dependent anti-tumor activity. In addition, LBL-033 had a significant synergistic effect, when combined with anti-PD-1. LBL-033 was shown favorable pharmacokinetic properties with a good safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys.<br \/>Conclusion: LBL-033, a novel bispecific antibody targeting CD3 and MUC16 with a unique epitope, which is located at the MUC16 membrane-proximal domain, with affinity differentiation between anti-MUC16 and anti-CD3. It is shown a great anti-tumor efficacy in animal models, with a good safety profile in monkeys. These data support LBL-033 as a novel therapeutic bispecific antibody for ovarian cancer and other MUC16 positive tumors.

Here, we report therapeutic potential of a novel Siglec-6\/CD3 targeted bsAb against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. We show here for the first time the functional and therapeutic relevance of Siglec-6 in CLL cell adhesion and migration. Mechanistically, we have shown Siglec-6 mediated cell adhesion and migration through Siglec-6 ligand (sialyl Tn) mediated DOCK8 dependent activation of Cdc42 associated with actin polymerization. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of Siglec-6, we generated a human (hu) Siglec-6 transgenic mouse model and crossed it with the TCL1 CLL mouse model to obtain Siglec-6 x TCL1 mice which develop Siglec-6+ leukemia. A pilot in-vivo study with anti-Siglec-6\/CD3 targeted bsAb showed a survival benefit in humanized CD3 (huCD3) mice engrafted with Siglec-6+ leukemic cells.<br \/><i><u>Methods used:<\/u><\/i> Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell surface expression of Siglec-6 and sialyl Tn (sTn). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify Siglec-6 interacting proteins. CRISPR\/Cas9 technique was used to generate knock-out (KO) cell lines for mechanistic studies. Phalloidin staining followed by confocal imaging was used to examine actin polymerization. For in-vivo BsAb treatment experiments, huCD3 mice were engrafted with 5 million Siglec-6+ leukemic cells isolated from Siglec-6 x TCL1 mouse splenocytes.

B7-H3 overexpression often correlates with poor survival and higher tumor grade, it has become an attractive target for the development of novel cancer therapies recently. B7-H3 targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as MGC018 and DS7300a, have shown preliminary clinical efficacy. DB-1311 is a B7-H3 targeting ADC comprised of a humanized B7-H3 antibody conjugated to a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor P1021 via a cleavable linker. We herein report preclinical efficacy and safety data of DB-1311 and its differentiation from DS7300a.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The binding of anti-B7-H3 to other B7 family members were evaluated via ELISA and SPR. Anti-B7-H3 antibody was conjugated to P1021 with different Drug-Antibody-Ratio (DAR) values. The efficacy of B7-H3 ADCs with different DAR values was tested in vivo, pharmacokinetics and safety profile were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. Based on potency and toxicity analysis, DB-1311, an ADC with DAR6, was selected for preclinical development. In vitro and in vivo studies were then conducted with DB-1311 to further investigate its pharmacological effects.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> B7-H3 antibody with DAR6 demonstrated higher efficacy than its DAR4 counterpart in lung cancer (Calu6), glioma(U87MG) and prostate cancer (PC-3) models. In monkeys, the DAR6 ADC showed good stability and dose-proportionally increased exposure. Additionally, it was well tolerated with repeat dose administration up to 80 mg\/kg and didn&#8217;t show significantly worse toxicities than DAR4 counterpart. In preclinical study, DB-1311 demonstrated specific, dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward B7-H3-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and potent antitumor activity in vivo but minimum tumor growth inhibition activity in a B7-H3 negative xenograft model. Moreover, DB-1311 showed more potent antitumor activity than DS7300a analogue in vitro and in vivo.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> DB-1311, a preclinical B7-H3 ADC candidate, with a DAR value of approximately 6, exhibited potent cytotoxicity in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo toward a range of B7-H3-expressing tumor cell lines representing several cancer types and was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys with promising pharmacokinetics characteristics. The preclinical antitumor activity and safety profile warrants further development of DB-1311 to evaluate its efficacy and safety in clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),In vitro,In vivo,B7-H3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chenggang Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Yao<sup>2<\/sup>, Chen Qu<sup>1<\/sup>, Bing Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Rong Shi<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Yang Qiu<sup>2<\/sup>, Haiqing Hua<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Research and Development, Duality Biologics, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Duality Biologics, Research and Development, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6da0d24e-23f3-4f4c-8f15-825a892f63fa","ControlNumber":"5265","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

However, most patients still have not responded to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. Thus, it is still urgent to find novel treatments for patients who have no response to ICI and acquire ICI resistance.<b> <\/b> Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein expressed in various cell types. It has primarily been known as a key molecule in brain-related diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s. However, the function of APP in regulating T cell activity has yet to be elucidated. Previously, we identified that APP expressed in T cells is a binding partner protein of a novel immune checkpoint protein contactin 4 (CNTN4), and APP is a central molecule for conveying immunosuppressive signal of CNTN4 to T cells through the investigation using <i>APP<\/i> knocked-out<i> <\/i>T cells. Here we further confirmed that APP had a mechanism of action to weaken TCR signaling by reducing adhesion capacity to cancer cells even with extracellular domain regardless of intracellular domain. When APP was knocked out on CD4<sup>+<\/sup> or CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, the conjugation of T cells with CT26 murine colorectal cancer cells was maintained better than <i>APP<\/i> WT T cells, and the increased conjugation induced improved T cell-mediated cytotoxicity on CT26 cancer cells. With the anti-APP monoclonal antibody generated by single B cell screening using rabbits, we also explored APP as a potential cancer immunotherapeutic target like CNTN4. Anti-APP antibody bound explicitly to APP recombinant protein without off-target binding and strongly bound to HEK293 overexpressing APP. Moreover, the anti-APP antibody, which inhibited the interaction between APP and CNTN4 more, showed better anti-tumor efficacy in the syngeneic mice model. However, the anti-APP antibody did not affect tumor growth in the immune-deficient mice model, suggesting that the anti-APP antibody shows anti-tumor activity by immunomodulation. To further investigate the immune modulatory function of T cell subsets in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by anti-APP antibody treatment, we analyzed the proportion of T cells, Treg cells, and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing granzyme B and perforin in tumor tissues. Collectively, an anti-APP antibody, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting the APP\/CNTN4 axis, has the potential for a significant breakthrough in anticancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Antibody,Immuno-oncology,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mi Young Cha<sup><\/sup>, <b>Youngeun Ha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Bu-Nam Jeon<sup><\/sup>, Hyunuk Kim<sup><\/sup>, Yunyeon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Jiyeong Lee<sup><\/sup>, Han-sol Kim<sup><\/sup>, A-Reum Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Hyunkyung Yu<sup><\/sup>, Kyung Mi Park<sup><\/sup>, Hansoo Park<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Genome & Company, Sungnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"45d2e565-7361-451f-9f81-8eb43155d608","ControlNumber":"2349","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Despite the recent success of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the response rates in cancer patients are limited (~20-40%). To improve immune checkpoint blockade therapy, relevant preclinical animal models are an essential component in the development and testing of multiple combination approaches and strategies. Companion dogs naturally develop several types of cancer that in many respects resemble clinical cancer in human patients. Therefore, the canine studies of immuno-oncology drugs are convertible into knowledge that informs and prioritizes new immuno-oncology therapy in humans. The challenge has been, however, that immunotherapeutic antibodies that target canine immune checkpoint molecules, such as canine PD-L1, have not been commercially available. Here, we developed a new canine PD-L1 antibody as an immuno-oncology drug and characterized its functional and biological properties by multiple assays. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of cPD-L1 antibodies was evaluated in our unique caninized PD-L1 mice. Altogether, these <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> data including an initial safety profile in laboratory dogs, support the development of our canine PD-L1 antibody as an immune checkpoint inhibitor for studies in dogs with naturally occurring cancer for translational research. In conclusion, our new therapeutic antibody and caninized PD-L1 mouse model will be an essential translational research tool in raising the success rate of immunotherapy in both dogs and humans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Immune checkpoint blockade,Cancer immunotherapy,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wonkyung Oh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alyssa Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Deepika Dhawan<sup>2<\/sup>, Perry  M.

However, durable responses are still limited, which may be due to downregulation of the targeted TAA or expansion of clones with low target expression<sup> <\/sup>. To improve binding to tumor cells and enhance tumor cell killing, we propose to simultaneously target BCMA and CD38 using ISB 2001, a potential first-in-class TREAT&#8482; trispecific CD3 T-cell engager based on Ichnos&#8217; proprietary BEAT platform. To understand whether dual targeting could improve binding to tumors and enhance killing, we compared ISB 2001 to control molecules lacking one of the two TAA binders. Potency of ISB 2001 was greater than control molecules lacking either BCMA or CD38 used alone or in combination in a re-directed lysis assay on multiple myeloma cells These results were consistent with the binding to tumor cell lines, in which ISB 2001 showed higher maximal binding than control molecules lacking either CD38 or BCMA binding domains. We also compared the tumor killing potency of ISB 2001 to teclistamab, a BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody recently approved to treat relapsed\/refractory (RR) MM patients who have received prior lines of treatment. To mimic the heterogeneity of tumor cells, the killing of MM cell lines expressing varying levels of BCMA and CD38 was evaluated. ISB 2001 exhibited potent killing of the cell lines with EC50 ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 pM, which was statistically superior to that of teclistamab. These results were consistent with elevated binding of ISB 2001 to MM cells compared to teclistamab. In the presence of soluble BCMA or APRIL, ISB 2001 was 100-fold more potent than teclistamab. When evaluated in a therapeutic PBMC-humanized mouse model subcutaneously engrafted with BCMA<sup>low<\/sup>\/CD38<sup>low<\/sup> KMS-12-BM cells, ISB 2001 resulted in complete tumor regression and showed statistically higher potency than teclistamab at 0.1 mg\/kg dose. In addition, ISB 2001 showed more potent anti-tumor activity than teclistamab in bone marrow aspirates of MM patients, indicating that ISB 2001 to leverage its cytotoxic properties with available immune cells. Taken together, we show that there is a clear advantage of avid binding achieved by the dual targeting using a TREAT-based ISB 2001, which results in potent and efficacious killing of tumor cells<i> in vitro<\/i> and<i> in vivo<\/i>. These data support clinical development of ISB 2001 as a promising treatment of RRMM through co-targeting of BCMA and CD38. Significant benefit is anticipated for RRMM patients who may experience tumor escape through target downregulation mechanisms. The evaluation of ISB2001 in a phase 1 clinical trial is planned for the first half of 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,BCMA,Multiple myeloma,Bispecific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Maria Pihlgren<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Carretero<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy Berret<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivia Hall<sup>1<\/sup>, Carole Estoppey<sup>1<\/sup>, Adam Drake<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniela Pais<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Macoin<sup>1<\/sup>, Myriam Chimen<sup>1<\/sup>, Perrine Suere<sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Nallet<sup>1<\/sup>, Blandine Pouleau<sup>1<\/sup>, Elodie Stainnack<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy Loyau<sup>1<\/sup>, Thierry Monney<sup>1<\/sup>, Aurore Delachat<sup>1<\/sup>, Cyrille Dreyfus<sup>1<\/sup>, Stan Blein<sup>1<\/sup>, Zeynep Kaya<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Matthes<sup>3<\/sup>, Rebecca Croasdale-wood<sup>1<\/sup>, James Edwards<sup>2<\/sup>, Claire Edwards<sup>2<\/sup>, Lamine Mbow<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Dyson<sup>1<\/sup>, Cyril Konto<sup>1<\/sup>, Ankita Srivastava<sup>1<\/sup>, Eugene Zhukovshy<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Mario Perro<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Oncology Research, Ichnos Sciences Biotherapeutics SA, Epalinges, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>Service d’Hématologie, Université de Genève, Ichnos Sciences Biotherapeutics SA, Geneve, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5d7827ec-c06e-4385-b9a4-a200353a320a","ControlNumber":"5907","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Despite being a potent class of therapeutics, not all patients respond to therapy. Recent studies into state of blinatumomab-treated T cells highlight exhaustion and the lack of co-stimulation as potential factors in resistance. In solid tumors, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is also a major factor while cytokine release is a safety consideration for all bispecifics that bind CD3 with strong affinity. To address the challenges of CD3 bispecifics, we have developed the EVOLVE&#8482; platform, a trispecific antibody that consists of tumor targeting and attenuated CD3 binding affinity coupled with a CD2 agonist. We show that CD2 costimulation is superior to other pathways in its ability to sustain T cell activation and expansion and cytokine production over repeated cycles of stimulation. By integrating a CD2 agonist with an attenuated CD3 affinity bispecific, we can restore cytolytic potential without concomitant increase in cytokine release as compared to a strong CD3 affinity bispecific. The EVOLVE platform is also capable of inducing tumor cell killing by <i>in vitro<\/i> exhausted T cells whereas the bispecific did not. In terms of safety, the EVOLVE platform does not induce peripheral T cell activation and cytokine release in PBMCs in the absence of target as compared to CD3 and CD28 agonist antibodies. The superiority of the EVOLVE platform compared to a bispecific was also demonstrated <i>in vivo<\/i> where we observed 8\/8 complete responses in EVOLVE-treated animals whereas the strong CD3 affinity bispecific showed no difference compared to isotype control using a CORL105 lung cancer xenograft model. We believe these experiments recapitulate the continual clinical challenges of using strong CD3 affinity bispecifics while demonstrating the advantages of the EVOLVE platform. Finally, we demonstrate the modular nature of the EVOLVE platform across diverse tumor antigens including B7H4, PSMA, CD20, and a novel squamous tumor antigen ULBP2. Together our data highlight the broad applications of the EVOLVE platform to improve T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and suggest its potential as an emerging, first-in-category immunotherapeutic strategy to address unmet medical needs in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mohosin Sarkar<sup><\/sup>, <b>Eric  M.

A major unmet medical need in immuno-oncology (IO) is extending the benefits of these therapies to patients who never experience tumor regression (primary resistance) or who derive initial benefit followed by tumor progression (acquired resistance). To improve clinical benefits of anti-PD-1 antibody, we generated SAR445877 (formerly KD050), which is an antibody cytokine fusion molecule that combines a human anti-PD-1 antibody with a mutated fusion of human IL15 and human IL15R&#945; sushi domain. SAR445877 binds to human PD-1 and inhibits immunosuppressive signaling through the PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway. The IL15-IL15R&#945; fusion contains a single amino acid mutation that confers reduced potency of IL2\/15R&#946;&#947; stimulation relative to wild type IL-15, reduces binding to IL-2R&#946; expressing HEK 293 cells, (EC50: &#62;10<sup>8<\/sup> nM vs 4.05nM) and decreases pSTAT5 activation in HEK blue IL-2 reporter assay by more than 5-fold. Through its IL15-IL15R&#945; fusion moiety, SAR445877 stimulates cells expressing IL2\/15R&#946;&#947; with much weaker activity than wild type IL-15 when measured by CTLL-2 cell proliferation in vitro (EC50: 398.8nM vs 1.68nM). Fusion of IL-15 to anti-PD-1 antibody mediates cis-activation of human PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> cells, including both PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> HEK blue reporter cell line and human primary T cells, with higher potency compared to non-targeted IL-15. This cis-activation could result in expansion and activation of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with improved activity in the tumor microenvironment compared to non&#8209;targeted IL-15. Antitumor efficacy of SAR445877 was explored in the CT26 colorectal cancer model using the clinical candidate. Transgenic mice expressing human PD-1 and PD-L1 were implanted with CT26 tumors expressing human PD-L1 and treated with SAR445877. SAR445877 displayed a more potent antitumor efficacy than pembrolizumab. Further, treatment with SAR445877 increased the CD8\/CD4 T cell ratio and significantly increased the percentage of effector memory CD8 T cells in tumors. In anti-PD-L1 antibody resistant Pan02 syngeneic tumor model, a murine surrogate molecule produced a remarkable antitumor activity and was well tolerated. Combination treatment of murine surrogate with anti-mPD-L1 displayed greater antitumor activity than single agent treatment (TGI = 99.30% vs 78.78%). In summary, SAR445877 can target potency-reduced IL-15 to PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and induce cis-activation of T cells. SAR445877 exhibited potent anti-tumor efficacy in PD-1 resistant preclinical model with good tolerability. These results support further evaluation of SAR445877 in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT05584670).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Cytokines,Immunotherapy,Therapeutic proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marie Bernardo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yu-an Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Dan Lu<sup>2<\/sup>, Stella Martomo<sup>2<\/sup>, Fatima Menas<sup>1<\/sup>, Chen Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Raymond Perez<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeegar Patel<sup>3<\/sup>, Donald Shaffer<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiangming Li<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sanofi, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Kadmon, a Sanofi company, Cambridge, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Evommune, Los Altos, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8ce930ee-6431-45ec-b693-b3fdc7afec55","ControlNumber":"3806","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

In the tumor microenvironment (TME), signal 2 can be provided by bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) targeting CD28 and a tumor associated antigen (TAA), enabling CD28 clustering on T cells in a TAA-dependent manner. The inhibitory PD-L1\/PD-1 axis is described to repress T cell activation by directly inhibiting CD28 driven costimulation, affecting mostly activated and\/or exhausted T cells. Preclinical studies have shown the benefit of combining blocking anti-PD-1\/-L1 antibodies and costimulatory CD28 bsAbs for the treatment of solid tumors. We reasoned that the effect of such a combination could be integrated into a single molecule, by associating a blocking anti-PD-L1 antibody arm with an agonist anti-CD28 antibody arm. To this end, a PD-L1xCD28 bsAb (NI-3201) was generated on the &#954;&#955; body platform to block the PD-L1\/PD-1 immune checkpoint, hence release the brake on CD28 signaling and provide signal 2 when co-ligating PD-L1+ tumor and immune cells (e.g., antigen-presenting cells). The capacity of NI-3201 to provide signal 2 to T cells following co-engagement of PD-L1 on tumor or immune cells was assessed in a variety of assays and models. Using a sensitive reporter cell bioassay, NI-3201 was shown to efficiently block the PD-L1\/PD-1 axis. The pharmacological activity of NI-3201 was then assessed through <i>in vitro<\/i> assays of cancer cell lines co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). NI-3201 synergized with CD3 bsAbs to enhance activation and proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 T cells, ultimately leading to strengthened T cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) against PD-L1-positive cancer cell lines. In immunocompetent huCD28-transgenic mice engrafted with huPD-L1-expressing murine colon adenocarcinoma MC38 cells, NI-3201 displayed superior single-agent activity as compared to the anti-PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab, with tumor regression being observed in all treated mice. At study termination, most of the NI-3201-treated mice rejected MC38-huPD-L1 tumors. All surviving mice rechallenged with wild type MC38 cells rejected the tumors, thus demonstrating a durable anti-tumor immunological memory response induced by NI-3201. Finally, as the anti-PD-L1 arm of NI-3201 is cross-reactive to mouse PD-L1, it was noteworthy that NI-3201-treated huCD28-transgenic mice displayed no clinical signs of toxicity. NI-3201 has demonstrated potent activity in a plethora of assays and single agent anti-tumor <i>in vivo <\/i>activity superior to a clinically approved PD-L1 benchmark. The mechanism of action of NI-3201 and the data presented herein support the use of this molecule as a universal combination partner for CD3-bispecifics. Pre-clinical development of NI-3201 is ongoing, with pharmacokinetic and tolerability studies in non-human primates planned for early 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,CD28,PD-L1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sara Majocchi<sup><\/sup>, Pauline Lloveras<sup><\/sup>, Coline Burnet-Merlin<sup><\/sup>, Lise Nouveau<sup><\/sup>, Pauline Malinge<sup><\/sup>, Valery Moine<sup><\/sup>, Giovanni Magistrelli<sup><\/sup>, Limin Shang<sup><\/sup>, Nicolas Fischer<sup><\/sup>, Krzysztof Masternak<sup><\/sup>, <b>Walter Ferlin<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Light Chain Bioscience – Novimmune SA, Geneva, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4706dfc4-f220-4d5e-a90b-b5355d581330","ControlNumber":"4273","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

One of the key TME regulators is the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). In addition to its role in tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis, MIF induces polarization of macrophages to a suppressive M2-like subtype, suppresses cytotoxic T cells and correlates with poor response to immune checkpoint therapy. Therapeutic interventions are hampered due to MIF&#8217;s ubiquitous expression and non-pathological roles. In contrast, the disease-related structural isoform of MIF, termed oxMIF, is exclusively present in solid tumor tissue, can be specifically targeted by antibodies and oxMIF neutralization blocks protumorigenic activities attributed to MIF. We determined the antitumorigenic and TME-modifying potential of the new oxMIF-specific antibody ON203 in preclinical models including fresh tumoroids retaining an intact TME isolated from colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) patients. 3D tumoroids were treated with ON203 and tumor cell killing was analyzed by high-content 3D computational bioimaging. ON203-induced TME modulation was assessed by secretome analysis and flow cytometry. To understand ON203&#8217;s action on the TME and to determine factors influencing the response to ON203 we performed dimensionality reduction (UMAP) to comparatively visualize the composition of the tumoroids. To further characterize the immune population differences between conditions, we employed multi-parameter clustering (FlowSOM\/XShift) and compared the abundance of each cluster across conditions. We also investigated functional marker expression differences across each of the conditions. ON203 demonstrated excellent tumor penetration and retention and reduced tumor cell proliferation in mouse xenograft models. oxMIF presence was confirmed in all freshly isolated CRC tumoroids and correlated with a &#8220;cold&#8221; phenotype with high IL-10 and TGF-&#946; levels. Four out of five ON203-treated CRC tumoroids responded with significant tumor cell death. In the responding tumoroids ON203 activated NK and NKT cells (upregulation of Granzyme B and CD107a) and supported an anti-tumor M1-like polarization and macrophage activation (upregulation of CD16 and HLA-DR). <b><\/b> Taken together, the anti-oxMIF antibody ON203 demonstrated antitumorigenic effects by reducing tumor cell proliferation and by modulating the TME towards immunosupportive functions. In the upcoming clinical Phase 1 trial ON203&#8217;s safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in patients with solid tumors will be analyzed to evaluate its potential as a standalone or combinatorial therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Macrophages,Natural killer cells,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Barbara Maurer<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric  R.

In recent years, immunotherapeutic approaches that target a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), including EGFRvIII-targeted cancer vaccine and adoptive cell transfer, have been examined in clinical studies, which so far have shown limited efficacy in GBM patients. GBM is highly heterogeneous for targeting antigen expression. An immunotherapeutic agent that harnesses multiple TAAs simultaneously may mitigate tumor antigen escape and improve efficacy in GBM patients. Here, we describe a DNA-encoded tri-specific T cell engager<br \/>(DTriTE) that targets CD3 and two TAAs, EGFRvIII and IL13Ra2, which are expressed in up to 30% and 75% of GBM cases, respectively. We designed EGFRvIII-IL13Ra2-DTriTE to include single-chain variable fragments targeting IL13Ra2, CD3, and EGFRvIII in a series, fused with glycine-serine linkers. EGFRvIII-IL13Ra2-DTriTE exhibited robust binding activities to both EGFRvIII<sup>+<\/sup> and IL13Ra2<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells and primary T cells, inducing robust T cell activation and anti-tumor cytotoxicity. EGFRvIII-IL13Ra2-DTriTE showed durable <i>in vivo <\/i>expression of over 10 weeks after a single IM injection in NSG mice. We developed an orthotopic challenge of a heterogeneous GBM model, wherein a mixture of EGFRvIII<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells and IL13Ra2<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells were planted in the brains of NSG mice and primary human T cells were peripherally delivered. A single IM administration of EGFRvIII-IL13Ra2-DTriTE resulted in complete tumor clearance. An administration of DNA-encoded bispecific T cell engager (DBTE) targeting EGFRvIII alone induced tumor clearance in 3 of 10 (30%) and limited tumor control in 5 of 10 (50%) animals. Similarly, mono-targeting of IL13Ra2 alone induced tumor clearance in 1 of 9 (11%) and limited tumor control in 4 of 9 (44%) animals.

By targeting dual tumor-associated antigens (TAA), the bispecific ADC (BsADC) serves as a promising therapeutic strategy that can further increase tissue specificity and selectivity. HER2 and TROP2 are two TAAs that are commonly expressed and co-expressed by multiple tumor types, including gastric, colorectal, bladder, breast, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Of note, TROP2 expression has been detected in a wide range of HER2-low expressing tumors. These data led us to predict that targeting HER2 and TROP2 with a BsADC would provide therapeutic benefit, especially for patients with HER2-low cancers. Hence, we generated YH012, a first-in-class BsADC that contains a fully human bispecific anti-HER2\/TROP2 antibody conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable linker. <i>In vitro<\/i>, YH012 demonstrated enhanced affinity, internalization, and tumor selectivity compared to its parental monoclonal and monovalent anti-HER2 or anti-TROP2 antibodies. <i>In vivo, <\/i>YH012 showed strong anti-tumor activity in multiple cell line-derived and patient-derived xenografts (CDX and PDX) of NSCLC, gastric, pancreatic, and breast cancer. Moreover, YH012 exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy than benchmark antibodies in both HER2-positive and HER2-low xenograft models, indicating that YH012 has a potent and broad therapeutic effect. In summary, YH012 has the advantages of increased potency, tissue specificity, and reduced toxicity as a novel BsADC that can be further exploited to treat HER2 and TROP2 co-expressing tumors, especially HER2-low tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Xenografts,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chengzhang Shang<sup>1<\/sup>, Gao An<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuming Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Ellen Zhang<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Qingcong Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi Yang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Biocytogen Boston Corp, Wakefield, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2865c186-ac65-4b80-8723-ef6b5107bbb6","ControlNumber":"6306","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

By combining the antibody-mediated specific targeting with potent killing from a cytotoxic payload, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), and especially bispecific ADCs (BsADC), have become powerful therapeutic strategies. EGFR and MET are oncogenic proteins that are co-expressed in a wide range of tumors. Moreover, MET amplification is largely associated with drug resistance of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Biocytogen developed a fully human EGFR x MET BsADC using our proprietary common light chain RenLite<sup>TM<\/sup> mouse platform and knobs-into-holes technology. The BsAb showed enhanced internalization and binding affinity compared to parental monoclonal and monovalent antibodies in the EGFR\/MET co-expressing NCI-H1975 cell line. After conjugating the BsAb with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable linker, the resulting BsADC, YH013, exhibited a remarkable and dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in NCI-H1975 and NCI-H292 cell line-derived xenograft models. Moreover, in multiple patient-derived xenografts of NSCLC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which co-express EGFR and MET, YH013 demonstrated superior and durable efficacy that outperformed benchmark antibodies at a lower dose (3 mg\/kg). Collectively, these results suggest that YH013 can be an effective treatment option for EGFR and MET co-expressing tumors and overcome MET-driven EGFR-TKI resistance to improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Xenografts,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yanfei Han<sup><\/sup>, Chengzhang Shang<sup><\/sup>, Zhuolin Li<sup><\/sup>, Zhenyan Han<sup><\/sup>, Jun Li<sup><\/sup>, Zixu Cui<sup><\/sup>, Gao An<sup><\/sup>, Wanjun Hao<sup><\/sup>, Yujie Liu<sup><\/sup>, Hao Li<sup><\/sup>, Baihong Liu<sup><\/sup>, <b>Ellen Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Qingcong Lin<sup><\/sup>, Yi Yang<sup><\/sup>, Yuelei Shen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f738053c-8c60-41f8-ba32-c214325834f9","ControlNumber":"6474","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

The first-line treatment is usually induction chemotherapies, followed by further chemo-\/radiation therapies or stem cell transplant, <i>etc<\/i>. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs), <i>e.g.<\/i> PD1 blocker, although a great success for treating many solid tumors, has yet to show convincing activity in AML. CD47, a &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; receptor frequently found on the surface of tumor cells, including hematological malignances such as AML, prevents phagocytosis by interacting to its ligand, SIRP&#945;, on the surface of macrophages. CD47 is also now shown as a key immune checkpoint for both innate and adoptive immunity (Liu et al., 2018). CD47 targeting, actively being tested for MSD and AML in clinics, encounters challenges for the reported toxicities (<i>e.g.<\/i> anemia\/thrombocytopenia) as well as inadequate efficacy (Feng et al., 2019). Majority of investigational CD47 targeting agents in the clinics are combination therapies with other modality in order to increase the likelihood of success. To this end, it is prudent to develop agents with dual targeting agents, particularly for both the innate and adoptive immune checkpoints. We describe a novel specially designed\/constructed bi-specific antibody (BsAb), HX009, targeting CD47 and PD1 for the treatment of cancers. We tested HX009 in several preclinical AML-PDXs (patient-derived xenograft models) via systemic engraftment: AM8096 (CD47<sup>lo<\/sup>, H-score of 55 by IHC), AM7577 (CD47<sup>hi<\/sup>, H-score of 237)(An et al., 2017) and AM5512 (CD47<sup>hi<\/sup>, H-score of 198). All three PDXs responded to 10mg\/kg twice weekly dose of HX009 (IP) as measured either by leukemic burden in peripheral blood at different timepoints, and in both spleen and bone marrow at the termination, or by survival. Since there is no T-cell function in xenograft models, all anti-leukemic activities observed should be attributed to the CD47 blockade, not PD1 blockade. AM7577 model responded significantly better than AM8096, likely due to the significantly higher expression of CD47 and also better than Ara-C standard of care (SOC) treatment at 3mg\/kg. In contrast, AM8096 responded even less to HX009 than Ara-C. In contrast, in the subcutaneous transplanted AML cell line-derived model, MV4-11, there is little anti-tumor activity observed, although there is significant expression of CD47 on the tumor cells. In conclusion, our data seems to suggest that HX009 could be a candidate immunotherapy for CD47<sup>hi<\/sup> AML, with CD47 expression being a positive predictive biomarker, warranting further evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,CD47,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaoyu An<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jinping Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Hang Ke<sup>3<\/sup>, Lingxin Xiong<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaolong Tu<sup>1<\/sup>, Lei Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Faming Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Henry Li<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Crown Bioscience, Inc., Taicang, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Crown Bioscience, Inc., Beijing, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Hanx Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd, Wuhan, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c6923408-f652-44b1-a917-75a92db841c1","ControlNumber":"4544","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;X.

Owing to its expression in several childhood tumors, B7&#8209;H3 is a potential target for pediatric cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB).<br \/>Methods: B7&#8209;H3 expression was evaluated by flow-cytometry (FCM) in a panel of human NB cell lines. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in monolayer and in multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) models by MTS assay and Cell Titer Glo 3D cell viability assay, respectively. Apoptotic cell death was investigated by the Annexin V staining. Pseudometastatic, orthotopic, and resected mouse NB models were developed via tumor cells tail vein injection, implantation in the adrenal gland, or implantation followed by surgical resection of the primary tumor mass, respectively, to mimic disease conditions related to circulating tumor cells and metastases, primary tumor growth, and minimal residual disease.<br \/>Results: All cell lines expressed cell surface B7-H3 in a unimodal fashion, ranging between 200 and 400 in mean ratio fluorescence intensity over unstained cells. MGC018 was cytotoxic in a dose- and time-dependent manner against all NB cell lines (IC50 range 5.1-53.9 ng\/mL) and NB MCTS (IC50 range 17.8-364 ng\/mL). MGC018 was inactive against a murine NB cell line (NX-S2) that did not express human B7&#8209;H3; however, NX-S2 cells were killed in the presence of MGC018 when co-cultured with human B7&#8209;H3-expressing cells, demonstrating by-stander activity. <i>In the pseudometastatic model and in <\/i>five orthotopic NB mouse models, weekly iv treatments<i> with 1 mg\/kg<\/i><i> <\/i>MGC018 for 3 weeks resulted<i> in delayed tumor growth and increased survival rates<\/i><i> <\/i>compared to animals treated with an irrelevant (anti-CD20) duocarmycin-ADC or an anti-GD2 antibody (dinutuximab beta). A 4-week course of treatment further ameliorated MGC018 antitumor effect in both the orthotopic and resected NB models and increased the survival of NB-bearing mice co-treated with TOpotecan-TEMozolomide (TOTEM), the standard-of-care therapy for relapsed disease. In the orthotopic model, tumor relapse was temporarily or completely arrested by 2 or 3 courses of MGC018, respectively. MGC018 treatment was not associated with body weight loss, hematological toxicity, or clinical chemistry abnormalities.<br \/>Conclusion: MGC018 exerts relevant antitumor activity in pre-clinical NB models and may represent a potential candidate for future NB clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Anticancer therapy,Immunotherapy,Neuroblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chiara Brignole<sup>1<\/sup>, Veronica Bensa<sup>1<\/sup>, Enzo Calarco<sup>1<\/sup>, Elena Giusto<sup>1<\/sup>, Eleonora Ciampi<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrizia Perri<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Valeria Corrias<sup>1<\/sup>, Simonetta Astigiano<sup>2<\/sup>, Michele Cilli<sup>2<\/sup>, Deryk Loo<sup>3<\/sup>, Ezio Bonvini<sup>3<\/sup>, Fabio Pastorino<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Mirco Ponzoni<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>G.

Compared to heme malignancies, treatment of solid tumors is hindered by immunosuppressed microenvironments that can be refractory to traditional CD3-bispecific TCEs. Immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment limits treatment responses in part due to the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints, such as PD-1 on exhausted T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells. To improve T cell responses and anti-tumor activity in immunosuppressed solid tumors, we generated trispecific TCE antibodies (Abs) that target a tumor associated antigen (TAA), CD3 and PD-L1 (via a PD1 moiety) to stimulate tumor-directed T cell killing and checkpoint blockade at the tumor site.<br \/>In this engineering approach we harnessed the flexibility of our Azymetric<sup>TM<\/sup> technology to screen multiple antibody formats, geometries, paratopes, and PD-1 domain affinities in parallel. We screened the TriTCE CPI antibodies, targeting different TAAs, for tumor-directed T cell cytotoxicity and CPI activity on TAA<sup>+<\/sup>PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> and TAA<sup>-<\/sup>PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells. We identified multiple TriTCE CPI Abs that induced potent TAA-dependent T cell killing of TAA<sup>+<\/sup>PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup>, but not TAA<sup>-<\/sup>PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup>, tumor cells. Evaluation of CPI using a PD-1\/PD-L1 checkpoint reporter gene assay identified antibody formats that stimulated simultaneous TAA dependent T cell engagement and enhanced checkpoint inhibition superior to bispecific Ab plus anti-PD-L1 Ab combination treatments. Additionally, in a human PBMC-engrafted xenograft model, TriTCE CPI Abs showed increased anti-tumor activity compared to a bispecific Ab control +\/- anti-PD-L1 Ab treatment. Furthermore, the benefits of increased anti-tumor activity and CPI was observed across multiple TriTCE CPI Abs targeting different TAAs.<br \/>We generated multiple TriTCE CPI Abs that combine tumor-dependent T cell cytotoxicity with checkpoint blockade, which may translate to improved T cell responses in immunosuppressed solid tumors. The evaluation of multiple Ab formats, geometries and paratope affinities allowed for optimization of TAA-dependent cytotoxicity and CPI to identify Abs with enhanced anti-tumor activity and superior site-specific CPI, key factors that may contribute to a wide therapeutic index and improved clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Antibody engineering,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maya  C.

Solid tumor cells lack expression of CD28 ligands, so we hypothesized that activation of CD28 signaling at the T cell\/tumor cell interface could enhance anti-tumor activity. We developed a CD28 bispecific platform that allows for the rapid generation of tumor-associated antigen (TAA) x CD28 bispecific antibodies that conditionally provide CD28 costimulation only in the presence of TAA and TCR engagement. Here, we present results for a set of bispecific antibodies with broad applicability across a range of solid tumors, including CEACAM5 x CD28, Trop-2 x CD28, STEAP1 x CD28, and mesothelin x CD28. We developed optimized CD28 scFv and Fabs that cover a range of affinities and are only agonistic in the context of TCR engagement. A matrix of bispecifics pairing these CD28 binders with CEACAM5, Trop-2, STEAP1, and mesothelin antibodies of varying affinities and epitopes were generated using Xencor&#8217;s XmAb&#174; bispecific antibody platform. Activities of these bispecifics were assessed in vitro by measuring T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity in co-cultures of human cancer cell lines mixed with primary human T cells. CEACAM5 x CD28, Trop-2 x CD28, STEAP1 x CD28, and mesothelin x CD28 bispecifics enhanced T cell degranulation, cytokine secretion, and cancer cell cytotoxicity only in concert with TCR engagement. IHC was used to compare TAA expression on cancer cell lines versus that found on cancer tissues, allowing categorization of cell lines as high density (tumor surrogate) or low density (normal tissue surrogate). CD28 bispecifics were identified with selective potency on high versus low expressing cell lines, suggesting a favorable therapeutic index. CD28 bispecific antibodies co-targeting CEACAM5, Trop-2, STEAP1, and mesothelin show promising activity and warrant further development across a range of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Costimulation,Solid tumors,T cell engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matthew  A.
