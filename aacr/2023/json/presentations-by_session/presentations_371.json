[{"Abstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive and lethal form of brain tumors, recurs in 90% of cases and the standard protocol of care&#8212;temozolomide (TMZ)&#8212;is an ineffective method to combat chemo-resistant GBM. It is therefore imperative that we identify, develop, and design novel therapeutics to effectively combat recurrent GBM (rGBM). Multi-potent stem-like cell subpopulations within GBM (also referred to as glioma stem cells or GSCs) play important roles in tumor propagation, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence following treatment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive resistance in GSCs can lead to novel therapeutic approaches for rGBM. Bioinformatics analyses of transcriptome data sets from rGBM clinical specimens identified transforming growth factor-beta receptor type 2 (TGFBR2) as a putative driver of resistance and recurrence in GBM. We show that TMZ-resistant cells become more stem-like concurrent with higher expression of TGFBR2 protein and mRNA. Importantly, shRNA-mediated inhibition of TGFBR2 decreases proliferation of TMZ-resistant cells and enhances the effects of TMZ. We hypothesize that by developing targeted therapeutics to reduce TGFBR2 expression we will inhibit the growth capacity and\/or re-sensitize rGBM cells to ionizing radiation (IR) or TMZ treatment by simultaneously targeting multiple putative oncogenes implicated in the induction of stem-like resistant GBM cell subsets. Future directions include inhibiting TGFBR2 signaling in clinical specimens derived from rGBM patients using two translatable approaches: (1) ITD1, a small molecule TGFBR2 inhibitor predicted to cross the blood-brain-barrier and (2) microRNAs to target multiple TGFBR2 target genes up-regulated in rGBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Therapy resistance,Tyrosine kinase receptors,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maya  K.

Current management for osteosarcoma includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery. Unfortunately, some patients eventually develop recurrent or metastatic diseases and treatment options are extremely limited. Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a unique collagen-activated tyrosine kinase that participates in various human diseases, including cancer. DDR1 promotes the adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and metastasis of cancer cells. However, the expression and function of DDR1 remain unknown in osteosarcoma. The purpose of this study is to assess the expression, clinical prognostic relationship, and functional roles of DDR1 in osteosarcoma. The correlation between DDR1 expression in tumor tissues and clinicopathological features and prognosis was assessed via immunohistochemical staining of a unique tissue microarray (TMA) constructed from osteosarcoma specimens. Furthermore, DDR1 expression in osteosarcoma cell lines was determined by Western blot. DDR1-specific siRNA and a highly selective DDR1 inhibitor, 7rh, were applied to determine the impact of DDR1 expression on osteosarcoma cell growth and proliferation. In addition, the effect of DDR1 inhibition on clonogenicity was evaluated using a clonogenic assay, and a 3D cell culture model was used to mimic DDR1 effects in an <i>in vivo<\/i> environment. The results demonstrate that higher DDR1 expression significantly correlates with recurrence, metastasis, and shorter overall survival in osteosarcoma patients. The expression of DDR1 is also inversely correlated to the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therapeutically, DDR1 knockdown with siRNA or selective inhibition with 7rh decreases the proliferation and growth of osteosarcoma cells. In conclusion,<b> <\/b>our study supports DDR1 expression as an independent predictor of poor prognosis and a promising therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Therapeutic target,Prognostic markers,Tyrosine kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jinglu Wang<sup><\/sup>, Robert Walker<sup><\/sup>, Francis Hornicek<sup><\/sup>, <b>Zhenfeng Duan<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Miami, Miami, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dd496c38-e999-4662-b37e-1de5217e7af8","ControlNumber":"144","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

These ESR1-TAF are gain-of-function mutations, exhibiting estrogen-independent cell growth, motility and ET resistance. They are not directly druggable because the ER&#945; C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) encoding sequence is replaced with a translocated in-frame partner gene sequence. Herein we utilized proteomic approaches to develop novel targeted therapies against ESR1-TAF driven tumorigenesis.<br \/>Methods: <i>ESR1 <\/i>fusion cDNA constructs were expressed in ER&#945;+ breast cancer cell lines (T47D and MCF7). Cell growth was assayed by an Alamar blue assay. A mass spectrometry (MS)-based Kinase Inhibitor Pulldown Assay (KIPA) was employed to identify druggable kinases that are commonly upregulated by diverse ESR1-TAFs. A panel of 22 ER&#945;+ patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were profiled using proteomics and phosphoproteomics to identify models with sensitivity to RET kinase inhibition.<br \/>Results: KIPA detected an increased abundance of a receptor tyrosine kinase, RET, in T47D cells expressing ESR1-TAFs in an estrogen-independent manner, compared to stable cell lines expressing transcriptionally inactive fusions as well as wild-type ER&#945; protein. Interestingly, RET was also increased when constitutive activating ER&#945; LBD point mutants, Y537S and D538G, were expressed in breast cancer cells. Inhibition of the RET kinase <i>in vitro<\/i> by repurposing pralsetinib, an FDA-approved RET inhibitor for advanced thyroid and non-small-cell lung cancers, demonstrated a significant reduction in the growth of cells expressing ESR1-TAFs and ER&#945; LBD mutants. These data nominate RET kinase as a common therapeutic vulnerability for ESR1-TAF expressing breast cancers. Proteomic profiling of 22 biologically heterogenous ER&#945;+ PDX tumors defined targetable pathways and predicted tumor subsets that were responsive to RET inhibition therapy. Organoids and xenografts from the pan-ET resistant WHIM18 PDX (that expresses the ESR1-YAP1 TAF) were inhibited by pralsetinib to a similar extent as the CDK4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib. These data provide key preclinical rationale for the consideration of RET inhibition for the treatment of ESR1-TAF-driven ET-resistant breast cancer. Interestingly, the growth of WHIM37 PDX (that expresses ER&#945; D538G) that had low level of RET and high level of GFR&#945;-1, the co-receptor of RET, was also suppressed by pralsetinib. This data suggests that either RET or GFR&#945;-1 is a predictive biomarker for RET inhibitor efficacy.<br \/>Conclusions: Kinome analysis of <i>ESR1<\/i> translocated breast tumors using KIPA followed by drug sensitivity studies nominated RET as a new therapeutic target for ET-resistant ER&#945;+ breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,ESR1 fusion,RET,Kinase-inhibitor pulldown,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xuxu Gou<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Beom-Jun Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Meenakshi Anurag<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonathan  T.

Our focus is on one of these newly defined entities&#8212;myxoid glioneuronal tumors&#8212;a slow growing, mucinous glial tumor defined by a pathognomonic dinucleotide substitution in the extracellular domain of PDGFRA p.K385I\/L. PDGFRA p.K385I\/L remains a variant of unknown significance, however, constitutive activation of PDGFRA is well established as a pharmacologically actionable, oncogenic driver present in a variety of tumor types. Here we report the functional characterization of PDGFRA<sup>K385I<\/sup> and PDGFRA<sup>K385L<\/sup> by assessing transforming potential using Ba\/F3 cells and immortalized human astrocytes. Our results demonstrate that both p.K385I and K385L substitutions are oncogenic, driving cytokine-independent Ba\/F3 cell growth and anchorage-independent colony formation. Western blot analysis of downstream cellular signaling pathways in the absence of PDGF-ligand further confirm the activating nature of these mutations, showing robust phosphorylation of PDGFRA and constitutive phosphorylation of downstream signaling effectors ERK1\/2, SHP2, and STAT3. To assess whether PDGFRA<sup>K385I<\/sup> and PDGFRA<sup>K385L<\/sup> are pharmacologically actionable, we tested multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors with known activity against PDGFRA aberrant cancers using our mutant-transformed PDGFRA Ba\/F3 cells. We found that the PDGFRA<sup>K385I<\/sup> and PDGFRA<sup>K385L<\/sup> mutants were sensitive to inhibitors axitinib, AZD-3229, and avapritinib at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Further, these mutants showed resistance to imatinib, nilotinib, and crenolanib underscoring the importance of pharmacogenomic investigation. No appreciable difference in sensitivity or resistance profiles was observed between the two mutants. In summary, our findings indicate that these previously uncharacterized p.K385I\/L extracellular domain mutations in PDGFRA are oncogenic and represent a pharmacologically actionable target that could be harnessed to increase therapeutic options in the setting of myxoid glioneuronal tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Patient-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Catherine  Z.

Incorporation of FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3is) into therapy for <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITD+ AML has improved outcomes, but FLT3i efficacy is limited by onset of resistance, which occurs by diverse mechanisms. The tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is inactivated in <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITD+ AML, and we previously showed that PP2A-activating drugs (PADs), including DT-061 and FTY720, enhance FLT3i efficacy through enhanced proteasomal degradation of c-Myc and Pim-1, mediated by activation of the serine\/threonine kinase GSK-3&#946; (Mol Cancer Ther 20:676, 2021). Here we sought to determine whether concurrent treatment with PADs overcomes resistance to FLT3is. We studied MOLM-14 human AML cells, with heterozygous <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITD, and FLT3i-resistant MOLM-14 cells with D835Y tyrosine kinase domain and F691L gatekeeper <i>FLT<\/i>3 mutations and M14(R)701 MOLM-14 cells (from Dr. Donald Small, Johns Hopkins) with a G12D <i>NRAS<\/i> activating mutation. IC<sub>50<\/sub>s, determined by WST-1 cytotoxicity assays, of Type 1 FLT3i gilteritinib in MOLM-14, D835Y, F691L and M14(R)701 cells were 9.2, 18.6, 56 and 57.5 nM, and the Type II FLT3i quizartinib, 2.8, 211, 659 and &#62;4,000 nM. Both DT-061 and FTY720 sensitized MOLM-14 D835Y cells to quizartinib (IC<sub>50<\/sub>s &#60;10 nM) but not to gilteritinib in cytotoxicity assays and showed synergy with quizartinib (combination indexes 0.6, 0.5), but not with gilteritinib in drug combination studies using Chou-Talalay analysis. In contrast, DT-061 and FTY720 did not sensitize to or synergize with quizartinib or gilteritinib in MOLM-14 F691L cells. Finally, FTY720 markedly sensitized M14(R)701 cells to both quizartinib and gilteritinib and showed substantial synergy (combination indexes &#60;0.1), while DT-061 did not. In mechanistic studies, quizartinib alone did not decrease phospho-FLT3 expression by western blot analysis in MOLM-14 D835Y cells, but DT-061 or FTY720 and quizartinib co-treatment markedly decreased phospho-FLT3, but not FLT3, expression. Thus PADs resensitize cells with D835Y to quizartinib by inactivating FLT3-ITD, thereby enabling the binding of quizartinib to FLT3-ITD. Additionally, while FTY720, but not DT-061, markedly sensitized M14(R)701 cells to quizartinib and gilteritinib, FTY720 and DT-061 increased phosphatase activity similarly in a PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay, indicating that sensitization by FTY720 likely occurs by a mechanism other than PP2A activation. Potential induction of ceramide accumulation by FTY720, a sphingolipid analog, in M14(R)701 cells is being studied.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,FLT3,Protein phosphatase,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Moaath Mustafa Ali<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aditi Chatterjee<sup><\/sup>, Jonelle  K.

It is expected to be the most effective therapy for patients with tumor metastasis. Checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy is a form of cancer immunotherapy which can block inhibitory checkpoints, restoring immune system function. Tumor cells could recruit immunomodulatory cells and induce inhibitory signals, resulting in losing immunomodulatory. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic agents that work in concert with CPI. HPK1, also known as MAP4K1, can act as a negative regulator of activation signals generated by T cell receptor (TCR). The development and screening of HPK1 inhibitors have great potential in the cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we constructed a HPK1 knockout reporter cell line Jurkat-NFAT-Luc2-HPK1-Knockout-Cell-Line by CRISPR\/Cas9 which can be used in high-throughput HPK1 inhibitors screening. Wild type cells were incubated with HPK1 inhibitors and luciferase signals were compared in HPK1-knockout cells. Our HPK1 knockout reporter cell line has high sensitivity and specificity. The reporter system can achieve high-throughput compound library screening. After selected the compound with selective inhibitory activity, further validation and optimization would be performed. Moreover, we constructed a Jurkat-HPK1-HiBiT reporter cell line by CRISPR\/Cas9. It can be used in the screening of HPK1 degradants.

Wee1-targeted agents are under active clinical investigation in multiple cancer types. However, Wee1 and its inhibitors have not been well studied in prostate cancer, particularly neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of Wee1 inhibitor AZD1775 and its synthetic lethal combination with Chk1 inhibitor in the context of NEPC. Our data demonstrated increased Wee1 expression in NEPC cells and tumors. Treatment of NEPC cells with AZD1775 inhibited NEPC tumor cell survival with greater potency as compared to other prostate cancer cells, demonstrating increased vulnerability of NEPC cells to Wee1 inhibition. We further identified synthetic lethality between the inhibition of Wee1 and several protein kinases, particularly Chk1, another key G2\/M checkpoint kinase. Using an autochthonous adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model that gives rise to NEPC tumors, we assessed the efficacy of AZD1775 and a highly selective Chk1 inhibitor SRA737 as single agents and in combination on the progression, survival, and metastatic spread of NEPC tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>. AZD1775 and SRA737 when used as single agents significantly suppressed tumor growth, improved overall survival, and incidence of distant metastases of mice with NEPC tumors. The combination of AZD1775 and SRA737 on a sequential 2-wk treatment schedule was more efficacious in suppressing tumor growth and metastasis than each drug alone in castrated TRAMP NEPC tumors. Mechanistically, the combination of Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors synergized to reduce the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 at Y15 and Cdc25c at S216, resulting in enhanced activation of CDK1\/cyclin B complex, abrogation of G2\/M checkpoint, and consequent premature mitotic entry, which ultimately led to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. Our findings provide promising preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic values of Wee1 and Chk1 inhibitors as single agents and in combination for the treatment of NEPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle checkpoints,Kinase inhibitors,Prostate cancer,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yapeng Chao<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yuzhou Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yu Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jaclyn  A.

The overexpression of the proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) kinase is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with RCC. PIM1 is a constitutively active effector serine\/threonine kinase with roles in tumor progression including cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration. Yet, the mechanisms underlying PIM1 expression and its function in RCC are not fully delineated. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the activation of the JAK\/STAT signaling cascade. High serum IL-6 levels are implicated in the poor prognosis of RCC patients and are hypothesized to contribute to RCC invasion and metastasis. PIM1 is shown to be transcriptionally regulated downstream of JAK\/STAT signaling and an IL-6\/STAT3\/PIM1 axis exists in pancreatic cancer. We thus hypothesize that this pathway also regulates expression of PIM1 in RCC. Here, we explore the levels of PIM1 in RCC and identify potential signaling pathways influencing PIM1 expression. Our results show five RCC cell lines, 769-P, 786-O, ACHN, CAKI-1, and RCC-4 cells overexpress PIM1 relative to normal renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. In RCC cell lines, IL-6 secretion correlates with PIM1 protein levels. Treatment with ruxolitinib, a JAK1\/2 inhibitor, leads to a dose and concentration dependent decrease in PIM1 levels. We then tested whether incubation with an IL-6 neutralizing antibody is sufficient to regulate PIM1 protein levels. Indeed, use of an IL-6 antibody resulted in decreased pJAK2 protein and PIM1 protein. Our initial studies suggest that differential expression of PIM1 among RCC cell lines may be linked to autocrine IL-6 signaling. Interestingly, 769-P cells demonstrate increased PIM1 levels but do not secrete IL-6 and neither ruxolitinib treatment nor incubation with an IL-6 neutralizing antibody appear to affect PIM1 levels. Therefore, an IL-6\/JAK-independent pathway resulting in increased PIM1 protein levels likely exists in 769-P cells. Further investigation is required to elucidate the contexts of PIM1 regulatory pathways in order to develop novel targeted anti-cancer strategies in RCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Kinases,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kimberly S.

An integral part of the GBM stroma is the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which promote GBM growth. Receptor tyrosine kinase EphA3, a member of the Eph family, is overexpressed in GBM tumors and in MSCs within TME, making it an attractive target for Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy. CART has proven incredible promise in certain hematological malignancies therapy but remained short in solid tumors, particularly GBM. We hypothesize that concurrent targeting of cancers and TME by EphA3-CART can be a potential therapeutic option in GBM. We first showed the expression of the EphA3 receptor by Immunohistochemistry and western blot on GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX), as well as on the SNB-19 and U87 human GBM cell lines and adipose-derived MSCs using flow cytometry. We then generated EphA3-CAR construct derived from a clinically validated anti-EphA3 scFv cloned in a lentiviral vector containing CD28 and CD3&#950;, and generated EphA3 CART cells with over 90% efficiency. EphA3 CART cells demonstrated potent antigen specific effector functions. To demonstrate the antitumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i>, we subcutaneously grafted 1 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> GBM cells per NOD-SCID-&#947;-\/- mice and at ~150-300 mm<sup>3<\/sup> tumor volume, mice were then treated with 5 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> EphA3-CART or un-transduced (UTD) T cells control. Tumors were monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and caliper measurements, and mice were followed for survival. Mice treated with EphA3 CART cells exhibited a significant reduction in tumor volume (p&#60;0.005), and prolonged overall survival (p=0.0015). Finally, we tested the ability of EphA3-CART cells to overcome MSC induced CART cell suppression by co-culturing EphA3-CART cells with MSC and EphA3<sup>+<\/sup> GBM target cells while using the CD19<sup>+<\/sup> mantle cell lymphoma cell line JeKo-1 and CART19 as control. MSC conditioned coculture of GBM and CART showed significant suppression of CAR19 in the CART19 - JeKo-1 system (p=000.3), but no significant suppression of EphA3-CART cells. In summary, our results indicate that EphA3 CART cells exhibited potent and specific antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo and ameliorated MSC induced inhibition of CART cell functions, representing a potentially promising therapeutic option in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Tumor microenvironment,Chimeric antigen receptor,Mesenchymal stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ekene  J.

CDK8\/19 Mediator kinases potentiate transcription induced by different signals, regulate protein levels of Mediator complex components and protect CCNC from proteolytic degradation; the latter activity is exerted in a kinase-independent manner. CDK8\/19 kinase inhibitors have entered clinical trials for solid tumors and leukemias. To extend the effects of CDK8\/19 inhibition and to suppress their kinase-independent activities, we have developed three series of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) based on different selective inhibitors of CDK8\/19 kinases, connected via different linkers to a moiety binding cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase. The most potent PROTACs degraded both CDK8 and CDK19 in different cell types with DC50s of 10-20 nM. RNA-Seq analysis of 293 cells treated with a CDK8\/19 kinase inhibitor or PROTAC showed that the bulk of the PROTAC&#8217;s transcriptomic effects matched the effects of the kinase inhibitor. In contrast to the kinase inhibitors, CDK8\/19-degrading PROTACs also induced CCNC degradation. Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) analysis revealed that multiple myelomas (MM), where CRBN is an established therapeutic target, show greater dependency on CCNC than most of the tumor cell lines. We have tested two strongly CCNC-dependent MM cell lines and one CCNC-independent MM line for sensitivity to different CDK8\/19 kinase inhibitors and PROTACs. Kinase inhibitors showed low to moderate anti-proliferative activity in all three MM lines, whereas CDK8\/19 PROTACs were an order of magnitude more potent than the kinase inhibitors in the two CCNC-dependent MM lines (IC50s of 20-30 nM) but not in the CCNC-independent line. The effects of CDK8\/19-degrading PROTACs were stronger than those of the CRBN-targeting drug pomalidomide (approved for MM), a CRBN-binding PROTAC acting on androgen receptor or a CDK8 degradation-inactive PROTAC analog containing CDK8\/19- and CRBN-binding moieties. These results suggest the potential of CDK8\/CDK19-degrading PROTACs for the treatment of MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK8,Multiple myeloma,Cyclin C,PROTAC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Li Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Charles E.

However, until recently, there was a paucity of potent, specific, and bioavailable DYRK1A inhibitors that did not target the related cdc2-like kinases (CLKs) and glycogen synthase kinase 3&#946;. In this study, we describe a set of next-generation DYRK1A inhibitors and used them to evaluate the specific contribution of DYRK1A activity to tumor biology and evaluate the therapeutic potential of DYRK1A inhibition in cancer.<br \/>Methods: <i>DYRK1A<\/i> expression was analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia databases.

While the overall response rate to first line therapy is encouraging (~80%), the majority of women develop recurrent disease, characterized by resistance to standard chemotherapy. There is convincing evidence that cancer stem cells (CSCs) have implications in resistance and recurrence of OvCa. To understand the pathways involved in enhancing this stem-like phenotype, we performed RNA sequencing and identified TLR-ILR1 (TIR) pathways as highly activated in cisplatin resistant OvCa and stem-cell populations. Subsequently, using a tumor microarray, we observed that interleukin receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), a critical mediator of TIR signaling, is upregulated in OvCa patient tissues compared to normal. This expression further correlated with younger diagnosis age and shorter overall survival, suggesting a role in OvCa tumorigenesis. Knockdown of IRAK1 by specific shRNA in OvCa cells, significantly impaired CSC enriched spheroid growth and orthotopic tumor growth in mouse models replicating advanced peritoneal OvCa. RNA sequencing of IRAK1 knocked down cells identified downregulation of CSC related genes including STAT3, MYC, NOTCH1, and NOTCH3. In addition, there was a reduction in the cisplatin efflux transporter ABCC1 and stemness marker gene CD44. Advanced OvCa is often associated (~90% in stage III and IV) with the development of malignant ascites. We demonstrate for the first time that significant amounts of low molecular weight hyaluronic acid fragments (LMW HA) are present in ascites. LMW HA induced IRAK1 dependent activation of non-canonical signaling through PKC-&#946; leading to induction of STAT3 phosphorylation and MYC. This was further accompanied by increased spheroid formation, demonstrating a critical role for IRAK1 in HA-induced stemness. We have further identified a selective IRAK1 inhibitor, TCS2210 (1,2-Dihydro-N-hydroxy-2-oxo-3-(3-phenylpropyl)-6-quinoxalinecarboxamide). TCS2210 abrogated LMW HA induced activation of IRAK1 and expression of stemness genes MYC, NOTCH1, and NOTCH3. Lastly, we found that TCS2210 effectively suppresses OvCa cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, synergizing with standard-of-care cisplatin. Our data suggests a role of IRAK1 in OvCa, by enhancing cancer cell growth and stemness. It further suggests that IRAK1 is a putative target for advanced OvCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3 activation,Stemness,Inflammation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David Standing<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Prasad Dandawate<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaimie Johnson<sup>1<\/sup>, Sumedha Gunewardena<sup>1<\/sup>, Michele  T.

In an earlier study, we identified Aurora Kinase (AK) inhibitors from a large-scale drug screening as a unique class of reagents to induce selective apoptosis in HPV+ human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo (using HPV+ PDX mouse models). We tested the in vivo efficacy of alisertib, an Aurora Kinase A inhibitor, in an immunocompetent mouse model (mEER) for HPV+ oropharyngeal cancers. In preparation for this, we first tested 300 nM alisertib on 3 HPV+ murine cancer cell lines: TC-1, C3.43, and mEER for 48h. We observed that when compared to the vehicle (DMSO) control group, the level of phospho Aurora Kinase A was completely inhibited. Furthermore, in multiple HPV+ murine tumor cell lines we observed significant apoptosis as measured by annexin V 7-AAD staining along with higher cell surface expression of calreticulin (CRT), and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) which are markers for immunogenic cell death (ICD). Both CRT and HMGB1 serve as &#8220;eat me&#8221; signals that in turn trigger APC-mediated dead-cell antigen uptake, a crucial event for priming the responses from the innate immune system. In support of this, we observed that in a co-culture setting, the conditioned medium from alisertib-treated tumor cells increased the frequencies of CD8+ cells expressing GnzB as well as a significant decrease in the population of T regulatory cells (Tregs) (CD4+ FoxP3+). Additionally, we observed an increase in the innate immune natural killer cell subset. Future studies will explore the in vivo efficacy of Aurora Kinase inhibition along with immune checkpoint blockade and\/or therapeutic vaccination. Our proposed research will have a positive impact because we will gain insight into the immune responses underlying the co-dependency of HPV+ cancers on Aurora kinase. Our research may lead to an increase in the rates of long-term, durable clinical responses or may allow for therapy de-escalation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aurora kinase,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Immunogenic cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pragya Sinha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Soma Ghosh<sup><\/sup>, Faye M.

Atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) plays a significant role in many cancer types. A positive correlation between elevated PKC levels and both the invasive and chemotactic potential of human breast cancer cell lines has been suggested in <i>in-vitro<\/i> studies. In addition, the atypical protein kinase C isoforms (aPKC), PKC- and PKC- are involved in the increased proliferation of several cancer types, including breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Hence, this project focused on utilizing aPKC inhibitors, ICA-1S (5-amino-1-((1R,2S,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide and - Stat (8-hydroxy-1,3,6- naphthalenetrisulfonic acid), on two malignant breast cancer cell lines (T47D and BT549) to observe the effect on cell proliferation. To observe the effects of the aPKC inhibitors on the malignant breast cancer cells, cell proliferation assays were conducted, where cells were treated with ICA-1S, and - Stat for 72 hours (about 3 days). Furthermore, to observe if ICA-1S induces apoptosis in the malignant breast cancer cells, both the cell lines were treated with ICA-1S for 120 hours (about 5 days), and western blotting techniques were utilized. The results indicated that in T47D cell line, treatment with ICA-1S (50uM) and - Stat (10uM) caused 52% and 75% reduction in cell proliferation, respectively. Moreover, with BT549 cell line, treatment with - Stat (1uM) decreased the cell proliferation by 40%. Additionally, it was observed by western blotting that ICA-1S induces apoptosis in BT549 cell line. This was shown by an increase in the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP, along with a decrease in survivin, and phospho-BAD. However, ICA-1S did not induce apoptosis in T47D cell line. Further investigation will be conducted on determining the effect of aPKC inhibitors on the proliferation, invasion, and migration of the malignant breast cancer cell lines. In addition, siRNA treatment will be applied to knockdown PKC- and PKC- and subsequent effect will be observed. In conclusion, PKC- and PKC- plays a<br \/>significant role on breast cancer, and further investigation will be conducted to analyze these roles, which will lead to the determination of a signaling pathway via which atypical protein Kinase C functions in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Protein kinase C,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nuzhat Nowshin Oishee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Khandker Mohammad Khalid<sup><\/sup>, Dr. Mildred Acevedo-Duncan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2e39d5d2-f017-42ee-b458-cc72cd3c05bf","ControlNumber":"7946","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Its high mortality rate is largely due to symptoms not appearing until late in the disease, usually after the cancer has metastasized. Despite current state-of-the-art treatments, the prognosis for patients remains poor. New effective treatments are urgently needed to improve patient survival. High lactate production and low glucose oxidation, independent of oxygen availability, is known as the Warburg effect and is common in cancer. Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1) irreversibly converts fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the first step in the Warburg effect. The platelet isoform of PFK (PFKP) regulates glycolysis and plays roles in tumorigenesis in other human cancers, the precise mechanisms has yet to be defined. Moreover, PFKP in ovarian cancer remain unknown. We hypothesize that PFKP modulates metastasis and stemness in ovarian cancer.<br \/>Methods: Expression of PFKP in clinical samples, ascites-derived tumor cells, normal ovarian epithelial cells (HOSEs) and ovarian cancer cell lines was determined by immunohistochemistry\/immunofluorescence and qPCR\/immunoblotting, respectively. The correlation between PFKP and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. Ectopic expression or knockdown of PFKP followed by migration, invasion, sphere formation and soft agar assays were performed in ascites-derived tumor cells and ovarian cancer cell lines to investigate the effects on metastasis, stemness and malignant transformation respectively. Additionally, the related signaling pathway was explored by qPCR and immuoblotting.<br \/>Results: Up-regulation of PFKP in clinical samples, ascites-derived tumor cells and ovarian cancer cell lines was found when compared to HOSEs. Higher PFKP was correlated to shorter overall and disease-free survival. Functionally, knockdown of PFKP by siRNA\/shRNA approaches in ascites-derived tumor cells, ES-2 and HeyA8 cells decreased migration, invasion, sphere formation and colony formation in soft agar, which was accompanied by decreased expression &#945;5 integrin, pERK and MMP9. Ectopic expression of PFKP in SKOV-3 cells showed opposite effects. Intriguingly, we found that MEK-1 inhibitor (U0126) or an anti-MMP9 neutralizing antibody could block PFKP-mediated migration\/sphere formation abilities.<br \/>Conclusion: PFKP was overexpressed in ovarian cancer and regulates metastasis, stemness and anchorage-independent growth. &#945;5 integrin and ERK\/MMP9 signaling were involved in such functional effects. PFKP could be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Warburg effect,Stemness,Ovarian cancer,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ruiqian Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle K.Y.

Current treatment strategies are surgical removal of cancerous parts and chemotherapy with platinum drugs (e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin) or taxols. However, recurrence of cancer with drug resistance is frequent. Previously two inhibitors; ICA-1S (5-amino-1-((1R,2S,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide and &#950;-stat (8-hydroxy-1,3,6- naphthalenetrisulfonic acid) specific for two atypical protein kinases, PKC-&#953; and PKC-&#950; respectively have been reported. These inhibitors have an anticancer effect in different cancers, including clear-cell ovarian cancer. Our aim was to find if cisplatin has any synergistic effect with ICA-1S and &#950;-stat on ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Ovarian cancer cell line ES-2, which has mutation in p53 gene was used in this study. After 72 hours of treatment with ICA-1S (10 &#181;M) and &#950;-stat (10 &#181;M), proliferation of ES-2 cell line was inhibited by 42.5% and 23.5% respectively compared to control. When combined with cisplatin (0.5 &#181;M), the inhibition of cell proliferation increased to 67% for &#950;-stat and 65.8% for ICA-1S (N=3 trials) which is synergistic. Wound healing assay with ES-2 cells showed that ICA-1S and cisplatin inhibited the migration of ES-2 cells separately as well as in combination. SDS-PAGE and subsequent western blotting showed that ICA-1S monotherapy and combination with cisplatin reduced the expression mutant p53, PI3K, AKT, Bcl2, and phopho-BAD. IP with PKC &#950; beads showed the association of PKC &#950; with PKC-&#953; and p53 in ES-2 cell line. As mutation in p53 is quite frequent in ovarian cancer with gain of function, ICA-1S may have an advantageous role in inhibiting mutated p53 regulated pathway. Inhibition of ES-2 cell line with ICA-1S and &#950;-stat also suggested that PKC-&#953; and PKC &#950; play important roles in ovarian cancer and may augment traditional chemotherapy. Further study on the pathway affected by aPKC inhibitors combined with cisplatin would be investigated through WST, western blotting and immunoprecipitation assay.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein kinase C,Cisplatin,Ovarian cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mahfuza Marzan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nuzhat Nowshin Oishee<sup><\/sup>, Khandker Mohammad Khalid<sup><\/sup>, Mildred Acevedo-Duncan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0946bbc6-390f-404d-9052-d12e2525ea1f","ControlNumber":"2726","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

It is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor with a tendency to invade surrounding healthy brain tissues, rendering them largely incurable. In this study, small-interference RNA was used to knock down the expression of protein kinase C PKC-&#953;. The reduced PKC-&#953; expression impaired the phosphorylation of LIM kinase 1\/2 (LIMK), which is a critical step in cofilin recycling and actin polymerization. Additionally, there was a down-regulation of matrix metalloprotease-9 expression in LN-229 and U87G cells, which coincided with decreased invasion. Therefore, PKC-&#953; regulates both cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell adhesion, which contributed to cell migration. Silencing of PKC-&#953; also dampened Transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;)-activated kinase 1 (Tak1) level. TAK1 is an essential component in genotoxic stresses-induced NF-&#954;B-activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathways in GBM. TAK1, when activated, forms a complex with TAB1-3 (Tak1 binding proteins). Our data reveal, reduced Tak1 level after silencing PKC-&#953; interferes with complex formation and reduces NF-&#954;B-activation. Diminished PKC-&#953; level also reduces activation of Tak1\/JNK axis. This deactivation exerts an anti-oncogenic effect on glioblastoma via suppression of Akt1, c-Myc, and STAT3. This implies PKC-&#953; may have a crucial role in the activation of Tak1.

We previously reported that an Mcm2 hypomorphic mouse (designated Mcm Cre\/Cre) develops T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), due to acquisition of 100-1000 kb interstitial deletions involving tumor suppressor genes. When crossed to mice that express a NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene, NHD13+;Mcm2Cre\/Cre mice develop B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL). Sparse whole genome sequencing revealed somatic copy number variants (CNV) involving Pax5 and Ptpn1. The role of Pax5 in B-cell development, differentiation, and leukemia has been widely studied. However, little is known about deletions of Ptpn1 and its role in BCP-ALL.<br \/>Objective: The principal objective is to investigate how deletion of Ptpn1 impacts BCP-ALL development in mouse models.<br \/>Methods: Mice expressing NHD13 fusion (NHD13+) were crossed with Ptpn1 knockout mice. The F2 cross generated 6 genotypes that were positive or negative for NHD13 and wild type\/heterozygous\/homozygous for Ptpn1. Mice were studied for incidence of BCP-ALL, which was characterized by whole-exome sequencing, molecular pathway analysis and transcriptome-sequencing.<br \/>Results: NHD13+;Ptpn1-\/- mice developed BCP-ALL, characterized by hyperleukocytosis, variable anemia and thrombocytopenia, expression of B220 and\/or CD19, and invasion of non-hematopoietic tissues (liver, kidney, lung). In addition, NHD13+;Ptpn1+\/- mice that developed BCP-ALL lost the wild-type (WT) Ptpn1 allele in the leukemic cells. Similar to human BCP-ALL, NHD13+;Ptpn1-\/- mice that developed BCP-ALL showed presence of clonal TCR-delta rearrangements as well as IGH rearrangements in the leukemic cells. Whole exome sequencing showed presence of acquired mutations in genes known to be involved in B-cell differentiation, such as Pax5 or Bcor, as well as genes involved in B cell signaling pathways, such as Jak3, Jak1 and Flt3 and Western blots demonstrated accumulation of phosphorylated STAT3 protein.<br \/>Conclusion: This study demonstrates that Ptpn1 loss along with expression of an NHD13 fusion gene leads to a highly penetrant BCP ALL in mice, suggesting a role for Ptpn1 in preventing malignant transformation. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a collaborative model for BCP ALL in which the NHD13 transgene leads to increased stem cell self-renewal, somatic Bcor or Pax5 mutations block normal B cell differentiation, and somatic signaling mutations (Jak1\/3, Flt3) lead to hyperproliferation, which is potentiated by Ptpn1 deficiency.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Tyrosine kinase,Fusion genes,Protein phosphatase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Toshihiro Matsukawa<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Nupur Nigam<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Bertoli<sup>1<\/sup>, Michel L.

Although sorafenib has not shown significant survival benefit in clinical trials for NSCLC patients, one study identified a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring <i>ARAF<\/i> p.S214C mutation as an exceptional sorafenib responder. As NSCLC lacks clinically validated predictive biomarkers for drug responses, we aim to evaluate the potential of <i>ARAF<\/i> p.S214C mutation as a biomarker for sorafenib sensitivity and its mechanism of action. Constructs with <i>ARAF<\/i> p.S214C mutation, <i>ARAF<\/i>-wild type (WT) and EGFR-vector control were ectopically expressed in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, H2023, by retroviral transduction. Western blot confirmed stable overexpression of ARAF proteins over time. MTT assay showed that sorafenib inhibited growth of cells expressing <i>ARAF<\/i> p.S214C more pronouncedly than cells expressing <i>ARAF<\/i>-WT or vector control. In addition, spheroids formed by cells expressing <i>ARAF<\/i> p.S214C were more sensitive to sorafenib inhibition, indicating sorafenib sensitivity of <i>ARAF<\/i> p.S214C in NSCLC <i>in vitro<\/i>. To evaluate whether such sorafenib sensitivity is dependent on the kinase activity of ARAF, phospho-MEK and MAPK levels in mutant cells will be determined. As ARAF belongs to the Raf protein family which also includes BRAF and RAF1, knockdown studies and co-immunoprecipitation will be performed to determine whether BRAF and RAF1 are essential for <i>ARAF<\/i> p.S214C activity. The <i>in vivo<\/i> sorafenib sensitivity of <i>ARAF<\/i> p.S214C will be validated in tumor xenografts established from cells expressing the above constructs upon sorafenib treatment. Tumor volume will be assessed and expression of the tumor marker cytokeratin will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry.

Through its N-terminal ovarian tumor (OTU) domain, A20 negatively regulates NF-&#312;B by removing the K63-linked ubiquitin chains on RIP1 that act as platforms for NF-&#312;B activation downstream of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;). On the other hand, A20 also catalyzes the addition of K48-linked ubiquitin chains on RIP1 via its C-terminal zinc finger domain 4 (ZnF4) to promote its proteasomal degradation. Through both mechanisms, A20 is a means of negative feedback on TNF&#945;-induced NF-&#312;B activity. Importantly, inactivation of A20 is frequently found in B-cell lymphomas, where loss-of-function A20 truncations promote cell proliferation and upregulation of NF-&#312;B signaling. Among the post-translational modifications (PTMs) reported in A20, there are several phosphorylation events in its C-terminus, including within the ZnF4 domain. Besides its known E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, previous reports show that the C-terminal region of A20 is important for ubiquitin binding, having preference for K63-linked poly-ubiquitin. However, a little is known about the effects of phosphorylation at this region on A20 activity as well as its consequences in downstream signaling. Our current work suggests that phosphorylation in the C-terminus of A20 inhibits its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and disrupts its interaction with ubiquitin, which may also affect its deubiquitinase activity by preventing its recruitment to ubiquitinated proteins in the TNF&#945; receptor (TNFR) complex. We also propose that the C-terminal region is important for the formation of the A20 ubiquitin-editing complex, necessary to downregulate NF-&#312;B-activated inflammatory signals. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that not only gene-inactivating mutations, but also post-translational mechanisms, such as phosphorylation, inhibit A20 to promote cancer development. Our research is now focused on understanding the upstream signaling that regulates A20 phosphorylation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Kinases,NF-&#954;B,Phosphorylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tania Lopez Palacios<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tsz-Yin Chan<sup><\/sup>, Christina Egbert<sup><\/sup>, Jacob Truman<sup><\/sup>, Spencer Ashworth<sup><\/sup>, Alec Vaughan<sup><\/sup>, Joshua  L.

However, the biological function of TNK1 is not well understood. We also found that TNK1 is unusual among kinases for the presence of a functional ubiquitin association (UBA) domain on its C-terminus. We discovered that the TNK1 UBA domain binds to poly-ubiquitin with high affinity and has no apparent preference for ubiquitin chain length or linkage type. Interestingly, the UBA domain is important for TNK1 function, given that deletion of the UBA domain (TNK1 &#916;UBA) alters its localization and phospho-substrate network, while also weakening the oncogenic activity of TNK1 in cell transformation assays. Based on these data, we hypothesized that the UBA domain tethers TNK1 to its substrates. To test this hypothesis, we performed quantitative phospho-tyrosine proteomics using murine pro-B cells transformed with either TNK1 full length or TNK1 &#916;UBA and identified TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as a putative UBA-dependent TNK1 substrate. TBK1 is a serine\/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of inflammation, autophagy, and NF-&#312;B signaling. During the selective autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins (aggrephagy), TBK1 phosphorylates p62 at S403 to increase its affinity to ubiquitin, and thereby increases p62-mediated recruitment of misfolded proteins into the condensate. Unchecked growth of ubiquitin condensates can overwhelm the size capacity of autophagosomes, potentially causing misfolded proteins to become proteotoxic aggregates. Our preliminary data suggest a model in which active TNK1 accumulates at ubiquitin condensates to phosphorylate and inhibit TBK1. Based on these data, we propose that TNK1 acts as a kinase sensor of poly-ubiquitin to control the TBK1-mediated growth of ubiquitin condensates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Autophagy,Phosphorylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Emmalee Kohler<sup><\/sup>, Tania Lopez-Palacios<sup><\/sup>, Tsz-Yin Chan<sup><\/sup>, Christina Egbert<sup><\/sup>, Jacob Truman<sup><\/sup>, Spencer Ashworth<sup><\/sup>, Alec Vaughan<sup><\/sup>, Joshua Andersen<sup><\/sup>, <b> D.

Resistance to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapies necessitates the continuous search for novel therapies. Previous studies demonstrate AI-resistance is associated with hormone-independence, enhanced motility, and increased growth factor signaling. Here, long-term letrozole-treated (LTLT-Ca) breast cancer cells were used to evaluate polyisoprenylated cysteinyl amide inhibitors (PCAIs) as potential alternative therapies for the treatment of aromatase inhibitor-resistant breast cancer. We determined the potency of PCAIs as anticancer agents by evaluating their effects on cell viability, phosphorylation of MAPK pathway enzymes, G-proteins levels, cell migration and apoptosis. Among the PCAIs tested, NSL-YHJ-2-27 showed significant potency against cell viability with an EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 3.6 &#181;M. MEK (p-MEK1\/2), ERK (p-ERK1\/2), and p90RSK (p-p90RSK) phosphorylation were significantly increased by 178, 119 and 125%, respectively, over controls. In addition, of the seven G-proteins evaluated, only KRAS and NRAS showed significant increases of 49% and 97%, respectively. Cell proliferation and colony formation were impeded by 82% and 74%, respectively, after PCAIs treatment. Migration of the LTLT-Ca cells was inhibited by 80% following treatment with 5 &#181;M of NSL-YHJ-2-27. Lastly, the PCAIs also caused the degeneration of the spheroids after 10 &#181;M PCAIs treatment, dead cells were very apparent after AO\/EB staining. Our findings suggest that the PCAIs&#8217; suppression of cell viability and activation of the MAPK pathway causes apoptosis possibly through the activation of the proapoptotic p-p90RSK isoforms. The results reveal the ability of the PCAIs to effectively cause a negative impact on several cancer hallmarks suggesting their potency as anticancer agents. These findings also support a potential role for PCAIs&#8217; use in treating breast cancers that have become resistant to aromatase inhibitor therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Breast cancer,Apoptosis,Aromatase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jassy Mary S.
