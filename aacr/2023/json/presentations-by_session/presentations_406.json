[{"Abstract":"Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) patients face a dismal prognosis, with median survival of ~15 months and 5-year survival rate of 6.8%. Standard of care includes surgical resection, external beam radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). Unfortunately, all GBM patients succumb to their disease. Glioma stem cells (GSCs), a GBM subpopulation, possess enhanced DNA repair that contributes to chemoradiotherapy resistance. The epigenetic modifier lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A\/LSD1) is overexpressed in GBM and emerging studies show KDM1A is implicated in DNA damage response. This study aims to determine the significance of KDM1A to promote DNA repair in GSCs. We hypothesize KDM1A inhibition augments therapeutic efficacy of TMZ via attenuation of DNA repair pathways.<br \/>Methods: Patient-derived GSCs were obtained via IRB-approved protocol from patient samples at UT Health San Antonio. KDM1A knockdown and knockout cells were generated by transduction of validated KDM1A-specific shRNA or gRNA, respectively. Brain bioavailability of KDM1A inhibitor NCD38 was established using LS-MS\/MS. Effect of combination KDM1A knockdown or inhibition with TMZ was studied using cell viability, neurosphere, and self-renewal assays. Mechanistic studies were conducted using CUT&#38;Tag-seq, RNA-seq, immunofluorescence, comet, Western blotting, RT-qPCR, homologous recombination (HR), and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) reporter assays. <i>I<\/i><i>n vivo <\/i>efficacy of KDM1A knockdown or inhibitor alongside TMZ was determined using orthotopic murine GBM models.<br \/>Results: GBM patient data sets showed KDM1A is elevated in recurrent GBM versus primary tumors. KDM1A knockdown, knockout, or pharmacological inhibition increased efficacy of TMZ in reducing cell viability and self-renewal of GSCs. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated KDM1A inhibitor NCD38 is readily brain penetrable. CUT&#38;Tag-seq studies showed KDM1A is enriched at the promoters of DNA repair genes. RNA-seq studies confirmed that KDM1A inhibition reduced expression of DNA repair-related genes. RT-qPCR and Western blotting validated downregulation of DNA double-strand break repair genes. Knockdown, knockout, or inhibition of KDM1A attenuated HR and NHEJ-mediated DNA repair capacity. Immunofluorescence and comet assay demonstrated increased TMZ-mediated DNA damage in NCD38-treated GSCs. Importantly, KDM1A knockdown or inhibition enhanced efficacy of TMZ and significantly improved survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results provide compelling evidence KDM1A is essential for DNA repair in GSCs and KDM1A inhibition sensitizes GBM to TMZ via attenuation of DNA repair pathways. These findings suggest combination therapy of KDM1A inhibitor NCD38 with TMZ is a potential novel therapeutic strategy to improve GBM outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,LSD1,DNA repair,Temozolomide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Salvador Alejo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bridgitte Palacios<sup>1<\/sup>, Prabhakar Pitta Venkata<sup>1<\/sup>, He Yi<sup>1<\/sup>, Wenjing Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Jessica Johnson<sup>1<\/sup>, Sridharan Jayamohan<sup>1<\/sup>, Weixing Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Siyuan Zheng<sup>3<\/sup>, Takayoshi Suzuki<sup>4<\/sup>, Rajeshwar  R.

BET inhibitors can also combine with many anticancer agents to enhance activity. The bromodomains of the BET protein, BD1 and BD2, have unique functions and inhibiting either domain can result in differential responses. To date, non-selective BET inhibitors have failed during early clinical development due to significant on-target toxicity and limited benefit; however, selectively targeting specific bromodomains may result in a more favorable benefit\/risk profile. NUV-868 is a novel and highly selective BD2 inhibitor of the BET protein family with ~1500-fold selectivity for BRD4-BD2 relative to BRD4-BD1. Herein, we describe NUV-868 and its activity in multiple in vitro and in vivo solid tumor models. Target engagement, selectivity of bromodomain inhibition, and regulation of BET-mediated gene expression were examined. Additionally, the antitumor activity of NUV-868 in combination with enzalutamide or olaparib was studied in tumor xenograft models of prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancer. NUV-868 demonstrated high selectivity for BD2 and regulated expression of several BET target genes. NUV-868 in combination with enzalutamide inhibited growth of several prostate cancer cell line- and patient-derived xenografts. NUV-868 in combination with olaparib inhibited tumor growth in models of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Our preclinical data demonstrate that NUV-868, a BD2-selective BET inhibitor, inhibits growth of tumor xenografts in combination with enzalutamide or olaparib and provides rationale for examination of these combinations in the clinic. An ongoing, phase 1 clinical study (NCT05252390) is evaluating NUV-868 as a monotherapy and in combination with olaparib or enzalutamide in patients with advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BET inhibitor,Enzalutamide,Olaparib,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hitisha Patel<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jennifer Hertzog<sup><\/sup>, Laura Heller<sup><\/sup>, Spandana Vootukuri<sup><\/sup>, Yan Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Chris Miller<sup><\/sup>, Gary Hattersley<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nuvation Bio, Inc., New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a71b640c-3a32-4dcb-816a-4e5eced2e72c","ControlNumber":"1617","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

While EP300 and CBP proteins bind and regulate genes broadly across the genome, they also function to promote the expression of tumor-selective oncogenes such as the transcription factor <i>c-MYC<\/i>. This activity makes these proteins attractive targets for preclinical therapeutic development. EP300\/CBP proteins contain highly homologous domains, including catalytic HAT domains and bromodomains (BRDs) that mediate physical binding of EP300\/CBP to acetylated proteins. Importantly, however, the relative contribution of these distinct domains to tumor cell proliferation remains unresolved. To identify the relative contribution of the EP300\/CBP BRD and HAT domains, we used a chemical strategy. We performed a cell viability-based high-throughput screen of the potent EP300\/CBP BRD- or HAT-specific inhibitor, CCS1477 or A-485 on 454 barcoded cancer cell lines representing 31 distinct cancer types. These data revealed that the proliferation of most tumor cell lines regardless of the type of cancer were equally affected by targeting either domain of EP300\/CBP. Intriguingly, Group 3 medulloblastoma (G3MB) cell lines were the most sensitive to EP300\/CBP BRD inhibition, compared to HAT inhibition. Since G3MB cells are highly sensitive to BRD4 inhibition, we conducted a bromoscan analysis of the phase 1 compound CCS1477, which revealed high selectivity for EP300\/CBP (K<sub>d<\/sub>~4-5nM), with limited off-target effects on BRD4 (K<sub>d<\/sub>~250nM) or other bromodomain-containing proteins. To validate that the effects on G3MB were primarily due to inhibition of EP300\/CBP, we performed biotinylated CCS1477 pulldown assays in G3MB neurosphere cultures using <i>in vitro <\/i>relevant dosing of CCS1477, which demonstrated selective pulldown of EP300 and CBP, but not BRD4. Further, crystallographic studies of the EP300, CBP and BRD4 bromodomains in complex with CCS1477 demonstrated that the selectivity for the EP300\/CBP BRD was critically dependent on interactions between the difluorophenyl group of CCS1477 and amino acid side chains in the BRD of EP300\/CBP. In contrast, the analogous sidechains of BRD4 were unable to coordinate efficient binding of CCS1477. Mechanistically, treatment of MB cells with CCS1477, but not A-485 or the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1, caused rapid early loss of mRNA expression of specific G3MB dependency networks including the driver oncogene c-<i>MYC<\/i>. These studies identify a selective role for the EP300\/CBP bromodomain in maintaining genetic dependency networks in G3MB cells and provide new chemical approaches to disrupting malignant transcription in Group 3 medulloblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Pediatric cancers,Epigenetics,Histone acetylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Noha Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Shendy<sup><\/sup>, <b>Adam Durbin<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fd479d89-2353-43d3-81ac-fd09a2dbb87a","ControlNumber":"2332","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

The enhancer of zeste homology 2 (EZH2) and its homolog EZH1 are catalytic subunits of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) to repress transcription of its target genes.<br \/>Although methlytransferase activity of PRC2 is mainly contributed by EZH2, EZH1 also conducts a compensatory role to maintain tri-methylation of H3K27. EZH1 also directly binds to chromatin and modulates its condensation. Recent studies have suggested that EZH1 as well as EZH2 played a critical role in T-cell lymphoma such as ATL\/L and PTCL, which had high innate EZH1 and increased EZH2 expression upon acquisition of their malignancy. Consequently, dual inhibition of EZH1\/2 might induce higher expression of downstream tumor suppressor genes than blocking EZH2 alone, expecting greater activity as an anti-cancer therapy.<br \/>Herein, we presented a novel and potent EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor, HM97662, which simultaneously inhibited the methyltransferase activity of both EZH1 and EZH2 with 2.1 and 16 nM of IC<sub>50<\/sub>, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay verified that HM97662 had great binding affinity on EZH1-EED-SUZ12 complex as well as EZH2-EED-SUZ12 complex than competitors. HM97662 also showed broad and strong antiproliferative activity against various T-cell lymphoma cell lines. Representatively in HH cells, HM97662 not only suppressed global tri-methylation of H3K27, but also dose-dependently increased protein expression levels that modulate cell cycle or cancer cell apoptosis. HM97662 exhibited increment of CDKN1A (p21) proteins involved in cell cycle arrest and induced protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 as well as PARP. Additionally, resulting induction of apoptosis by HM97662 in HH cells was confirmed by TUNEL staining. Mechanistically, HM97662 increased mRNA expression of several target genes inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in gene panel assay performed in HH cells. Two cell cycle repressor, CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN1C (p57), and a pro-apoptotic marker, BTG-2, were dose-dependently increased by HM97662. We further conducted chromatin accessibility assay and identified that the chromatin structures of them were loosened and highly transcribed after the treatment of HM97662.<br \/>Based our <i>in vitro <\/i>pharmacology data, we evaluated an antitumor activity of HM97662 in EZH1\/2 co-expressed HuT-102 T-cell lymphoma cell mouse xenograft model, and daily oral dosing of HM97662 showed potent tumor growth inhibition.<br \/>In conclusion, the present studies demonstrated that HM97662 has promising prospective for the treatment of patients with T-cell lymphoma. Given that the necessity of new treatment options on T-cell lymphoma, it is urgent to assess the effectiveness of HM97662 in further clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Epigenetics,EZH2,Lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jooyun Byun<sup><\/sup>, Seung Hyun Jung<sup><\/sup>, Yu-Yon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Miyoung Lee<sup><\/sup>, Gunwoo Lee<sup><\/sup>, <b>Heesun Moon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Eun Young Lee<sup><\/sup>, Junghwa Park<sup><\/sup>, Seon Yeong Han<sup><\/sup>, Young Gil Ahn<sup><\/sup>, Young Hoon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Kwee Hyun Suh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ffd54bd0-e3b5-40e4-b2bd-0b8ef021406c","ControlNumber":"5475","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

The bromodomain (BRD) of CBP\/p300 serves as an acetyl-lysine &#8220;reader&#8221; that allows CBP\/p300 to bind chromatin at acetylated histone and non-histone proteins leading to the regulation of gene transcription. Indeed, CBP\/p300 are critical co-activators of nuclear receptors, including the androgen receptor (AR) in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Thus, inhibition of CBP and p300 is an emerging therapeutic strategy to block the transactivation activity of the AR in CRPC. In addition, inhibition of the CBP\/p300 BRD has been described as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat multiple myeloma (MM) through transcriptional suppression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and concomitant repression of its target genes MYC and MYB.<br \/>TT125-802 is a highly selective and potent, oral small molecule inhibitor of the BRD of CBP\/p300. In a BROMOscan assay against a panel of 40 BRD-containing proteins, TT125-802 revealed the unique selectivity to the BRD of CBP\/p300 with a minimal off-target binding to all other BRDs, including BET proteins.TT125-802 shows selective anti-proliferative activity in AR-dependent prostate cancer cell lines (22Rv-1, C4-2, and LNCaP) and inhibits AR target gene expression (KLK2, KLK3, TMPRSS2, and MYC) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 of 2 to 33 nM). AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines (DU-145 and PC-3) are insensitive to TT125-802 in vitro, pointing to an AR-selective mode of action. In an <i>in vivo<\/i> model of CRPC, TT125-802 inhibited tumor growth when administered orally to human C4-2 xenograft-bearing mice. Daily dosing of TT125-802 was well tolerated with stable bodyweights and platelet counts. In addition, preclinical studies in CRPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-bearing mice showed that the combination treatment of TT125-802 and enzalutamide had a synergistic effect on tumor growth inhibition compared to single agent treatments. TT125-802 reduced mRNA expression of the AR-target genes in tumor samples and decreased plasma PSA levels compared to enzalutamide alone, and the combination reduced levels even further. In a preclinical model of MM (OPM2), TT125-802 had a dose-dependent effect on tumor growth, inducing tumor regressions at the highest dose. Target genes such as MYC, MYB, and IRF4 were potently downregulated in tumors. We conclude that TT125-802 is a novel, highly selective inhibitor of the BRD of CBP\/P300. It has therapeutic potential as monotherapy in prostate cancer and multiple myeloma and in combination with next-generation AR inhibitors for patients with lethal prostate cancer. A FIH study of TT125-802 in cancer patients is on track to start in 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bromodomain,Epigenetics,Multiple myeloma,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sara Laudato<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Dorothea Gruber<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Bohnacker<sup><\/sup>, Martin Schwill<sup><\/sup>, Charles-Henry Fabritius<sup><\/sup>, Raquel Herrador<sup><\/sup>, Katrin Westritschnig<sup><\/sup>, Thushara Pattupara<sup><\/sup>, Vikram Ayinampudi<sup><\/sup>, Stefanie Flückiger-Mangual<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>TOLREMO Therapeutics AG, Muttenz, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"20c89bcd-83b3-40e0-84ff-104dcc35b19b","ControlNumber":"4522","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Recently, dysregulation of the splicing machinery has been identified to be one of the therapeutic vulnerabilities for PRMT5 inhibition in multiple cancers. Therefore, inhibitors selectively targeting PRMT5 could be of high clinical value in cancers with defects in spliceosome machinery. In this regard, we are developing a series of novel substrate competitive PRMT5 inhibitors to target brain cancer and solid tumors with brain metastasis.<br \/>Methods: Structure based drug design was used to identify novel PRMT5 inhibitors. To assess <i>in vitro <\/i>potency, flash plate assay was used. Cell based activity was assessed by measuring the symmetrical dimethylation of SmD3, intron retention and long-term cell proliferation assays. Tumor growth inhibition was measured in orthotopic glioblastoma models in mice.<br \/>Results: Our lead PRMT5 inhibitor JBI-778 had a strong in vitro potency against PRMT5 where the EC<sub>50<\/sub> was ~5 nM and a similar cellular potency (&#60; 10 nM) in inhibiting symmetric dimethylation of arginine. JBI-778 showed a strong anti-proliferative activity in select Neuroblastoma, Medulloblastoma, NSCLC, and glioma cell lines where the IC<sub>50<\/sub>s ranged from 27 to 700 nM. Of note, NSCLC cell lines with mutation in the spliceosome protein RBM10 appeared to be more sensitive to JBI-778 treatment, which is consistent with enhanced retention of introns that are reported to be PRMT5 substrates including ATM, POLD and PNISR. JBI-778 showed an excellent oral bioavailability with a very high and sustained brain exposure in rodents. In U87-MG human GBM orthotopic model, oral administration of the JBI-778 resulted in strong and dose dependent efficacy with complete (~95 %) tumor growth inhibition and regression in few mice and translated into significant survival advantage. In 005 mouse GBM orthotopic model that mimics human GBM, JBI-778 showed a strong tumor growth inhibition and significantly extended survival (40 in control vs 58 days in 778 treated, p&#60;0.05). IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies conducted in rodent and non-rodent species did not detect anemia or thrombocytopenia even at higher than efficacious concentrations.<br \/>Conclusion: PRMT5 inhibitor JBI-778 is able to penetrate the brain in all animal species tested and it is highly efficacious in orthotopic glioma models. Its differentiated mechanism makes it a potential option for the treatment of gliomas and brain metastasis with a focus on patients with spliceosome mutations. IND application for JBI-778 has been approved by FDA and a FIH trial is being planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Antitumor activity,Orthotopic models,Spliceosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dhanalakshmi Sivanandhan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chandru Gajendran<sup>1<\/sup>, Naveen Sadhu M<sup>2<\/sup>, Zainuddin Mohammed<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramachandraiah Gosu<sup>3<\/sup>, Divsha Sher<sup>4<\/sup>, Shahar Mansur<sup>4<\/sup>, Dinorah Friedmann-Morvinski<sup>4<\/sup>, Sridharan Rajagopal<sup>2<\/sup>, Luca Rastelli<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Discovery Biology, Jubilant Therapeutics Inc, Bedminster, NJ,<sup>2<\/sup>Discovery Chemistry, Jubilant Therapeutics Inc, Bedminster, NJ,<sup>3<\/sup>Protein Chemistry, Jubilant Therapeutics Inc, Bedminster, NJ,<sup>4<\/sup>Sagol School of Neuroscience, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel,<sup>5<\/sup>Chief Scientific Officer, Jubilant Therapeutics Inc, Bedminster, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9d21857f-7cf3-498a-854c-17728b08d1dd","ControlNumber":"4222","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

Between 4-5% of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients harbor SMARCA4 damaging mutations or SMARCA4 homo-deletions, resulting in loss of SMARCA4 protein expression. These SMARCA4-deleted cancer cells are predicted to be highly dependent on the paralog gene SMARCA2 for their survival. Therefore, targeting SMARCA2 in SMARCA4-deleted cancers using selective SMARCA2 degraders induces synthetic lethality while sparing SMARCA4 wild type normal cells. Although the treatment of lung cancer has improved considerably in recent years with the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and specific KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> covalent inhibitors, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutations significantly co-occur in 15-17% of SMARCA4-deleted NSCLC patients and have also been shown to correlate with a worse clinical outcome. The co-occurrence of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\/SMARCA4-deletion mutations in NSCLC led us to investigate whether combining our selective SMARCA2 degraders with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> or other MAPK pathway inhibitors would demonstrate synergistic effects. To test this hypothesis, we treated SMARCA4 damaging\/low expression KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant cell lines with our SMARCA2 degraders and several KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors, in addition to SHP2 and MEK inhibitors. Robust synergy was observed with these combinations, suggesting that targeting SMARCA2 together with agents that inhibit distinct nodes of the MAPK pathway in patients with SMARCA4-deleted cancer may be a promising therapeutic strategy. To further understand the mechanisms underpinning the synergy between our SMARCA2 degraders and KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\/MAPK pathway inhibitors, we conducted RNA-seq and found unique transcriptional signatures in the synergistic combinations relative to those of either agent alone. We are currently testing if this <i>in vitro<\/i> synergy with our SMARCA2 degraders extends to <i>in vivo<\/i> combination efficacy in CDX and PDX models. Furthermore, early data suggested that SMARCA4 deletion may indicate poor outcomes of ICIs in lung cancer patients. Interestingly, our SMARCA2 degraders promote the antigen presentation pathway and induce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in SMARCA4-deleted cancer cells. We are currently investigating combinations of our SMARCA2 degraders with ICIs using syngeneic mouse models and human ex-vivo approaches. In summary, our preclinical data suggest that potent and selective SMARCA2 targeted degraders may potentially improve patient outcomes when combined with therapeutic agents targeting the RAS\/MAPK pathway and\/or ICIs in SMARCA4-deleted cancers. The combination of SMARCA2 degraders with standard of care agents warrants further investigation as a potential novel, effective, and highly targeted combination approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Targeted protein degradation (TPD) ,KRAS,Combination immunotherapies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael Hulse<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Margot Elkins<sup><\/sup>, Jessica Burtell<sup><\/sup>, Komali Vykuntam<sup><\/sup>, Philip Pitis<sup><\/sup>, Liang Lu<sup><\/sup>, Kris Vaddi<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Combs<sup><\/sup>, Koichi Ito<sup><\/sup>, Peggy Scherle<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Prelude Therapeutics, Wilmington, DE","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"48f070e3-74f2-442f-ad5c-315e29cf561f","ControlNumber":"4997","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

The PRMT5-MTAP collateral vulnerability describes the accumulation of the metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA) in tumor cells (as a result of the deletion of the <i>MTAP<\/i> gene), which acts as a natural endogenous partial inhibitor of PRMT5. This provides an opportunity to selectively inhibit PRMT5 in <i>MTAP<\/i> deleted tumors, which occurs in ~15% of all cancers. First generation PRMT5 inhibitors, which cannot discriminate between MTAP-proficient normal cells and MTAP-deficient tumor cells, have a narrow therapeutic index which may limit clinical efficacy due to on-target toxicity. MTAP-selective PRMT5 inhibitors spare MTAP-proficient normal cells, improving therapeutic index and clinical efficacy. We have developed a novel MTAP-selective PRMT5 inhibitor, AZ-PRMT5i-1, that selectively targets MTAP-deficient tumors and spares MTAP-proficient tissue.<br \/>Methods: In vitro activity of AZ-PRMT5i-1 was profiled using six MTAP isogenic cell lines, as well as in a panel of 300 cancer cell lines. In vivo efficacy was assessed using three MTAP deleted models and hematological toxicity was addressed using a 3D human bone marrow model.<br \/>Results: Using a <i>MTAP<\/i> CRISPR KO isogenic pair we demonstrate potent inhibition of SDMA in MTAP-null tumors with a 54-fold margin over the MTAP wildtype (WT) counterpart. MTAP differential activity was maintained in proliferation assays across a number of MTAP isogenic cell lines and in a panel of 300 cancer cell lines. AZ-PRMT5i-1 demonstrates strong dose dependent efficacy across <i>MTAP<\/i> deleted xenograft and PDX models of gastric and lung origin, where greater than 80% of tumor growth inhibition was detected, with no apparent toxicity. In addition, corresponding dose-dependent inhibition of SDMA is observed in the treated tumors. In an <i>in vitro<\/i> 28-day 3D human bone marrow model, AZ-PRMT5i-1 has reduced toxicity in erythroid and megakaryocyte cell lineages, compared to a first generation PRMT5 inhibitor.<br \/>Conclusion: Overall, these studies demonstrate that AZ-PRMT5i-1 is a potent PRMT5 inhibitor demonstrating MTAP selectivity and anti-tumor activity in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> pre-clinical models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Small molecule inhibitor,Methylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  T.

In MPNs, bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins can bind to acetylated chromatin to regulate the activity of transcription factors such as NF-kB, leading to overproduction of inflammatory cytokines. Dysregulation of transcriptional gene expression can drive disease defining characteristics, therefore, targeting BET proteins could be an attractive therapeutic approach. In preclinical models, BET inhibitors decreased inflammatory cytokine production and restored hematopoietic cell differentiation. Combination of BET inhibitors with the JAK1\/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, resulted in further reduction in cytokine production and bone marrow fibrosis (Kleppe M. <i>Cancer Cell<\/i> 2018). Here, we investigate a novel, orally bioavailable BET inhibitor, INCB057643, for the treatment of MPN in combination with ruxolitinib. INCB057643 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the BET family. In binding assays, INCB057643 selectively inhibited both BRD4 bromodomains, BD1 and BD2, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 39 nM and 6 nM, respectively. INCB057643 comparably inhibited both NF-kB reporter activity and <i>MYC<\/i> protein levels. Nascent transcript analysis on the JAK2 V617F-mutant cell line SET2 showed decreased transcription of genes linked to inflammation, alone and in combination with ruxolitinib. These data suggest that INCB057643 and ruxolitinib can be used in combination to effectively suppress the pathogenic gene program driving chronic inflammation. Functionally, INCB057643 inhibited proliferation of SET2 cells at nanomolar concentrations. In a SET2 xenograft model, combination of INCB057643 and ruxolitinib potently inhibited tumor growth. Similarly, in the MPLW515L-driven MPN mouse model, INCB057643 in combination with ruxolitinib resulted in a greater reduction in spleen volume, compared to that achieved with single agent treatment. Meso scale discovery assays on MPN-patient-derived CD34<sup>+<\/sup> cells and whole blood using INCB057643 showed inhibition of NF-kB-mediated production of cytokines such as IL-8. In addition, flow cytometry-based analysis on MPN-patient-derived CD34<sup>+<\/sup> cells showed that INCB057643 in combination with ruxolitinib decreased pathogenic megakaryopoiesis, and increased terminal erythroid differentiation. Our data demonstrate that the combination of the BET inhibitor, INCB057643, with ruxolitinib can restore normal hematopoietic differentiation, reduce inflammatory gene expression, and inhibit pathogenic cell differentiation in preclinical models of MPN. INCB057643 is currently being evaluated in clinical studies as monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with MPN.<br \/><b>Acknowledgments:<\/b> Michelle Pusey and Gaurang Trivedi contributed equally to this study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BET inhibitor,MPN,INCB057643,ruxolitinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Michelle Pusey<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Gaurang Trivedi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bob Collins<sup>1<\/sup>, Nina Zolotarjova<sup>1<\/sup>, Pat Feldman<sup>1<\/sup>, Monica Bomber<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacob Ellis<sup>2<\/sup>, Kristy Stengel<sup>3<\/sup>, Cynthia Timmers<sup>1<\/sup>, Hamza Celik<sup>1<\/sup>, Matt Stubbs<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeff Jackson<sup>1<\/sup>, Scott Hiebert<sup>2<\/sup>, Susan Wee<sup>1<\/sup>, Sunkyu Kim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, DE,<sup>2<\/sup>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN,<sup>3<\/sup>Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6e643b08-9f66-4165-8577-96509669f7b6","ControlNumber":"5067","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Previous studies have reported correlation between EZH2 and cancer progression with overexpression and mutations in various cancers. EZH1, homolog of EZH2, also has been known to role in development and progression of cancers by complementarily replacing EZH2. In recent researches, EZH1\/2 dual inhibition showed global epigenetic modification on histone methylation and acetylation. Also, cancers associated with change in epigenetic factors such as mutations in subunit of SWI\/SNF responded on EZH1\/2 dual inhibition. Therefore, EZH1\/2 dual inhibition is expected to be an effective strategy for cancer treatment. Herein, we present a novel potent EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor, DW91170, as a promising candidate for treatment of lymphoma with improved anti-cancer activity. DW91170 selectively inhibited EZH1 and EZH2 enzyme activity. DW91170 brought about histone modification by reducing tri-methylation and enhancing acetylation of H3K27, which increased expression of target genes and cell cycle arrest was confirmed by treatment of DW91170. DW91170 showed effective tumor growth inhibition in two types of EZH2 hot spot mutation models. In Pfeiffer (A677 mutation) and WSU-DLCL2 (Y641 mutation) CDX models, DW91170 showed improved tumor regression activity with no significant abnormal signs such as weight loss. In order to verify the potential of DW91170 in R\/R-lymphoma patients, the anti-cancer effect was evaluated in Rituximab-resistant cell line and R\/R-DLBCL patient-derived PDX model. As a result, DW91170 efficiently inhibited Rituximab-resistant cell proliferation and suppressed tumor growth in R\/R-DLBCL PDX model more significantly compared to other EZH inhibitors. Moreover, DW91170 has a good absorption profile that works in a physiological condition. Taken together, we demonstrated that DW91170, a dual epigenetic regulator of EZH1 and EZH2, showed great anti-tumor activities in various lymphoma cell lines and animal models such as CDX and PDX. We are currently trying to expand indication into solid tumor to find a targetable population in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EZH2,Epigenetics,Lymphoma,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Doc-Gyun Jeong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Woon Heo<sup><\/sup>, DongHyuk Shin<sup><\/sup>, Yeonkyung Oh<sup><\/sup>, Sangho Lee<sup><\/sup>, Seongsu Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Whuijung Park<sup><\/sup>, Jiyoung Woo<sup><\/sup>, Chanseok Jeon<sup><\/sup>, Subin Kim<sup><\/sup>, Jaekyung Lim<sup><\/sup>, Yun-Ha Hwang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Dong Wha Pharm, Yongin, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d843d952-4c19-401c-92d2-dba470178430","ControlNumber":"5469","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

However, it has been more challenging to identify orally bioavailable TPD molecules due to the physicochemical properties of the large molecules and narrow structure-activity relationship (SAR) compared to conventional small molecule inhibitors. In the present study, we identified orally active TPD molecules that selectively and potently degrade SMARCA2 protein and induce synthetic lethality in SMARCA4-deficient cancer cells. SMARCA2 (BRM) and SMARCA4 (BRG1) are the two mutually exclusive catalytic core subunits of SWI\/SNF complexes that play an important role in controlling gene expression by remodeling chromatin. The complexes are mutated in more than 20% of human cancers and subsets of solid tumors lose expression of SMARCA4 protein due to damaging mutations or gene deletion. The SMARCA4-deficient cancer cells are highly dependent on the paralog gene SMARCA2 for their survival and thus SMARCA2 has been suggested as an attractive therapeutic target for patients with SMARCA4-deficient cancers. We have recently identified SMARCA2 selective degraders that demonstrate oral bioavailability in mice with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and acceptable DMPK and safety profiles in rodent studies. These SMARCA2 degraders show 50 to 300-fold DC<sub>50<\/sub> selectivity for SMARCA2 over SMARCA4 in our cellular assays. When pre-treated with a proteasome inhibitor or neddylation inhibitor, the degradation of SMARCA2 was rescued, confirming that the degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway. These TPD molecules inhibit only SMARCA4-deficient cancer cell proliferation (NCI-H838, NCI-H1693, HT1080 SMARCA4 KO) with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 3-10 nM, but not SMARCA4 WT cells (Calu-6, NCI-H520, HT1080 WT). Oral administration of our SMARCA2 degraders resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition of SMARCA4-deficient lung cancer xenografts at well tolerated doses. The treated tumor tissues show robust SMARCA2 protein reduction for more than 72h post dosing, consistent with the SMARCA2 degradation kinetics-based pharmacodynamic prediction model. In summary, our orally bioavailable SMARCA2 degraders induce synthetic lethality in SMARCA4-deficient cancers <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Efforts to further evaluate these compounds in additional models and in combination with other agents are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Targeted protein degradation (TPD) ,Synthetic lethality,SMARCA2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Koichi Ito<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Artem Shvartsbart<sup><\/sup>, Joseph Rager<sup><\/sup>, Anjana Agarwal<sup><\/sup>, Michael Hulse<sup><\/sup>, Komali Vykuntam<sup><\/sup>, Min Wang<sup><\/sup>, Justin Kurian<sup><\/sup>, Miles Cowart<sup><\/sup>, Joy Cote<sup><\/sup>, Monisha Sivakumar<sup><\/sup>, Jack Carter<sup><\/sup>, Jessica Burtell<sup><\/sup>, Alex Grego<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Moore<sup><\/sup>, Neha Bhagwat<sup><\/sup>, Stefan Ruepp<sup><\/sup>, Tom Emme<sup><\/sup>, Liang Lu<sup><\/sup>, Philip Pitis<sup><\/sup>, Corey Basch<sup><\/sup>, Klare Bersch<sup><\/sup>, Song Mei<sup><\/sup>, Raul Leal<sup><\/sup>, John Rose<sup><\/sup>, Danielle Roth<sup><\/sup>, Ganfeng Cao<sup><\/sup>, Kris Vaddi<sup><\/sup>, Sandy Geeganage<sup><\/sup>, Bruce Ruggeri<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Combs<sup><\/sup>, Peggy Scherle<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Prelude Therapeutics, Wilmington, DE","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f2088a71-f12e-4b0f-b90e-ea216d40bf4c","ControlNumber":"5252","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

A structure-based drug discovery effort led to the identification of CTS2190 that showed single-digit nanomolar enzymatic inhibitory activity on type I PRMTs. Here, we report the development and preclinical characterization of CTS2190, a potent, orally bioavailable small molecule type I PRMT inhibitor. CTS2190 demonstrated strong cellular proliferation inhibitory activity in a large, diverse panel of human hematological and solid tumor cell lines across several lineages. <i>In vivo<\/i>, oral CTS2190 administration once daily resulted in tumor regression in a variety of xenograft (both CDX and PDX) models across different lineages with good tolerance. The anti-tumor activity was dose-dependent and correlated with the inhibition of type I PRMT activity as measured by decrease in ADMA and increase in MMA. In summary, CTS2190 is a promising type I PRMT inhibitor and clinical trial is underway to explore the proof-of-concept anti-tumor benefit for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Epigenetics,PRMT,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hui Shi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xingnian Fu<sup>1<\/sup>, Qiugeng Ouyang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiaxin Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yiqin Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Youzhen Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Guoliang Xu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuan Mi<sup>1<\/sup>, Haiping Wu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>CytosinLab Therapeutics, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ac94a6a0-577f-41db-9717-f9beacf1fdae","ControlNumber":"4381","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

The prevalence of m6A and the activity and expression of METTL3 have been linked to the appearance and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)1. EPICS has discovered and optimized a small molecule inhibitor of METTL3 (&#8220;M3i&#8221;). M3i was shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of METTL3 (IC50 = 2 nM, SPA assay) and inhibit the presence of intracellular m6A in a cell-based assay (IC50 = 8 nM, Calu6). The anti-proliferative effects of METTL3 was demonstrated in a spheroid model (NCIH-560, IC50 = 100 nM) as well as cell viability assays in various AML (Kasumi-1, IC50 = 30 nM; LEXF 41283, IC50 = 46 nM; MV-4-11, IC50 = 248 nM) and solid tumor (Calu6, IC50= 6 nM; Caov3, IC50 = 27 nM) cell lines. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a disseminated xenograft model using established systemic MV-4-11-Luc-mCh-Puro2 in female NSG mice where M3i (30 mg\/kg, i.p., QDx31 days) significantly (p&#60;0.01, relative to vehicle control) inhibited cancer progression as measured by in-life imaging in addition to flow cytometry of hCD45+ cells in bone marrow, blood and spleen; M3i had minimal effects on hematopoiesis in this model with no significant changes in RBCs, WBCs and neutrophils, but an increase in platelets (measured by IDEXX). In an orthotopic, patient-derived xenograft model of AML (LEXF 41283, intratibial implantation, female NSG mice), M3i (30 mg\/kg, i.p., QDx91 days) significantly prolonged survival (p&#60;0.01, relative to vehicle control) with a commensurate absence of hCD45+ cells following compound treatment. These results confirm that the pharmacological inhibition of METTL3 is a viable strategy for the treatment of AML and support the additional exploration of the role of METTL3 inhibitors in alternate blood cancers as well as solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,METTL3,m6A,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Graeme Fraser<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Catherine Sorlet<sup><\/sup>, Nicolas Parmentier<sup><\/sup>, Elodie Brunel<sup><\/sup>, Anne-France Hartiel<sup><\/sup>, Killian Oukoloff<sup><\/sup>, Guillaume Dutheuil<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>EPICS Therapeutics, Gosselies, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"023987e2-6f54-423c-ae09-e156b6092293","ControlNumber":"5952","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

To evaluate effects on cell proliferation, 5637 cells were treated with four doses of UNC7713 (25 nM-100 nM), and colony formation was evaluated after 10 days using crystal violet and analyzed by Fiji.

The TCGA recently revealed a plethora of genetic alterations in chromatin modifiers in HPV-negative HNSCC, including protein lysine methyltransferases which methylate lysine residues on histone tails and regulate gene expression. One of these enzymes, SUV420H1, is known to trimethylate H4K20 and is recurrently amplified in approximately 6% of HPV-negative HNSCC tumors (TCGA). It has also been found to be significantly overexpressed in multiple HNSCC cell lines compared with normal keratinocytes. This study aims to investigate whether SUV420H1 has oncogenic activity and could be a novel therapeutic target in HPV-negative HNSCC. To evaluate the effect of SUV420H1 depletion on HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines, siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed in four SUV420H1 overexpressing HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines, and MTT assays showed significantly reduced cell viability by approximately 80-90% after 12 days of siRNA treatment. Colony formation assays, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assays are ongoing, and these assays are planned in SUV420H1 CRISPR KO cell lines. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis in 434 HPV-negative HNSCC tumors (TCGA) showed significant enrichment of immune signatures, EMT, cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. Ongoing experiments aim to investigate the effects of SUV420H1 knockdown on the global histone methylome, and to identify direct downstream targets of SUV420H1 through combined genome-wide mapping of SUV420H1 using CUT&#38;RUN assays and RNA-seq in HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines. Syngeneic and xenograft mouse models are also planned to evaluate the effect of SUV420H1 depletion on flank tumor growth in vivo. These studies may elucidate the oncogenic effects and mechanisms of SUV420H1, and may provide evidence to support SUV420H1 as a potential novel target in the treatment of HPV-negative HNSCC tumors with SUV420H1 amplification or overexpression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Head and neck cancers,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arfa Moshiri<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Sohyoung Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Vassiliki Saloura<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Thoracic and GI Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Collaboration Core, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, Bethesda, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e118efb3-0965-4fde-b121-1f65c1c8effa","ControlNumber":"7504","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Co-occurrence of mutations in chromatin\/transcriptional regulators, including DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, RUNX1 and TP53, creates the dysregulated transcriptome, which is responsible for the increased growth, survival and therapy-refractoriness in MPN blastic phase (BP). Treatment with JAK inhibitors (JAKis), e.g., ruxolitinib, venetoclax and hypomethylating agents are ineffective in improving survival in MPN-BP. CDK7 is the crucial catalytic component of the general transcript initiation factors TFIIH, which is recruited to the transcription start-sites along with RNA-pol II (RNAP2) to initiate transcription. Complexed with cyclin H, CDK7 phosphorylates CDK1, 2, 4 and 6, as well as serine 5 and 7 in the C terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP2, thus facilitating transcript initiation. CDK7 also phosphorylates CDK9, which in turn phosphorylates serine 2 of the CTD of RNAP2, and phosphorylates and inactivates the negative elongation factors, thus enabling productive mRNA transcript elongation of growth and survival promoting oncogenes. In MPN-BP, these include RUNX1, Bcl-xL, MCL1, CDK4\/6, PIM1 and MYC. CRISPR-gRNA dependency-screen (DepMap) demonstrated that CDK7 is a dependency in the Advanced-AML cell lines, SET2 and HEL cells. Present studies demonstrate that treatment with ATP-competitive, covalent CDK7 inhibitors (CDK7i) SY-1365, and its clinical grade counterpart SY-5609, dose-dependently inhibits cell cycle, growth and induces lethality in SET2 and HEL as well as patient-derived (PD), CD34+ MPN-sAML cells. ChIP-Seq analysis showed that SY-1365 treatment caused log2 fold-reduction in p-Ser2-RNAP2 occupancy on the DNA of MYC, PIM1 and MCL1 genes in HEL cells. RNA-Seq analysis showed that SY1365 treatment caused negative enrichment of gene-sets of MYC and E2F targets, as well as inflammatory response, IL6-JAK-STAT3 and mTORC1 signaling. SY-1365 treatment also dose-dependently depleted protein expressions of p-Ser5 RNAP2, p-Ser2 RNAP2, c-Myc, c-Myb, RUNX1, PU.1, MCL1 and Bcl-xL, while inducing cleavage of PARP protein. As compared to the parental JAKi-sensitive, in vitro generated JAKi-persister\/resistant (P\/R) SET2\/RuxP cells were significantly more sensitive to SY-1365-induced apoptosis. Co-treatment with CDK7i and ruxolitinib or the BET inhibitor OTX015 was synergistically lethal in PD MPN-BP cells (n=7). In an aggressive xenograft model of HEL-GFP\/Luc cells in NSG mice, compared to the vehicle control, monotherapy with SY5609 significantly reduced the MPN sAML burden and improved survival of the NSG mice without causing host toxicity. These findings demonstrate promising activity and support the rationale to further evaluate the in vivo efficacy of CDK7i-based combinations against advanced MPN.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK7,Acute myeloid leukemia,Myc,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher  P.

The canonical core of PRC1 responsible for its E3 ligase activity is a heterodimeric unit comprised of RING1B and BMI1. Emerging data implicates RING1B in various cancers and highlights the importance of PRC1 function in the maintenance and proliferation of leukemic stem cells. Studies demonstrate that loss of PRC1 activity through <i>RING1B<\/i> knockdown impairs leukemic stem cell proliferation, causes leukemic stem cell differentiation, and enhances survival in MLL-AF9 mouse models. Therefore, development of potent small molecules targeting the activity of PRC1 might offer a new approach for generating new therapeutics for leukemia.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Here, we report the discovery and development of the first-in-class small-molecule inhibitors directly binding to RING1B in PRC1. We performed an NMR-based fragment screen against RING1B-BMI1, identifying fragment hit, RB-1, with low-millimolar binding affinity. RB-1 was extensively optimized into a class of inhibitors with considerably enhanced binding affinity to the low-nanomolar range. These inhibitors have been shown to diminish the H2A ubiquitination activity of PRC1 E3 ligase cores. Structural studies revealed that our PRC1 inhibitors bind directly to the RING domain of RING1B and ultimately block the protein-protein interaction between RING1B and the nucleosome. In leukemic cell lines and primary AML samples, PRC1 inhibitor treatment elicits an anti-proliferative effect on cell growth and displays on-target action seen by the reduction of the H2A ubiquitination mark. Additionally, small-molecule inhibition of PRC1 results in the induction of cellular differentiation of leukemic cells, as well as apoptosis. Gene expression analysis in leukemic cells treated with our PRC1 inhibitors reveals upregulation of multiple genes that are repressed by PRC1, which is also supported by the displacement of PRC1 from chromatin assessed by CHIP-seq studies. Furthermore, our PRC1 inhibitors are active <i>in vivo<\/i> in mouse models of leukemia, demonstrating reduction of leukemia progression upon treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We developed first-in class inhibitors directly targeting the E3 ligase core of PRC1. Treatment with our PRC1 inhibitors in leukemic cells elicit an anti-proliferative effect, blocks ubiquitination of H2A, and results in the de-repression of many genes repressed by PRC1. Additionally, our PRC1 inhibitors elicit an anti-proliferative effect on leukemia progression <i>in vivo<\/i>, demonstrating the traction for developing anti-leukemia therapeutics that inhibit PRC1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Drug discovery,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miranda L.

Despite recent advances, the majority of patients with lung cancer still lack effective therapeutic options, underscoring the dire need for additional treatment approaches. Genomic studies have identified frequent mutations in subunits of the SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeling complex including <i>SMARCA4<\/i> and <i>ARID1A<\/i> in non-small cell lung cancer with a frequency of up to 33% in advanced stage disease, making it the most frequently mutated complex in lung cancer. Recent reports, as well as our own data, have identified the paralogue <i>SMARCA2<\/i> to be synthetic lethal to <i>SMARCA4 <\/i>suggesting SMARCA2 is a valuable therapeutic target<i>. <\/i>However, the discovery of selective inhibitors of SMARCA2 has been challenging. To overcome this hurdle, we have utilized iterative structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to develop novel, potent and selective SMARCA2 degrading small molecules based on proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology. We demonstrated that YD23, our lead SMARCA2 PROTAC, potently and selectively induces degradation of SMARCA2. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that YD23 reduces chromatin accessibility only in <i>SMARCA4<\/i>-deficient cells with profoundly decreased chromatin accessibility at enhancer regions. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis indicated that core cell cycle genes were downregulated by YD23 and is consistent with reduced chromatin accessibility at their regulatory regions. Furthermore, integrative analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed a strong correlation between gene expression and enhancer accessibility changes by YD23. In particular, we identified the mitotic regulator NEDD9 as a critical target in enhancers that are strongly reduced by YD23 in SMARCA4-deficient lung cancer cells. In conclusion, our study provides a promising chemical probe for studying the synthetic lethal interaction between SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, dissect the chromatin and epigenetic landscape alterations and lay the foundation for future preclinical and clinical development of SMARCA2 degraders as therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Lung cancer,Chromatin remodeling,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sasi Kotagiri<sup><\/sup>, <b>Nicholas Blazanin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yuanxin Xi<sup><\/sup>, Jing Wang<sup><\/sup>, Yonathan Lissanu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Ctr., Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"932f09fe-4fa3-4d82-9ef9-a09dc2e74202","ControlNumber":"7050","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), high LSD1 expression is associated with suppressed differentiation pathways. Although selective LSD1 compounds are in clinical development, understanding of the molecular markers of tumor sensitivity to inhibition of LSD1 inhibition is incomplete.Methods: We report on the pharmacological characterization of EXS-74539, a potent, selective and reversible LSD1 inhibitor. We assessed EXS-74539 efficacy in in vitro and in vivo SCLC cell line models, encompassing the four molecular subtypes of SCLC tumor cells previously proposed (Rudin et al, 2019), based on differential expression of key transcription regulators, ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 and YAP1. Results: In vitro, EXS-74539 demonstrated similar anti-proliferative activity against both neuroendocrine (NCI-H1417 and NCI-H69, ASCL1 sub-type) and non-neuroendocrine (NCI-H526: POU2F3) SCLC cell lines, with IC50 values of 28, 12 and 11 nM, respectively. In vitro exposure of these cell lines to EXS-74539 led to concentration-dependent alterations in differentiation-associated genes. However, in vivo, significant differences in antitumor growth response upon LSD1 inhibition were observed between the cell lines; NCI-H69 tumor growth was unaffected following treatment with EXS-74539 and an irreversible LSD1 inhibitor at dose regimens which were efficacious in the NCI-H1417 and NCI-H5126 models. We describe in vitro and in vivo gene expression correlations associated with LSD1 sensitivity. Conclusions: The reversible LSD1 inhibitor, EXS-74539, is a potent inhibitor of SCLC cell line proliferation and shows in vivo efficacy. Characterizing SCLC cell line sensitivity in vitro and in vivo identified gene signatures that may have use as markers of sensitivity, which we are currently characterizing and validating in human SCLC patient samples.Rudin et al., Nat Rev Cancer, 2019","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LSD1,Small molecule inhibitor,Lung cancer: small cell,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew Payne<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Manisha Naik<sup><\/sup>, Simon Richards<sup><\/sup>, Victor Sebastian Perez<sup><\/sup>, Maria Dominguez<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Exscientia, Oxford, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1860e672-2f30-4057-976f-e2fa4a8e80f0","ControlNumber":"6892","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.
