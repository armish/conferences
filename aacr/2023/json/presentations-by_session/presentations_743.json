Sialoglycans are immune suppressive and promote tumor immune evasion by binding to sialoglycan receptors (e.g. Siglecs) expressed on immune cells. However, redundant immune cell expression among Siglecs has posed a challenge for receptor-targeting therapeutic approaches. E-602 is a first-in-class fusion protein of engineered human sialidase (Neu2) and a human IgG1 Fc region. The dimeric sialidase moieties of E-602 circumvent the redundancy of this biology by directly cleaving terminal sialic acid residues from sialoglycans on immune and tumor cells. In preclinical studies, E-602 enhanced immune function by augmenting antigen-specific priming and activation of T cells and restoring function of exhausted-like T cells, and E-602 demonstrated antitumor activity as monotherapy in multiple mouse tumor models.<br \/>Methods: A Phase 1\/2 first-in-human dose escalation study is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and antitumor activity of E-602 in patients with advanced cancers. Eligible patients with select advanced solid tumors were treated with E-602 IV once weekly at dose levels between 1 and 30 mg\/kg. Circulating immune cells were analyzed for changes in sialylation and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. Changes in circulating cytokines were measured by immunoassays.<br \/>Results: As of January 6, 2023, 32 patients were treated with at least one dose of E-602. The most common tumors treated were colorectal (n=18) and pancreatic (n=6). Doses up to 30 mg\/kg were tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. The most frequent adverse event was infusion-related reactions which were primarily grade 1-2 and clinically manageable. PK was linear across the evaluated dose range with an estimated T1\/2 of 9-24 hours. Dose dependent PD observations included (1) desialylation of peripheral CD8+ T, CD4+ T, and NK cells, remaining detectable in some patients at 7 days post-dose; (2) increases in the immune activation marker, CD69, on peripheral CD8+ T, CD4+ T, and NK cells; and (3) increases in the IFN&#947;-dependent chemokine CXCL10, TNF-&#945;, and MIP1-&#946;. Thus far, response-evaluable patients have had stable or progressive disease. Additional safety, PK, PD, and clinical outcomes for other patients treated as part of backfill at multiple dose levels will be reported at the meeting.<br \/>Conclusion: E-602 is tolerated at doses up to 30 mg\/kg. Consistent with preclinical findings, dose-dependent desialylation and immune system activation were observed. Based on the observed tolerability and PD effects, the Phase 2 portion of the study to evaluate clinical activity of E-602 monotherapy in patients with checkpoint-inhibitor resistant NSCLC and melanoma will proceed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glycosylation,Immunotherapy,T cell,Sialidase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jason J.

Following significant anti-tumor responses during preclinical study in multiple tumor models; a Phase I trial in humans found a <u>single dose<\/u> to be not toxic and elevated the Natural Killer T cell populations in patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Additionally, a Phase I <u>multiple dose<\/u> trial in companion dogs with metastatic osteosarcoma demonstrated a 22% complete response rate. A Phase II trial was performed studying the addition of Salmonella-IL2 to standard of care chemotherapy for stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Patients and Methods: <\/b>A Health Canada and local IRB approved, non-randomized, two-arm study in patients with Stage 4 metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is currently underway. The goal is to recruit 30 patients per arm; Arm 1: Salmonella-IL2 with FOLFIRINOX and Arm 2: Salmonella-IL2 with Gemcitabine\/Abraxane. The primary outcome is overall survival with secondary outcomes of response determined by CT imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria and biomarker data. Outcomes were compared to patients with stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer administered FOLFIRINOX (n=37) or Gemcitabine\/Abraxane (n=24) from 4 years prior to starting this trial (2016-2020) at the study site and to historical controls from the published literature. Salmonella-IL2 is orally administered concomitantly with the administration of the prescribed chemotherapy according to arm of enrollment. 10<sup>9<\/sup> cfu of attenuated Salmonella-IL2 was administered orally after ingestion of a gastric acid neutralizing agent and followed with 200ml of an isotonic crystalloid fluid.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Results: <\/b>A total of 28 patients have been enrolled into this clinical trial. 20 patients were administered Salmonella-IL2 orally every 2 weeks with FOLFIRINOX; mean age 59.4 (32-73) years; 12(60%) women, and 8 (40%) men. 8 patients were administered Salmonella-IL2 with Gemcitabine\/Abraxane every 2\/3 weeks; mean age is 68.8 (56-82); 6 (66.7%) women and 3 (33.3%) men. Median survival in the FOLFIRINOX arm was 24 months compared to 11.1 months in published historical controls and 13.1 months site specific controls (n=37) (P&#60;0.05; Log Rank Test). In addition, CT imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria demonstrated a 73% partial response rate compared to 31% in historical controls. There have been 24 serious adverse events; none of which have been attributed to the study drug. No survival advantage was observed in the Salmonella-IL2 with Gemcitabine\/Abraxane arm.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Addition of Salmonella-IL2 to FOLFIRINOX for stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer results in the near doubling of median survival when compared to historical and site-specific controls receiving FOLFIRNOX only.

Mutant KRAS (mKRAS) is an oncogenic driver found in approximately 90% of PDAC that has emerged as a target for neoantigen-specific vaccination.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This is a single-arm, open-label, first-in-human phase I study of a pooled synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccine targeting six mKRAS subtypes (G12D, G12R, G12V, G12A, G12C, G13D) combined with ipilimumab\/nivolumab (ipi\/nivo) in patients with resected PDAC (NCT04117087). Key inclusion criteria: presence of a vaccine-targeted KRAS mutation, disease-free status after completing adjuvant chemotherapy within 6 months of enrollment. Priming phase: mKRAS vaccine given on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 along with ipi 1 mg\/kg every 6 weeks for 2 doses and nivo 3 mg\/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Boost phase: mKRAS vaccine given on weeks 13, 21, 29, 37, and 45 along with nivo 480 mg every 4 weeks for 10 doses. Co-primary endpoints: safety, mKRAS-specific T cell response. Secondary endpoints: disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>At the time of data cutoff (December 1, 2022), 11 patients were treated with a median follow-up time of 10.7 months. 8\/11 patients achieved a mKRAS-specific T cell response, defined as &#62;5-fold change in IFN-gamma-producing mKRAS-specific T cells within 17 weeks post-vaccination, as assessed by serial ELISpot. The median fold change in IFN-gamma-producing mKRAS-specific T cells within 17 weeks post-vaccination was 10.2 (range: 1.5-686.3). The majority of all adverse events were grade 1 (79.5%) or grade 2 (15.2%) in severity per NCI CTCAE v5.0. Four grade 3 immune-related adverse events (pneumonitis, adrenal insufficiency, arthralgias, myalgias) and discontinuation of checkpoint blockade occurred in 2\/11 patients.

However, NIVO + IPI resulted in more durable responses and higher 24-month OS rates vs chemo. We present exploratory biomarker analyses of NIVO + IPI vs chemo.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was derived from whole exome sequencing of baseline tumor tissue and matching blood. TMB-high (TMB-H) was defined as &#8805; 199 mutations\/exome. Gene expression signatures (GES), including 12-gene chemokine, 2-gene regulatory T cell (Treg), 15-gene fibroblast, and 5-gene endothelial, were assessed via RNA sequencing of baseline tumor tissue. GES subgroups were defined by signature score tertiles.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 813 patients were randomized to receive NIVO + IPI or chemo; 366 were evaluable for TMB (NIVO + IPI 45%, chemo 45%), and 402 were evaluable for GES (NIVO + IPI 49%, chemo 50%). OS HR for NIVO + IPI vs chemo was numerically lower in the TMB-H (6% of evaluable patients, HR 0.31) vs TMB-low (94% of evaluable patients, HR 0.87) subgroup (<b>Table<\/b>). Multiple GES subgroups showed OS benefit with NIVO + IPI vs chemo, including chemokine-high, Treg-high, fibroblast-low, and endothelial-low subgroups (<b>Table<\/b>). Additional analysis on microsatellite instability and GES in programmed death ligand-1 combined positive score subgroups will be presented.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This exploratory analysis suggests that there are patient subgroups with GC\/GEJC\/EAC that may benefit from dual immune checkpoint blockade. Clinical utility of these biomarkers should be prospectively validated in future trials.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{B5B28E03-575E-498E-9E88-E0AD3EBEE898}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\"><b>Overall survival<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><b>All randomized patients<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\">0.89 (0.77-1.03)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>All evaluable <\/b>HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>High, n (%) <\/b>HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Medium, n (%) <\/b>HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Low, n (%) <\/b>HR (95% CI)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>TMB (n = 366)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.81 (0.65-1.00)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21 (6) 0.31 (0.10-0.95)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">345 (94) 0.87 (0.70-1.09)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>GES (n = 402)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Chemokine<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.82 (0.67-1.01)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.59 (0.40-0.86)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.92 (0.65-1.32)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.98 (0.68-1.40)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Treg<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.59 (0.41-0.86)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.91 (0.64-1.30)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 1.07 (0.75-1.52)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Fibroblast<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.98 (0.69-1.40)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.94 (0.66-1.35)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.63 (0.43-0.91)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Endothelial<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.97 (0.68-1.38)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.94 (0.65-1.34)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">134 (33) 0.65 (0.45-0.94)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\">OS HR data are unstratified for NIVO + IPI vs chemo.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Combination therapy,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yelena Y.

Further, we performed molecular characterisation with whole exome and transcriptomic sequencing to identify the determinants of response.<b> <\/b>In this single-arm, phase 2 trial (NCT#03798106), we enrolled patients with metastatic and\/or recurrent STS who had received up to two previous lines of systemic anticancer therapy and had at least one measurable lesion. Treatment consisted of pazopanib 800 mg orally, administered once a day, continuously, and durvalumab 1500 mg administered via intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate.<b> <\/b>Between September 2019 and October 2020, fourteen (30.5%) of the 46 evaluable patients showed an objective response, including in alveolar soft-part sarcoma, angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumour. During a median follow-up period of 18.4 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.7 months (95% confidence interval: 5.7-10.4). The common treatment-related adverse events of grades 3-4 included neutropenia (n = 9), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (n = 7) and alanine aminotransferase (n = 5) levels, and thrombocytopenia (n = 4). In the exploratory analysis, the B lineage signature was a significant key determinant of overall response (<i>P<\/i>=0.014). In situ analysis also showed that tumours with high CD20<sup>+<\/sup> B cell infiltration and vessel density had a longer PFS than those with low B cell infiltration and vessel density (<i>P<\/i>=6.5&#215;10<sup>-4<\/sup>)<b> <\/b>as well as better response <b>(<\/b>50% <i>vs<\/i> 12%,<b> <\/b><i>P<\/i>=0.019). In conclusion, durvalumab combined with pazopanib demonstrated promising efficacy in an unselected STS cohort, with a manageable toxicity profile. Our findings provide insights into combined high B cell infiltration and vessel density as potentially relevant biomarkers for the selection of patients who may benefit to a greater extent from PD-L1 blockade and VEGF inhibitor combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hee Jin Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kum-Hee Yun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Su-Jin Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Han Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung Hyun Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wooyeol Baek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoon Dae Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sang Kyum Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>JooHee Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iksung Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heounjeong Go<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiwon Ko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inkyung Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Kyung Jeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyang Joo Ryu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun Young Rha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Hyo Song Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyun Jung Jun<\/i><\/presenter>.

Similarly promising clinical benefit has been seen with this combination in patients with immunotherapy-resistant melanoma, prompting ongoing Phase2\/Phase3 trials in both melanoma (NCT05061134) and NSCLC (NCT05450692). Preliminary preclinical data showed that ceralasertib can modulate innate and adaptive immunity; here we extend these findings in the peripheral blood of HUDSON patients.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Longitudinal blood samples were collected at baseline, on-therapy samples after 7 days of ceralasertib alone and after durvalumab treatment to evaluate gene expression analyzed using a linear mixed effects model, and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing were analyzed using paired Wilcoxon analyses.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Matched pre- and on-treatment blood samples were available for analysis from 48 patients for gene expression analysis and 62 patients for TCR repertoire sequencing. Gene expression analysis revealed dynamic, reversible changes upon ceralasertib treatment for 7 days (prior to durvalumab). Consistent with pre-clinical data, changes in innate and adaptive immunity-relevant signatures such as monocyte lineage (adjusted p-value [p.adj]=1.1e-23), cytotoxic (p.adj=7.4e-04), exhausted T-cell signatures (p.adj=1.5e-05) and increases in the IFN&#947; response (p.adj=2.0e-03), IFN&#945; response (p.adj=3.7e-05), and TNF&#945; signaling (p.adj=2.3e-13) signatures were seen, which reverted to baseline levels after ceralasertib followed by durvalumab treatment. Longitudinal TCR sequencing demonstrated similar cyclical changes, most notably reductions in clonality after ceralasertib treatment for 7 days (p=1.1e-06), with a return to baseline after ceralasertib followed by durvalumab treatment. An increase in peripheral TCR clonality was observed in most patients (n=48\/58) after the addition of durvalumab, followed by an increase in expanded (p=3.29e-13) and newly detected expanded TCR clones (p=1e-15). The net result of TCR changes after ceralasertib followed by durvalumab treatment was an overall increase in clonality in most patients, without a significant difference in the composition of the most abundant T-cell clones, as measured by the Morisita index.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: We found that ceralasertib, combined with durvalumab treatment in relapsed\/refractory NSCLC patients, decreased signatures associated with exhausted T-cells and, conversely, increased interferon pathway activation. Furthermore, we observed an expansion and maintenance of abundant T-cell clones indicative of an anti-tumor response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,HUDSON study,Ceralasertib,ATR inhibition,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sonia Iyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Conway<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deanna Russell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avinash Reddy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Cosaert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Barry<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marlene Dressman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilhem Mensi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boaz Aronson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jane Peters<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helen Ambrose<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keunchil Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Forde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Besse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John V.
