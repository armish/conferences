[{"Abstract":"\u0009\u0009 \u0009 \u0009 \u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Background &#38; Aim: Aberrant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) metabolism is closely associated with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Tissue-resident memory T cell (Trm) plays a central role against solid tumors, including HCC, depending on the uptake of exogenous fatty acids to maintain survival and anti-tumor immunity. Here we aimed to explore the potential interaction in TME between HCC-derived PUFAs and Trm function in a series of integrated clinical, basic and translational studies.<br \/>Methods: Tissue interstitial fluids (TIFs) were isolated and analyzed from fresh paired adjacent tissues and HCC for detecting the PUFAs alterations in the HCC TME. Integrated analyses were performed in multiple public databases and local cohorts. <i>Fatty acid desaturase 1<\/i> (<i>FADS1)<\/i> knockdown (KD) HCC cell line was generated to observe the tumor biology and metabolic function. The effects of <i>FADS1<\/i> knockout (KO) or overexpression were investigated in multiple spontaneous HCC mouse models via hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HTVI) <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mutation landscape analysis was used to explore the mechanism of <i>FADS1<\/i> transcription. Therapeutic interventions by downregulating <i>FADS1<\/i> were also evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: Clinically, we found that the arachidonic acid (ARA) level was enriched in HCC TIFs. A rate-limiting enzyme controlling PUFA biosynthesis, especially ARA production from dihomo-<i>&#947;<\/i>-linolenic acid (DGLA), FADS1, was overexpressed in HCC patients. High expression of FADS1 predicted poor survival and was negatively correlated with CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup>Trm infiltration. Moreover, in the local clinical trial, we noticed that the expression of FADS1 was upregulated in non-response patients with anti-PD-1 mAb treatment. Functionally, we demonstrated that the ARA level was decreased in the conditioned medium (CM) from <i>FADS1<\/i> KD cells. Applying CM prolonged the survival of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup>Trm <i>ex vivo<\/i>. <i>FADS1<\/i> KO inhibited tumor development by increasing intratumor infiltration and function of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup>Trm. In contrast, overexpression of <i>FADS1<\/i> promoted HCC progression by restraining immune surveillance <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mechanistically, we found that the expression of <i>FADS1<\/i> was upregulated in the <i>TP53<\/i> mutation group by analyzing the mutation landscape of HCC. Mutant P53 protein could bind to the promoter region of <i>FADS1<\/i>. Therapeutically, recombinant adeno-associated 8 (rAAV8)-shRNAs delivery and anti-PD-1 mAb administration inhibited the tumor growth of anti-PD-1 mAb treatment-resistant HCC model driven by <i>CTNNB1<sup>N90<\/sup><\/i> and <i>MYC<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: We demonstrated that mutant P53 protein directly promoted <i>FADS1<\/i> transcription, increasing ARA accumulation in HCC TME. FADS1 remodeling the metabolic patterns of PUFAs impaired CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup>Trm anti-tumor immunity, possibly leading to HCC progression. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Tumor immunity,Fatty acids,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tao Ding<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Li Pang<sup>1<\/sup>, Runying Long<sup>2<\/sup>, Shinuan Zeng<sup>1<\/sup>, Kevin TP Ng<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingmei Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhiwei Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Kwan Man<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Surgery, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f18e657b-c208-47eb-a1cc-347232cae1ac","ControlNumber":"481","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

The regulation mediated by the N6methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase protein called FTO in CRC is quite controversial. As previously studied in obesity and food intake, currently is being linked to stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, chemotherapy resistance and proliferation in colon cancer cells, however, its localization and function in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and how it connects with progression remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate FTO protein in tumor and healthy corresponding tissue from 22 colorectal cancer patients with different histological TNM stages (hTNM) by immunohistochemistry and multiple immunofluorescence analysis; classifying the tumor and stromal FTO localization and associating this data with clinical and histopathological features. As for content, the frequency of FTO+ cells in stromal compartments increases in more invasive stages compared to non-tumor tissue and in tumors with low desmoplasia. Regarding to localization, FTO is mostly nuclear and present in the lamina propria cells in non-tumor tissues and in immune and fibro-immune compartments in the TME, such as T cells, cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages. In tumor cells, the percentage of FTO+ cells increase in early carcinogenic stages (hTNM I vs healthy tissue) and in moderately differentiated tumors. In addition, nuclear FTO expression increases in normal T cells and fibroblasts with a particular pattern after exposure for 24h to a colon adenocarcinoma cell-derived conditioned media, suggesting FTO activity in the TME interaction following a paracrine signal. In conclusion, the increase of the FTO protein in both tumor and stroma from CRC suggests its participation mediating TME communication.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Colorectal cancer,Molecular markers,Fat mass and obesity protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Glauben  T.

A detailed understanding of this interaction will help better understand CLL leukemic cell survival and drug resistance mechanisms.<b> <\/b> We performed RNA-seq in paired CLL B cells isolated from untreated blood and BM (n=6) and in untreated CLL B cells (n=4) cultured alone or co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) derived from either normal individuals (n=2) or CLL patients (n=2). We found upregulation of 232 and 917 genes in CLL B cells from BM and in co-cultured CLL B cells compared to the CLL B cells from the same patient&#8217;s blood and CLL B cells cultured alone respectively (p&#60;0.05, fold change &#62;1.5). However we found only 13 genes overlapped between BM CLL B cells and co-cultured CLL B cells. To explore the functional importance of these 13 genes, we analyzed the expression of these genes in CLL blood B cells from an additional 169 untreated patients by RNA-seq and found a positive relationship between 5 of these 13 genes (<i>MKI67<\/i>, <i>PNP<\/i>, <i>C16orf54<\/i>, <i>MOB3A<\/i>, <i>CDK2AP2<\/i>) with CLL patient&#8217;s clinical outcome including overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and time to first treatment (TTFT) [univariate Cox regressions analysis (UCRA) p&#60;0.05]. Out of 5 genes, purine nucleotide phosphorylase (<i>PNP<\/i>) which is an enzyme in the purine salvage pathway, showed the significant association for patient&#8217;s OS, PFS, and TTFT using UCRA [hazard ratio (HR) {95% CI}: 2.8 {1.8-4.3}, 2.7 {1.9-3.8}, 2.9 {2.0-4.2}, respectively, p&#60;.0001], suggesting purine metabolism plays an important role in BM induced CLL B cell survival. We also observed an increase in PNP protein levels in CLL B cells co-cultured with BMSCs or from BM using Western blot analysis<b>.<\/b> Untargeted metabolomic profiling (LC-MS+GC-MS) showed an increased level of purine salvage pathway metabolites adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine in co-cultured CLL B cells<b>. <\/b>Consistent with this altered nucleotide metabolism data, we also found increased pyrimidine pathway enzyme thymidylate synthase (TYMS) at RNA and protein levels in co-cultured CLL B cells and in BM CLL B cells. We further analyzed the RNA-seq data generated from the 169 CLL patients and it also showed a positive association of TYMS gene with their OS, PFS and TTFT using UCRA [HR (95% CI): 1.35 (1.0-1.8), 1.3 (1.0-1.6), 1.63 (1.3-2.1) respectively, p&#60;0.05].<b> <\/b> In conclusion,<b> <\/b>these results indicate that active purine\/ pyrimidine metabolism in CLL B cells may be augmented by the BM environment to support CLL B cell survival. Future studies to understand the exact mechanism of PNP and TYMS mediated CLL B cell survival for both untreated and treated CLL B cells will uncover unique approaches for therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sutapa Sinha<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zhiquan Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Weiguo Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Kari  G.

STAT3-mediated DNA methylation is controlled by K685 acetylation, we therefore hypothesized that distribution of acetyl-CoA could affect the role of STAT3 in DNA methylation. Here, by methylation microarray from GCA patients and cells depleted with STAT3, we identified a STAT3-related CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), located at neuronal genes (neuronal CIMP). Further TCGA RNA-Seq identified neuronal CIMP+ve to be positively associated with the expression and higher cyto\/mito ratio of acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSS2). Intriguingly, patients with neuronal-CIMP +ve or higher cyto\/mito ratio of ACSS were associated with a better survival, suggesting a different role of acetyl-STAT3. As STAT3 pathway plays a key role in chemokine response, we also analyze whether neuronal-CIMP contributes to anti-tumor immune response.

However, some tumors termed &#8220;immune excluded&#8221; recruit lymphocytes to the tumor site, but the lymphocytes are unable to penetrate the tumor parenchyma and localize primarily in the peritumoral region. In soft tissue sarcoma patients, most tumors are poorly infiltrated by T cells, which is associated with a poor response to immunotherapies. It has been described that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are enriched in immune excluded tumors and may directly block the migration of T cells via the production of dense extracellular matrix or by forging an immunosuppressive niche. We generated two models of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) that recapitulate the &#8220;immune excluded&#8221; and &#8220;inflamed&#8221; microenvironments observed in sarcoma patients. These syngeneic models rely on p53KO mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing either <i>Ccne1<\/i> or <i>Vgll3,<\/i> which are frequently amplified in UPS patients. These models differ in their overall proportion of infiltrating TILs, and specifically T cells, making them ideal for comparative studies to investigate the mechanisms driving T cell exclusion in the TME. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identified a population of CAFs expressing Nt5e, encoding CD73, which are spatially enriched in the peritumoral region of immune excluded <i>Ccne1<\/i> tumors and closely associate with CD8+ T cells located at the tumor margin. Using transwell invasion assays, we show that CD73+ CAFs but not CD73- CAFs are able to block the migration of activated T cells towards tumor cells, even in the presence of CXCL10. Further, we show that Nt5e CAFs are enriched for signatures of glucose metabolism, and hypoxia, thus we hypothesized that CD73+ CAFs may block the migration of T cells into tumors by forging a nutrient poor metabolic barrier around the tumor. To test this, we treated <i>Ccne1<\/i> tumors with BAY-876, a GLUT1 inhibitor and observed a significant accumulation of infiltrating CD8+ T cells compared to controls. GLUT1 treated CAFs expressed significantly less Nt5e, indicating that CD73 may play a role in the maintenance of glucose metabolism in CAFs. Furthermore, blockade of CD73 in CD73+ CAFs decreases the expression of the glucose transporter, Glut1. All together, these data suggest that CD73 may serve as a marker of glucose dependent CAFs that alter the metabolic niche to block T cell infiltration into tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Metabolism,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marina Broz<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Emily Ko<sup><\/sup>, Jinfen Xiao<sup><\/sup>, Marco DeSimone<sup><\/sup>, Roberta Piras<sup><\/sup>, Kristin Ishaya<sup><\/sup>, Xen Ping Hoi<sup><\/sup>, Jlenia Guarnerio<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9ab516d5-9abf-432c-acaf-2dc71535478c","ControlNumber":"5639","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

In some cases, resistance arises from pre-existing tumor heterogeneity, which allows subpopulations of drug-tolerant cells with distinct transcriptional states to survive in the presence of drug. The loss of SOX10, a lineage-specific transcription factor, is known to drive melanoma phenotype switching from a proliferative to an invasive drug-tolerant state. Here, we found that knocking out SOX10 in human and mouse melanoma cell lines leads to the upregulation of transglutaminase-2 (TGM2), a calcium-dependent cross-linking enzyme. Analysis of publicly available bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data showed that TGM2 is highly expressed in the invasive cell state in melanoma cell lines and patient-derived melanoma cultures, respectively. Furthermore, knockdown of SOX10 in patient-derived melanoma cultures increases TGM2 mRNA expression. 3D spheroid assays and extracellular matrix production\/remodeling assays showed that knockdown of TGM2 has no effect on the invasiveness of SOX10-deficient cells. However, we found that TGM2 is secreted by SOX10-deficient cells and hypothesized that it could modulate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) given that TGM2 has been associated with increased immune infiltration in melanoma patient samples. To investigate the effect of TGM2 on the TIME, we stably overexpressed TGM2\/Tgm2 in syngeneic mouse melanoma cell lines and allowed tumors to grow in immune-competent C57BL\/6 mice. As compared to empty vector, TGM2\/Tgm2-overexpression led to an increase in the percentage and number of CD4+ T cells and B cells, and a decrease in the number of myeloid cells, in the tumor immune compartment by flow cytometry analysis. Future studies will assess which subsets of CD4+ T cells and B cells infiltrate TGM2\/Tgm2-overexpressing tumors, how these changes to the TIME affect melanoma invasiveness, and if TGM2 expression affects response to targeted therapy <i>in vivo<\/i>. Overall, our data suggest that TGM2 is highly expressed in the invasive melanoma cell state, is regulated by the SOX10 transcription factor, and can modulate adaptive immune cells in the TIME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Tumor heterogeneity,Invasiveness,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Signe Caksa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole  A.

The cellular immune landscape of HCC can elucidate the tumor response and suggest the best strategy for effective T-cell responses. Ursolic acid (UA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with anti-inflammatory properties and can suppress tumor cells by oncogenic growth signaling and has known anti-inflammatory properties. To comprehend the effect of UA on the HCC immune landscape, we evaluated lymphoid cells in a syngeneic tumor model of an immunocompetent rat. The mcA-RH7777 rat cell line was implanted in Buffalo rats. The tumor size was verified with ultrasound, and rats received UA 75 mg\/Kg or extra-virgin olive oil(EVOO), UA vehicle, by oral gavage every other day for 7 and 14 days. Tumor cells were isolated and stained with CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD103, CD161, IL-17A, INFg, CD279\/PD-1, FOXP3 antibodies. Immunophenotyping by spectral cytometry was analyzed in Flow Jo Software. The partial results from 7 and 14 days demonstrated UA had the same effect as EVOO. Tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes (TIL) were increased in EVOO and UA in 7 and 14 days of treatment in comparison with untreated tumors. For 7 days group, NK-like cells were higher in UA and EVOO than untreated (p=0.004 and p=0.004), while for 14 days there is a tendency to decrease it in oil and UA treatment. CD3+CD8+ (Tc) and CD3+CD4+(Th) populations seem reduced after oil and UA treatment. Also, both populations had low expression of INFg+ in all treatments and times used. EVOO may increase the population of CD25+FOXP3+(TREG) PD-1+ cells after 14 days of oil-only treatment. CD25+FOXP3+(TREG) INFg+ after very low representation in 7 days, seems to recover to normal level after 14 days in the UA group. UA group had tumors presenting more CD3+ (p=0.0004), CD3+CD4+ (Th), and CD3+\/CD8+ (Tc) after 14 days (p=0.004 and p=0.0015 respectively). Evaluating the control rat liver (without tumor), we could see increased Th (p=0.02) and decreased Th17 cells (p=0.0002) in comparison with the liver surrounding the tumor untreated. The effect of UA was similar in the spleen. Tc (p=0.0015) and Th (p=0.0004) had a bigger population in the control and no activation of Tc and Th (INFg+) compared with the spleen of untreated tumor rats. UA in the liver and spleen, the decrease in the Th17, but not in the tumor. Maybe because tumors hadn't a consistent amount of Th17. EVOO seems to contribute to the infiltration of T cells, but not to activation of these cells. Oral gavage and olive oil may interpose the UA effect. The preliminary result using trans arterial embolization may be more effective as a combined strategy against HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Immune cells,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Flow cytometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Patricia  L.

The cholesterol metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) has been identified to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment via Liver X Receptor (LXR) in myeloid immune cells. Interestingly, 27HC treatment of different myeloid immune cell types results in increased secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with altered cargo. Importantly, EVs from 27HC treated myeloid cells promote tumor growth and metastasis in murine models of breast cancer. Given that these altered EVs are involved in cancer progression, it is imperative that we understand how their biogenesis and secretion are regulated.<br \/>Methods and Results: Immunofluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that 27HC increases the size and number of CD63+ multivesicular bodies (MVBs) but not EEA1+ endosomes in RAW 264.7 cells. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed no significant changes in mRNA expression of genes associated with EV biogenesis machinery. However, we did observe that 27HC increased the size and number of LAMP1+ lysosomes. This led to the hypothesis that 27HC increases EV secretion by skewing MVBs away from lysosomal degradation and towards secretion as EVs by i) impairing lysosomal integrity, and\/or ii) altering the post-translational modifications on the MVBs. To study the effect of 27HC on lysosomal function, we stained the lysosomes with a pH sensing fluorescent dye and observed a decrease in fluorescent intensity, indicating an increase in lysosomal pH. In addition, treatment with 27HC increased levels of cathepsin B in cells. Treatment of cells with Bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal proton pump inhibitor phenocopies the 27HC mediated increase in EV secretion and co-treatment of cells with Bafilomycin A1 and 27HC has the same effect. Post-translational modifications such as ISGylation and NEDDylation have been previously implicated in modulating EV secretion and cargo, and we have observed that 27HC decreases overall ISGylation and NEDDylation of proteins in cells.<br \/>Conclusion: 27HC increases the size of multivesicular bodies, impairs lysosomal integrity, and alters levels of ISG- and NEDDylated proteins in cells. These data suggest that a combination of these modulations leads to the increase in EV secretion. Collectively, our studies reveal novel mechanisms by which EV secretion is modulated by 27HC. By extension, this axis represents a novel avenue for intervening in EV secretion and ultimately in the development of breast cancer therapeutics.<br \/>Funding: Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program Era of Hope Scholar Award (BC200206), and National Cancer Institute (R01CA234025).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Myeloid immune cells,Extracellular vesicles,27-Hydroxycholesterol,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anasuya Das Gupta<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Natalia Krawczynska<sup>1<\/sup>, Hashni Epa Vidana Gamage<sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaena Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Janet E.

With a low number of viable therapeutic targets, mutations in IDH1 represent new hope in treating these devastating tumors that are invariably recurrent and confer a dismal prognosis in their most aggressive forms. In addition to their high frequency of mutation in gliomas, mutations in <i>IDH1 <\/i>are tumor-specific suggesting their effective targeting can reduce the collateral damage to the normal brain imparted by standard therapies. Furthermore, mutations in <i>IDH1<\/i> lead to the overproduction of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), which mediates many of mutant IDH1&#8217;s effects including blocks to normal differentiation, aberrant histone and DNA methylation profiles, perturbed metabolism, induction of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, among others.<br \/>To gain an understanding of mutant IDH-mediated tumorigenesis, we generated genetically faithful mouse models of glioma that harbor the pathognomonic signature including the IDH1-R132H mutation and p53 deletion. This orthotopic intracranial injection model generates tumors that overproduce D-2HG, are histologically diffuse, and confer a prolonged survival compared to their wildtype counterparts. Additionally, these models display the proneural glioma subtype and are enriched for an oligodendrocyte precursor cell gene expression signature, both of which are typified by IDH mutations in human glioma. Exploring the impact of the IDH mutation on the tumor microenvironment, we identified several diminished immune cell subsets among the mutant IDH murine tumors, including plasma cells, NK cells, monocytes, and M2 macrophages, while a subtle increase among dendritic cells was observed as indicated through immune deconvolution of RNAseq data of murine brain tumors. Further analysis showed a reduced Th17 gene expression profile that was corroborated through <i>in vitro <\/i>studies showing a D-2HG-mediated suppression of IL17 producing Th17 cells and a perturbed metabolic activity skewing towards oxidative phosphorylation.<br \/>Th17 cells have only relatively recently been identified and their biological impact appears to be cancer-context dependent with only a few studies being performed in gliomas. With the potential for Th17-mediated anti-tumor activity, as observed in cases of melanoma, the prospect for understanding this understudied lineage and exposing a new therapeutic avenue is exciting. As such, the biological significance of D-2HG-mediated Th17 suppression, the underlying mechanism, as well as the therapeutic potential and anti-tumor activity of Th17 restoration or IL17 overproduction are actively being investigated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IDH1,Animal models,Tumor microenvironment,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nathan  M.

However, STING expression is suppressed or lost in the majority of cancers, which correlates with poor survival in cancer patients. Hypoxia is a key feature of solid tumors that adversely affects prognosis by altering gene expression, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, promoting genome instability, and hampering therapy responses.<i> <\/i>In this study, we found that that prolonged moderate hypoxia induces downregulation of STING expression in multiple cancer cell lines, causing decreased STING pathway activation after treatment with a STING agonist, or with DNA damaging chemotherapy. Mechanically, we found that hypoxia suppressed histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation at the STING promoter based on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in H1975 cells, a non-small cell lung cancer cell line, and knockdown of the H3K4 demethylases, KDM5A or KDM1A, prior to hypoxic exposure prevented hypoxia-induced down-regulation of STING expression. Moreover, decreased STING expression in hypoxic cells was reversed by treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2&#8242;-deoxycytidine. Next, we found that prolonged hypoxia increased both D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) and L-2-HG levels in H1975 cells, and that 2-HG treatment, by itself, decreased STING expression under normoxic conditions in H1975 cells. These findings are consistent with analysis of TCGA data showing that STING expression at the mRNA level is reduced in malignancies with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) which causes elevated D-2-HG. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia increased Branched Chain Amino Acid Transaminase 1 (BCAT1) expression, and overexpression of BCAT1 accelerated STING downregulation in hypoxic condition. Functionally, expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs), CCL5 and interferon-&#946;, was low in hypoxic H1975 cells compared to normoxic cells after treatment with poly(dA:dT), a small molecule STING agonist, and doxorubicin. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) was also reduced in hypoxic H1975 cells. In summary, the results suggest that hypoxia suppresses STING expression through epigenetic regulation, leading to STING silencing, and that this process synergizes with oncometabolites. The decreased STING caused by hypoxia further causes reduction of innate immune responses in cancer cells. Our study provides new understanding of the underlying mechanisms for STING silencing, which will help not only to study cancer immunity but also to develop novel therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,STING Pathway,Gene silencing,Oncometabolites,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuhong Lu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Annali Yurkevicz<sup><\/sup>, Yanfeng Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jonathan Dow<sup><\/sup>, Peter  M.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in glycan-driven cancer progression remain poorly understood.<br \/>In this study, we explored the expression profile of a glycosylation-related gene signature (Affymetrix, GlycoV4) and its association with cancer progression in tumors from different primary sites. First, we analyzed published transcriptomic data from patients&#8217; tumor biopsies to identify pan-cancer molecular signatures associated with glycosylation-related genes including components of the glycosylation machinery and glycan-binding proteins or lectins, to determine unsupervised sample clusters with similar glyco-transcriptome profiles. Next, focusing on a melanoma transcriptomic database (TCGA-SKCM), a supervised machine learning algorithm based on Random Forest was applied to classify each biopsy according to its sample type (metastatic or primary tumor). Notably, we found that using 27 glycogenes out of the 570 included in the signature each biopsy could be classified with 87% accuracy as metastatic or primary tumor. These findings highlight the importance of components of the glycosylation machinery as novel biomarkers of tumor progression.<br \/>To explore possible mechanisms underlying glycosylation changes, we focused on the study of lectins responsible for deciphering the biological information encoded by the glycome. Particularly, galectins, a family of endogenous lectins, are known to be involved in immunomodulation, inflammation, tumor escape, and metastasis. TCGA-SKCM data was used to study the implications of two galectins expression, galectin-2 (Gal-2) mostly unexplored, and galectin-1 (Gal-1), a known regulator of antitumor immune responses. In this dataset, we found that Gal-1 expression was associated with less survival, whereas higher expression of Gal-2 was linked to increased overall survival in melanoma patients. Furthermore, initial findings revealed that Gal-2 expression was significantly augmented in metastatic biopsies whereas Gal-1 was significantly increased in primary solid tumor biopsies. Finally, to study possible mechanisms underlying these correlations, we used an immunocompetent mouse melanoma model to challenge WT and Gal-2-deficient (<i>Lgals2<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>) mice. Interestingly, tumor volume was significantly increased in <i>Lgals2<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice (p&#60;0.005) compared to their WT counterpart. To understand the molecular bases of Gal-2-driven tumor growth changes, we are studying the tumor microenvironment. Given the anti-inflammatory role of Gal-1 and the potential pro-inflammatory capacity of Gal-2, we propose that Gal-1 and Gal-2 may play opposing roles, regulating the outcome of tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glycosylation,Galectin-1,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Montana  N.

Previously, we reported ABCG2, a drug efflux pump, enriches a subpopulation of cells exhibiting a very high level of stemness genes expression in ES cells. These ABCG2+ ES cells exhibited high HIF-2&#945;, which in cooperation with MYC-regulated Nanog and Sox-2. ABCG2+ cells demonstrated highly cytoprotective altruistic behavior by secreting high levels of glutathione. In the present study, we evaluated whether ABCG2+ subfraction of human LSCs exhibits high level of stemness genes and altruistic behavior. We isolated the ABCG2+ cell subfraction from cervical lymph node and blood of human T-ALL(n=5) and CML(n=7) patients exhibiting high levels of stemness genes in addition to MYC and HIF-2&#945;. We investigated the altruistic stemness phenotype of the ABCG2+ cells by studying the molecular signature of MYC binding to HIF-2&#945;. siRNA HIF-2&#945; treatment led to ABCG2+ cell loss of proliferative capacity and reduced GSH levels, suggesting reduction of cytoprotective altruistic behavior in vitro. Treatment of ABCG2+ cell harboring mice with FM19G11 led to marked loss in the secondary engraftment in NOD\/SCID mice, indicating loss of ABCG2+ cell self-renewal capacity. We found siRNA MYC inhibition led to loss of HIF-2&#945; expression, suggesting that MYC might be regulating HIF-2&#945; mediated altruistic stemness program in the ABCG2+ cells.

Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate which in T cells and tumor associated macrophages supports antitumor immunity. PC is required for lung metastasis in several models of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC); however the role of PC expression in primary tumor growth is less well understood. Suppression of PC in tumor associated macrophages and T cells blunts antitumor immunity. We have shown that suppression of PC in tumor cells is sufficient to promote tumor progression and immune evasion.

Here, in this study, we investigated the effect of Met on tumor-associated NETs and its effect on the prognosis of cancer patients.<br \/>Method: We retrospectively examined the outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who received curative surgery in Jichi Medical University Hospital and asked the impact of Met intake on their outcome. In addition, we performed multicolor immunohistochemistry to examine the phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), TAN and NETs in surgically removed tissues specimens in 40 (colorectal cancer) CRC patients who had taken Met before surgery and propensity score-matched 40 patients who had not.<br \/>Results: A total of 1858 patients underwent curative colectomy from April 2010 to March 2021. Among them, 283 patients had T2DM at the time of surgery, and 62 patients had been treated with drugs including Met. The postoperative disease-free survival rate (DFS) was significantly improved in the Met intake group compared with non-intake group (HR=0.21, p&#60;0.01). The number of CD66b(+) TANs significantly decreased in Met-intake group (Median(M)=169 (36-553)\/mm2 vs 99 (34-322)\/mm2, p&#60;0.01). The number of tumor-associated NETs defined as CD66b(+) cit-H3(+) cells significantly decreased in Met-intake group (M=36 (8-272)\/mm2 vs 20 (0-104)\/mm2, p&#60;0.01), and tumor-associated NETs\/TANs ratio significantly decreased in Met-intake group (29.9% vs 19.8%, p&#60;0.01). The number of CD3(+) TILs significantly increased in Met intake group (M=122 (28-257)\/mm2 vs 142 (48-386)\/mm2, p&#60;0.05). The number of CD8(+) TILs significantly increased in Met-intake group (M=60 (14-180)\/mm2 vs 99 (52-318)\/mm2, p&#60;0.01), and CD8\/CD3 ratio significantly increased in Met-intake group (51.2% vs 72.1%, p&#60;0.01).

Approximately 50% of all CRC patients develop metastases. Tumor microenvironment (TME), including extracellular matrix (ECM), plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis in CRC, indicating an important role of agents targeting ECM in the treatment of CRC. ECM acts as niche to support cancer cells. In this study, the role of metformin as a therapeutic agent in modulating ECM components of CRC has been studied.<br \/>Methods: HCT116 (aggressive, poorly differentiated) and HT 29 (less aggressive, moderately differentiated), human CRC cell lines were treated with different doses of metformin (0.1, 2.5 and 5 mM) for 14 days <i>in vitro<\/i> and subsequently microarray analysis was done to identify differentially expressed genes. To observe the role of metformin in modulating the ECM, ECM-receptor interaction pathway was given primary focus among the list of pathways identified by DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) bioinformatics resources. The seven differentially expressed genes of ECM-receptor interaction pathway (elucidated by microarray) were -COL3A1, COL4A2, COL5A2, VTN, ITGA6, TNXB and LAMC3. These genes were validated using RT-qPCR in both the cell lines. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done in different histopathological grades of CRC samples to evaluate the expression and localization of ECM proteins.<br \/>Results: The gene expression of COL4A2, COL5A2, ITGA6, VTN and TNXB by RT-qPCR was decreased with metformin treatment and these results were consistent with microarray data. However, discrepancy was observed in the gene expression of COL3A1 and LAMC3 between microarray and RT-qPCR. Expression of COL3A1, VTN was found to be increased whereas a decrease in expression of ITGA6 was observed in different histopathological grades of CRC samples with IHC. The expression of PI3K and AKT proteins were decreased in HCT116 cells with metformin treatment justifying its anticancer properties.<br \/>Conclusions: Anticancer role of metformin via mTOR and PI3K-AKT signaling has been studied before, but this study identifies the novel ECM proteins in CRC that can be modulated by metformin. The results from this study indicates the promising role of metformin in CRC as it is associated with very less side effects and can influence various aspects of cancer biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metformin,Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular matrix,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amar Preet Kaur<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aditi Bhattacharya<sup>2<\/sup>, Muzaffer Ahmed Bhat<sup>3<\/sup>, Aakriti Bansal<sup>1<\/sup>, Sudip Sen<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Gorakhpur, India,<sup>2<\/sup>Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India,<sup>3<\/sup>Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"43afd4d8-230f-47e8-ae62-927f87954916","ControlNumber":"3380","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Murine models of high-fat diet-induced obesity have shown alterations in proteins involved in fatty acid binding and mitochondrial beta-oxidation, including enoyl-CoA hydratase short chain 1 (ECHS1), which promote increased uptake of fatty acids by primary tumor cells. This creates a metabolic tug of war between tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, thereby depriving cytotoxic immune cells of the metabolic reprogramming for anti-tumor functionality. Nonetheless, metabolic gene expression changes in breast tumor microenvironment of obese individuals remain elusive. We hypothesize that increased expression of ECHS1 leads to immune dysregulation in breast tumor microenvironment and increases risk of cancer progression.<br \/>Proteomic and genomic expression and survival characteristics of ECHS1 in invasive breast cancer was explored in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. We the modeled the effects of ECHS1 expression on immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment using a regression framework. We also performed single cell RNA sequencing analysis for differential expression of ECHS1 in various human breast cells. Additionally, expression level of ECHS1 was validated <i>in silico <\/i>in adipose tissue to elucidate increased immune dysregulation and risk of progression of breast carcinoma in obese individuals.<br \/>We found a significantly increased expression of ECHS1 at both RNA and protein levels in HR+ breast cancer (p&#60;0.001 for both), compared to Herceptin 2 receptor-positive or triple negative breast cancer. High expression of ECHS1 in female breast cancer is also associated with significantly decreased survival based on the TCGA data. Further, we found a significantly negative correlation of CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, and a significantly positive correlation of regulatory T cells with ECHS1 expression in the breast tumor microenvironment. We discovered increased expression of ECHS1 in luminal epithelial cells compared to myoepithelial cells based on single cell RNA sequencing. Lastly, high expression of ECHS1 protein expression based on immunohistochemistry was confirmed in human adipocytes.<br \/>Collectively, our observations support the hypothesis that preferential uptake of free fatty acid through increased expression of ECHS1 in HR+ breast cancer impairs cytotoxic and anti-tumor effects of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Immune dysregulation is further amplified in obese individuals given increased levels of adipose cells and higher ECHS1 expression. Altogether, ECHS1 is a putative biomarker and potential therapeutic target as its downregulation may improve survival in obese patients with HR+ breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Fatty acids,Microenvironment,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tina Bharani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Divyansh Agarwal<sup>2<\/sup>, Estefania Roldan-Vasquez<sup>3<\/sup>, Jessalyn Ubellacker<sup>4<\/sup>, Ted  A.

PDA is notoriously chemo-resistant and has shown little to no sensitivity to the current immune checkpoint blockade therapy. A novel marker for the tumor microenvironment is phosphatidylserine, first characterized as a selective marker of tumor vasculature. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of tumor associated endothelial cells, apoptotic tumor cells, and some viable tumor cells, where it functions to suppress the immune response. Exposed PS drives immunosuppression by binding to PS receptors expressed on tumor-infiltrating macrophages and dendritic cells. To this point, PS has been targeted with antibodies, such as Bavituximab, that have shown excellent specificity for tumor vasculature and an immune stimulatory environment evidence by polarization of macrophages to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype, a reduction in myeloid-derived suppressor cells, enhanced maturation of dendritic cells and increased primed T cell activity. We have advanced this concept by developing the next generation of PS targeting agent, a fusion protein (betabody) that exploits the PS-binding domain of &#946;2-glycoprotein 1 (&#946;2GP1), an abundant serum protein that binds PS.&#8239;Betabodies were constructed by fusing domain V of &#946;2GP1 to the Fc of an IgG2a. Betabodies are smaller than full length antibodies (~85 kDa vs 150 kDa), have good affinity for PS (~1 nM) and bind directly to PS. We have demonstrated that betabodies bind specifically to externalized PS through ELISA, ICC and flow cytometry. We established that betabodies localize robustly and specifically to the tumor microenvironment through in vivo localization experiments in tumor-bearing mice. Further studies will exploit the specificity of betabodies to deliver novel microtubule-disrupting agents to exposed PS in the microenvironment of PDA. Because betabodies are internalized inefficiently, therapeutic payloads will be linked to betabodies via enzyme cleavable linkers. This first-in-class tumor targeting therapeutic has potential to provide efficacy in therapy-resistant pancreatic tumors. In addition, similarly to PS targeting antibodies, preliminary data in vitro has shown that treatment of both bone marrow derived macrophages and Raw 264.7 with the unconjugated betabodies repolarize M2 macrophages to a M1 phenotype. The mechanism of action has not yet been fully elucidated; however, it may involve the interaction between the &#946;2GP1 domains and endogenous LPS. This first-in-class tumor targeting therapeutic has potential to provide efficacy in therapy-resistant pancreatic tumors via targeted drug delivery as well as modulation of the immuno-microenvironment like its PS targeting predecessors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Phospholipid,Fusion proteins,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Natalie Zara Phinney<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xianming Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Mary Lynn Trawick<sup>3<\/sup>, Kevin Pinney<sup>3<\/sup>, Rolf Brekken<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Bio-Thera Solutions, Ltd., Guangzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Chemistry and Biochemistry, Baylor University, Waco, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ebb87072-fe23-41bb-a138-5747bed49b0b","ControlNumber":"5295","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) serve as intercellular conduits for establishing robust, tumor-promoting networks within the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. TNTs are provoked by hypoxia and can passage organelles like mitochondria, i.e., between astrocytes and stem-like brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs). This is theorized to expand resistance properties to other cell types, as well as facilitate metabolic rescue in damaged cancer cells. We investigated the mitochondrial uptake (MU) abilities of RT-sensitive or RT-resistant BTICs from normal human astrocytes (NHAs) under hypoxic conditions.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We used a Cytation5 Cell Imager to quantify MU by BTICs from NHAs in direct contact under normal (20%) or hypoxic oxygen tensions (5%). We obtained RT-sensitive (JX14P) patient-derived xenograft BTICs and generated a paired acquired-resistant (JX14P-RT) line. This was achieved by implanting primary tumors into flanks of athymic nude mice and serially treating with 6 fractions of 2Gy over 14 days for multiple passages until the median doubling time was halved. Cells were plated at a 1:1 ratio on Geltrex for 18h and exposed to 5% or 20% oxygen in serum-free media. NHAs were pre-labeled with a GFP-mitochondria tracker and BTICs were infected with a mCherry lentivirus. BTIC-MU was determined by quantifying double-positive cells in whole-well images. Viability was determined using CellTiterGlo, n = 4.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Time-lapse imaging revealed GFP-mitochondria transfer from NHAs to BTIC cells via TNTs stimulated by hypoxic conditions. We measured overall MU and cell viability in both BTIC lines. JX14P co-cultured with NHAs trended toward an increased MU (cell fraction) in hypoxia (Hyp) compared to Normoxia (Norm) (Norm = 32.61 &#177; 13, Hyp = 44.83 &#177; 5, P&#62;0.167). JX14P exhibit higher cell viability (RLU) in hypoxia when mono- or co-cultured with NHAs (Mono: Norm = 10275 &#177; 901, Hyp = 12599 &#177; 579, P&#60;0.0039, Co: Norm = 5415 &#177; 664, Hyp = 8341 &#177; 700, P&#60;0.0001). JX14P-RT co-cultured with NHAs show a trend for more MU in hypoxia compared to Normoxia (Norm = 25.90 &#177; 12, Hyp = 38.12 &#177; 12, P&#62;0.167). Compared to monoculture, JX14PRT exhibits higher cell viability in co-culture with NHAs under hypoxia (Mono: Norm = 9721 &#177; 255, Hyp = 10011 &#177; 1462, P&#62;0.998, Co: Norm = 4928 &#177; 664, Hyp = 7805 &#177; 944, P&#60;0.005).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: RT-sensitive or -resistant BTICs cocultured with NHAs exhibit increased cell viability under acute hypoxia compared to Normoxia with a trend toward increased MU.

Chronological aging is a major risk factor in all types of cancer as it has been shown to drive changes in noncancerous cells (stromal and immune) of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote tumor initiation and progression. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, which is a major risk factor for melanoma, also can cause a physical premature aging phenotype, known as photoaging. Photoaging of the skin often occurs in tandem with chronological aging, and contributes to the physical features of aging through similar alterations in normal skin structure (eg. collagen degradation). However, the molecular mechanisms of how photoaging compares to chronological aging in changing the TME and on tumor progression is still lacking.Preliminary data have indicated that photoaging of young dermal fibroblasts induce some similar signature changes to that of intrinsically aged. We have shown <i>in-vitro<\/i> that UVA exposure in young fibroblasts cause upregulation in MMP-1, a matrix remodeling protein, and downregulation in &#946;-catenin, the cell adhesion transcription regulator. These same changes were also shown in chronologically aged fibroblasts. In addition, both photoaging and chronological aging decreases ECM structural integrity, with increased collagen fragmentation and a reduction in the renewal of cross-linking proteins. To investigate how photoaging contributes to the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment of the aged dermis, we are using biochemical and phenotypic assays to study how chronic UVA exposure induces an intrinsically aged-like fibroblast behavior and secretome. We also hypothesize that photoaged fibroblasts reprogram the TME to become more permissible for the growth of tumor cells, and will test changes in invasion and metastasis or melanoma both in-vitro and in-vivo.Studying the impact of photoaging on aging in the skin microenvironment will help identify therapeutic targets and have direct clinical applications for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Extracellular matrix,Ultraviolet radiation,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vania Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yash Chhabra<sup><\/sup>, Laura Hueser<sup><\/sup>, Sneha Pramod<sup><\/sup>, Alexis Carey<sup><\/sup>, Ashani Weeraratna<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"241589ff-6631-484e-80af-44b2463067eb","ControlNumber":"8110","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.
