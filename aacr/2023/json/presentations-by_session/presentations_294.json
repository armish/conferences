[{"Abstract":"Knowing a drug&#8217;s mechanism of action (MOA) is essential for its clinical success by selecting the best indications, likely responders, and combinations. Yet knowledge of many drugs&#8217; MOA remains lacking. Here we present DeepTarget, a computational tool for deep characterization of cancer drugs&#8217; MOA by integrating existing large-scale genetic and drug screens. Spanning &#8764;1500 drugs across &#8764;18K possible target genes, DeepTarget predicts: (1) a drug&#8217;s primary target(s), (2) whether it specifically targets the wild-type or mutated target forms, and (3) the secondary target(s) that mediate its response when the primary target is not expressed. We first tested and successfully validated DeepTarget in a total of eleven unseen gold-standard datasets, with an average AUC of 0.82, 0.77, and 0.92 for the above three prediction abilities, respectively. We then proceed to use it in a wide range of applications: First, we find that DeepTarget&#8217;s predicted specificity of a drug to its target is strongly associated with its success in clinical trials and is higher in its FDA-approved indications. Second, DeepTarget predicts candidate drugs for targeting currently undruggable cancer oncogenes and their mutant forms. Finally, DeepTarget predicts new targets for drugs with unknown MOA and new secondary targets of approved drugs. Taken together, DeepTarget is a new computational framework for accelerating drug prioritization and its target discovery by leveraging large-scale genetic and drug screens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Target discovery,Therapeutic target,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sanju Sinha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Neelam Sinha<sup><\/sup>, Eytan Ruppin<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e1b71d60-e29f-4829-bd9e-0997bc6d171a","ControlNumber":"2033","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Spatial proteomic technologies enable capturing single-cell information with the spatial context allowing us to link cancer-causing mutations to outcomes in cell signaling, responses and survival that will aid in diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of cancer. We aim to capture single cells in intact tissue sections of stage III colorectal tumors from 52 patients to spatially characterize cell types, interactions, and organization of the tumor microenvironment in relation to genetic alterations and clinical outcomes.<br \/>Methods: Using Hyperion Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), we profiled 16 protein markers across 170 tissue regions, capturing molecular signatures of tissue architecture, tumor cells, and immune cells. We developed an analysis pipeline to quantify single-cell protein expression and identify cell phenotypes. We preserved spatial information to characterize the interactions between neighboring cells and identify multicellular communities. We also generated whole exome sequencing data, RNAseq data and histopathological images from sections of the same tissue blocks. We compared cellular and spatial features between tumors harboring prognostic genomic evens such as TP53 deletion and MSI and between patients stratified by clinical outcomes such as survival and recurrence.<br \/>Results: We spatially profiled over 800,000 cells to identify 10 tumor, immune and stromal cell phenotypes, and validated identified cell types against matched histopathology and CIBERSORTx deconvoluted RNAseq. To quantify cell-cell interactions, we measured the distance between neighboring cells and performed neighborhood enrichment analysis. We characterized the multicellular organization of the tumor microenvironment to identify 7 consistent cell neighborhoods of up to 10 adjacent cells. We quantified p53 expression in individual tumor cells and found that TP53 deletion (all heterozygous) had no significant association with p53 expression or p53+ tumor cell abundance, suggesting spatial proteomics reveals additional information absent in traditional sequencing. We find that MSI is exclusive of TP53 deletion and that MSI positive tumors had few p53+ tumor cells, increased CD8+ T cell composition and B cells that were further away from p53+ tumor cells compared to MSI negative tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Using Hyperion IMC to acquire a spatial single-cell atlas of stage III colorectal cancer enabled us to characterize the tumor microenvironment by defining cell types, quantifying cell interactions, and identifying multicellular communities. These features enable the linkage of prognostic genetic alternations and clinical outcomes with changes in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,Spatial proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew Su<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Minh Tran<sup>1<\/sup>, HoJoon Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Anuja Sathe<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiangqi Bai<sup>2<\/sup>, Richard Cruz<sup>3<\/sup>, Lance Pflieger<sup>3<\/sup>, Quan Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Hanlee P.

PARPi have also found utility in <i>BRCA-<\/i>non mutated cancers, suggesting other factors may contribute to response. Recently, PARPi trials in pediatric solid tumors have had mixed results. SL interactions have been shown to exist in a network relationship, as such the aim of this study was to identify a clinically relevant SL signature (including synthetic dosage lethality and synthetic rescue) that would predict response to PARPi in pediatric cancers.<br \/>Methods: Pre-treatment genomic copy number alteration, RNA sequencing, and survival data from 519 pediatric cancer patients (INFORM Consortium, 91% solid tumor) were obtained. SL partner genes for PARPi were selected if co-alteration of the drug target (<i>PARP1\/2\/3)<\/i> and candidate gene was 1) found to be under-represented in the patient transcriptome, 2) associated with improved survival, and 3) the genes were phylogenetically similar to <i>PARP1\/2\/3<\/i>. The 100 gene signature was validated on two independent pediatric cancer drug screens: in-vivo orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (OPDX) mouse models (n=24) and in-vitro PRISM cell lines (n=54). It was also validated on a cisplatin (<i>PARP<\/i> surrogate) treated pediatric osteosarcoma clinical trial (n=37). Comparisons were made to 1) a signature generated with the same pipeline using adult TCGA data, 2) a validated adult synthetic lethality pipeline (SELECT), and 3) a published 60-gene PARPi response signature (BRCAness score).<br \/>Results: The pediatric signature predicted response in all drug screens evaluated. Four cell line screens: Talazoparib (AUC 0.72, p = 0.003), Rucaparib (AUC 0.69, p = 0.01), Niraparib (AUC 0.67, p = 0.03), Olaparib (AUC 0.64, p = 0.06), and two OPDX screens: Talazoparib (AUC 0.74, p = 0.03), Olaparib (AUC 0.74, p = 0.03). The pediatric signature outperformed both adult signatures (AUCs 0.34-0.61, all p&#8217;s &#62;0.05), and the BRCAness score (AUCs 0.41-0.53, p&#8217;s &#62;0.05) except in the Olaparib cell line (BRCAness: AUC 0.68, p = 0.01). In the pediatric osteosarcoma dataset, the pediatric signature predicted death (AUC 0.68) and two-year recurrence (AUC 0.72), outperforming the other measures (death: AUC 0.49-0.66; two-year recurrence: AUCs 0.36-0.44).<br \/>Discussion: We developed a pediatric derived, clinically relevant, synthetic lethal signature that predicts response to PARPi in pan-pediatric cancer drug screens and in a cisplatin treated osteosarcoma clinical trial.

The role of TRM in melanoma and rare melanoma subtypes is unknown.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>Our goal was to examine the relationship between TRM abundance and melanoma prognosis. We generated TRM signatures using multiple independent single-cell RNA sequencing data from human melanoma cells to infer TRM abundance.

Model accuracy was validated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic curves, principal component analysis, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.<br \/><b>Findings: <\/b>We found a significantly longer overall survival in patients with high TRM infiltration. Furthermore, we found that TRM can interact with the tumor microenvironment and genomic features of melanoma, making TRM abundance positively correlate with the prognosis of melanoma patients. Melanoma abundance was also significantly associated with several common genomic aberrations, including the TP53 mutation. In addition, we developed a 20-gene risk score that significantly classifies patients into low- and high-risk categories. We found that in several independent datasets, patients with high risk scores had significantly worse overall survival than patients with low risk scores.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Altogether, our findings suggest that TRM abundance may positively correlate with melanoma survival.

By contrast, sex differences in pediatric cancers have been understudied, with almost no genomic studies. To fill this gap, we have performed analyses on the genome, epigenome and transcriptome in eight different pediatric cancer types in nearly 3,000 tumors. Pediatric cancers had distinctive somatic mutational patterns when it came to sex differences, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia exhibiting sex-biases in its transcriptome and other cancer types showing stronger biases in their methylomes. However, no sex differences in somatic mutational profiles were identified. This stands in stark contrast to adult tumors, where we further previous genomic and transcriptomic studies by identifying sex differences in the proteomes, in drug sensitivity profiles and in functional genomics. In summary, our study reveals that sex differences in pediatric cancers are more modest than those in adult tumors and this may shed light into potential mechanisms by which sex influences the cancer genome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Cancer,Genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jieun Oh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chenghao Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole Zeltser<sup>1<\/sup>, Constance  H.

Conversely, regular exercise is linked to decreased risk of multiple cancers. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Specifically, how exercise impacts tumor genomic landscapes has not been considered. To address this gap, we integrated clinical annotation of exercise exposure with tumor mutational profiling of 2,879 patients with cancer. Exercise exposure was evaluated by validated questionnaire and tumor genomic profiling of &#8805; 505 commonly mutated cancer genes was performed using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actional Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay. Among the most represented cancer types were breast (n = 623), lung (n = 524), endometrial (n = 260), colorectal (n = 217) and prostate (n = 176). We found that exercise influences the genomic landscapes of tumors in a cancer-type specific manner. For instance, breast, colorectal and lung cancers from exercising patients had significantly lower tumor mutation burden (TMB) compared with non-exercisers. TMB of melanoma was significantly higher in exercisers versus non-exercisers. A pan-cancer analysis showed that mutations in SMAD3 were more frequent among exercisers, while mutations in STK11, KEAP1 and RBM10 were more frequent among non-exercisers. Overall, this study shows that exercise regulates tumor genomic landscapes and does so in a cancer-site specific manner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exercise,Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brandon  L.

The emergence of single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) has enabled novel interrogation of how copy number aberration (CNA) patterns shape tumor evolution and, separately, of single-cell replication timing (scRT) profiles in developing tissues or diploid cell lines; however, there is a lack of computational methods to study scRT dynamics in samples with high CNA rates. Exploring such an intersection aims to understand genomic and epigenomic co-evolution as replication timing (RT) is linked with epigenetic modifications and nuclear organization. Additionally, it aims to quantify replication stress and relative proliferation rates of tumor subclones. We thus developed a method for probabilistic estimation of replication timing (PERT) which infers scRT profiles for cancer cells with subclonal and cell-specific CNAs. PERT uses a Bayesian framework and informative priors to jointly infer replication and copy number states of S-phase cells. We benchmarked PERT&#8217;s accuracy using 200 simulated datasets with varying cell-specific CNA rates and subclonal structures and its ability to improve cell cycle predictions through permutation experiments on cell cycle sorted cell lines. PERT enabled analysis of &#38;gt10,000 S-phase cells across a cohort consisting of 6 wild-type and 6 genetically engineered cell lines, 13 high grade serous ovarian cancers, and 6 triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). Of this cohort, 7 were time-series datasets with 3 of such being TNBC patient-derived xenografts containing on and off cisplatin timepoints. PERT&#8217;s output enabled us to calculate genome-wide scRT variability and detect sample and subclonal RT shifts. We found that cells with significantly earlier or later replication of chromosome X had unbalanced ratios of active (Xa) to inactive (Xi) alleles, in line with previous reports that Xi replicates much later than Xa due to its repressive epigenetic marks and location within the nucleus. We found that intrasample scRT variability increased as a function of the number of subclones in a sample, consistent with CNAs altering RT, whereas intraclonal scRT variability increased in settings consistent with replication stress. Finally, we developed an analysis framework for time-series data to examine whether subclones enriched for S-phase cells undergo expansion if left untreated or contract if treated with cisplatin compared to cells depleted for S-phase cells. Altogether, this work illuminates how aberrant replication can both generate and result from CNAs while also improving prediction of replication stress, proliferation rates and chemosensitivity at subclonal resolution. This work is broadly important for understanding how to better target the evolvability of genomically unstable cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA replication,Genomic instability,Single cell,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Adam C.

Existing methods use somatic variant allele frequencies to quantify circulating tumor fractions (cTF). Their performance can be limited by the number of detectable somatic alterations and the associated limit of detection (LoD), as well as interference from copy number variation and non-tumor alterations, such as clonal hematopoiesis. Here, we describe the LoD, precision and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of cTF level and change using GuardantINFINITY, a next generation sequencing panel covering over 800 genes with genome-wide methylation detection.<br \/>Method: The cTF of a single sample is estimated from methylation signals across targeted regions of the GuardantINFINITY methylation panel, calibrated using internal training data. cTF change compares two or more samples from the same patient to identify patient-specific methylated regions, and compare the methylation signals of the paired regions. LoQ of cTF level and change were assessed in experimental titrations of advanced colorectal, breast, and lung cancer patient samples and cell line samples into cancer-free backgrounds at different target levels between 0.1%-0.5% cTF. LoD is defined as the lowest cTF level where &#62;95% replicates were detected to have tumor-derived methylation signals. LoQ of cTF level or change is defined as the lowest cTF where the coefficient of variation (CV) across replicates is less than 30%. Accuracy of methylation based cTF compared to cTFs calculated from maximum VAF of somatic mutations was assessed on 1,400 clinical samples of colorectal and lung cancer patients (N=189, 372, 252 and 463 for stage I to IV).<br \/>Results: Experimental titrations of cancer samples demonstrated a single-sample LoD of 0.05% cTF (lowest dilution level) and quantitative precision down to a LoQ of below 0.1%, compared to the LoQ of 0.3% estimated by somatic mutations. In paired clinical titration samples, the LoQ of methylation ctDNA level change was also below 0.1%, compared to the LoQ of ctDNA level change estimated by somatic mutations at 0.3-0.5%. In the 1,400 clinical samples, 64% had at least one somatic mutation detected, 90% had ct-DNA detected with methylation and 96% of these ct-DNA detected samples had cTF above the defined methylation LoQ. Among patients with both methylation and genomic signals identified, the methylation method quantified a similar cTF to those that were calculated using maximum somatic driver mutations (Pearson r=0.83).<br \/>Conclusion: Methylome sequencing using GuardantINFINITY enables accurate and precise quantification of ctDNA level and change with a liquid-only approach, offering longitudinal ctDNA monitoring for more patients than previous methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,Precision medicine,Tumor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sai Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Katie Quinn<sup><\/sup>, Che-Yu Lee<sup><\/sup>, Jun Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Kyle Chang<sup><\/sup>, Tingting Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Shile Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Carin Espenschied<sup><\/sup>, Sara Wienke<sup><\/sup>, Thereasa Rich<sup><\/sup>, Indira Wu<sup><\/sup>, Yvonne Kim<sup><\/sup>, Xianxian Liu<sup><\/sup>, Nageswara Alla<sup><\/sup>, Dustin Ma<sup><\/sup>, Giao Tran<sup><\/sup>, Han-Yu Chuang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Guardant Health, Palo Alto, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1e1084a2-266a-4fbe-84ef-81bbf009149d","ControlNumber":"6778","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Glioblastomas are highly invasive and aggressive brain tumors with a low five-year survival rate of less than 10%. Current treatment strategies are not sufficient for long term disease outcome, and innovative approaches to analyze glioblastoma are imperative for future improved options. Many factors contribute to difficulty of treatment, though one critical consideration is the diffuse nature and known intratumoral heterogeneity of this cancer. It is important to determine LOH heterogeneity, as this genomic alteration is associated with copy number variation and specific classifications of gliomas. Loss of heterozygosity is an irreversible deletion of DNA that is a common alteration in cancer. Application of spatial transcriptomics can increase our understanding of genomic complexity across a tissue, and unsupervised graph clustering can computationally separate spatial regions with similar gene expression patterns. Our method investigates spatial clusters individually at known heterozygous SNP sites to identify evidence for LOH with Bayesian inference and a hidden Markov model. Our analysis centers on the balance of reference (A) and non-reference (B) spatial transcriptomics read counts at SNPs of interest. B allele frequency is the number of reads aligned to the alternative allele divided by the total number of reads counted at the SNP. At a normal two-copy state at a heterozygous site, B allele frequency is ideally 50 percent. LOH can be identified as this value deviates toward 0 or 100, and copy number alterations impact this frequency. Our method utilizes Bayes factor values, or likelihood ratios between two models, using allele counts to provide support for either LOH or a heterozygous event. For our analysis, spatial transcriptomics BAMs are processed with a graph clustering algorithm and split into cluster-specific BAMs. We calculate allele count coverage for each cluster at pre-selected heterozygous SNP positions identified through germline exome sequencing. Bayes factor values are then calculated at each SNP, resulting in evidence for LOH or a heterozygous event. Chromosomal regions are segmented by a hidden Markov approach. Cumulative metrics for each segment are evaluated to determine a &#8220;state&#8221; label of heterozygous, LOH, or undefined. We tested our method on three WHO grade 4 IDH wild-type EGFRvIII positive fresh frozen glioblastoma tissue samples. Sub-clonal heterogeneity was identified in two samples and confirmed by bulk exome sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and analysis of initial clinical reports.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Genomics,Glioblastoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michelle  G.

Despite the diversity of complementarity determining region (CDR) among T cells, many sequence features of CDRs are conserved. Conserved CDR sequences allow for shared specificity, that is, recognition of the same antigen, potentially increasing the pool of candidate TCRs available for treating patients. Utilizing sequence similarity, enrichment of V-genes, CDR lengths, and evidence of clonal expansion, several computational algorithms have been developed to predict the specificity of TCRs. Using neoantigen-specific TCRs (neoTCRs) in our phase 1 clinical trial (NCT039703820), we investigated the shared specificity of TCRs in the context of personalized autologous T cell therapy for cancer patients.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Leveraging a high throughput TCR discovery and validation platform, neoantigen-specific T cells were isolated from patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and their neoTCR sequences were identified. RNA-seq was performed on tumor biopsies and TCR sequences derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were extracted using MiXCR software.

TCR specificity algorithms accurately clustered neoTCR &#946; chains into groups of shared antigen specificity.

In addition, TCR specificity algorithms identified a public TCR sequence known to recognize an HPV-derived epitope presented by HLA-A*02:01 with high similarity to a TCR sequence identified in a tumor biopsy of an HPV16+ HLA-A*02:01+ patient with head and neck cancer.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Neoantigens and their associated neoTCRs identified by our TCR discovery and validation platform can be used as a benchmark for TCR specificity prediction algorithms. TCR specificity algorithms provide insight into TCRs with predicted shared specificity in the blood and within the tumor.

The aim of this study is to characterize the molecular changes of DCIS to improve DCIS risk assessment.<br \/>Methods: We obtained paraffin-embedded tissue of 210 DCIS samples with no concurrent or antecedent IBC from 5 cancer institutions, and extracted DNA and RNA. Transcriptome analysis: Illumina&#8217;s TruSeq RNA Exome kit was used for library construction, followed by sequencing.<br \/>Methylome analysis: Bisulfite treated genomic DNA was restored and arrayed using the Illumina 450K methylation chips. DNA Copy number (CNV) analysis: CNV was estimated from the methylation data set using the EpiCopy R package.<br \/>Results: Samples passing Q\/C metrics: Transcriptome: 59 cases, 63 controls. Methylome &#38; CNV: 93 cases, 98 controls. We classified samples into their intrinsic PAM50 subsets. Cases showed an increase in the Her2 subtype, and the controls were enriched in LuminalA (LumA) samples, while Basal and LuminalB (LumB) subtypes were evenly distributed. Compared to the TCGA IBC dataset, proportions of Her2 and LumB subtypes in DCIS were increased while the LumA cohort was decreased. Unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data resulted in 3 clusters with key differences between PAM50 subtypes: one cluster predominated in Basal and Her2 subtypes, and a second was enriched in hormone-positive samples (LumA and LumB). For the methylome data, the optimal number of clusters was 6. Again, several clusters showed correlation with PAM50 subtype, e.g., one was enriched for hormone-negative subtypes (Basal and Her2), while another was enriched for hormone-positive subtypes (LumA and LumB). For the CNV data, the optimal number of clusters was 4. Here, one CNV cluster appeared predominantly in the Basal subtype, and there were multiple regions showing significant subtype-specific differences with the TCGA IBC data set. While the well-known heterogeneity of DCIS prevents the above broad molecular categories from strongly stratifying DCIS by outcome, we are continuing to analyze our data sets for predictive molecular signatures. Since the long-term outcome of all DCIS in this cohort is known, we are in the unique position to pursue additional questions such as PAM50 subtype differences in times-to-events or lineage fidelity (i.e., whether the subtype of the subsequent IBC matches the preceding DCIS), and it appears that the time to IBC diagnosis is shortest in Basal DCIS, while at the same time, lineage fidelity is lowest in Basal DCIS, as has been previously reported.<br \/>Conclusions: Our subtype-stratified analyses identified multiple molecular differences both between intrinsic subtypes as well as between DCIS and IBC that suggest subtype-specific characteristics that may be exploitable for risk stratification of DCIS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DCIS,Progression,Genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marija Debeljak<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Soonweng Cho<sup>2<\/sup>, Bradley Downs<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Considine<sup>3<\/sup>, Brittany Avin-McKelvey<sup>4<\/sup>, Yongchun Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, William Grizzle<sup>5<\/sup>, Katherine Hoadley<sup>6<\/sup>, Charles Lynch<sup>7<\/sup>, Brenda Hernandez<sup>8<\/sup>, Paul vanDiest<sup>9<\/sup>, Wendy Cozen<sup>10<\/sup>, Ann Hamilton<sup>11<\/sup>, Debra Hawes<sup>10<\/sup>, Edward Gabrielson<sup>12<\/sup>, Ashley Cimino-Mathews<sup>12<\/sup>, Liliana Florea<sup>13<\/sup>, Leslie Cope<sup>3<\/sup>, Christopher B.

Clinically, metastatic non-ccRCC patients, regardless of subtypes with distinct genomic aberrations, are all treated with the same standard of care therapies, underscoring the need for precision therapeutic strategies. Diagnostic challenges also exist as benign and malignant entities often display overlapping histomorphologies that current diagnostic cytokeratin markers cannot resolve. Therefore, identification of more reliable diagnostic and prognostic non-ccRCC biomarkers remains an unmet need in this field.<br \/>As part of the Clinical Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), we performed integrative analysis of multi-omics data including genomic next generation sequencing-based whole exome, whole genome, RNAseq, snRNAseq and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, post translational modifications (glycosylation and phosphorylation) and metabolomic profiles generated by CPTAC. The composition of the kidney tumor cohort (n=151) included 103 ccRCC, 15 oncocytomas, 13 papillary RCC (PRCC), 11 other rare tumors and 8 unclassified RCCs. Our multi-omic analysis revealed both unique and shared molecular features of RCC subtypes. We characterized proteogenomic, PTM and glycoproteome impact of genome instability (GI), a feature that is associated with poor prognosis in both ccRCC and non-ccRCC and affects 10-15% of cases. These analyses identified new prognostic signatures, outlier targetable kinase expression patterns, kinase-substrate relationships and differential protein glycosylation events. Glycoproteome analysis also revealed variation in cell-type specific marker expression among RCC subtypes such as FUT8 (core-fucosyltransferase) associated protein glycosylation in PRCC. Integrative analysis of snRNA-seq data predicted diverse tumor cell-of-origin and stratified RCC subtype specific proteogenomic signatures. Differential expression analysis revealed several novel diagnostic makers including MAPRE3, GPNMB, PIGR, SOSTDC1. These biomarkers were validated by IHC and their addition to existing panels results in improved diagnostic specificity. Metabolic characterization revealed RCC subtype-specific differences and increased oncometabolite SAICAR in oncocytomas that may have functional significance. The valuable proteogenomic data resource we generated contains several rare tumor types that are hard to obtain for proteogenomic characterization at the scale described here, and will certainly aid in future pan-RCC studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Proteomics,Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ginny Xiaohe Li<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Yi Hsiao<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Lijun Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Rahul Mannan<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuping Zhang<sup>4<\/sup>, Francesca Petralia<sup>5<\/sup>, Hanbyul Cho<sup>2<\/sup>, Noshad Hosseini<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Calinawan<sup>5<\/sup>, Yize Li<sup>6<\/sup>, Shankara Anand<sup>7<\/sup>, Aniket Dagar<sup>8<\/sup>, Yifat Geffen<sup>7<\/sup>, Felipe  V.

Multiple studies have shown that HLA homozygosity or loss-of-function somatic mutations negatively correlates ICI response rate. Here we present additional data on the algorithm Kmerizer, designed to perform HLA germline typing and somatic mutation detection from cfDNA input material, and we show how we use these in neoantigen prioritization for patient outcome prediction.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Kmerizer first leverages the high depth coverage of targeted sequencing to rapidly identify germline alleles by matching k-mers from the input reads to the k-mers of known HLA alleles. Careful realignment of reads ontothe called germlines is followed by proprietary somatic variant calling. MHC class1 germline allele calls are combined with patient mutation data to generate<i> in silico <\/i>TCR binding affinity predictions using net MHC-4.0. These predictions are compared across cohorts to assess how cancer type, TMB, and ICI response vary with the predicted neoantigens and TCR binding affinity.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Of nineteen cell lines, twelve plasma samples and eight gDNA samples with confirmed HLA typing information, Kmerizer delivered 100% sensitivity on both MHC-I and II genes, with 99.5% and 98.7% specificity, respectively, based on GuardantINFINITY cfDNA sequencing data. For homozygous\/heterozygous status, accuracy of 99.1% on class I and 97.7% on class II genes is achieved. HLA allele prevalence among our development samples is consistent with reference cohorts of similar geographic origin in MHC class I genes. The HLA somatic caller achieves &#62;99.99% specificity per base as computed on 48 normal samples, while achieves &#62;91% sensitivity for somatic events with expected allele frequency (AF) ~ 0.15% (AF range[0.08%,0.26%] for detected events) as evaluated through simulations. Additionally, we generated a total of 2,767 immunogenic (ic50&#60;500nM) class-I somatic neoantigens predictions across 112 samples from cancer patients with germline HLA typing results. We found average patient neoantigen TCR binding affinity was significantly associated with cancer type (&#967;<sup>2<\/sup>=86.08,p&#60;0.0001).

About 75% of breast tumors are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+). Nearly 30-50% of ER+ breast cancers eventually become refractory to multiple lines of therapy and progress to an uncurable metastatic stage despite positive 5-year results on primary endocrine therapy. To uncover the malignant phenotypes underlying the development of therapeutic resistance, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 219,532 cells from 80 ER+ breast cancer patients. This included 28 solid tumors and 52 metastatic fluid samples (pleural effusions and ascites). We grouped samples in three groups to study the evolution of biological phenotypes based on the number of lines of therapy administered to a patient: 1. Early (non-metastatic), 2. Advanced (metastatic with less than 3 lines of therapy), and Refractory (metastatic with 3 or more lines of therapy). We used Pareto task inference analysis to model evolutionary task trade-offs across malignant cell populations from the early, advanced, and refractory tumors. Our model revealed 5 unique phenotypic states or &#8220;archetypes&#8221; that existed across ER+ cancer cells. A multitask learning model based on group lasso revealed the specialized biological tasks associated with each archetype, including 1. Metabolism and self-renewal, 2. EGF\/STAT3 signaling, 3. Estrogen signaling, 4. Apoptosis, and 5. MYC activation with rapid proliferation. We found the estrogen signaling archetype was progressively lost in advanced and refractory tumors (P=7.2x10<sup>-110<\/sup>), while the MYC archetype was progressively gained in the advanced and refractory tumors (P=2.45x10<sup>-9<\/sup>). The EGF\/STAT3 archetype was unique to refractory tumors (P= 1.42x10<sup>-37<\/sup>). We further investigated the evolution of resistant traits by modeling the pathway phenotypes in malignant cells against the number of lines of therapy received by the patients. Patients refractive to multiple lines of therapy progressively gained mTOR signaling pathway activity concurrent with loss of estrogen-signaling. Multiple pathways that crosstalk with the mTOR pathway were activated in the tumors receiving multiple lines of therapy, including IGFR, and EGF\/ERBB signaling. In comparison to early and advanced tumors, refractory tumors also gained JNK\/p38 signaling (P=0.006) and activated glycolysis (P=5x10<sup>-6<\/sup>). This study reveals how metastatic ER+ breast cancer cells acquire capabilities for resistance to multiple lines of therapy, thus serving as a unique resource for understanding refractory ER+ breast cancer biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,Systems biology,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aritro Nath<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Cosgrove<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Griffiths<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeffrey Chang<sup>2<\/sup>, Adam Cohen<sup>3<\/sup>, Andrea Bild<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Beckman Research Institute of The City of Hope, Monrovia, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Inova Schar Cancer Institute, Fairfax, VA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"adcc04ba-7f13-4636-a675-c05e143a9cdc","ControlNumber":"7681","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Computational tools can detect ecDNA in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from biopsies. However, the lack of longitudinal studies tracking patients from pre-cancer to cancer have made it difficult to determine how ecDNAs contribute to the malignant transformation. Two independent surveillance studies of Barrett&#8217;s esophagus (BE) patients enabled us to study this transition, as BE is the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The studies included a longitudinal case-control study and an independent, cross-sectional surveillance cohort, both with histological correlatives, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the role of ecDNA in the transition of BE to EAC.<br \/>We analyzed WGS data from 206 patients in a cross-sectional surveillance cohort from Cambridge University UK, with biopsy-validated BE, including 42 patients who never developed high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or EAC during multi-year follow-ups, 25 patients with HGD, 51 patients with early-stage EAC, and 88 patients with late-stage EAC. ecDNA frequency increased between early-stage EAC (24%) and late-stage EAC (43%), suggesting continual ecDNA formation during cancer progression.<br \/>We additionally analyzed WGS and histology data collected from multi-regional sampling of BE and EAC tissue at two time points from 80 BE patients in an observational case-control study at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (FHCC), where 40 of the patients developed BE-associated EAC during the study and 40 did not. Among FHCC patients, 33% who developed EAC had at least one esophageal biopsy with ecDNA prior to, or at EAC diagnosis. In biopsies collected before cancer diagnosis, ecDNA presence in the biopsy was enriched among patients who later developed EAC compared to patients who did not. When linked to histology data, ecDNA-positive biopsies associated with worsened histological states before cancer diagnosis (p=0.015), and also at cancer diagnosis (p=0.037), with the pre-cancer timepoint being on average 2.1 years prior to cancer diagnosis. The ecDNAs had diverse collections of oncogenes and immunomodulatory genes, and showed higher copy number states than other focal amplification types. Furthermore, ecDNAs showed increasing copy number and structural complexity in more advanced disease stages highlighting their positive selection and ongoing structural evolution. In both FHCC and Cambridge cohorts, we found an association of TP53 loss with ecDNA formation demonstrating the role of prior genomic instability to form ecDNA. In total, our findings illustrate that oncogenic ecDNA can develop early in the malignant transformation, and that they are tied to worsening patient disease status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Barrett's esophagus,Gene amplification,Genomic instability,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jens Luebeck<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alvin  W.

Recent advances in mass spectrometry enable comprehensive investigation of PTMs. However, identifying functionally relevant PTMs and protein domains implicated in disease remains a key challenge. We present <i>CLUMPS-PTM<\/i>, an algorithm for spatial clustering of PTMs to propose functional domains. We apply <i>CLUMPS-PTM<\/i> to the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) dataset (one of the largest proteogenomic pan-cancer PTM datasets) comprising 1110 samples spanning 11 tumor types.<br \/>First, we map over 14K phospho-sites and 13K acetyl-sites detected in the CPTAC dataset to protein data bank (PDB) files. We expand this to the predicted AlphaFold proteome and recover additional 12K phospho-sites and 10K acetyl-sites exceeding model confidence (pLDDT) of 70%. Consistent with previous research, phospho-sites are found on residues with lower AlphaFold prediction confidence than acetyl-sites due to their abundance in unstructured domains (p-value &#60; 1e-4).<br \/>To identify functionally relevant protein domains in the pan-cancer context, we characterize the 1110 samples by applying <i>SignatureAnalyzer<\/i>, a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization method, to discover multi-omic patterns. This analysis identifies strong signatures associated with DNA damage response (DDR) and stratifies the CPTAC cohort into DDR-high (n=442) and DDR-low (n=668) groups. Next, we applied <i>CLUMPS-PTM<\/i> to differentially modified phospho\/acetyl-sites between these groups. We identified 22 proteins (including GMPS, NCBP1, and ANPEP (CD13)) with significant clusters of differentially phosphorylated sites (q-value &#60; 0.1) in DDR-high samples. ANPEP is a zinc-dependent aminopeptidase with a significant cluster (q-value = 0.0129) of differentially phosphorylated sites in the ERAP1-C domain that faces peptidase active sites known to have proliferative activity via the MAPK pathway. <i>CLUMPS-PTM<\/i> also identified a significant cluster of acetyl-sites on ARID1A (a SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeler known to be mutated in cancer) in DDR-high samples (q-value = 0.085). The ARID1A cluster is on the C-terminal tail of the protein within the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) domain, an upstream regulator of proteins that increase catabolism, reduce inflammation, and increase cell survival. Increased acetylation may block a ubiquitination site at the C-terminus of the protein, resulting in increased protein levels, likely due to reduced ARID1A degradation, and increased GR signaling.<br \/>Overall, <i>CLUMPS-PTM<\/i> is an open-source tool that allows near proteome-wide spatial analysis with the growing availability of PTM data. We anticipate that it will be useful to the broader proteomic community for the discovery of novel targets and generation of insights into functional mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Proteomics,Cancer genomics,Mass spectrometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shankara  K.

Previous studies have demonstrated broad applicability of UG100 data for whole-genome germline variant calling, single cell transcriptomics and whole-genome methylation analysis, as well as for recalling cancer signatures from cfDNA at very low fraction of circulating tumor DNA.<br \/>Somatic variant calling is a natural application for this platform as it can benefit from lower sequencing cost to enable deeper sequencing coverage. Here, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a somatic calling pipeline from UG100 whole genome sequence data. Since deep-learning-based variant calling methods currently outperform statistical variant calling methods for germline variant calling on UG100 data, we cast somatic variant calling as a classification problem.<br \/>Specifically, we trained a classifier to distinguish if a candidate at a particular location is a somatic variant or a sequencing error. We used a version of DeepVariant optimized for UG100 data to train the deep-learning classifier in three scenarios: tumor only, tumor with an unmatched background sample and matched tumor-normal samples. The labeled truth set for training was generated by mixing whole genome sequenced samples from the genome-in-a-bottle project in a wide range of proportions (0-100% mixing ratio) to simulate various allele frequencies, with an average genome coverage of 100x. The tumor\/normal model was the best-performing of the three models with a recall of &#62;98% for SNPs and 90% for Indels at allele fraction &#62; 10%. Notably, the model also showed high specificity as well with 16 false positive SNPs and 19 false positive indels at AF over 10% called on the chromosome that was not part of the training (chr20).<br \/>We then applied the model for calling from the WGS data on three well characterized pairs of matched tumor and normal cell lines: HCC1143, COLO829 and HCC1395. We evaluated the performance on the pre-defined UG-HCR (Ultima Genomics - High Confidence Region), which includes 95% of the human genome. DeepVariant models performed very well on calling SNPs (&#62;92% recall at allele frequencies above 10%) and indels (&#62;90% recall). The calls were also highly specific, with less than 1\/Mb variants absent in the ground truth across the UG-HCR.<br \/>Lastly, we applied the models to 8 unpaired cell lines with known driver mutations and observed that we call 34\/34 driver mutations of length &#60;=20 bp that appear in COSMIC (100% recall).<br \/>We expect the UG100 sequencer to become an important tool for somatic genome analysis and to enable deep whole-genome sequencing to become a routine assay in clinical oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,Deep learning,Variant calling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Maya Levy<sup><\/sup>, Doron Shem-Tov<sup><\/sup>, Hila Benjamin<sup><\/sup>, Sima Benjamin<sup><\/sup>, <b>Ilya Soifer<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Shlomit Gilad<sup><\/sup>, Danit Lebanony<sup><\/sup>, Nika Iremadze<sup><\/sup>, Eti Meiri<sup><\/sup>, Doron Lipson<sup><\/sup>, Omer Barad<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ultima Genomics, Newark, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"27147792-d4dd-47fe-84ee-dc0e7bebc272","ControlNumber":"5892","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

However, the presence of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) variants, or biological noise, due to aging or therapy has potential to confound biomarker interpretation. Currently, comprehensive methods to filter out non-tumor variants require genotyping the white blood cell (WBC) fraction of the paired plasma sample, which is a costly, complicated workflow. A plasma-only, bioinformatics solution to identify non-tumor variants is needed for accurate biomarker assessments in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA).<br \/>Method: An ensemble model was trained on a database of &#62;250,000 plasma samples comprising healthy donor, early and late-stage cancer patients sequenced on the Guardant360<sup>TM<\/sup> , GuardantREVEAL<sup>TM<\/sup>, and GuardantOMNI<sup>TM<\/sup> liquid biopsy panels as well as public tissue datasets. The model was optimized with 5 fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to produce a non-tumor and tumor variant classifier. To validate these calls, 116 paired plasma and WBC advanced cancer samples were selected for high prevalence of putative CH variants and genotyped using an in-house bioinformatics pipeline. In the validation cohort, cfDNA variants were determined to be of non-tumor or CH origin if there was molecule support in the WBC; cfDNA variants above 0.6% (limit of detection in the gDNA) with no support in the WBC were determined to be from the tumor.<br \/>Results: The validation cohort consisted of 2150 somatic SNV and Indels, 956 of which were confirmed in the WBC and 1194 confirmed as plasma-only. Half of confirmed CH variants (48%, 458\/956) occurred in known CH genes, while the other half occurred in genes such as TP53, ATM, NOTCH4, FAT1, SRSF2. No clinically actionable variants were confirmed in the WBC. Non-tumor or CH predictions were made for 624 somatic variants: 515\/624 correctly identified CH, for a positive predictive value (PPV) of 83%. Of all CH variants confirmed in the WBC, 54% (553\/956) had a CH or non-CH prediction; CH predictions had 91% (515\/553) positive percent agreement (PPA) with the WBC. Remaining variants with no CH prediction (403\/956) were low or no prevalence across datasets and occurred predominantly in LRP1B, TET2, TP53, KMT2D. Nearly half (67%, n=109) of CH predictions not in WBC occurred in a CH gene. For non-CH gene variants, 16% of false positive predictions occurred in 6 variants across 4 genes (ACVR2A, RNF43, B2M, FLT3).<br \/>Conclusion: We present a plasma-only method that has high PPA and PPV with WBC genotyping for classifying non-tumor, CH variants in the cfDNA. Further investigation is underway to improve the sensitivity of annotating rare CH variants.

Among different types of mutations, structural variants (SVs) widely spread in cancer genomes and can be important cancer drivers, demonstrated in multiple cancer types. SVs can induce oncogene activation by redirecting enhancers to promoter regions or disrupting chromatin topology. These events are called &#8220;enhancer hijacking&#8221; and known to upregulate oncogenes in multiple cancers. Enhancers are among the best understood cis-regulatory elements and are essential regulators for precise gene expression in normal tissue. Since SV associated gene deregulation has been shown in multiple cancer types, it is a feasible way to infer putative oncogenes by detecting enhancer hijacking events. Taking advantage of next generation sequencing, bioinformatic tools were developed to study pan-histology protein-coding gene deregulation caused by SVs. However, algorithms that can unbiasedly detect enhancer hijacking in both coding and non-coding genes are yet to be developed. Here we present a computational algorithm &#8220;HYENA&#8221; to identify putative oncogenes activated by enhancer hijacking using whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing data. It deploys rank-based regression model to test whether an SV breakpoint located close to a gene significantly increases the gene expression. Permutation tests were used to generate a false discovery rate for each gene. By benchmarking with existing tools serving similar purposes, we confirmed that HYENA has superior capabilities to infer enhancer hijacking events. We detected 192 oncogene candidates in 1,148 tumor samples from 25 cancer types. While confirming the known cases of enhancer hijacking, we also identified numerous novel oncogene candidates, of which a substantial proportion was non-coding genes. Specifically, we found that a long non-coding RNA <i>TOB1-AS1<\/i> was activated by rearranged enhancers in 10% of pancreatic cancer samples. Furthermore, experimental validation with pancreatic cancer cell lines and immunodeficient mice indicated that high expression of <i>TOB1-AS1<\/i> is capable to promote cancer cell invasion and tumor metastasis, suggesting it is a novel cancer driver. As the existing treatments for pancreatic cancer are largely inefficacious and patients still have poor prognosis, new targets are urgently needed to improve pancreatic cancer treatments. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying <i>TOB1-AS1<\/i> promoted metastasis remain to be unveiled, this non-coding gene can be a promising target in the patients carrying this enhancer hijacking event. In summary, our results demonstrated that HYENA is a sensitive and reliable tool to infer enhancer hijacking activated oncogenes and spot new potential targets to treat cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene regulation,Oncogene,Long noncoding RNA,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anqi Yu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ali  E.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) based estimates of tumour mutational burden (TMB) has been robustly associated with response to CPI therapy across multiple tumour types and a threshold of &#8805;10 mutations per megabase (Mb) is now an FDA-approved biomarker for treatment with pembrolizumab. However, studies to date have been limited to whole exome sequencing (WES), with no data yet reported on the utility of whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a biomarker to predict CPI response. WGS data can identify non-coding alterations which impact the expression of immune regulatory genes, variants likely to form non-coding epitopes, including novel open reading frame mutations especially structure variants (SV). Here, we have identified a pan-cancer cohort of n=364 patients treated with CPI from Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project (GEL). We find that SV burden is highly associated with worse CPI response (HR =1.3 (1.0-1.8) , p-value = 0.037) and high SV burden group have low tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) score (P-value &#60; 0.0001). However, we found that patients who have high proportion of SV derived neoantigen group improved overall survival (HR = 0.44 (0.27-0.73) , p-value = 0.002). In addition, enhancer region alteration of antigen present gene was observed in 43 patients (12%) and was associated with worse CPI response. (HR = 1.5 (1.0-2.2), P-value = 0.034). We further explored the SV derived neoantigen generate neoantigen-specific T cell response.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{1C9EA5FC-EF2B-49BC-9FFD-6370A41E20D3}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\"><b>Summary of Cox Model from structure variant <\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">Variables<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No. patients<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>P<\/i><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sex<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Female<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">164<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i> <\/i><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Male<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">200<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.15 ( 0.87-1.52)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.3285<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cancer Type<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Others<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">59<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Lung<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">88<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.39 (0.91-2.14)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.1255<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Melanoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">155<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.84 (0.56-1.28)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.4267<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Renal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">62<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.84 (0.52-1.38)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.495<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TMB estimated WGS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">364<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.98 (0.97-0.99)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0036<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SV burden<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Low<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">182<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">High<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">182<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.36 (1.02-1.81)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0358<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Proportion of anti-tumour antigen from SV<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Low<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">49<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">High<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">47<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.48 (0.29-0.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0045<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">antigen non-generate<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">268<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.49 (0.35-0.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#60; 0.0001<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Whole genome sequencing,Neoantigens,Structure variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hongui Cha<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Simpson<sup>1<\/sup>, Charles Swanton<sup>2<\/sup>, Kevin Litchfield<sup>1<\/sup>, Genomics England Research Consortium<sup><\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University College London, London, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b808ffac-ac48-41e3-a983-08a49f2bc7b6","ControlNumber":"5976","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Therefore, describing the spatial composition and interaction of cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is necessary. Here, we developed a tool, STopover, which adopts topological analysis in spatial transcriptomics to reveal cell-cell colocalization patterns in TME and capture the key components and niche of intercellular communication, and applied it to human lung cancer data.<br \/>Methods: The spatial colocalization pattern of pairs of features was defined using topological data analysis with Morse filtration. The spatial network of spatial gene expression data was generated for each sample and then the patterns were summarized as connected components (CCs) based on the spatial distance between unit tissue regions and the persistence of each CC. The global and local extent of spatial overlap of a feature pair was calculated as Jaccard indices between extracted CC pairs. We applied STopover to 11 barcode-based spatial transcriptomic data of human lung adenocarcinoma with different PD-L1 expressions. Spatial mapping of cell types in TME was performed by CellDART. In addition, image-based spatial transcriptomic data of lung cancer were also used to find key spatial molecular interactions in TME using STopover.<br \/>Results: First, STopover disclosed the distinct immune and stromal infiltration patterns in lung cancer tissues. Spatial colocalization of cancer cells and T-cells was heterogeneous and correlated with the immune-related markers such as MHC class I signature. The cancer types were clustered according to spatial colocalization patterns of various immune cells with cancer cells, which showed different infiltration patterns of immune cells. Moreover, STopover could estimate the top cell-cell interaction and emphasize the key locations based on the literature-supported ligand-receptor database.<br \/>Conclusion: STopover is expected to account for significant spatial cell interactions in tumor-immune and tumor-stromal components and could be utilized as a platform to decipher the mechanisms underlying immune-oncology treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,spatially resolved transcriptomics,topological analysis,colocalization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sungwoo Bae<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hyekyoung Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Kwon Joong Na<sup>3<\/sup>, Dong Soo Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Hongyoon Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Young Tae Kim<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institute of Radiation Medicine, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e2c52234-7711-4bf2-8093-1c1e904a4491","ControlNumber":"2789","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

In cancer, altered mRNA splicing can lead to aberrant protein products that promote oncogenic transformation, metastasis and confer chemotherapy resistance, due to splicing factor mutation or mis-expression. We hypothesize that the role of splicing imbalance in cancer is grossly underestimated and is likely regulated by the same recurrent global disruptions observed across human cancers. To determine common and malignancy specific splicing subtypes across cancer we designed a novel integrated computational workflow that uses genome variant data from RNA-Seq in conjunction with fully unsupervised analyses (NMF and SVM) to identify novel patient splicing-defined subtypes (OncoSplice). Applied to 20 adult and pediatric cancers with large cohorts, we identified common-recurrent splicing subtypes associated with MYC-hyperactivation and TGF-beta signaling, lineage reprogramming, tumor infiltration and broad mutation impacts. Such recurrent and tumor specific subtypes were frequently associated with poor prognosis and novel dominantly regulated driving splicing events (e.g., transcription factors). Broad splicing subtypes were associated with circadian dysregulation, as determined from normal healthy tissues (GTEx) and in many cases were found to phenocopy well-described splicing mutation impacts or were associated with new RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) evidenced by orthogonal computational predictions. Splicing subtype associated RBPs were frequently undergo autoregulation, as further evidenced by CLIP-Seq and RBP knockdown. To enhance the RNA community&#8217;s ability to explore hundreds of known and novel splicing variation across cancers and healthy tissues, we provide an interactive online splicing explorer at oncosplice.org. Together, these data highlight previously unknown regulatory relationships and prognostic associations in cancer associated with broad and targeted splicing regulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Splice variants,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Circadian genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anukana Bhattacharjee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Audrey Crowther<sup>2<\/sup>, Guangyuan Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Meenakshi Venkatasubramanian<sup>3<\/sup>, Dan Schnell<sup>1<\/sup>, Stuart Hay<sup>1<\/sup>, Preeti Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Krithika  R.

Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of TNBC is a complex ecosystem, characterized by the dynamic interactions between stromal, immune, extracellular matrices (ECM), and cancer cells. Understanding the fibroblasts as a heterogeneous population with pleiotropic actions on TME, mediated by ECM formation and interactions with immune cells, is necessary to develop approaches to interfere with the loss of ECM homeostasis, promote immunity, and improve the outcome of concomitant therapeutic approaches in TNBC and other cancer types. Our recent studies suggested distinct fibroblast sub cell types of varied biosynthesis of ECM components in the TME of TNBC, which have significant associations with the infiltration and activity of immune cells. In this study, we developed advanced computational methods to characterize the role of fibroblast sub cell types, their functional variations, and stromal-immune cell interactions in TNBC, by integrative analysis of tissue, single-cell, and spatial multi-omics data. We hypothesized that the genes involved in sub cell types and functional variations of fibroblast cells may form distinct data structures in omics data, which are identifiable by carefully designed pattern recognition methods. We also hypothesized that different subtypes and functional activities of fibroblast cells lead to varied ECM formations, metabolic shifts, and affect the infiltration and functions of immune cells, which could be identified as the spatial regions with distinct expression changes of stromal and immune marker genes.We first reconstructed TNBC TME context-specific gene sets of fibroblast sub cell types and functions. We assemble a series of computational methods including tissue data deconvolution, functional module detection on scRNA-seq data, and metabolic flux analysis into an integrative data analysis framework to characterize fibroblast cells and their functions in the TME of TNBC and reconstruct context-specific pathways of fibroblast sub cell types and functions. We further detected spatially dependent ECM formation and stromal-immune cell interactions in TNBC by using spatial resolved transcriptomics data. We observed spatially dependent variations of (1) sub cell type and cell type-specific functions, and (2) stromal-immune cell interactions, in the TME of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stroma,Extracellular matrix,Fibroblasts,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuhui Wei<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Haiqi Zhu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiao Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xinyu Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Jia Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Tingbo Guo<sup>3<\/sup>, Pengtao Dang<sup>3<\/sup>, Sha Cao<sup>1<\/sup>, Chi Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Indiana University, School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN,<sup>2<\/sup>Indiana University, Bloomington, IN,<sup>3<\/sup>Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6876e81f-6f6e-49cd-9d06-3a70471c888f","ControlNumber":"6978","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, the data sparsity of single-cell assays can preclude accurate estimation of transcription factor activity. In addition, gene expression alone cannot capture transcription factor activity, especially in the context of drug treatment which alters transcription factor function without suppressing gene expression. To circumvent these challenges, we have developed epiregulon, a R package that constructs gene regulatory networks and infers transcription factor (TF) activity in single cells by integrating single cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and bulk TF occupancy data. Epiregulon applies tests of independence to identify likely transcription factor - regulatory element - target gene relationships occurring at joint probabilities exceeding the expected probabilities of independent events. With epiregulon, we are able to detect lineage factor activity at enhanced sensitivity and predict perturbations more accurately than gene expression could. We further applied this tool to understand transcription factor activity to enzalutamide treatment and identify potential drivers of enzalutamide resistance. Finally, we generated a ground truth dataset using reprogram-seq, a technology that captures multi-omic profiles of single cells upon expression of defined transcription factors. Epiregulon correctly predicts NKX2-1 targets and demonstrates that NKX2-1 expression reprograms the epigenome towards a neuroendocrine state in LNCaP cells. Epiregulon is a useful tool that constructs gene regulatory networks to model the underlying gene regulation hierarchies that drive gene expression and cell states.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Transcriptional regulation,Epigenomics,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tomasz Wlodarczyk<sup>1<\/sup>, Jenille Tan<sup>2<\/sup>, Kerstin Seidel<sup>2<\/sup>, Diana Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Shang-Yang Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Aleksander Chlebowski<sup>4<\/sup>, Timothy Keyes<sup>5<\/sup>, Yu Guo<sup>2<\/sup>, Aaron Lun<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Siebel<sup>2<\/sup>, Shiqi Xie<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Xiaosai Yao<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Roche, Basel, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA,<sup>4<\/sup>Roche, Basal, Switzerland,<sup>5<\/sup>Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8979700a-1ed7-420a-bcd4-409874396fcb","ControlNumber":"6790","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.

Whilst fresh frozen (FF) derived WGS data provides optimal data quality, the majority of clinical biospecimens are from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue which results in DNA damage and an increase in artifactual mutation calls. Development of analytical frameworks tailored to FFPE derived WGS data can unlock the potential of genome profiling in clinical oncology. We performed comprehensive WGS analysis on 58 matched FF\/FFPE specimens derived from 3 cancer centers. Consensus calling detected high-confidence somatic mutations across variant classes including: single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions\/deletions (indels), structural variants (SVs) and copy number aberrations (CNAs). For each sample, genome-wide mutational patterns including tumor mutational burden (TMB), SNV\/indel signatures, and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores were estimated. We developed a random forest based framework using 33 features to learn mutation patterns associated with FFPE artifacts and implemented a filtration strategy for FFPE derived WGS data within a clinical prototype analytical workflow. We identified a high degree of concordance (~91%, n=192\/210) for oncogenic variants between FF\/FFPE WGS data. Comparison of small mutation calls presented an average 2-fold increase in FFPE samples with a range up to 152x for SNVs and 43x for indels. However, this was not the case for SVs: -0.4x (range -0.8-1.4). We demonstrate that genome-wide mutation patterns were significantly affected, impacting estimates for TMB, HRD and signature contributions. On average, TMB was overestimated in FFPE (median=10.3, range: 1.4-94) versus FF (median=3.4, range:0.04-29.6). For 7 patients with evidence of HRD in FF, HRD scores did not reach statistical significance in FFPE. Mutational signatures in FFPE were enriched for COSMIC signatures 37 and 5. Our artifact classification model achieved ROC AUC of 97.5% and precision-recall of 98.9%. Post artifact filtration, precision in SNV\/indel calling was increased from 49.3% to 93.4% and 61.8% to 82.7% respectively with no effect on driver alterations. This increased global signal concordance drastically, with comparable TMB scores (median 2.4; range .03-26.1) and improved cosine similarity for SNV\/indel signatures (median 0.98; range 0.40-1). HRD was successfully detected in 7\/7 patients from FFPE derived data post filtering with probability scores ranging from 0.76-1. We demonstrate that FFPE specimens harbor a variable increase in artifactual mutation burden in SNV\/indels but not in SVs. We propose an effective filtering procedure which successfully removes FFPE related artifacts enabling accurate profiling of clinically relevant driver mutations and genome-wide mutation patterns from readily available FFPE-derived tumor specimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole genome sequencing,FFPE,Machine learning,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dylan Domenico<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gunes Gundem<sup>1<\/sup>, Max  F.

COMF mutations can impart new catalytic functions that can be applied to enable novel chemical synthesis and metabolic engineering techniques. We previously showed that the oncogenic COMF mutation IDH1 p.R132H could also be used to enable a bio-based method of adipic acid production, a valuable commodity chemical used to synthesize nylon that erstwhile required petroleum-substrates for synthesis. However, there is no high-throughput method to identify COMF mutations. Here, we present METIS (Mutated Enzymes from Tumors In silico Screen), a bioinformatic pipeline to identify COMF mutations from cancer mutational data based on the recurrence rate, genetic conservation, and predicted functionality of the mutations. We applied METIS to 210,354 cancer-derived missense mutations from the COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) database. We identified 4 candidate COMF mutations: the Cbl proto-oncogene E3 ubiquitin ligase (CBL) p.Y371H, Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 17 (GALNT17) p.R228C, solute carrier family 17 member 5 (SLC17A5) p.R364C, and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like (OGDHL) p.A400T. To determine these mutations&#8217; effect on the cellular metabolome, we performed unbiased global metabolite profiling using LC-MS\/MS and GC\/MS of HeLa cells exogenously expressing COMF candidates. OGDHL p.A400T demonstrated significant metabolic changes after FDR correction (q&#60;0.05, two-tailed Welch&#8217;s unequal variances t-test with Bonferroni correction). In particular, xanthosine, a key intermediate in purine metabolism commonly used in pharmaceutical development, was increased 2.9-fold (P = 1.2 x 10<sup>-9<\/sup>, q = 3.2 x 10<sup>-7<\/sup>). Thus, our data suggest OGDHL p.A400T could be used to improve production methods for a useful biochemical. We then deployed METIS2, which featured improved statistical, pathogenicity, and structural analysis tools to all 49 million currently-available cancer mutations within COSMIC, providing a refined panel of six candidate mutations. Consistent with the findings from initial METIS metabolomic screen, METIS2 identified OGDHLp.A400T as a COMF mutation candidate. Overall, our results detail an approach to filter cancer data for mutations that confer metabolic functions, validate that mutations identified in this way can alter the cellular metabolome, and catalog potentially-useful candidate mutations. Moreover, prediction of COMF mutations through METIS can also be applied to elucidate mechanisms of cancer initiation, progression, and\/or maintenance to identify potential therapeutic targets. As cancer mutation and structural data continue to accumulate, we expect METIS to increase in its predictive power to accurately find COMF mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Metabolomics,Cancer genetics,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kevin  J.

It is, however, challenging to identify functional interactions due to the prohibitively complex molecular landscape of the tumor-immune interfaces. We address this challenge with a statistical analysis framework, termed immuno-oncology gene interaction maps (ImogiMap). ImogiMap quantifies tumor-immune checkpoint interactions based on their co-associations with immune-associated phenotypes. The interactions are statistically validated for significance, robustness, and specificity. The outcome is a catalog of maps that quantify the interactions at the tumor-immune interface for diverse immune phenotypes and checkpoints. We demonstrate that applications of ImogiMap on immune checkpoints and T-cell dysfunction signatures genes recapitulates the previously reported interaction of SERPINB9 and immune checkpoints in the tumor microenvironment. Our analyses also suggest other immune checkpoint and T-cell dysfunction signatures interactions that are significantly associated with IFN&#947; expression in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and basal-like breast cancer. We also provide open-source software and a user-friendly web application to enable future applications and rapid adoption of ImogiMap. Such applications may guide the discovery of previously unknown tumor-immune interactions and help the identification of immunotherapy targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Tumor microenvironment,Immune checkpoint,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Behnaz Bozorgui<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elisabeth  K.
