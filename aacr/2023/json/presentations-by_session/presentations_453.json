[{"Abstract":"Most cancers achieve replicative immortality through reactivation of <i>telomerase reverse transcriptase<\/i> (<i>TERT<\/i>), the rate limiting subunit in telomerase activity. Tumors from more than 50 distinct cancer types reactivate <i>TERT <\/i>expression via mutations in the <i>TERT <\/i>promoter. Understanding how the mutations lead to activation and immortality is a central question in cancer research. Oncogenic signaling pathways including EGFR\/AMPK, MAPK, and C-MYC\/ASL, have been linked to telomere maintenance via their regulation of the mutant <i>TERT <\/i>promoter. Two mutually exclusive point mutations in the <i>TERT <\/i>promoter generate a de novo E26 Transformation Specific (ETS) binding motif that recruits the GA-Binding Protein (GABP) multimeric complex to reactivate <i>TERT <\/i>expression (Bell et al, Science 2015). Recruitment of GABP to the mutant <i>TERT <\/i>promoter facilitates the recruitment of C-MYC to the promoter (Shi et al, Mol. Cell 2022), which aids in transcriptional activation. The Hippo pathway plays a key role in development, organ size determination, and homeostasis, and has been found dysregulated in numerous cancer types. GABP is a member of the Hippo pathway, with GABP activating the promoter of the Hippo transcriptional effector Yes-associated protein (<i>YAP1<\/i>) and the Hippo pathway core kinases stimulating GABP nuclear exit (Wu et al., Cell Reports 2013). We have found that YAP and its paralogue transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are linked to mutant <i>TERT <\/i>promoter activation in glioblastoma via transcriptional activation of both <i>GABPA <\/i>and <i>MYC<\/i>. These observations suggest the Hippo pathway supports tumor immortality in glioblastoma. While immortality has proven to be an elusive target, further investigations of the signaling networks that converge on the activation of the mutant <i>TERT <\/i>promoter may reveal therapeutic targets that block tumor growth and have secondary benefit by their impact on tumor immortality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TERT,Hippo pathway,Transcription,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicholas O.

Most SCLC patients have distant metastasis at diagnosis and the 5-year survival of these patients is around 2.8%. Despite initial response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, relapses are very common. No targeted therapy is available for SCLC. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the acquisition of chemoresistance, and to identify novel targets and therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease. Recently, FOXM1 was identified as an essential component in SCLC tumor growth. Our aim is to develop FOXM1-targeted therapy to thwart SCLC progression and the development of chemoresistance. We have targeted FOXM1 using highly specific small molecule inhibitor FDI-6 and found that FOXM1 inhibition drastically reduces colony formation and cell migratory capabilities in multiple SCLC cell lines (SBC3, SBC5). Additionally, we observed that FOXM1 downregulation via FDI-6 reduced SCLC growth both as monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin. Based on these studies, we conclude that FOXM1 inhibition alone or in combination with cisplatin could be a unique therapeutic approach for SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,FOXM1,Small molecule inhibitor,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Md Arafat Khan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Parvez Khan<sup>1<\/sup>, Mahek Fatima<sup>1<\/sup>, Asad Ur Rehman<sup>1<\/sup>, Shailendra Kumar Maurya<sup>1<\/sup>, Sameer Mohiuddin<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramakanth Chirravuri Venkata<sup>1<\/sup>, Jesse L.

Nevertheless, there are few studies on the comprehensive analysis between mRNA expression of TICRR and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).<br \/>Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database of LUAD were acquired to analyze the mRNA expression between tumor and normal tissues, survival prognosis, and clinicopathology characters. The GO, KEGG, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed using the R package. The correlation of TICRR with immune cell infiltration, RNA epigenetic modification, DDR pathway, and RNA metabolism of LUAD were further explored using TCGA and GEO database.<br \/>Results: TICRR was confirmed significantly upregulated in several cancers, like LUAD, Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC), except for Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), Thyroid carcinoma (THCA), which was downregulated in tumor tissues. Cox analysis indicated the overexpression of TICRR was related to poor survival in several cancers. The KEGG enrichment showed TICRR expression positively related to cell cycle, homologous recombination, mismatch repair, DNA replication, and cysteine metabolism in LUAD. Pathway enrichment showed a close relationship with spliceosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Immune infiltration analysis revealed TICRR expression was negatively correlated with B cell expression, immune score, stromal score, and immunostimulators like IL2 (P&#60;0.001), and positively correlated with neutrophil cell expression, immune inhibitors like PD-L1 and CTLA4. Interestingly, high mRNA expression of TICRR correlates with DDR pathway signature (37 genes), 37 m6A\/m5C regulated genes, and some metabolism-regulated genes. Single-cell analysis of six LUAD samples showed that TICRR was significantly enriched in macrophage and T cells.<br \/>Conclusions: TICRR has been identified to be a prognosis biomarker in LUAD, which is involved in immune activation, pathway transportation, RNA modification, and tumor energy metabolism. TICRR can be used as a promising therapeutic target and prognosis indicator for LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Prognostic markers,TICRR,gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xunbo Zheng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Guan<sup>2<\/sup>, Chenteng Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Li Han<sup>3<\/sup>, Hanxing Huang<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Respiratory and Critical Illness Medicine, The First Hospital of Putian, Putian, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The First Hospital of Putian, Putian, China,<sup>3<\/sup>ChosenMed Technology Co.

Recently, Super-enhancers (SEs), tissue-specific clusters of enhancer elements, were found to drive cell identity genes and play an important role in tumorigenesis. However, current studies focus on SE in lung tumors but largely neglect those specific in normal lung tissues, which also provide critical data for understanding transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. For the first time, this study characterized normal-specific SE-associated genes (SEGs) in LUAD by dysregulation in tumor, prognostic significance and tumor microenvironment (TME) interactions via a comprehensive analysis of 22 bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We analyzed TCGA datasets of 10 cancer types<b>, <\/b>and additional datasets comprising 4 datasets of LUAD tumor and normal paired samples, 5 datasets of LUAD tumors with survival information, and 3 single-cell transcriptomic datasets. For each dataset, standard methods were used for data preprocessing and normalization according to its generation platforms (e.g., microarray, bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq). For downstream analyses, paired t-test and linear model were used to identify dysregulated SEGs; Cox Proportional Hazards Regression was used to evaluate their prognostic significance and LASSO was used to select features for building multivariate prognostic models; bulk data deconvolution and correlation analysis were applied to assess the association of TME cell composition and SEG expression; Gene set enrichment analysis was applied for functional analysis.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>We found normal-lung SEGs were significantly disproportionally downregulated in LUAD tumors (Chi-squared test, p &#60; 0.01), and associated with poor prognosis of patients. The patterns were consistently found in discovery (TCGA) and independent validation datasets. Interestingly, the effect appears specific to lung as such downregulation of normal-lung SEGs was also found in lung squamous cell carcinoma but not observed in most of other 8 cancer types. The downregulated SEGs were significantly involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, and stem cell pluripotency, and were enriched in tumor suppressors. Also, their downregulation correlate with reduced endothelial cells and lower immune activity with reduced B and CD8 T cells and inhibited immune target genes.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Our study characterized the genes associated to normal-specific SEs in LUAD, shedding sheds light on their role in tumorigenesis of lung cancers. Their broad downregulation indicates a significant effect of SE aberrancy in the transformation of normal cell into cancer cells with a modulation of immune microenvironment; further functional studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Expression,Regulation,Tumor suppressor,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Guoshuai Cai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yihan Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiang Cui<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Amos<sup>3<\/sup>, Feifei Xiao<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC,<sup>2<\/sup>Yale University, New Haven, CT,<sup>3<\/sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>University of Florida, Gainesville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fea0c845-c170-4036-9a97-51f3561aa12f","ControlNumber":"6522","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Here, using GEMM (Genetically Engineered Mouse Models) and human lung cancer cell lines, we delineate the role of FOXA2 in lung cancers.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: GEMM that carry mutant KRAS or mutant EGFR along with FOXA2 (CCSP-rtTA; tetO-Foxa2; tetO-Kras.G12D or tetO-EGFR.L858R) were developed allowing for lung tumor induction by doxycycline administration. The growth of lung tumors affected by FOXA2 was assessed by microCT and pathologically. FOXA2 downstream genes were also evaluated in vivo by immunohistochemistry of mouse lung sections and in vitro by gain (ectopic lentivirus transduction) and loss (siRNA) of function approaches with human lung cancer cell lines using TaqMan gene expression, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and CRISPRi analyses. FOXA2 protein expression in human lung cancer specimens was also assessed.<br \/>Data: FOXA2 suppressed the growth of EGFR-mutant lung tumors while promoting that of KRAS-mutant lung tumors in GEMM. Notably, half of the KRAS-mutant lung tumors presented invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung (IMA) with the expression of a master mucous transcription factor SPDEF and the two major IMA mucin genes MUC5AC and MUC5B. In vitro, FOXA2 induced the expression of SPDEF, MUC5AC and MUC5B by directly binding to their loci. H3K27ac was introduced at the enhancer region of MUC5AC (most highly expressed IMA gene) by FOXA2 and the expression of MUC5AC initiated by FOXA2 was enhanced by mutant KRAS.

Therefore, it is essential to expand our current knowledge of the biological processes that contribute to metastasis to guide the discovery of novel therapeutic modalities. The Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a mechanism for the acquisition of malignant cells, which causes epithelial cells with specialized cell-cell contacts to gain mesenchymal migratory capacity. High expression of the Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) transcription factor is correlated with poor clinical outcomes of cancer, including therapeutic resistance and EMT-mediated metastasis. ZEB1 has a calculated molecular weight of 125kDa; however, numerous groups have reported discrepancies in the observed molecular weight (approximately 190-250kDa). This has been attributed to dimerization mediated by post-translational modifications (PTMs). Therefore, we performed mass spectrometry and identified a novel PTM - K811 acetylation - that may regulate ZEB1 dimerization and function. To define the role of ZEB1 acetylation, we generated ZEB1 acetyl mimetic (K811Q) and deficient (K811R) mutant-expressing NSCLC cell lines. We hypothesize that ZEB1 dimerization is regulated by K811 acetylation to promote protein stability and lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. We determined that the K811R ZEB1 (125 kDa) has a shorter half-life wild-type and high ubiquitination rate than (WT) ZEB1 and K811Q ZEB1 (~225 kDa), suggesting that disruption of ZEB1 acetylation hinders its dimerization and protein stability. Further, ZEB1 dimer recruits the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex to bind the promoter of its target genes <i>mir200c-141<\/i> and <i>SEMA3F<\/i>. RNA-sequencing revealed that unlike K811R ZEB1, WT ZEB1 and K811Q ZEB1 downregulate the expression of gene sets involved in tight junction, apical junction, and cell-cell junction formation. We also identified six novel ZEB1 acetylation-dependent gene candidates that function in signaling pathways and epithelial cell maintenance; <i>CBLN3<\/i>, <i>STAP2<\/i>, <i>PLEKHG6<\/i>,<i> LAD1<\/i>,<i> RNF43<\/i>,<i> <\/i>and <i>LLGL2<\/i>. <i>In vitro<\/i> 2D migration Boyden chamber, 3D invasion assays, and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies demonstrated that ZEB1 acetylation promotes the invasive and metastatic potential of the NSCLC cell line. Our findings suggest that K811 acetylation regulates ZEB1 dimerization and stability to promote NuRD interaction and lung adenocarcinoma via EMT. Future studies are focused on assessing changes in gene expression programs and chromatin accessibility that are ZEB1 dimerization dependent and that could contribute to NSCLC metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Metastasis,Acetylation,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mabel Giselle Perez-Oquendo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Roxsan Manshouri<sup><\/sup>, Yanhua Tian<sup><\/sup>, Jared Fradette<sup><\/sup>, Don Gibbons<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ea4ba5f1-bd79-4219-a8e2-f35f10182744","ControlNumber":"5436","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Unfortunately, most patients will present with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Current treatment methods (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, FOLFIRINOX) are not sufficient for patients with late-stage disease and only modestly improve survival. Difficulties in treating PDAC lie in the characteristics of PDAC tumors. They are highly heterogeneous, have multiple signaling pathway alterations, and are highly metastatic with a dense tumor microenvironment (TME). Hence, PDAC remains one of the most lethal malignancies with a 5-year survival rate below 10%.The&nbsp;<i>KRAS<\/i>&nbsp;mutation is a hallmark of PDAC, occurring early in 95% of pancreatic neoplasms.&nbsp;The mutant KRAS protein constitutively activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway to sustain PDAC pathogenesis. Although the mutant&nbsp;<i>KRAS<\/i>&nbsp;gene is the initiating molecular alteration, chronic inflammation accelerates PDAC progression to a highly aggressive and therapy-resistant cancer. Our study shows that MAPK and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NF-&#954;B) inflammatory signaling pathway synergize to promote PDAC progression. Live cell imaging analysis of PDAC cell lines after the simultaneous hyperactivation of MAPK and NF-&#954;B signaling by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha respectively (TNF alpha), showed significant increases in cell migration. An integrated genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis (ChIPseq and RNAseq) after the&nbsp;simultaneous stimulation of both pathways&nbsp;revealed significant increases in the occupancy of the active mark, H3K27ac. This was observed around transcription start sites of a subset of genes involved in cell polarity, migration, and subtype switch, processes known to be important for tumor aggressiveness. Epigenome mapping of the transcription factors FOSL1 and RELA, which are downstream targets of the MAPK and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways respectively, show their co-occupancy in the H3K27ac-enriched regions. Furthermore, loss-of-function approaches show the synergistic effect of both MAPK and NF-&#954;B hyperactivation on the migration capacity&nbsp;<i>in vitro&nbsp;<\/i>and&nbsp;<i>in vivo<\/i>. Based on these observations, we aim to delineate the molecular mechanism involved in the synergism, investigate the role of the TME, and decipher the signaling interactions between PDAC tumor cells and cells of the TME. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the synergism between MAPK and NF-&#954;B signaling and will provide novel insights into the development of mechanism-based therapeutic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription,Pancreatic cancer,Metastasis,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joana  E.

However, the current first-line treatments have poor patient outcomes, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapeutics. The nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B) is a crucial transcription factor frequently activated constitutively in PDAC. It mediates the transcription of oncogenic and inflammatory genes that facilitate multiple PDAC phenotypes. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of NF-&#954;B activation holds substantial promise in PDAC diagnosis and new therapeutics. The purpose of this study is to identify novel regulation of NF-&#954;B, with the aim of providing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PDAC. Here, we report protein O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) - mediated NF-&#954;B activation through novel serine O-GlcNAcylation of its p65 subunit. We show that overexpression of serine-to-alanine (S-A) mutant at the O-GlcNAcylation site impaired NF-&#954;B nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity in PDAC cells. Moreover, these S-A p65 mutants downregulate NF-&#954;B-target genes important to major cancer hallmarks and inhibit cellular proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth of PDAC cells compared to WT-p65. Interestingly, this modification happens downstream of the inhibitor of NF-&#954;B (I&#954;B&#945;) degradation. Collectively, we have identified OGT-mediated serine O-GlcNAcylation of NF-&#954;B and determined its mechanistic and cellular function in driving PDAC phenotypes. Thus, our study holds great significance as it uncovers a brand-new strategy for PDAC diagnosis and effective therapeutics development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,NF-&#954;B,Glycosylation,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aishat Motolani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew Martin<sup>2<\/sup>, Benlian Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Guanglong Jiang<sup>4<\/sup>, Yunlong Liu<sup>4<\/sup>, Tao Lu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN,<sup>2<\/sup>Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Nutrition, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH,<sup>4<\/sup>Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8f7f8814-47ad-46b8-95fb-79ae73779254","ControlNumber":"2256","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

FUBP1 controls gene expression by binding to specific far upstream element (FUSE) DNA sequences of the promoters of key tumor survival genes to regulate their transcription to provide a pro-tumor phenotype (high c-Myc, low p21). This makes FUBP1 a novel therapeutic target as its inhibition reprograms tumors to an anti-cancer phenotype (low c-Myc, high p21). This report describes the development of novel anthranilic acid derivatives which bind to FUBP1 (as shown by ChIP and gel shift assays) and modulate the mRNA and protein expression (qRT-PCR and Western) of FUSE-controlled genes (e.g., c-Myc and p21). The lead compound UCF699 was shown to reprogram pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells into an anti-cancer phenotype in a dose-dependent manner and inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth.

Thus, the identification of prognostic biomarkers as well as molecular therapeutic targets should be critical. Gene expression is regulated by various factors such as transcription factors, promoters, enhancers, DNA methylation, microRNAs, etc. Among them, it has been reported that enhancers play an essential role in the development and progression of cancer. This study aims to identify the novel regulatory element of gene transcription and therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer by analyzing enhancers.<br \/>Material and Methods: We implemented NET-CAGE analysis to identify the active enhancer regions in pancreatic cancer cell lines and two immortalized normal pancreatic cell lines. As for the enhancer sequences, we conducted a motif analysis using an analytical pipeline, HOMER to capture sequence motifs enriched in the enhancers. The p-values output by HOMER were applied to identify transcription factor motifs enriched in the tumor cell lines compared to the normal cell lines. We analyzed RNA-sequencing data derived not only from 105 cases of in-house pancreatic cancer but from 178 cases of The Cancer Genome Atlas.<br \/>Results: We found that the enrichment of KLF and ELF family transcription factors was observed in cancer cell lines compared to normal cell lines. <i>ELF4<\/i> expression was significantly higher in tumor tissues than in normal tissues (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p&#60;0.05). In survival analysis, high <i>ELF4<\/i> expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis (Kaplan-Meier method, Log-rank test, p&#60;0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed ELF4 expression in the nuclei of PAAD cells, and GSEA showed a positive correlation between increased <i>ELF4<\/i> expression and the cell cycle-related gene sets and PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR-related gene sets.<br \/>Conclusions: The current result of the NET-CAGE enhancer analysis revealed that the KLF and ELF families might contribute to activating pancreatic cancer. As we know that KLF4 induces the pluripotency of somatic cells, KLF and ELF are considered to be cancer stemness-related genes. We are focusing on deciphering the regulatory element of the KLF and ELF to orchestrate downstream molecules of cancer stemness-related genes, which will lead to the intractability of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Pancreatic cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tadashi Abe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hideyuki Saito<sup>1<\/sup>, Yusuke Nakano<sup>1<\/sup>, Masahiro Hashimoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuki Ando<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuichi Hisamatsu<sup>1<\/sup>, Takeo Toshima<sup>1<\/sup>, Yusuke Yonemura<sup>1<\/sup>, Takaaki Masuda<sup>1<\/sup>, Ken Eto<sup>2<\/sup>, Toru Ikegami<sup>2<\/sup>, Koshi Mimori<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Kyushu University Beppu Hospital, Beppu, Oita, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7fc9b2e2-83a5-4161-8963-c4a5742c8772","ControlNumber":"2618","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Its expression is upregulated in a variety of cancers and is correlated with decreased overall patient survival. In normal tissues, VGLL1 is most highly expressed in placental trophoblast cells, which share attributes of rapid cellular proliferation and invasion with cancer cells. Binding of VGLL1 to TEADs shows structural similarity to co-transcriptional activators in the Hippo pathway, yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and WW Domain containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1\/TAZ). YAP\/TAZ has been implicated in tumorigenesis in many cancer types, and this structural relationship has provided insights into the functional role of VGLL1. The impact of VGLL1 expression in pancreatic cancer has not been fully elucidated and no VGLL1-targeted therapy currently exists.<br \/>The aim of this study was to evaluate the function and downstream targets of VGLL1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Ectopic expression of VGLL1 in human pancreatic cell lines PANC1 and SU8686 stimulated cancer cell proliferation and invasion, consistent with findings from other cancer types. ChIP-seq and Nanostring assays were also performed to identify VGLL1 downstream target genes and pathways. Interestingly, analysis of ChIP-seq data from VGLL1-transduced PANC1 cells identified four novel transcription factors with a VGLL1 binding motif, in addition to TEAD4 which has been previously reported. Furthermore, gene array analysis showed approximately 150 differentially expressed genes in mouse pancreatic cancer cells transduced with VGLL1, including genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Ectopic VGLL1 expression resulted in the increased expression of AP-1, MMP9, and VEGF, genes associated with cancer progression. Furthermore, VGLL1 decreased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p15, p16 and p21 that are associated with reduced cancer cell proliferation. To identify potential regulatory features of VGLL1, we performed mass spectrometry to identify phosphorylation sites and potential binding partners. Our preliminary data suggests that 14-3-3 binds to VGLL1, an intriguing finding since 14-3-3 is also known to regulate YAP\/TAZ by sequestering it in the cytoplasm upon being phosphorylated. Our results demonstrate that VGLL1 interacts with specific transcription factors such as TEAD4 in pancreatic cancer cells to modulate the expression of genes expected to promote cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, we have identified a potential regulatory molecule for VGLL1 that plays a critical role in inhibiting other co-transcription activators from translocating into the nucleus. It is hoped that this work will set the stage for the development of VGLL1-targeted therapies with which to treat patients with pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncogene,Pancreatic cancer,Transcription factor,Coactivator,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Heather M.

In this study, we performed in vitro enChIP (engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation)-sequencing to identify the KLF5 enhancer region which interacts with KLF5 promoter region. We successfully identified the KLF5 enhancer region in colorectal cancer cells and further found that KLF5 promoter region interacted with the transcription start site (TSS) region of CCAT1 gene, which is located at the different chromosome. Our results indicated that KLF5 protein participated in the core regulatory circuitry together with co-factors (BRD4, MED1, and RAD21), which contributes to construction of the three-dimensional genome structures consisting of KLF5 promoter, enhancer and CCAT1 TSS region. We also found that CCAT1 expression was highly correlated with KLF5 expression in CRC clinical samples and that KLF5 regulated CCAT1 expression. In conclusion, our data propose the mechanistic insight that KLF5 protein constructs the core regulatory circuitry with co-factors in the three-dimensional genome structure and coordinately regulates KLF5 and CCAT1 expression in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,lncRNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuhki Yokoyama<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hirofumi Yamamoto<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Molecular Pathology, Graduate School of Medicine Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ba265c3c-a7de-4be4-b6d5-0be7f9b80cdd","ControlNumber":"4324","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Therefore, novel strategies are needed to provide insight into how colon cancer can be prevented and treated, particularly before malignancy. One approach is to identify genes whose misregulation disrupts crypt-luminal colon epithelial cell migration, needed for stem cell progeny at the bottom of the crypt to transition from a highly proliferative, immature state to a growth arrested, mature phenotype near the lumen. Aberrant expression of these genes may contribute to early stages of tumorigenesis, before adoption of a malignant state. Tropomyosins, including tropomyosin 4 (TPM4), are actin-binding proteins that regulate contractility and migration in many cell types. We have shown that TPM4 RNA is overexpressed in premalignant (flat mucosa) of FAP (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis) patients 2.59 fold over the level in normal controls. Furthermore, TPM4 RNA and protein is highly overexpressed in proliferating, undifferentiated Caco2 (human adenocarcinoma) cells relative to growth-arrested, differentiated cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that TPM4 overexpression can block colon epithelial cell differentiation and induce early, premalignant events in colon epithelial cell tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether Caco2 cell clones stably overexpressing TPM4.2, the TPM4 isoform expressed in Caco2 cells, are defective in the ability to adopt a mature phenotype measured by RNA expression of differentiation-specific genes, including intestinal alkaline phosphatase (ALPi), upon induction of spontaneous differentiation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Stable TPM4.2 transfectants exhibited a 2.61-fold decreased expression of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (ALPi) relative to control transfectants after 20-21 days of spontaneous induction. Lgr5 RNA was quickly suppressed in both TPM4.2 and control transfectants upon induction of differentiation but was re-expressed in TPM4.2 transfectants 12.3 fold above control levels at day 14 of spontaneous induction. Our results suggest that proper regulation of TPM4 expression in colon epithelial cells is critical to preventing adoption of a tumorigenic state. TPM4 RNA is overexpressed in premalignant human colon tissue, and forced overexpression of TPM4 suppresses maturation and promotes proliferation in an in vitro model of colon epithelial cell differentiation. Misregulation of TPM4 gene expression may therefore block normal differentiation and induce early events in colon epithelial cell tumorigenesis. Based on these studies, we suggest that TPM4 expression levels may be used as diagnostic tools for determining tumorigenic potential and may offer therapeutic strategies for early intervention in colon cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Premalignancy,Colon cancer,Differentiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Rajsumeet Macwan<sup>1<\/sup>, Piotr  B.

It has been shown that FOXA2 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and carcinogenesis in glioma, breast cancer, hepatoma, and others. However, FOXA2 has not yet been elucidated on the tumorigenesis, proliferation, and invasion of human gastric cancer, and needs to be researched and discovered. In this study, the HGF-mediated association of FOXA2, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and cancer cell proliferation and invasion were investigated in two types of human gastric cancer cell lines.<br \/>Methods: In this study, cell culture, cDNA microarray analysis, western blotting, Real-time Polymerase chain reaction, Zymography, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, FOXA2 knock-down with short hairpin RNA (shRNA), chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, Standard two chamber invasion assay.<br \/>Results: First, we confirmed that the expression level of FOXA2 was up-regulated by HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) in human gastric cancer cells.

Our previous work has established a CRISPR\/Cas9 genome-wide knockout screening profile and developed a two-component mixture model to identify cancer-specific essential genes in 436 cancer cell lines. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that <i>RPL22L1<\/i> acts as a feature gene to predict cancer-specific essential genes in human cancer. Previous studies suggest that RPL22L1 is correlated with tumor progression and adverse prognosis in several cancer types, while its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. In the present study, we found that <i>RPL22L1<\/i> is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ES) and liver progenitor cells, which were acquired from a vitro hepatic differentiation model originating from ES cells. Hence, we hypothesized that RPL22L1 enhances cancer stem cell properties in HCC. Functional assays showed that RPL22L1 would promote sphere formation in vitro. qRT-PCR and Western Blotting results indicated that RPL22L1 could promote stemness-related gene expressions such as CD133, CD44, and SOX9 in HCC cell lines. Overexpression of RPL22L1 increased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, which was decreased when RPL22L1 was silenced with short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Extreme limiting dilution assay showed that RPL22L1 overexpression stimulated self-renewal ability in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, higher RPL22L1 expression can also promote cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, as well as drug resistance to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP). Silver nitrate staining demonstrated that RPL22L1 overexpression correlated with a larger size and number of nucleoli. The expression of RPL22L1 was also associated with adverse prognosis in HCC clinical samples. In conclusion, our study reveals aberrant ribosomal protein activity in HCC and the role of RPL22L1 in promoting HCC tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Ribosomal RNA transcription,Stemness,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>JinLin Huang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zhenyang Guo<sup>2<\/sup>, Jie Luo<sup>1<\/sup>, Beilei Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Lanqi Gong<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaona Fang<sup>1<\/sup>, Dora Lai-wan Kwong<sup>1<\/sup>, Xinyuan Guan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>2<\/sup>Shang Hai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shang Hai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"71e305dd-0262-4304-a5be-00aa096f0c31","ControlNumber":"5641","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

We recently discovered an intronic heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs79208225 (G&#62;A), near a spliceosome binding site in less than 1% of the general population but ~4% of our HCC cohort. HCC patients with the SNP had significantly longer times till recurrence (p=0.001) and better overall survival (p=0.02) compared to patients without the SNP. Using the minigene assay, we found the SNP causes exon 10 exclusion, which resulted in lower levels of full length NELF-E and the presence of a truncated NELF-E isoform that was not degraded via RNAi surveillance. We hypothesize NELF-E isoform switching is anti-tumorigenic in HCC. To investigate the effects of exon 10 exclusion, we employed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). HCC cells treated with ASOs had decreased cell proliferation and colony formation. Moreover, exon 10 exclusion enriched for the truncated NELF-E isoform and decreased full length mRNA and protein expression. Genetic models (CRISPR\/cas9) showed similar phenotypes, suggesting that the truncated NELF-E is anti-tumorigenic.

With more than 140 chemical modifications of RNA, the epitranscriptome is a central mechanism in regulating protein synthesis. Remarkably, the epitranscriptome is often altered in cancerous tumors and under stress conditions such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and anti-tumor therapies. For instance, N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), the enzyme responsible for acetylating cytidines (N4-acetylcytidine or ac4C) in RNA, is highly overexpressed in cancers such as Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Of significant relevance to cancer, NAT10 is considered an oncogenic driver in fatty acid-induced HCC. Hence, this project aims to characterize the underlying oncogenic mechanisms of the NAT10\/ac4C axis.<b> <\/b>Our data indicate that NAT10 and RNA acetylation levels are altered in response to fatty acids, ROS, and chemotherapeutic drugs. Likewise, we observed altered subcellular localization of NAT10 and ac4C in response to ROS and chemotherapeutic drugs. Building on our previous findings that NAT10-catalyzed ac4C promotes translation efficiency, our model stipulates that subcellular redistribution of the RNA acetyltransferase complexes enhances cell cycle progression, cancer cell proliferation, and cellular resilience by fine-tuning the translation of cancer driver genes. Collectively, our findings advance our understanding of how NAT10 promotes cancer growth while providing the mechanistic basis to target NAT10 for therapeutic purposes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,Translation,Gene expression,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Emmely  A.

We and others have shown that high levels of AGO2 is associated with a worse prognosis in HCC patients. Specifically, we showed AGO2 promotes HCC progression by modulating MYC mRNA stability in an RNAi-independent manner. In addition to its canonical role as an RNA binding protein, AGO2 has been demonstrated to regulate gene expression by affecting RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing through the Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) complex in <i>Drosophila<\/i>. It remains elusive how AGO2 modulates the chromatin to affect transcription. Here, we hypothesize AGO2\/NELF interactions modulate chromatin accessibility to promote HCC. Immunoprecipitation assays were employed to detect protein-protein interactions between AGO2 and the NELF complex in HCC cells. To determine the effects of AGO2 RNAi-silencing on their interaction, DICER-knockout (via CRISPR) HCC cell lines were also probed for protein-protein interactions. We found AGO2 and NELFE, a member of the NELF complex, interact in both wild-type and DICER-knockout HCC cell lines. These data suggest AGO2 may play an important role in modulating transcription through NELF. Currently, we are investigating the potential interplay between AGO2 and NELFE in modulating chromatin accessibility to promote hepatocarcinogenesis.

ROR&#945; was the first identified substrate of lysine methylation-dependent degradation. However, the mechanisms of other post-translational modifications (PTMs) that occur in ROR&#945; and p53 remain largely unknown, especially in liver cancer. Arginine methylation is a common PTM in arginine residues of nonhistone and histone proteins and affects substrate protein function and fate. We found an analogous amino acid disposition containing R37 at the ROR N-terminus compared to histone H3 residue, which is arginine methylated. Here, we provide evidence that R37 methylation-dependent degradation is carried out by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). In addition, we discovered that PRMT5 regulated the interaction between the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH and ROR&#945; through ROR&#945; arginine methylation. Arginine methylation-dependent ubiquitination-mediated ROR&#945; degradation reduced downstream target gene activation. H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased PRMT5 protein levels, consequently increasing ROR&#945; protein levels in liver cancer in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the enzymatic activities of PRMT5 were directly affected by ROS via the dissociation of PRMT5-Mep50 octamer in the methylosome complex. Taken together, ROS inhibited liver cancer progression by inducing apoptosis via PRMT5-mediated methylation of ROR&#945; combined with other histone and non-histone substrates and the ITCH axis. Our results potentiate PRMT5 as an elimination target in cancer therapy, and this additional regulatory level within ROS signaling may help identify new targets for therapeutic intervention in liver cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor,Liver cancer,Epigenetics,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ji Min Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hyunkyung Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Hyuntae Im<sup>1<\/sup>, Hee-ji Baek<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d49fe2e4-bf14-401c-878a-640be254fabc","ControlNumber":"5740","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

However, the impact of PBRM1 loss on chromatin remodeling, especially pertaining to kidney tumorigenesis, has not been examined previously. Here we show that in VHL-deficient ccRCC tumors, PBRM1 deficiency results in altered PBAF complexes that retain the association between SMARCA4 and ARID2 but disengage BRD7 from SMARCA4. The PBRM1-deficient PBAF complexes redistribute from promoter proximal regions to distal enhancer regions containing motifs of pro-tumorigenic factors including NF-&#954;B. Subsequently, PBRM1-deficient cells display heightened NF-&#954;B activity across multiple cell models. The ATPase function of SMARCA4 maintains chromatin occupancy of both pre-existing and newly acquired RELA specific to PBRM1 loss, and activates downstream target gene expression. Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib reverses NF-&#954;B activation by reducing RELA occupancy and delays growth of PBRM1-deficient tumors. In conclusion, PBRM1 safeguards the chromatin by repressing aberrant liberation of pro-tumorigenic NF-&#954;B target genes by residual PBRM1-deficient PBAF complexes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Chromatin remodeling,Epigenetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaosai Yao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Han Hong<sup>2<\/sup>, Amrita Nargund<sup>2<\/sup>, Michelle Shu Wen Ng<sup>3<\/sup>, Hong Lee Heng<sup>4<\/sup>, Zhimei Li<sup>4<\/sup>, Peiyong Guan<sup>5<\/sup>, Masahiro Sugiura<sup>6<\/sup>, Pek Lim Chu<sup>2<\/sup>, Loo Chien Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Xiaofen Ye<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Yauch<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenneth Tou-En Chang<sup>6<\/sup>, Radoslaw  M.

Cells also have membrane-less organelles (MLOs), which are formed through phase separation. Examples of MLOs include stress granules and nucleoli, where macromolecules (proteins, DNAs, RNAs) coherently and dynamically concentrate into biomolecular condensates resembling droplets in lava lamps. MLOs play central role in cellular processes - choreographed events such as transcription and RNA splicing take place in MLOs. MLOs are highly organized, and their dysregulation always led to diseases. Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the second most common RCC in America. PRCC is an aggressive cancer, yet the uncharacterized molecular etiology results in the lack of effective treatment for patients. Our lab and others have observed dysregulated oncoproteins MLOs in PRCC. However, the molecular properties and functions of these aberrant MLOs have not been characterized. The photolyase homology region of Arabidopsis thaliana Cry2 (Cry2WT) is a light-sensitive protein that self-associate with blue light exposure. We hypothesize that fusing dysregulated MLOs oncoproteins with Cry2WT will allow us to tune and study the oncoproteins condensates. We aim to develop an optogenetic model to study how oncoproteins condensates function in PRCC cells. Dysregulated oncoproteins were fused to mCherry-Cry2WT, introduced into cell line models, light-activated and imaged using a ZEISS LSM 900 microscope. We found that blue-light indeed induced proteins clustering when oncoproteins were fused to mCherry-Cry2WT but not with mCherry-Cry2WT alone. This model will allow us to tune the formation of oncoproteins condensates. Future work will involve studying how optogenetically tuned oncoproteins condensates function in PRCC patient-derived cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion proteins,Biomolecular condensates,Optogenetics,Papillary renal cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Choon Leng So<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jane Lee<sup><\/sup>, Binglin Huang<sup><\/sup>, Danfeng Cai<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch. of Public Health, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b2b67327-c812-40f4-9927-55c7d7a2fcf3","ControlNumber":"863","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Interestingly, several MAGE proteins are limited in expression to reproductive tissues but are aberrantly expressed in various types of human malignancies. We have recently demonstrated overexpression of MAGE family member A6 in advance-stage bladder cancer (<i>Cancers 13:23, 5931, 2021<\/i>). However, the mechanisms involved in MAGE gene overexpression and its coregulators are currently unknown. One hypothesis is that MAGEA6 and androgen receptor (AR) signaling is involved in the etiology of bladder cancer progression. In the present study, we determined the functional relationship between MAGEA6 and AR in bladder cancer. Treatment with DHT, an AR agonist, increased AR and MAGEA6 expression in UMUC3 and J82 bladder cancer cells at the protein and transcript level. On the contrary, exposure of cells to enzalutamide, an antiandrogen, resulted in simultaneous reduction of AR and MAGEA6 more prominently in UMUC3 cells, compared to J82 harboring low MAGEA6 transcript. Dual-sgRNA CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout of MAGEA6 in UMUC3 and J82 cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, reduced survival, and migration potential in both cell lines. An induction of S-phase and G0\/G1 phase cell cycle arrest was noted in UMUC3 and J82 cells. <i>In silico<\/i> analysis showed Arg20 and Cys557 amino acid residue of AR interacts with Asp236 and Gln106 amino acid residue of MAGEA6 through hydrogen bonds. Further confirmation of physical interaction between AR and MAGEA6, performed by immunoprecipitation of AR and probed for MAGEA6 and vice versa established interaction of AR-MAGEA6 with each other which was further confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. In conclusion, these findings confirm the oncogenic role of MAGEA6 and its physical interaction with AR may be involved in bladder cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Bladder cancer,Melanoma Antigen Gene A6,Physical interaction,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Prem Prakash Kushwaha<sup><\/sup>, Shiv Verma<sup><\/sup>, <b>Sanjay Gupta<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Urology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"aaf69c69-1fd6-4d78-9c3a-668954a5fdb6","ControlNumber":"900","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Previous studies reported that the dysregulation of <i>HOXC6<\/i><i> <\/i>gene expression plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis. HOXC6 is reportedly over-expressed in several types of human cancer, including breast, leukemia, and lung cancers. Moreover, higher expression of HOXC6 leads to lymph node metastasis. In addition, it has been also demonstrated that in prostate cancer cells, HOXC6 downregulation reduced cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Although the precise mechanisms of HOXC6 in carcinogenesis still need to be investigated. In a secondary data analysis from our previous study, we identified HOXC6 is upregulated and enriched with tumor type-specific enhancer region in HPV+HNSCC samples. Moreover, we used publicly available TCGA data consisting of 520 HNSCC samples and a JHU cohort with 47 HPV+ HNSCC samples to illustrate that HOXC6 is more highly expressed in HPV+ HNSCC than in adjacent normal samples. We further validated the HOXC6 overexpression through an in vitro study using HPV+HNSCC cell lines and patient tissue samples. Clinicopathological data from TCGA indicated that higher HOXC6 expression correlated with poor overall survival. To explore the function of HOXC6 in HNSCC, we knocked down HOXC6 in HPV+ HNSCC cells via siRNA and performed the cell proliferation assay. We observed that HOXC6 downregulation decreased the cell proliferation rate compared to control samples. In conclusion, our results suggest HOXC6 acts as an oncogenic driver in HPV+ HNSCC progression, which is potentially regulated by tumor type-specific enhancers and may serve as a potential biomarker.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Carcinoma: squamous cell,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Subhendu Roy Choudhury<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Vera Mukhina<sup><\/sup>, Iuliia Vyshkvorkina<sup><\/sup>, Jessica Gore<sup><\/sup>, Alexa Anderson<sup><\/sup>, Daria A.

CIMP-high is an aggressive ACC molecular subtype defined by global CpG island hypermethylation with paradoxical activation of adrenal differentiation (driven by master transcription factor SF1) and stemness (driven by &#946;-catenin). We show DNA hypermethylation redistributes histone methyltransferase EZH2 and its mark, H3K27me3. EZH2 inhibition remains lethal to CIMP-high ACC cells, erasing transcriptional programs without altering DNA methylation. We reconcile this phenomenon by discovery of two nuclear complexes, SF1\/&#946;-catenin and EZH2\/&#946;-catenin, present in physiology and persistent through advanced ACC. We find SF1\/&#946;-catenin is a chromatin-bound complex that controls the ACC super-enhancer landscape, while EZH2\/&#946;-catenin is restricted to off-chromatin pools. EZH2 inhibition purges SF1\/&#946;-catenin from chromatin, sparing EZH2\/&#946;-catenin, inducing dedifferentiation and restraining ACC growth in vitro and in vivo.

Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) is a cancer-testis antigen that functions as a retinoic acid receptor repressor and as a substrate recognition subunit for Cullin-2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting degradation of cell cycle regulatory factors. PRAME is ectopically expressed in both types of KC: basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The functions and clinicopathological relevance of PRAME expression in BCC and SCC are unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of PRAME on retinoid sensitivity and the pathogenesis of BCC and SCC. Cell lines representative of human BCC, SCC and immortalized keratinocytes were subjected to shRNA-mediated PRAME knockdown, PRAME knockout using CRISPR-Cas9, and ORF overexpression. Cells were treated with retinoids (all-trans retinoic acid, acitretin or tazarotene), and subjected to assays for cell proliferation (e.g., flow cytometric cell cycle analysis, label-free confluence tracking, Ki-67 immunofluorescence, etc.), cell death\/survival (e.g., clonogenic assay, caspase staining, etc.) and for retinoid-induced gene expression changes (RT-qPCR and immunoblotting, etc.). PRAME overexpression attenuated retinoid-induced changes in cytokeratin expression in immortalized keratinocytes and SCC cells. PRAME knockdown in BCC and SCC cells augmented retinoid-induced changes in cytokeratin expression. Importantly, PRAME overexpression attenuated the pro-differentiation synergy between high calcium culture conditions and retinoid treatment in immortalized keratinocytes. PRAME also altered expression of several cell cycle regulatory proteins (p14\/ARF, p16\/INK4A, p21\/Waf, p27\/Kip1, etc.), which was in turn reflected accelerated cell proliferation dynamics in some PRAME-overexpressing cell lines. PRAME also conferred increased resistance to retinoid-induced cell cycle arrest in SCC cells, which was restored by PRAME knockdown. Furthermore, PRAME expression was inversely correlated with the pro-apoptotic protein Tazarotene Inducible Gene 3 (TIG3) in SCC cells. Our results implicate PRAME in KC tumorigenesis and differentiation, and suggest that PRAME could serve as a therapeutic target to optimize the use of retinoids to manage these cancers. We propose future studies to determine the clinicopathological relevance of PRAME expression in KC, PRAME-targeting strategies to enhance retinoid sensitivity, and the use skin tissue organoid models to study the effect of PRAME on epidermal differentiation dynamics in premalignant skin and KCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Retinoids,Squamous cell carcinoma,Drug resistance,Differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brandon Liam Ramchatesingh<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ivan Litvinov<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0d532935-2772-4b28-8e07-cced7b1ea782","ControlNumber":"6298","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.
