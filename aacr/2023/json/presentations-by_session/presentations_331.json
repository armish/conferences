[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) is standard of care in stage III colon cancer. However, 50% of the patients would be cured by surgery alone and are being overtreated, while 30-35% will experience a recurrence despite adjuvant treatment, resulting in only 15-20% of the patients benefitting from ACT. Therefore, there is a need for prognostic biomarkers to better stratify this group of patients for ACT decisions. Recent observational and interventional studies in non-metastatic colon cancer have shown that detection of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood after surgery is highly prognostic for development of recurrence. Hence, ctDNA analysis is a promising approach to guide treatment decisions in stage III colon cancer, but studies with large well-defined patient cohorts are needed to prove clinical utility.<br \/>Aim: Determine the prognostic value of ctDNA in stage III colon cancer patients treated with ACT to reduce futile treatment.<br \/>Methods: 241 stage III colon cancer patients treated with ACT were included in the prospective observational study &#8220;PROVENC3&#8221; (PROgnostic Value of Early Notification by Ctdna in Colon Cancer stage 3), a substudy of the Prospective Dutch Colorectal Cancer cohort (PLCRC). The PLCRC infrastructure accrued patients with colorectal cancer in 23 participating hospitals in the Netherlands. After informed consent, blood was collected pre-surgery, post-surgery, post-ACT and every six months up to 3 years. Tumor-informed detection of ctDNA was performed through integrated whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue DNA (80x), germline DNA (40x), and plasma cell-free DNA (30x).<br \/>Results: Patient accrual was completed in 2021, with a median follow-up of 35.6 months. In total, 1090 blood samples have been collected to date. Analytical studies demonstrated a limit of detection of the test of 0.005% ctDNA utilizing contrived reference models derived from six independent cell lines, with a specificity of 99.6% across 119 noncancerous donor plasma specimens. From the PROVENC3 study, ctDNA analyses are ongoing for pre-surgery (n=68) and post-surgery (n=241 patients) blood samples. Preliminary results demonstrated a ctDNA detection rate of 93.4% pre-surgery and 17.1% post-surgery, which was associated with disease recurrence. Final analysis will enable determination of: 1) the proportion of ctDNA-positive\/negative patients after surgery and the corresponding recurrence rates; 2) the prognostic value of post-surgery ctDNA; and 3) the lead time between post-surgery ctDNA detection and recurrence.<br \/>Future Perspective: Ultimately, the results of this study will be used to model and design a ctDNA-guided interventional trial in stage III colon cancer patients, to reduce futile ACT and its associated side-effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Colon cancer,Whole genome sequencing,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carmen Rubio-Alarcon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Steven  L.

To enhance locoregional MRD sensitivity, we utilize a novel biofluid proximal to the primary tumor: the serosanguinous fluid collected by surgical drains inserted into the wound bed following regional lymph node dissection. We demonstrate that cancer-associated cfDNA in the surgical drain fluid (SDF) is a sensitive biomarker of locoregional MRD detection, risk stratification, and prognostication.<br \/>Methods: We extracted DNA from 168 SDFs, 48 paired plasmas, and 44 tumor specimens collected 24 hours after surgery from 90 patients: 74 HPV (+) oropharyngeal cancers (OPC), 8 HPV (-) oral cancers, 2 thyroid cancers, and 6 benign neck pathologies. SDFs were also collected at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery from 11 HPV (+) patients. We applied TaqMan qPCR to our specimens to quantify cell-free HPV (cf-HPV), a proxy for cancer-associated cfDNA in HPV (+) malignancies. We then measured the association between cf-HPV and extranodal extension (ENE), AJCC 8 staging, and established clinical and pathological risk criteria from 4 HPV (+) OPC clinical trials. We validated our findings using HPV next-generation sequencing. We also compared the predictive value of high-risk pathology with cf-HPV MRD for HPV (+) OPC recurrences. Lastly, we developed a second assay for cell-free BRAF V600E (cf-V600E) in thyroid cancer SDF.<br \/>Results: Serially collected SDF revealed cf-HPV decreased continuously from 0 to 24 hours postoperative, and that the 24-hour timepoint stratified detectable versus undetectable persistent residual disease. At 24 hours, SDF was significantly more enriched with cf-HPV compared to plasma (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.0001). In a subset of 9 patients, HPV genotype and detection in SDF were 100% concordant between NGS and PCR. Strikingly, SDF cf-HPV was 11-fold higher in pN2 patients versus pN1\/N0 (<i>P <\/i>= 0.02) and 15-fold higher in cases with ENE (<i>P <\/i>= 0.003), suggesting SDF reflects aggressive nodal pathology and captures locoregional MRD. When we classified our patients according to established clinical and pathological risk criteria, we found significantly higher SDF cf-HPV among high-risk patients (AUC = 0.77). Crucially, in HPV (+) patients treated with surgery alone, SDF MRD detected 100% of locoregional recurrences, while plasma MRD and high-risk pathology detected 0%. Lastly, as proof of concept, we demonstrated SDF cf-V600E detection in the context of high-risk thyroid cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: Surgical drain fluid cancer-associated cfDNA is a novel minimally invasive biomarker. Our SDF assay was strongly associated with high-risk criteria and detected locoregional relapse with 100% sensitivity compared to 0% in plasma. Our data suggest that SDF liquid biopsy is ultra-sensitive and has the potential to inform postoperative molecular-based risk stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Noah Earland<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ricardo  J.

Monitoring circulating tumor tissue modified viral (TTMV)-HPV DNA during post-treatment surveillance has emerged as a tool that has demonstrated &#62;95% positive predictive value (PPV) for detecting recurrence. Here we describe a large real-world population with detailed clinical follow-up, permitting determination of the longitudinal negative predictive value (NPV) of the assay.<br \/><b>Patients and methods:<\/b> This IRB-approved, retrospective observational cohort study included 312 patients across five U.S. centers who were &#8805;3 months post-treatment for HPV-driven OPSCC. Patients had one or more TTMV-HPV DNA results (NavDx&#174;, Naveris Laboratories) obtained during surveillance between February 2020 and January 2021. A baseline TTMV-HPV DNA test was not required. HPV status was assessed by p16 immunohistochemistry or HPV PCR\/ISH. Test results were correlated with physician-reported exam and imaging findings to assess disease status in follow-up.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The cohort was mostly male (85%), had a median age of 61 (range: 27-81), included smokers (50%), and 282 (90%) had involved nodes (N1: 204, N2: 70, N3: 8) at initial staging. Curative-intent treatment involved surgery with or without another modality in 54% of cases (169\/312). Median follow-up time was 23.5 months, and 39 patients (12.5%) had documented recurrence. Most patients had &#62;1 TTMV-HPV DNA test result &#8805;3 months post-treatment (231, 74%), with 48 (15%) having 5 or more tests. Among patients with multiple negative surveillance tests, the median time between tests was 126 days (4.2 months, range: 0.37-24.2). The first TTMV-HPV DNA surveillance test was most often performed within the first year post-treatment (195, 63%). Across 812 test results, the NPV was 99.5%. There were 4 false negative tests among patients with confirmed p16-positive (3\/4) or HPV PCR-positive (1\/4) biopsy-proven recurrence. One of these patients had a subsequent positive TTMV-HPV DNA test during salvage immunotherapy. Only one of these patients had baseline TTMV-HPV DNA testing available, which showed a low positive &#60;50 TTMV-HPV16 DNA Score, whereas the other three patients did not have a baseline result available.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our findings further support the clinical potential of monitoring circulating TTMV-HPV DNA during post-treatment surveillance. We demonstrate a very high assay NPV correlated with physician-reported outcomes. TTMV-HPV DNA can be used to assist in surveillance and could inform imaging needs and future practice guidelines for HPV-driven head and neck cancer survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,Cancer detection,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Glenn  J.

Its use for molecular classification has been extensively validated, but little is known about determinants of shedding parameters such as VAF. While it is correlated with tumor burden, characteristics of the tumor such as site of metastasis or particular mutations may have a role. Scope of this study is to elucidate these factors.<br \/>Methods: Data from advanced NSCLC patients included in two prospective cohorts who received a LB with 36-genes InVisionFirst-Lung (INI) and the 324-gene FoundationOne Liquid CDx (FMI) assays were reviewed and patients with available 18F FDG positron emission tomography scan (PET) performed within 30 days from LB were included. Total Metabolic Tumor Volume was calculated for each PET with a 42% SUVmax threshold. The higher VAF (mVAF) was calculated for each LB, excluding germline mutations and clonal hematopoiesis-related variants. Patients should be either untreated or with progressive disease at the time of LB. Regression analysis was performed according to a rank-based estimation model.<br \/>Results: Overall 301 LB were included, 119 with InVisionFirst-Lung and 182 with FoundationOne Liquid CDx. LB were contributive in 154 (85%) FMI and 102 (86%) INI. MaxVAF was correlated with tMTV in FMI ( rho 0.3571, p 0.0004) and IVI (rho 0.3387, p = 0.0003) cohort. In FMI cohort, median mVAF was higher for TP53 mutant vs wt (n= 111, mVAF 21.1 % vs 8.0%, p &#60; 0.0001), RB1 mutant (n = 11, mVAF 26.3% vs 4.7%, p 0.0103) and in those with liver metastasis ( p 0.0089). LDH was correlated to mVAF (rho 0.280, p = 0.0037). In multivariate model, tMTV (p &#60; 0.0001), TP53 mutation ( p 0.0039), RB1 mutation (p 0.0003) and liver metastasis ( p 0.0371) remained significantly associated with mVAF. When LDH was added to the model (LDH available for 119 pts), tMTV lost its significance (p 0.561). In INI cohort, median mVAF was also higher in patients with TP53 mutation ( 7.1% vs 3%, p 0.0038), in patients with liver metastasis ( 10.1% vs 4.6%, p 0.0299), and it was correlated with tMTV (rho 0.502, p &#60; 0.0001). It was confirmed in a multivariate model (p &#60; 0.0001 for tMTV and 0.0049 for TP53). Correlation between mVAF and LDH was also seen (LDH available for 54 pts, rho 0.591, p &#60; 0.0001). Among patients with liver metastasis, mVAF was correlated with MTV of liver lesions in FMI (n = 30, rho = 0.212, p = 0.0069) and INI cohort (n= 26, rho 0.204, p 0.0313). Overall, in patients with LDH &#60; ULN, 18 \/ 103 were non contributive, vs 4 \/ 70 in those with LDH &#62; ULN.<br \/>Conclusion: In patients with aNSCLC, mVAF depends on disease burden, on the molecular characteristics of the disease and on the presence and extent of liver disease. LDH levels above ULN predict the presence of ctDNA and percentage of mVAF.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer,Positron emission tomography (PET),TP53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Filippo Gustavo Dall'Olio<sup>1<\/sup>, Damien Vasseur<sup>1<\/sup>, Camilo Garcia<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Arianna Marinello<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mihaela Aldea<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Mezquita<sup>3<\/sup>, Jordi Remon<sup>1<\/sup>, Anas Gazzah<sup>4<\/sup>, Marco Tagliamento<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristi Beshiri<sup>4<\/sup>, Pernelle Lavaud<sup>1<\/sup>, Maud Ngocamus<sup>4<\/sup>, David Planchard<sup>1<\/sup>, Etienne Rouleau<sup>1<\/sup>, Antoine Italiano<sup>4<\/sup>, Benjamin Besse<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Nuclear Medicine, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>4<\/sup>DITEP, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"54cd7c0f-bb40-4727-ab1d-2fa6b56dc7a7","ControlNumber":"3808","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

For this retrospective biomarker study, we hypothesized that decreases in ctDNA after 6 weeks of therapy, as measured from a novel low-pass, whole genome methylation sequencing assay from Foundation Medicine, will have greater discriminatory power to distinguish overall survival (OS) than PSA alone in a post-abiraterone mCRPC setting.<br \/>Methods: Pre-treatment and C3D1 plasma samples from IMbassador250 were sequenced using a novel research assay that examines global copy number changes and methylation patterns through low pass, whole genome sequencing from Foundation Medicine. Kinetic changes in ctDNA were estimated between pre-treatment and C3D1 timepoints and patients were dichotomized into significant decreases vs. not using a predefined cutoff. PSA was examined as both 50% reduction from baseline to disease progression as well as a cutoff that matched the prevalence captured by the ctDNA reduction group at C3D1. Cox proportional hazards were calculated from Kaplan-Meier survival plots of overall survival between the reduction vs. no reduction groups.<br \/>Results: Stratifying OS according to PSA 50% reduction from baseline to disease progression yielded an HR = 2.71 (95%CI:2.04-3.62). 370 patients (48%) had available ctDNA at both C1D1 and C3D1, and the median OS (mOS) in the reduction vs. non-reduction groups were 17.4 vs. 9.1 months, respectively (HR of 3.01; 95%CI:1.96-4.64). Evaluation of PSA reduction at C3D1 in the patients with available ctDNA yielded mOS of 16.3 and 9.5 months in the reduction vs. non-reduction groups, respectively (HR=2.70; 95%CI:1.77-4.12). Spearman&#8217;s correlation of ctDNA fold change between the research assay and an orthogonal FDA approved liquid biopsy assay was 0.95.<br \/>Discussion: In this study, early ctDNA kinetic changes provided numerically superior estimation of overall survival compared to PSA in mCRPC patients receiving enzalutamide +\/- atezolizumab in the post-abiraterone setting. Furthermore, ctDNA kinetic changes through C3D1 were apparent mostly prior to both PSA 50 and radiographic progression (6 weeks vs mean 3.3 months), providing a non-invasive strategy that is independent of PSA for monitoring therapy response when the disease is less AR dependent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Methylation,Prognostic markers,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher Sweeney<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chang Xu<sup>2<\/sup>, Jie He<sup>2<\/sup>, Amanda Young<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexander Robertson<sup>2<\/sup>, Russell Petry<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Zollinger<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexander Fine<sup>2<\/sup>, Neil Peterman<sup>2<\/sup>, Eliana Polisecki<sup>2<\/sup>, Tyler Warner<sup>2<\/sup>, Kobe Yuen<sup>3<\/sup>, Yanmei Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Zoe Assaf<sup>3<\/sup>, Ryon Graf<sup>2<\/sup>, Sanjeev Mariathasan<sup>3<\/sup>, Priti Hegde<sup>2<\/sup>, David Fabrizio<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Powles<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Foundation Medicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA,<sup>4<\/sup>Saint Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a6029a3f-5400-4209-80e3-379282d6f9d1","ControlNumber":"3045","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Overall, 28 patients were treated with adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy, and 31 experienced recurrence. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues at surgery were available for 41 patients. Serial contributive ctDNA were retrieved from all 41 patients at the date of surgery, 36 patients within 19 weeks after surgery, 20 patients at six months after surgery, and 22 patients at recurrence. Tissue DNA was personalized detected with a custom NGS panel of 571 genes (DRAGON) and ctDNA was sequenced using another personalized dedicated NGS panel including up to 15 genes (OncoFOLLOW).<br \/>Results: Most frequently mutated genes in tissue included <i>TP53<\/i> (15.9%), <i>FAT1<\/i> (6.7%), <i>NOTCH1 <\/i>(5.5%) and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (4.3%) with similar allelic ratio to ctDNA at baseline surgery.

Twenty-three\/36 patients (64%) had detected ctDNA within 19 weeks after surgery among whom, 17\/23 patients (74%) had disease recurrence. Eleven\/20 patients (including 10 with adjuvant treatment) had detected ctDNA at six months after surgery among whom 6 patients (55%) had disease recurrence.

Thanks to their systemic availability in body fluids and their role in tumor pathogenesis, tdEVs have gained attention in the liquid biopsy area, as a possible biomarker for tumor diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring and also as possible therapeutic targets. Beyond being a target for the capture of CTCs, the Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) was also recently employed for the detection of EVs released by tumors. Here we present a method (for research use only) based on the CellMag&#8482; technology (Menarini Silicon Biosystems, MSB) to carry out parallel enrichment of EVs and CTCs from whole blood through an EpCAM-based magnetic enrichment.<br \/>Method: Whole blood samples from stage III\/IV prostate (n=5) or breast cancer patients (n=6) and healthy donors (n=4) were collected in CellRescue&#8482; tubes (MSB). After centrifugation, EpCAM+ EVs and CTCs were enriched from the plasma and cell fraction respectively, using the CellMag&#8482; Epithelial CTC kit (MSB); CTCs were counted at the CellTracks Analyzer II (MSB). EVs were enriched for qualitative evaluation by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and for miRNA analysis by Real-time PCR, using the TaqMan&#8482; Advanced miRNA Human Serum\/Plasma panel.<br \/>Results: CTCs counts ranged from 0 to 68; TEM analysis showed a higher density of EpCAM+ extracellular microvesicles (0,1-1&#181;m) in breast cancer patients&#8217; samples (n=2) compared to controls (n=2). Endogenous hsa-miR-16-5p control was detected in all analyzed samples (n=9 patients&#8217; samples, n=2 controls). One control and two patients&#8217; samples were tested for a panel of 188 serum\/plasma miRNAs. In both the breast and the prostate cancer patients a higher percentage of miRNAs was found with respect to healthy control (31%, 32% vs. 17%). Among these, several oncogenic miRNAs with diagnostic and prognostic value (such as hsa-miR-125b-5p or hsa-miR-26a-5p) were exclusively found in patients&#8217; samples, and further confirmed to be related to ErbB2 pathway in breast cancer using the miRPathDB 2.0 database, despite the CTCs count was 0 for both these patients&#8217; samples.<br \/><i><\/i> Conclusions: The described multi-target liquid biopsy approach enabled the combined enrichment of EpCAM+ CTCs and plasma EpCAM+ EVs from a single blood sample, along with their molecular analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Extracellular vesicles,Circulating tumor cells,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Giulia Bregola<sup>1<\/sup>, Martina Masotti<sup>2<\/sup>, Valentina Mattei<sup>2<\/sup>, Martina Moras<sup>2<\/sup>, Claudio Ratti<sup>3<\/sup>, Francesco Picardo<sup>1<\/sup>, Cecilia Simonelli<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolò Manaresi<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Francesca Fontana<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Castel Maggiore, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Alten, Bologna, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b5685d99-d9f3-4ecf-b15b-84435aa352dc","ControlNumber":"3399","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

Phase I (dose finding) and Phase II (efficacy) trials are increasingly merging, and newer &#8220;Phase IB&#8221; trials need to more rapidly assess drug activity with fewer patients. Moreover, emerging immunotherapies can induce a therapeutic effect with atypical response kinetics on imaging that differ from those classically observed with cytotoxic therapies. Noninvasive assessment of response using a blood biomarker such as cell free DNA (cfDNA) could complement tumor imaging as an early marker of response. Here we report on serial measurements of HPV16 E7 cfDNA by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) from plasma of patients in a Phase I trial of CUE-101 in HPV16+ recurrent\/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).<br \/>Methods\/Results: 49 patients with HPV16+ HNSCC have been enrolled in the monotherapy arm of this Phase I dose escalation and expansion trial of CUE-101 monotherapy (NCT03978689). CUE-101 is a fusion protein comprised of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, HLA-A*0201; an immunodominant peptide epitope derived from the HPV16 E7 protein; 4 molecules of a reduced affinity human interleukin-2 (IL-2); and an effector attenuated&#8209; human IgG1 Fc domain. The monotherapy dose escalation arm spanned 7 dose levels, ranging from 0.06 to 8 mg\/kg administered by IV infusion once every 3 weeks. Plasma samples were collected at screening and longitudinally prior to dosing in subsequent treatment cycles. HPV16 cfDNA was assayed by a previously validated ddPCR assay. Matched screening and cycle 3 plasma samples were available for 33 patients where HPV16 cfDNA was present at detectable levels. A positive plasma response, defined as a decrease of HPV cfDNA from first to second draw, was observed in 12\/33 (36.5%) patients, 6 of whom (50.0%) had &#8805; 50% decrease in HPV cfDNA. The most robust reductions of HPV16 cfDNA were observed at the 2 mg\/kg and 4 mg\/kg dose levels, with peak decreases of circulating HPV16 E7 cfDNA of 53.7% and 100%, respectively. Nevertheless, durable stable disease and clinical benefit following CUE-101 treatment was observed in patients with or without HPV cfDNA reduction at C3D1. Ongoing maturation of overall survival data in patients receiving CUE-101 monotherapy will enable exploration of correlations with changes in HPV16 cfDNA at early timepoints following initiation of treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data support the continued assessment of HPV16 cfDNA as an exploratory biomarker in patients receiving immunotherapy to better understand correlations with radiographic response assessments and overall clinical benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phase I,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Liquid biopsies,Human papillomavirus (HPV),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Benjamin Hanna<sup>1<\/sup>, Grace Heavey<sup>1<\/sup>, Apollina Goel<sup>2<\/sup>, Steven Quayle<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Yanan Kuang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cloud Paweletz<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Cue Biopharma, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"76f8e225-c30d-4b11-a506-ba5de2ca87a5","ControlNumber":"3741","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

However, detection of variants related to clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a major confounder that significantly impairs the clinical utility of liquid biopsies. Here we developed a machine-learning model to determine tumor versus CH origin of variants identified in plasma-only NGS.<br \/>Methods: We assembled a training cohort of 352 variants identified by targeted deep plasma sequencing from 199 patients with stage I-IV breast, colorectal, esophageal, lung, and ovarian cancer, coupled with matched white blood cell (WBC) and tumor tissue NGS to allow determination of the reference origin for each plasma variant. We employed Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to integrate fragment, variant, gene, and patient level features to predict tumor versus CH plasma variant origin, evaluating the performance of this approach within the training cohort using 10-fold cross-validation. We applied the fixed model to two independent validation cohorts: a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cohort comprising of 74 variants from targeted plasma NGS from 26 patients and a multi-cancer cohort of 409 variants detected using the MSK-Impact panel from 74 patients with breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.<br \/>Results: Variant allele frequencies (VAF) did not differentiate tumor from CH variants, as the VAFs between tumor (median VAF 0.53%) and CH (median VAF 0.409%) variants in the training cohort were largely overlapping (area under the ROC curve-AUC 0.54, 95% confidence interval-CI 0.48-0.61). Similarly, individual fragmentomic features (mutant fragment length, cut points, and endpoint motifs) had limited ability to distinguish tumor from CH variants (AUC range 0.51-0.76). Using serial plasma samples, we identified stable statistical measures of differences in fragment feature distributions between mutant and wild type fragments; these were subsequently incorporated into an XGBoost machine-learning model along with variant, gene and patient features to predict tumor versus CH variant origin. Our model predicted variant origin with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.87-1) from 10-fold cross validation in the training cohort. The performance of the model was tested in independent SCLC and multi-cancer validation cohorts; the fixed model predicted plasma variant origin with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.73-1) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.86-0.92) respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: We developed a machine-learning model that integrates patient, gene, variant and fragment features to predict tumor versus CH origin of plasma variants across solid tumors and NGS sequencing platforms. The ability to identify bona fide tumor variants in plasma-only sequencing fills a critical need in the clinical implementation of liquid biopsy-guided cancer therapy by reducing misinterpretation due to CH contamination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Machine learning,Circulating tumor DNA,cfDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jenna  V.

The field of liquid biopsies is of enormous interest for noninvasive monitoring of cancer progression and response to treatment. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, are nanoparticles found in all biological fluids. These cell-derived, small secreted vesicles convey biological information, either by surface-to-surface interaction or by shuttling bioactive molecules to a recipient cell&#8217;s cytoplasm. Because EVs harbor the cargos of their original cells, their contents may be useful as biomarkers to follow drug activity. (F. Urabi et al., 2020). We compared the effects of YAP1\/TEAD inhibitor treatment on intracellular and EV-encapsulated mRNAs in three compound-sensitive tumor cell lines (and one insensitive cell line) based on TEAD inhibitor IC50 assay profiles. Cell lines were treated at four doses of YAP1\/TEAD inhibitor (0.0 &#181;M, 0.3 &#181;M, 1.0 &#181;M &#38; 3.0 &#181;M) for 24h. EVs and intracellular RNAs were isolated and profiled by RNAseq. To estimate YAP1\/TEAD pathway activity, we used a transcriptomic signature identified previously by our group (L. Calvet et al., 2022) and we showed that the effects of YAP1\/TEAD inhibitor treatment on the YAP1\/TEAD score in intracellular mRNAs corresponded to a decrease of the score in EV-secreted RNAs. In addition, we ran an unbiased analysis to identify single transcripts in the EVs that were modulated by YAP1\/TEAD inhibitor. One of the best markers identified by regression analysis was CYR61, that is part of the signature and is a well-established downstream target of YAP\/TEAD pathway. In conclusion, these results suggest that the YAP1\/TEAD signature in EV mRNAs represents a relevant PD biomarker to monitor YAP1\/TEAD inhibitor activity and could potentially serve as a noninvasive liquid biopsy-based biomarker detection in the clinic.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{DB066A98-E530-4E50-8B33-802AB3808FAF}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,Pharmacodynamics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Manoel Nunes<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emmanuel Spanakis<sup>1<\/sup>, Wilson Dos-Santos-Bele<sup>1<\/sup>, Emilia Rabia<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephane soubigou<sup>1<\/sup>, Gaelle Muzard<sup>1<\/sup>, Odette dos-Santos<sup>2<\/sup>, Jack Pollard<sup>3<\/sup>, Angela Hadjipanayis<sup>3<\/sup>, Fabien Delahaye<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivier Venier<sup>2<\/sup>, Laurent Debussche<sup>2<\/sup>, Don Jackson<sup>3<\/sup>, Colette Dib<sup>1<\/sup>, Iris Valtingojer<sup>2<\/sup>, Matteo Cesaroni<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Precision Oncology, Sanofi, Vitry-sur-Seine, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Molecular Oncology, Sanofi, Vitry-sur-Seine, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Precision Oncology, Sanofi, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bc5246de-131b-4506-884d-09fb8cffcce6","ControlNumber":"4409","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

MRD assays for lymphomas are mostly performed in research settings due to lack of harmonized methods, heterogeneity of diseases, and need for a primary tumor sample. We explored the feasibility of a pan hematologic malignancy classifier (&#8220;pan heme classifier&#8221;) based on GRAIL&#8217;s methylation platform as a potential tumor-agnostic plasma-based MRD assay for hematologic malignancies.<br \/>Methods: First, 428 plasma samples from various hematologic malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and multiple myeloma (MM) were blindly tested retrospectively using the pan heme classifier. The majority of samples (375\/428; 88%) were from relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) disease. Cancer signal detection and signal origin prediction were explored at various detection thresholds. Next, sensitivity of the pan heme classifier was evaluated using 74 (22 and 14 unique patients in CLL and MCL, respectively) post-treatment samples with orthogonal methods (flow cytometry in CLL and clonoSEQ in MCL). Finally, dilution experiments were carried out in 4 DLBCL and 4 CLL patient samples.<br \/>Results: Of 428 samples, 408 (95%) passed quality control. At a prespecified detection threshold, we observed high (91%) cancer detection rate with high cancer signal origin<br \/>accuracies: 100% in CLL, &#62;98% in MM, &#62;95% in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL, FL, MCL), and 87% in AML samples. As expected, targeting lower detection thresholds resulted in increased cancer-positive calls. Cancer was reproducibly detected in 48 of 54 (89%) cases where paired samples were taken prior to treatment (screening and cycle 1, day 1), demonstrating high biologic reproducibility. Analysis of posttreatment CLL and MCL samples with cell-based orthogonal MRD assays suggests the current assay limit of detection (LOD) is ~10<sup>-3<\/sup>-10<sup>-4<\/sup> MVAF (a methylation-based tumor fraction estimate). These data suggest that cancer signal score is strongly correlated to the observed MVAF. Furthermore, serially diluted DLBCL and CLL patient plasma samples were spiked into healthy volunteer plasma samples, suggesting an LOD of 10<sup>-4<\/sup> MVAF.<br \/>Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the pan heme classifier can identify cancer signal from R\/R patients across multiple hematologic malignancies. We are currently working to further optimize the assay&#8217;s specificity and sensitivity. These results support the development of a blood-based tumor agnostic methylated ctDNA MRD assay with potential utility in several hematologic indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Methylation,Biomarkers,Malignant progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Veerendra Munugalavadla<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gary de Jesus<sup>1<\/sup>, Aleksandra Markovets<sup>2<\/sup>, Qinwen Liu<sup>3<\/sup>, Oliver Venn<sup>3<\/sup>, Rafael White<sup>1<\/sup>, Giulia Fabbri<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul Labrousse<sup>2<\/sup>, Dan Stetson<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian Dougherty<sup>2<\/sup>, Darren Hodgson<sup>4<\/sup>, Jill Walker<sup>4<\/sup>, Anas Younes<sup>5<\/sup>, Daniel Auclair<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>AstraZeneca, Waltham, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Grail, LLC, a subsidiary of Illumina, Inc., Menlo Park, CA,<sup>4<\/sup>AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>5<\/sup>AstraZeneca, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"881bcf1c-20a6-4320-81f6-5054d8f1468c","ControlNumber":"2820","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;V.

They grow independent of the androgen receptor, progress rapidly and can show traits of neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. As progression to AVPC is not well detected by prostate specific antigen monitoring, new biomarkers are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in combination with gene expression analysis of NE genes to identify AVPC patients with neuroendocrine traits.<br \/>Blood samples were collected from patients suffering from AVPC (n=78, including 25 patients with histological evidence of NEPC) as well as from patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) as controls (n=12) at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. CTC counts were determined by CellSearch analysis. In parallel, CTCs were immuno-magnetically enriched using the AdnaTest and bulk gene expression of prostate-specific and NE genes was analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR. From a subset of patients, CTCs were additionally enriched by Parsortix to compare gene expression of CTCs with EpCAM-based or size-based CTC enrichment.<br \/>Using CellSearch analysis, CTCs were found in 88.9 % of AVPC patients. CTC counts ranged between 0 &#8211; 20,000 CTCs\/7.5 ml of blood with a median of 32 CTCs\/7.5 ml. Similarly, 81.8 % of NEPC patients were positive for CTCs with a median count of 35 CTCs\/7.5 ml (range 0-13,000). In contrast, CTCs were found in only 50 % of HSPC patients at lower concentrations (median count of 0.5 CTCs\/7.5 ml, range 0-34). CTC counts were significantly elevated in AVPC and NEPC patients compared to HSPC (p = 0.002, p = 0.012), but no significant differences were found between AVPC and NEPC samples.In 93.8 % of AVPC samples, CTCs expressed prostate-specific genes such as <i>KLK3<\/i> or <i>PSMA<\/i>. At least one of the NE transcripts was detected in 37.5 % of AVPC patients. In CTCs from NEPC patients, the positivity for prostate markers was significantly reduced to 66.6 % (p = 0.01) and the positivity for NE markers was increased to 61.1&nbsp;%. A random Forrest model trained on all analyzed transcripts allowed for a distinction of HSPC and NEPC with an AUC of 79.5 %. Comparison of CTC enrichment strategies in a subset of 13 patients showed similar NE marker detection by size-based enrichment (53.8 % NE-positive) compared to the AdnaTest (61.5 % NE-positive).<br \/>AVPC and NEPC patients show a high CTC burden that will allow subsequent molecular analyses, and CTC counts allowed a distinction between blood samples from HSPC and NEPC patients. Gene expression analysis revealed a high degree of inter-patient heterogeneity for neuroendocrine-specific transcripts with a reduction of prostate markers in NEPC patients. Future molecular characterization and longitudinal monitoring of CTCs will shed more light on the evolution of AVPC and NEPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine differentiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lina Merkens<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sarah Greimeier<sup><\/sup>, Sabine Riethdorf<sup><\/sup>, Klaus Pantel<sup><\/sup>, Gunhild von Amsberg<sup><\/sup>, Stefan Werner<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8d6dc32b-6bbd-4089-9039-5fca14f6bba8","ControlNumber":"6017","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Advances in sequencing methods have significantly improved the performance of liquid biopsies. Yet, despite these advances, sensitivity remains a fundamental challenge. In oncology, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) screening tests only detect 20-40% of stage I tumors and tests for minimal residual disease have only 25-50% sensitivity after surgery. The major barrier to better sensitivity is the intrinsic low level of ctDNA in plasma. Physical absence of tumor DNA molecules in a blood draw from a patient with low disease burden will result in a negative test, no matter the sensitivity of the <i>ex vivo<\/i> detection platform. To overcome this barrier, here we report a first-in-class intravenous DNA-binding priming agent that is given 2 hours prior to a blood draw to recover more ctDNA, boosting the detection of tumor mutations in plasma by 19-fold and increasing sensitivity from 6% to 84%. Given the rapid clearance of cfDNA from circulation, we reasoned that a priming agent that could bind and protect cfDNA from clearance could increase the tumor DNA recovered from plasma. We selected monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as the class of molecules to use as cfDNA protectors given their persistence in circulation and ease of engineering. We identify a mAb that binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and find on electrophoretic mobility shift assays that it binds both free and histone-bound dsDNA, the constituent components of cfDNA. We then demonstrate that this mAb can delay the clearance of dsDNA from plasma <i>in vivo<\/i> through co-injection of the mAb with free- and histone-bound dsDNA in mice. We further identify interactions with Fc-gamma-receptors as a key mediator of early clearance of dsDNA bound to the priming mAb. To address this early clearance and limit potential immune interactions, we engineer the mAb to abrogate its Fc effector function. The engineered variant decreases clearance of injected dsDNA by over 150-fold at one hour post-injection compared to dsDNA alone. We next evaluate the effect of our priming mAb on cancer detection. We use a targeted panel against 1,822 mutations in the MC26 murine colon carcinoma cell line to detect tumor mutations in the plasma of tumor bearing mice. The priming mAb results in 19-fold higher recovery of tumor DNA molecules compared to a control mAb. This improved recovery leads to detection of 77% of targeted sites in plasma compared to only 15% in the control group. In sensitivity analyses, higher recovery of mutant molecules improves sensitivity for cancer detection from 6% to 84% at 0.001% tumor fraction. In summary, we demonstrate an approach to overcome a key barrier in liquid biopsies. We envision that similar to contrast agents in clinical imaging, priming agents could significantly boost the diagnostic sensitivity of liquid biopsies and enable further applications across biomedicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,Antibody engineering,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shervin Tabrizi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Carmen Martin-Alonso<sup>2<\/sup>, Kan Xiong<sup>3<\/sup>, Timothy Blewett<sup>3<\/sup>, Sainetra Sridhar<sup>3<\/sup>, Zhenyi An<sup>3<\/sup>, Sahil Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Sergio Rodriguez-Aponte<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Naranjo<sup>2<\/sup>, Douglas Shea<sup>3<\/sup>, Todd Golub<sup>3<\/sup>, Sangeeta  N.

Currently, the final CTC identification is performed by human reviewers through visual assessment, which is a time-consuming procedure that could be affected by subjective interpretations. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods can provide a solution by automating the process of CTC identification, thus eliminating subjectivity and producing faster and more reproducible results. We have recently presented an automated algorithm (for research use only) based on deep learning models for cell segmentation and classification which allows the automated identification of CTCs in CELLSEARCH&#174; fluorescent images (Ansaloni et al., EACR 2022). The purpose of this study was to assess inter-rater variability among human reviewers and to compare the AI performance against them.<br \/>Methods: Blood samples derived from metastatic cancer patients were processed with CELLTRACKS&#174; AUTOPREP&#174;. The AI algorithm was trained on fluorescent images of 7255 CTCs and 32876 non-CTC events (training set) acquired by CELLTRACKS ANALYZER II&#174; (CTAII) from 90 breast, 122 prostate and 54 colorectal cancer samples. 10 human reviewers, qualified for CTC image analysis, performed blind labeling of a separate dataset independently (test set: 55 samples taken from 27 breast and 28 prostate cancer). We studied inter-rater agreement and variability using Fleiss Kappa and Coefficient of Variation (CV). The labels provided by 5 experienced reviewers (average experience &#8773; 15 years) were used to generate the ground truth (GT) by majority voting. The CTC detection performance of the AI was ranked against the other 5 reviewers (average experience &#8773; 5 years).<br \/>Results: In the test dataset, 2990 out of 9554 events were identified as CTCs by the GT review on CTAII images. In the task of classifying each event as CTC or non-CTC, the inter-rater agreement among the 10 human reviewers measured by Fleiss Kappa was 0.85. These classification results provided the number of CTCs per patient counted by each reviewer. The inter-rater variability on the CTC enumeration among the 10 reviewers was evaluated for each sample (median CV = 17.9% and interquartile range = 17.6% , excluding 27 samples with mode = 0 CTC). Measured against the GT classification, the AI performance (accuracy = 94.7%; F1 = 91.6%) was at the top of the human reviewers&#8217; ranking (accuracy = 92.4 - 93.6 - 93.8 - 94.0 - 95.8%; F1 = 86.8 - 89.2 - 89.2 - 89.5 - 93.1%).<br \/>Conclusion: The AI algorithm reached top-ranking performance in CTC identification, surpassing 4 out of 5 expert reviewers. These results show the applicability of AI to cell classification to remove human subjectivity from the review process and to maximize standardization among different research centers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Luca Biasiolli<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Pietro Ansaloni<sup><\/sup>, Nicolò Gentili<sup><\/sup>, Ramona Miserendino<sup><\/sup>, Chiara Rossi<sup><\/sup>, Giulio Signorini<sup><\/sup>, Gianni Medoro<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Castel Maggiore (Bologna), Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bc210b0a-2141-4fea-9074-b17da3b1d1e0","ControlNumber":"3621","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

Here we employed longitudinal liquid biopsies to dynamically assess clinical outcomes with neoadjuvant immuno-chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal\/gastroesophageal junction (E\/GEJ) cancer.<br \/>Methods: We utilized targeted error-correction sequencing to perform high-depth ctDNA next-generation sequencing for 141 serial plasma and 32 matched white blood cell (WBC) DNA samples from 32 patients with operable stage II\/III E\/GEJ cancer that received neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with chemoradiotherapy prior to surgery (NCT03044613). ctDNA analyses were performed at baseline, post-ICB induction, after completion of chemoradiotherapy (pre-op), and post-operatively (post-op). Using a tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed panel NGS approach we determined the cellular origin of plasma variants, filtering out germline and clonal hematopoiesis (CH) variants and evaluated ctDNA clonal dynamics over time. Molecular MRD was evaluated post-ICB, pre-op and post-op and correlated with recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: Twenty out of 32 patients had detectable ctDNA at any timepoint. Of the 12 patients with undetectable ctDNA, 9 had only CH- and\/or germline-derived variants, while 3 patients had no detectable variants of any origin. ctDNA clearance post-ICB was correlated with tumor regression &#62;80% at the time of resection (Fischer&#8217;s exact p=0.04). The subset of patients that did not attain complete pathologic response was heterogeneous with respect to ctDNA dynamics; such that ctDNA clearance pre-op identified patients with longer OS despite residual tumor of &#62;0% at the time of resection (log rank p=0.06). Patients with undetectable ctDNA or ctDNA clearance pre-op had a longer RFS (log rank p=0.007) and OS (log rank p=0.03). Molecular MRD was associated with RFS and OS such that patients with ctDNA clearance post-op had longer RFS (log-rank p=0.007) and OS (log-rank p=0.017).<br \/>Conclusion: ctDNA clearance post-ICB, pre-op and post-op reflects differential clinical outcomes for patients with E\/GEJ cancer receiving neoadjuvant immuno-chemoradiotherapy. Understanding ctDNA dynamics and their relationship with pathological response and long-term outcomes can help identify patients at higher risk for recurrence and open a therapeutic window for future intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Blair V.

First generation ctDNA MRD assays that employ tumor-informed approaches to track single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have limits of detection (LOD95) of ~1E-4 and have high positive predictive values for recurrence. However, they have suboptimal clinical sensitivity, with false negative results at the completion of therapy in most patients who will ultimately recur. PhasED-Seq is a novel ctDNA MRD method that tracks multiple &#8220;phased&#8221; variants (PVs) within individual DNA fragments with a LOD95 ~100-fold better than first generation assays. Here we report PhasED-Seq ctDNA MRD results for the first prospective cohort of early stage NSCLC patients.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tumor tissues (n=46), PBMCs (n=46) and plasma samples (n=169) from 46 Stage I-III NSCLC patients treated with curative intent were prospectively collected at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. All patients underwent resection and received neoadjuvant +\/- adjuvant therapy (n=14), adjuvant therapy only (n=17), or neither (n=15). Samples were analyzed in Foresight Diagnostics' CLIA laboratory (Aurora, CO) using personalized PhasED-Seq. Briefly, PVs were identified via whole genome sequencing of tumors and matched blood germline DNA. Custom capture panels targeting PVs were synthesized and used to assess MRD status in pre-, on- and post-treatment plasma samples. Detection of ctDNA MRD was assessed at a post-treatment landmark, defined as the first post-therapy sample or when not available the last post-surgical sample taken during therapy. To enable comparisons, the same plasma samples were analyzed using an SNV-based ctDNA MRD approach.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b> PVs were identified in tumor tissue from all 46 patients. Across all plasma samples PhasED-Seq achieved a median LOD95 of 1.3E-6 and as low as 2.5E-7. Of 74 plasma samples with detectable ctDNA, 38 (51%) contained concentrations below 1E-4 and the lowest level of ctDNA MRD detected was 1.7E-7. For post-treatment landmark samples (n=45), the median time from end of therapy was 2 months. Cancer recurred in all patients (n=10) with detectable MRD at the landmark. Furthermore, PhasED-Seq better stratified freedom from recurrence (log-rank p=3E-8, Cox HR=10.8) than the SNV-based approach (log-rank p=0.08, Cox HR=2.5) and detected MRD at the landmark in more patients who ultimately recurred (56% vs 28%). PhasED-Seq also achieved longer lead times, including detecting MRD in 66% of samples collected 12 to 24 months prior to recurrence versus only 33% using SNV-based monitoring.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>PhasED-Seq achieves ctDNA detection below 1 part per million and appears to be significantly more sensitive than SNV-based MRD monitoring. These results suggest that PhasED-Seq is a promising approach for use in risk adapted trials in early stage NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,NSCLC,Recurrence,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  M.

Concordance between bTMB and tTMB values has been reported. However, the prognostic role of bTMB in relation to tTMB is not well understood.<br \/>Method: Patients with NSCLC who had both tTMB and bTMB results (collected from 10\/2020 to 10\/2022) were included. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed according to bTMB, tTMB levels (High defined as &#8805; 10 Mut\/Mb, Low defined as &#60;10 Mut\/Mb), and bTMB\/tTMB ratio. The Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test was used for survival analysis and the Mantel-Haenszel test was used to calculate the hazard ratio. Survival analysis by bTMB was performed only in 40 patients where bTMB was collected before and within 30 days of treatment initiation.<br \/>Results: Among 61 pts,18 pts (29%) received ICI monotherapy, 25 pts (41%) received ICI and chemotherapy combination therapy, 8 pts (14%) received chemotherapy, and 10 pts (16%) received targeted therapy. The median interval between bTMB collection and treatment initiation was 20 days (Q1:11, Q3:47) while 40 pts (66%) had the interval of &#60;30 days. 12 pts (20%) were tTMB high, and 32 pts (52%) were bTMB high. There was no difference in OS between groups with tTMB high and low. Similar findings were seen in OS and PFS of pts who received ICI containing regimen (p-value 0.71, 0.59, and 0.18, respectively). Group with high bTMB showed inferior OS compared to the group with low bTMB(p=0.008, OS HR=4.4) regardless of treatment regimens. Among people treated with ICI containing regimen, a similar trend was seen (p=0.009, OS HR=4.9). The median bTMB\/tTMB ratio was 2.49. Patients were divided into three groups according to bTMB\/tTMB tertiles (1st: 0.31-1.62, 2nd: 1.71-3.65, 3rd: 3.86-11.48). There was a significant difference in OS among the three groups with the 3rd tertile having the worst prognosis (log-rank test for trend, p=0.04). When divided into two groups (1st+2nd vs 3rd), the 3rd tertile group had a significantly inferior OS (p=0.01, HR 5.58). Among people treated with ICI containing regimen, a trend toward inferior OS was seen in the 3rd tertile group (p=0.12, HR 3.03). However, no significant difference in PFS was seen (p-value 0.77, HR 1.05).<br \/>Conclusion: High bTMB\/tTMB ratio was associated with inferior OS regardless of treatment regimen in patients with NSCLC. A high bTMB\/tTMB ratio may be indicative of increased tumor heterogeneity and\/or higher metastatic tumor burden. Further studies are warranted to explore the role of bTMB\/tTMB in various cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor mutational burden,Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Leeseul Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Jewel Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Youjin Oh<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Young Kwang Chae<\/b><sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ascension Saint Francis Hospital, Evanston, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH,<sup>3<\/sup>Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"099ed075-b455-4761-9ad0-f520fd8b867e","ControlNumber":"4171","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

OncoKB (Oncology Knowledge Base) is the first FDA-recognized database that contains information about these targetable somatic variants and corresponding therapeutic agents, including levels of evidence. Many of the human OncoKB variants have orthologs in the canine genome. This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of detecting these orthologs in dogs using liquid biopsy. This study involved two cohorts: The first was a cohort of 619 client-owned dogs with a variety of cancer diagnoses across all disease stages enrolled in a clinical validation study for a liquid biopsy test (herein the &#8220;research cohort&#8221;). All dogs had pre-treatment plasma samples collected at enrollment, and a subset of dogs also had matched tumor tissue collected. The second cohort comprised 457 client-owned dogs that had testing as part of the clinical deployment of the above-mentioned liquid biopsy test (herein the &#8220;clinical cohort&#8221;); 31% of these dogs had samples submitted as an aid in diagnosis (for dogs in which cancer was suspected clinically), and 69% had samples submitted for screening (in dogs with no <i>a priori<\/i> suspicion of cancer). Blood samples (and tumor samples, when available) were subjected to DNA extraction, proprietary library preparation, and next-generation sequencing. Sequencing data were analyzed using an internally developed bioinformatics pipeline to detect genomic alterations associated with the presence of cancer. Only canine orthologs of variants in the OncoKB database were evaluated in this study. Variants were called if they were observed in plasma at an allele frequency of at least 0.5%, with at least 6 unique supporting reads. Variants identified from plasma were subsequently genotyped in tissue without additional variant-level filtering. Analysis of plasma identified canine orthologs of OncoKB variants in ~8% of dogs in the research cohort, and ~4% of dogs in the clinical cohort. The higher percentage observed in the research cohort is likely due to the higher percentage of patients with confirmed cancer diagnosis. In the patients with an OncoKB ortholog in the research cohort, the dog had a cancer type that matched the human indication for the detected variant in 15% of cases. Of dogs in which an ortholog was identified in plasma, 44% had matched tumor tissue; and the variant observed in plasma was confirmed in tissue in &#62;50% of these subjects. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting canine orthologs of targetable human cancer somatic variants in the blood of dogs using next-generation sequencing. Although it is currently unclear how human databases can be used to inform targeted treatment decisions in dogs, these findings may have relevance for comparative oncology studies and future precision therapeutics development for both species.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Therapeutic target,Circulating cell-free DNA,Somatic mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel  S.

The traditional cfDNA purification methods using chaotropic solvent to separate nucleic acids from plasma through column or magnetic bead purification processes are usually laborious and time consuming, involving multiple washing steps, and the residual organic solvent could be carried over to the elution solution that could cause downstream PCR inhibition. Herein, we developed a novel particle surface chemistry that can biochemically bind rapidly (&#60;1min) and release nucleic acids rapidly (&#60;1min) under different buffer conditions without needing chaotropic solvent. We further optimized the binding and elution buffer solutions that allow to isolate cfDNA from plasma within 5-10 minutes in the sample volumes from 1 ml to 4 ml. The real-time quantitative PCR indicated DNA extraction yields were comparable or slightly better than the traditional methods for both small and large volumes. The novel bead chemistry and the optimized binding and elution buffers are not only compatible to high throughput format but could also be applied to a variety sample types for rapid sample preparations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Sample preparation,Extraction yield,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhiyang Zeng<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Andrew Taft<sup><\/sup>, Kasen Riemersma<sup><\/sup>, Connor Fitzgerald<sup><\/sup>, Mike Scurria<sup><\/sup>, Spenccer Hermanson<sup><\/sup>, Wenhui Zhou<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>R&D, Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e733a8d6-d910-4c26-942a-17de63d122fe","ControlNumber":"4087","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

Methods: We analysed ctDNA of 18 early-stage HNC patients for genomic landscapes using the illumina NextSeq 2000 NGS. A custom-designed OncoIndex gene panel was used for the hybrid capture target-enrichment of critical cancer genes. Panel was designed to detect cancer targeting exonic sequence of 600 genes reporting SNVs and indels along fusions and copy number amplification. The gene panel detected genome-wide signatures including bTMB, MSI (microsatellite instability), HRD (homologous recombination deficiency) prediction and calculate cfDNA tumor fraction. Results: 80 % patients showed presence of at least one CTC in peripheral blood, possibly indicating the progressive disease at the time of presentation. Comprehensive genomic profile obtained from plasma cfDNA of early-stage HNC cancer patients predominantly had low bTMB and MSI Scores (99 % patients). However, HRD and LOH matrix was high for 60 % patients indicating highly dysregulated DNA repair activities. Concurring to these observations, 98 % patients had mutations in key tumor suppressor and DNA damage response (DDR) genes possibly resulting in their loss of function. Besides DNA damage pathway, 60% patients harboured alterations in RTK genes including FGFR, EGFR and PDEGFR family and 32% patients showed activating mutations in Erk1 and its upstream regulators. MSH2 was the most prominently mutated gene (37%) followed by FGFR (32%). Surprisingly, unlike HPV positive advanced HNC cases, TP53 mutations were not detected in any patient, though alterations in TS genes were most prevalent in the study population. 51% alterations resulted into truncated proteins possibly impairing their functions, while 42% alterations were point mutations, 6 % were frameshift and 1 % indels. Presence of mutations in BRAF, PDGFR, FGFR and KIT genes suggested for the potential therapy resistance. Tumor fraction representing ctDNA showed elevated range from 20 % to 45 % with a corresponding ploidy between 2 to 4. Conclusions: Comprehensive ctDNA profile showed major gene alterations in TS and DDR response pathway genes besides mutations in proliferative signaling members. TP53 mutation was not detected, although critical tumor suppressor and DDR genes were predominantly mutated, suggesting for a unique mutation pattern associated with early-stage HNC due to tobacco etiology. Our results suggest that comprehensive ctDNA analysis along CTC profiling can predict the disease progression beforehand and may offer new treatment options to early-stage HNC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gowhar Shafi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Atul Bharde<sup>2<\/sup>, Fauzul Moubeen<sup>3<\/sup>, Kanchan Hariramani<sup>3<\/sup>, Alain D’Souza<sup>2<\/sup>, Trupti Kad<sup>2<\/sup>, Bhagwat Jadhav<sup>2<\/sup>, Sangita Prajapati<sup>2<\/sup>, Aditi Rani<sup>3<\/sup>, Madhura Basavalingegowda<sup>2<\/sup>, Mohan Uttarwar<sup>4<\/sup>, Gourishankar Aland<sup>5<\/sup>, Sreeja Jayant<sup>5<\/sup>, Aravindan Vasudevan<sup>5<\/sup>, Pankaj Chaturvedi<sup>6<\/sup>, Jayant Khandare<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>OneCell Dx Inc, Cupertino, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>OneCell Diagnostics, Pune, India,<sup>3<\/sup>iNDX.Ai Inc, Cupertino, CA,<sup>4<\/sup>OneCell Dx Inc, Cupertino, India,<sup>5<\/sup>Actorius Innovation and Research, Pune, India,<sup>6<\/sup>Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"47fc98ca-1dd3-4ad2-bb19-363d312947f4","ControlNumber":"7294","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

The development of colorectal cancer is composed of multiple stages, starting with benign polyps in the large intestine and rectum, and gradually progress to carcinomas, providing a window of opportunity for early detection. Early diagnosis increases the survival rate of patients, thus making screening tests for precursor lesions (PL) and early-stage CRC essential for reducing the mortality rate. In this context, the early detection of tumors based on liquid biopsy could provide benefits for improving the survival rate of CRC patients and has emerged as a promising avenue for cancer screening. The aim of the study was to evaluate the presence of variants in plasma cell-free tumor DNA from patients with PL and CCR to identify diagnostic and early screening biomarkers.<br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b>The<b> <\/b>cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples were obtained from plasma of patients that underwent diagnostic colonoscopy.

For example, early-stage, low tumor mutational burden (TMB) cancers may lack sufficient variants in these limited footprints to produce detectable signals. Further, insights into tumor evolution, including actionable mutations may be missed.Here we report a performance update of the NeXT Personal&#8482;&#65039; platform. Utilizing whole genome sequencing of tumor and normal DNA to guide design of bespoke MRD assays, we select up to 1800 high signal, low noise MRD targets and up to 400 exonic variants. Along with proprietary algorithms, this achieves high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 1 ~ 3 parts per million, and targets high specificity (99.99%). Specificity was demonstrated with healthy donor plasma samples and &#62; 200 cancer patient panels from a broad range of solid tumors. Sensitivity and linearity of MRD measurements were determined using dilution series from cell lines and clinical samples, which were orthogonally confirmed (R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.909, PPA = 100%, NPA = 100%) by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR).In addition, NeXT Personal simultaneously surveys tumor-agnostic content in the same workflow, providing detection of actionable mutations, markers of drug resistance, and mechanisms of tumor evolution from a curated set of variants in 90 clinically-relevant genes. Patient plasma (1 ~ 8 mL; 2 ~ 50 ng of cfDNA) can be rapidly queried to provide mutation-level information about tumor biology, longitudinal trajectory, and clinical actionability. The specificity of NeXT Personal variant detection is &#62; 99.99% with 100% PPV, while individual variant content demonstrates high sensitivity at allele fractions of 0.1% and above, with high accuracy and signal linearity as confirmed by ddPCR (R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.998).To explore the utility of NeXT Personal in a clinical setting, a retrospective analysis was undertaken in an advanced liver cancer (low TMB) cohort of 11 patients undergoing immunotherapy. Our results demonstrated that changes in ctDNA levels during therapy correlated highly with disease status (6wk vs. baseline, p = 0.017; 9wk vs. baseline, p = 0.004), and were detected prior to clinical response confirmation by RECIST 1.1. Examination of the clinical content provided useful insights into the potential of the assay.Our data demonstrate high analytical performance of the NeXT Personal platform in both MRD and individual variant detection. The assay is sufficiently sensitive for early stage, low shedding, and low TMB cancers, early time points or samples with limited input. The addition of clinically relevant tumor-agnostic actionable content makes NeXT Personal unique in its ability to detect MRD and to ultimately help guide clinicians.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,Early detection,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rui Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gábor Bartha<sup>1<\/sup>, John Lyle<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Harris<sup>1<\/sup>, Sean  M.

Investigation of CTCs might allow comprehensive studies at the DNA, RNA, and protein. However, fewer CTCs generally can be collected from patients with colorectal cancer, limiting the possibility of clinical applications of CTC analysis despite the development of many different methods. We have developed a micro-channel device that integrates hydrodynamic filtration (HDF) capable of size separation and dielectrophoresis (DEP) capable of electrical property separation, using peripheral blood from colorectal cancer patients.<br \/>Method: A separation test was performed using a whole peripheral blood sample obtained from colorectal cancer patients with <i>KRAS<\/i>mutation in the tumor tissue. The sample blood was diluted 2-fold with PBS, and red blood cells and plasma were removed using HDF. After that, Leukocytes and CTCs were separated in the same channel by DEP. DNA was extracted from CTCs (port 1) and leucocyte fraction (port 2), and KRAS mutations were detected using droplet digital PCR. In order to evaluate the separated fractions, microwell slide was used for evaluation by nuclear staining, CD45 and EpCAM antibody staining.<br \/>Results: 52 colorectal cancer patients were participated. The median age of patients was 71 years, 38 (73%) were male. Twenty-eight (53.9%) had colon cancers. Four stage III and 48 stage IV patients were included. The quality of DNA extracted from all patients were suitable for molecular genetic analysis. The DNA concentration of port 1 was significantly lower than that of port 2 (371 ng\/mL vs 36667 ng\/mL, P&#60;0.001). Using droplet digital PCR, KRAS mutations were detected in the port 1 of 8 (15.4%) patients and in port 2 of 15 (28.8%) patients. In 35.5% of patients, <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations were detected in either port 1 or port 2.<br \/>Conclusion: This device does not require pretreatment and is easy to extract CTCs. Since CTCs are contaminated with the leukocyte fraction, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of CTCs collection by adjusting the conditions of DEP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Circulating tumor DNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryo Ohta<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Takeshi Yamada<sup><\/sup>, Nobuhiko Taniai<sup><\/sup>, Hiroshi Yoshida<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Gastrointestinal and Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ae8cccd1-12fa-43cc-a00d-92ade4961ecc","ControlNumber":"2000","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

However this marker can be expressed heterogeneously, and can vary with time, treatment effects, and local factors including cytokine expression. Gene expression profiles of immunologically active genes are currently being studied to more accurately predict response to ICI treatment. To evaluate a potentially more straightforward way to accomplish this, we utilized an assay of cfRNA in plasma for PD-L1, utilizing a real-time PCR based assay (Circulogene, Inc, Birmingham, AL). The demonstrated limit of detection for PD-L1 RNA was 1 copy\/ul. Results were reported as either not detected, or low at over 1%, or high at over 50%. We used the PCR 30th percentile Ct value corresponding to a tissue IHC PD-L1 of&#62;50%, and the 66th percentile Ct value corresponding to a tissue PD-L1 expression of &#62;1%. We then collected data on over 400 patients over a two year period at a large community oncology practice and at a university clinic (Florida Cancer Specialists and Atrium Health\/Wake Forest-Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center) who had a clinical necessity for molecular testing in a commercially available setting with a CLIA certified lab. In some cases the corresponding tissue PD-L1 testing was also available, and may have been either positive or negative.To date 41 patients have been found to have high levels of cfRNA for PD-L1. Their clinical course has been analyzed using the electronic medical record. Some patients have received standard of care therapy, and some have been given CPI therapy with or without chemotherapy, if the attending oncologist felt this to be the best palliative option. These include tumors such as CRPC, metastatic low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma and HR+ metastatic breast carcinoma, that have rarely been treated successfully with CPI therapy. Tumor types - all are stage IV solid tumor patients: 19 NSCLC, 7 breast carcinoma, 3 colorectal cancer, 3 castrate resistant prostate carcinoma, 9 other tumor types.Data collection for tumor response or clinical benefit on the 41 patients is ongoing and will be presented at the meeting, and compared to published CPI response data using standard tissue IHC testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Checkpoint Inhibitors,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lowell L.

The sensitive detection of MRD following curative treatment allows for the identification of patients destined to recur. Higher assay sensitivities enable the longest lead times to clinical recurrence. Evaluations using several contrived pan-cancer samples have shown that the Inivata RaDaR tumor-informed personalized assay has a high sensitivity to detect ctDNA. The tumor-informed analysis utilizes sequencing of the tumor tissue to identify up to 48 clonal somatic variants, which are selected to generate a personalized panel to track the variants in patient plasma. To evaluate this technology in a disease specific manner, we generated a set of contrived plasma samples from commercial breast cancer patients and healthy individuals. The biological materials allowed us to generate a plasma sample with defined range of tumor content between 0.2 and 0.001% variant allele fraction (VAF). The sample dilutions were intended to recapitulate challenging cell-free DNA inputs that can be encountered in a clinical setting (median input: 5.76 ng [range 0.22 to 103.73]. Through our pan-cancer and breast cancer evaluations, we were able generate both sensitivity metrics along with a small limit of detection (LOD) study. The assay successfully detected tumor fractions in samples tested at 1X and 1.5X of the established LOD95% of 0.0011% VAF. RaDaR was able to detect the majority of MRD+ samples at 0.5X LOD. We will present data showing the level of sensitivity based on using both 2000 and 20000 genomic equivalents. The RaDaR assay showed high sensitivity for pan-cancer as well as ER+ breast cancer, which is known to have a low TMB compared to other subtypes. In this albeit small LoD study the Inivata assay was highly sensitive for the detection of ctDNA which is imperative to confidently detect ctDNA in advance of overt clinical recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Molecular markers,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hugh Russell<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Paul LaBrousse<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Stetson<sup>1<\/sup>, Greg Jones<sup>2<\/sup>, Giovanni Marsico<sup>2<\/sup>, Tim Forshew<sup>2<\/sup>, Robert McEwen<sup>3<\/sup>, Elza De Bruin<sup>4<\/sup>, Christopher Abbosh<sup>4<\/sup>, Darren Hodgson<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Dougherty<sup>1<\/sup>, James Hadfield<sup>4<\/sup>, Carl Barrett<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>AstraZeneca US, Waltham, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Inivata Limited, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>AstraZeneca, Location Chain Chesterford Research Park, United Kingdom,<sup>4<\/sup>AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e4eefb5f-0d49-4cb8-9183-dc4d1a1bf00f","ControlNumber":"6793","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

In addition to enumeration, there is great interest in the molecular characterization of CTCs. Nonetheless, this is technically challenging, especially with regards to RNA analysis, which requires immediate CTC processing to avoid RNA degradation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the CellRescue<sup>TM<\/sup> preservative tubes in preserving RNA, and to optimize a method for mRNA expression analysis on CTCs up to 4 days after blood collection.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Ten blood sample from one healthy donor (10 mL each) were collected into CellRescue<sup>TM<\/sup> tubes and spiked-in with 5 (n=4) or 500 (n=4) MCF7; two tubes were used for white blood cell (WBC) collection on day (d) 1, 2, 4, and 8 (4 mL used for each timepoint). The spiked-in samples were processed for CTC enrichment on d2 and d4 using CellSearch&#174; (cs5d2, cs500d2, cs5d4, cs500d4) or Parsortix&#174; (p5d2, p500d2, p5d4, p500d4). RNA was extracted, quantified, and subjected to reverse transcription to cDNA. Half cDNA from each sample was analyzed through TaqMan real-time PCR (in technical duplicates) for the detection of 3 transcripts of interest: ACTB (housekeeping), CD45 (WBC marker), and EPCAM (tumor cell marker). Considering the low amount of RNA, the second half of cDNA for each sample underwent preamplification of the 3 target transcripts, followed by real-time PCR (with technical triplicates) to evaluate whether this could increase sensitivity.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> RNA quantification by Qubit was 11.6, 23, 9.9 and 4.8 ng\/uL in WBC samples collected on d1, d2, d4 and d8, respectively. Thus, using CellRescue<sup>TM<\/sup> tubes, RNA was preserved up to 8 days, with a slight reduction in RNA quantity on d8. For spiked-in samples, RNA was below detection at any timepoint. Real-time PCR analysis of CD45 and ACTB in WBC samples confirmed a similar quantity of transcripts across all timepoints. For spiked-in samples processed with CellSearch&#174;, CTCs were detected only after preamplification and when 500 MCF7 were present. For spiked-in samples processed with Parsortix&#174;, 500 CTCs were detected both at d2 and d4, regardless of preamplification. Preamplification allowed for the detection of 5 CTCs as well, but only at d2. The spiked-in samples confirmed that by using CellRescue<sup>TM<\/sup> tubes, RNA is preserved up to 4 days, with slight transcript signal decrease between D2 and D4.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: With the developed pipeline, it is possible to detect 500 CTCs after blood storage for up to 4 days, and as low as 5 CTCs after 2-days storage. The enrichment methods can however affect the detection. More tests need to be performed to define the pipeline&#8217;s sensitivity using different enrichment methods and with different numbers of cells. Using this pipeline, up to a total of 100 gene expression assays of interest can be evaluated in a single sample.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,RNA,Breast cancer,Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eleonora Nicolo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Marwa Manai<sup>1<\/sup>, Youbin Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Munoz Arcos<sup>1<\/sup>, Strickland Kaylan<sup>1<\/sup>, Paolo D'Amico<sup>2<\/sup>, Huiping Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Giuseppe Curigliano<sup>3<\/sup>, Carolina Reduzzi<sup>1<\/sup>, Massimo Cristofanilli<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Robert H.

However, these tests are limited in their specificity resulting in a significant number of men still undergoing biopsy to avoid missing a csPCa. Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a platform for blood and urine biomarkers since they are released by all types of cells and preserve molecular constituents from their cells of origin within lipid membranes. The EPI urine test from Exosome Diagnostics (ExoDx) is currently the only commercially available EV based cancer diagnostic test; it uses three well established EV RNA markers to estimate the risk of csPCa. Studies by us and others have shown that an expanded urine EV PCa marker panel would improve disease stratification if these markers could be incorporated into a clinical grade assay. Our objective in this current study is to identify and characterize the EV RNA transcripts that are enriched by using antibodies for prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to capture urinary EVs that originated from PCa cells. This is the first step in the development of a next generation urinary EV test with increased specificity for csPCa within a rigorous and reproducible assay format.<br \/>Methods: Urine EVs from patients with csPCa and from healthy controls were prepared using the ExoDx clinical platform. These total EV samples were then compared with EVs enriched by immunocapture either with a PSMA specific antibody or with an isotype IgG control reagent. RNA was prepared from each of these three types of urinary EV samples and analyzed using RNAseq.<br \/>Results: RNAseq analysis of urinary total EVs, PSMA-antibody captured EVs and isotype IgG control captured EVs showed excellent mapping to transcriptome regions. We detected over 600 genes differentially enriched by PSMA antibody vs. isotype IgG EV capture and identified 18 genes from a candidate list of prostate biomarkers that have been assembled based on previous studies. A principal component analysis of 196 differentially expressed transcripts obtained from EVs enriched by PSMA immunocapture vs IgG controls showed excellent discrimination between prostate cancer patients and healthy controls. By using a feature selection approach to optimize for discrimination between prostate cancer patients and healthy controls we identified a novel 6-gene signature that, when derived from a PSMA capture EV dataset, shows a superior AUC for the accuracy of cancer detection (greater than 0.95) than that obtained from applying the same 6-gene signature on total EVs or on isotype IgG controls.<br \/>Conclusions: EV PSMA immuno-capture provides a robust approach to expanding the panel of PCa biomarkers that can be incorporated into clinical grade PCa urine EV assays, supporting the translation of pre-clinical discovery into clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Extracellular vesicles,Prostate cancer,PSMA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sandra M.

Detection of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in plasma perioperatively is associated with shorter recurrence free survival (RFS). ctDNA-Lung-Detect is an investigator-initiated prospective study of ctDNA detection and association with RFS in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Patients with clinically staged T&#60;4cm N0 NSCLC planned for surgical resection at the Princess Margaret\/University Health Network underwent ctDNA assessment before and after surgery (~1 month and 1 year). ctDNA minimal residual disease (MRD) was detected using the highly sensitive and specific tumor-informed Residual Disease and Recurrence (RaDaR&#174;, Inivata, Cambridge, UK) assay, which can track up to 48 tumor-specific variants in plasma.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Since August 2021, 64 eligible patients were enrolled (Table 1). One had isolated metastasis from a remote non-lung primary and subsequently excluded; another had their preoperative sample missed but was included. Preoperative ctDNA was detected in 15\/62 (23.8%) patients and 1\/63 (1.6%) post-operatively at the 1-month landmark timepoint (occult N2 disease found at surgery). All but one (93.3%) had ctDNA clearance with surgical resection. Two patients have recurred radiographically and in plasma at 1 year post-operatively, 1\/15 with preoperative ctDNA detected (6.7%) and 1\/47 without preoperative ctDNA detected (2.1%). Patients with higher T stage, tumor size, squamous histology, and without actionable driver alterations were more likely to have ctDNA detected at any timepoint.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>In patients with early stage NSCLC (small node negative tumors), 24% have detectable ctDNA pre-operatively. Surgical resection led to ctDNA clearance in 93% of cases. Our results support ongoing testing beyond the initial MRD landmark. Assessment of the impact on RFS post resection is ongoing.<br\/><br\/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jamie Feng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tom Waddell<sup>2<\/sup>, Kazuhiro Yasufuku<sup>2<\/sup>, Deirdre Kelly<sup>3<\/sup>, Andrew Pierre<sup>2<\/sup>, Shaf Keshavjee<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonathan Yeung<sup>2<\/sup>, Marcelo Cypel<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Donahoe<sup>2<\/sup>, Elliot Wakeam<sup>2<\/sup>, Marc de Perrot<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Law<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandra Salvarrey<sup>4<\/sup>, Lisa  W.
