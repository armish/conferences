[{"Abstract":"Regorafenib plus nivolumab (RegoNivo) combination has shown promising anti-cancer activity in multiple cancer types. REBNOBATE trial is a single-arm multicenter phase 2 trial of first-line RegoNivo in patients (pts) with uHCC (NCT04310709). Here we report the clinical outcomes of the RENOBATE study and integrative biomarker analysis using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: Adult pts with ECOG PS 0 or 1, BCLC stage B or C, and no prior systemic therapy were eligible for the study. Pts received nivolumab 480 mg iv, every 4 wks, and regorafenib 80 mg daily po, 3 wks on\/1 wk off, every 4 wks. Tumor response was assessed according to RECIST v1.1 every 8 wks. ctDNA analysis was performed using the Guardant 360 CDx (n=42). scRNA-seq was performed using PBMCs at baseline (e.g., C1D1) and on treatment (eg., C1D15) from early progression (EP) group (14 pts with PD or tumor burden increases towards PD on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> evaluation) and long-term response (LR) group (15 pts with PR or SD &#62; 6 months).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: 42 pts were enrolled. Response rates were 31.0% and median progression-free survival (was 7.4 mo (95% CI, 4.2-13.0) and 1-year OS rate was 80.5% (95% CI, 63.0-90.3%). Aberrations of Wnt\/&#946;-Catenin and PI3K\/mTOR pathways identified in ctDNA were not associated with efficacy outcomes. scRNA-seq revealed that genes upregulated in immune cells on C1D15 (vs. C1D1) were associated with immune activation and regulation of angiogenesis. Unsupervised clustering identified 13 immune subsets; among them, classical monocyte showed the most prominent changes in their proportion and gene expression profiles. After RegoNivo treatment, CD8 clusters had enhanced expressions of genes related to cytotoxicity, tissue homing (i.e., <i>CXCR6, CX3CR1<\/i>, and <i>CXCR3<\/i>) and proliferation (<i>MKI67)<\/i>, and monocyte clusters showed an enrichment of the gene signatures representing polarization towards M1-related features. Importantly, the enrichment of cytotoxic features of the T cell clusters and M1-polarizing features of monocyte clusters were more pronounced in LR group than in EP group. From the analysis of differentially expressed genes monocyte clusters between the EP and LR groups, a surface molecule &#8216;X&#8217; was identified as a potential biomarker involved in resistance to RegoNivo. RegoNivo showed promising efficacy outcomes in pts with uHCC. Through scRNA-seq of serial PBMCs, we identified enhanced cellular immune responses induced by RegoNivo and a potential predictive marker for immunotherapy in pts with uHCC. Our study highlighted that regorafenib might synergize with anti-PD-1 in pts with uHCC. Association between differential features of T cell and monocyte clusters induced by this combination and distinct clinical outcomes highlights the importance of immune-modulation in HCC pts suggesting a potential to further harness these signals","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Sequencing,Cancer genetics,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hyung-Don Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Seyoung Jung Jung<sup>2<\/sup>, Baek-Yeol Ryoo<sup>1<\/sup>, Min-Hee Ryu<sup>1<\/sup>, Beodeul Kang<sup>3<\/sup>, Hong Jae Chon<sup>4<\/sup>, Jung Yong Hong<sup>5<\/sup>, Ho Yeong Lim<sup>5<\/sup>, <b>Jeong Seok Lee<\/b><sup>6<\/sup>, June-Young Koh<sup>6<\/sup>, Changhoon Yoo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University School of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, CHA Bunda Medical Center, CHA University School of Medicine,, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Genome Insight, Inc., San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"504cd074-b1c8-4fc8-b7d1-3cc3e1f8c76b","ControlNumber":"6991","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

We hypothesized that mutations in single-copy regions of the genome or mutations present in multiple copies (hereafter referred to as persistent mutations) are retained during cancer evolution and immunoediting, may render the tumor continuously visible to the immune system and promote sustained tumor control during immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>We performed pan-cancer analyses of whole exome sequencing data across 31 tumor types in TCGA to quantify the landscape of persistent mutations (n=9,242). We then evaluated the association between persistent tumor mutation burden (pTMB) and ICB response compared to TMB in eight ICB-treated cohorts of patients with NSCLC, melanoma, mesothelioma, and head and neck cancer (n=524). To investigate the clonal evolution of persistent mutations we serially analyzed whole exome sequence data from NSCLCs prior to and at emergence of acquired resistance to ICB. Finally, we evaluated the composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in baseline and on-ICB melanomas by RNA sequencing differential enrichment analyses and deconvolution.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b><b>:<\/b> Integration of sequence alterations in only-copy and multi-copy states for 9,242 tumors across 31 tumor types revealed a cancer lineage-dependent distribution of persistent mutations that was largely independent of the overall TMB. In evaluating differential classification based on pTMB- vs TMB-high, we found re-classification rates as high as 53% in individual tumor types, with a median reclassification rate of 33% across all tumor types (range 15% - 53%). We then evaluated the clonal composition of persistent mutations and found a wide range of correlations between pTMB and fraction of clonal mutations (Spearman &#961; range: -0.11 - 0.59). In ICB-treated cohorts, pTMB better distinguished responding tumors compared to TMB, and a number of mutation and copy-number related features including tumor aneuploidy (melanoma: Mann-Whitney p=2.3e-06, NSLC: p&#60;2.0e-03, mesothelioma p=0.03, HNSCC p=0.05). Using in silico simulations, we found a similar advantage for pTMB when estimated from gene-panel targeted next generation sequencing. To support the biological plausibility of pTMB in the context of tumor evolution, we evaluated the rate loss of persistent mutations in longitudinal analyses of pre- and post-ICB NSCLC and found that a rate of loss significantly lower for persistent compared to loss-prone mutations (odds ratio 61.43, p&#60;2.2e-16). Consistent with our hypothesis, pTMB-high tumors had a more inflamed TME (p&#60;1e-11).<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS<\/b><b>: <\/b>Persistent mutations represent a biologically distinct subset within the overall TMB that is unlikely to be lost under selective pressure of ICB and may function as an intrinsic driver of sustained immunologic tumor control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Noushin Niknafs<sup>1<\/sup>, Archana Balan<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Cherry<sup>1<\/sup>, Karlijn Hummelink<sup>2<\/sup>, Kim Monkhorst<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoshan  M.

Whereas older investigational therapies for <i>MYC<\/i> amplified tumors were unsuccessful, promising novel targeted therapies are in early phase clinical trials. Unfortunately, it remains unclear how to select patients whose cancers may harbor true <i>MYC<\/i> addiction. We thus sought to characterize factors such as amplification level, focality, and clonality that may correlate with increased <i>MYC<\/i> dependence.<br \/>Methods: Utilizing a center-wide next generation sequencing (NGS) program of &#62;71,000 sequenced patients, genomic and clinical data from pediatric and adult patients with <i>MYC<\/i>, <i>MYCN<\/i>, and <i>MYCL<\/i> amplifications were identified between 2014 and 2022. Patients were characterized as harboring <i>MYC<\/i>, <i>MYCN<\/i>, and <i>MYCL<\/i> amplification based on a read-depth methodology using a DNA-based hybrid-capture NGS (MSK-IMPACT) and Fraction and Allele-Specific Copy Number Estimates from the Tumor Sequencing (FACETS). All cases underwent clinical data curation including baseline demographic, tumor characteristics, and treatment histories.<br \/>Results: We identified 3911 cancers with <i>MYCf<\/i> amplification (n=3257 (82%) <i>MYC<\/i>; n=364 (9%) <i>MYCL<\/i>; n=330 (8%) <i>MYCN<\/i>) across 40 malignancies, for an overall 5.5% incidence. The most frequent tumor types with <i>MYCf<\/i> amplification were breast (22%), non-small cell lung (NSCLC) (11%), colorectal (8%), ovarian (8%), prostate (7%), brain (5%), and small cell lung cancers (SCLC) (2%). Cancers with <i>MYC<\/i> amplification had longer segment lengths than <i>MYCL<\/i> and <i>MYCN<\/i> amplification, which appeared more focal (median = 19, 4.3 and 4.5 MB, respectively, p &#60; 0.001). <i>MYCN<\/i> amplified cancers had higher total copy number than <i>MYC<\/i> and <i>MYCL<\/i> amplified cancers (median = 19, 8, 9, respectively, p &#60; 0.001). <i>MYC<\/i>, <i>MYCN<\/i>, and <i>MYCL<\/i> samples were predominantly clonal (median clonal fraction &#62; 99% for all genes). Most NSCLC, squamous cell lung cancers, and pulmonary carcinoids had <i>MYC<\/i> amplifications (93%, 70%, and 67% respectively). Conversely, SCLCs most often had <i>MYCL<\/i> amplifications (49%). No concurrent targetable driver alterations were found in 33% of metastatic NSCLCs with <i>MYC<\/i>, 75% of <i>MYCN<\/i>, and 6% of <i>MYCL<\/i> amplifications.<br \/>Conclusions: While <i>MYCf<\/i> amplification is observed across a broad range of cancer types, factors such as gene type (<i>MYC<\/i>, <i>MYCN<\/i>, <i>MYCL<\/i>), focality, total copy number, clonality, and concurrent oncogenic drivers vary widely. Novel <i>MYC<\/i>-directed trials may consider enrichment for a subpopulation of cancers with higher-level, focal, and clonal <i>MYCf<\/i> amplifications without concurrent other drivers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,MYCN,Molecular profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Monica  F.

It is important to identify its unique genetic and molecular features. In this study we performed comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses of TN-IBC patient samples and identified TN-IBC unique features.<br \/>Methods: We collected matched pretreatment blood and tumor samples from 19 patients with primary TN-IBC enrolled in a phase II clinical trial (NCT01036087). Patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab (PmAb) plus NAC (PmAb\/NAC). Whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and multiplexed immunofluorescent staining were used to compare genetic and molecular profiles of these TN-IBC samples with 60 similarly analyzed stage III TN-non-IBC patient samples. We also compared the genetic and molecular characteristics of TN-IBC in patients who had a pathologic complete response (pCR) to NAC or PmAb\/NAC treatment, a suitable surrogate end point for IBC, with those who did not have pCR (non-pCR).<br \/>Results: Most TN-IBC patients (90%) had somatic gene alterations, most frequently in <i>TP53<\/i> (42%), <i>GATA3<\/i> (37%), and <i>PI3KCA<\/i> (26%). TN-IBC had distinct molecular and cellular differences from TN-non-IBC: a higher frequency of alteration of <i>GATA3<\/i> (adj-<i>p<\/i>=0.001), KEAP1 (adj-<i>p<\/i>=0.05), CDKN1B (adj-<i>p<\/i>=0.05), amplification of <i>ARNT<\/i>, <i>DDR2<\/i>, <i>BCL9<\/i>, <i>LMNA<\/i>, and <i>NDRG1<\/i>, lower mutation load, and fewer copy number variations (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001). TN-IBC had significantly higher expression of <i>BRCA1<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, <i>PALB2<\/i>, and <i>RB1<\/i> (log<sub>2<\/sub>FC&#8805;1, adj-<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001), enriched mitotic spindle and protein secretion hallmark gene sets, fewer CD8 T cells (<i>p<\/i>=0.01), and more &#947;&#948; T cells (<i>p<\/i>=0.004) and M1 macrophages (<i>p<\/i>=0.01) than TN-non-IBC. TN-IBC patients in the NAC arm who had pCR had significantly higher somatic mutation load (<i>p<\/i>=0.04), upregulated expression of <i>KRT36<\/i>, <i>KRT43P<\/i>, and <i>OR6K3<\/i> (log<sub>2<\/sub>FC&#8805;1, adj-<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001), enriched MTORC1 signaling and E2F targets, and a significantly higher percentage of M2 macrophages (<i>p<\/i>=0.04) than those without pCR. Patients with pCR to PmAb\/NAC had upregulated expression of <i>SERPINA9<\/i>, <i>OR52N5<\/i>, and <i>CLEC3A<\/i> (log<sub>2<\/sub>FC&#8805;1, adj-<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01), enriched interferon-&#945; and -&#947; responses, and significantly lower percentages of monocytes (<i>p<\/i>=0.03) and M0 macrophages (<i>p<\/i>=0.05) compared to non-pCR patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study demonstrated distinct genetic abnormalities, immune responses, and molecular characteristics associated with TN-IBC as well as differences related to patients&#8217; responses to NAC and PmAb\/NAC. This first comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, and immune profiling of the largest TN-IBC patient cohort improves our understanding of the molecular landscape of the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Our analysis could lead to the discovery of novel prognostic biomarkers and druggable targets for TN-IBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammatory breast cancer,Somatic mutations,Gene expression profiling,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaoping Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Li Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Takashi Semba<sup>3<\/sup>, Xingzhi Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Knafl<sup>2<\/sup>, Savitri Krishnamurthy<sup>4<\/sup>, Shan Shao<sup>3<\/sup>, Larry  W.

Homeobox (HOX) family genes are transcription factors that play a crucial role in anterior-posterior body axis patterning during embryonic development. This study aimed to propose a novel HOX-related signature of PGs to predict patients&#8217; prognosis and immune infiltrate characteristics.<br \/>Methods: Multiple levels of data (whole-exome sequencing, mRNA-sequencing, and single-cell RNA-sequencing) of 571 PGs obtained from publicly available databases were utilized to reveal the relationship among abnormal expression of HOX family genes, prognosis, tumor immune infiltration, clinical features, and genomic features in PGs. A total of 39 HOX family genes were utilized to identify heterogeneous subtypes using consensus clustering. Then a random forest-supervised classification algorithm and a nearest shrunken centroid algorithm were performed to develop a prognostic signature in the training group and validated in two test groups and an independent cohort.<br \/>Results: Here, we first identified 39 HOX family genes significantly differentially expressed in PGs compared to adjacent normal tissues. Then the individuals with PGs were then divided into two heterogeneous clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 2) based on HOX family gene expression profiles. Cluster 2 showed higher total mutation counts, lower immune infiltration, and worse prognosis than cluster 1. Finally, we constructed a four-hub-HOX gene signature (including HOXA2, HOXA6, HOXC5, and HOXC6) based on the cluster for subtype prediction applying a random forest supervised classification algorithm and a nearest shrunken centroid algorithm. The signature was revealed to be an independent prognostic factor for patients with PGs by multivariable Cox regression analysis.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results provide a novel method for the prognosis classification of PGs. The findings also suggest that the four-hub-HOX gene signature is a new biomarker for the prognosis of patients with PGs, allowing for more accurate survival prediction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognosis,Pediatric gliomas,immune infiltrates,Homeobox family genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qianhao Zhao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Junyan Su<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Kunming Children’s Hospital, Kunming, China,<sup>2<\/sup>ChosenMed Technology Co.

While PTC is often slow-growing and surgically resectable, recurrence years to decades after initial surgery occurs in ~20% of patients (now only in their 40s\/50s), with mortality of 38-69%. The identification of both prognostic biomarkers and actionable therapeutic targets for high-risk PTC at diagnosis is critically important and an unmet need. RNASeq analysis of 45 PTC and matched normal patient tissues from our biobank identified collagen 26A1 (COL26A1) as significantly upregulated in patients with higher risk extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, and multifocal tumors, compared to those with localized disease. Kaplan Meier survival curves of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data confirmed that increased COL26A1 expression significantly decreases survival probability by 25% (p=0.0086). Further analyses of TCGA data indicated that COL26A1 expression significantly correlated with clinical attributes including MACIS score (q=0.001), differentiation score (q=0.025), and tumor stage (q=0.025). Data from our in vitro culture PTC model system indicated that COL26A1 expression was increased 3X in PTC cell line K1, compared to immortalized &#8220;normal&#8221; thyroid epithelial cells, NThy-ori-3-1. Two CRISPR guides designed to target COL26A1 introduced into K1 resulted in repression of COL26A1 RNA and protein levels by 50% and 70%, respectively. COL26A1 repression decreased critical tumor phenotypes of aggressiveness and metastasis including proliferation (30%), clonogenicity (33%), anchorage-independent growth (37%), cell motility (43%), invasion (30%) and migration (33%). Cell-to-cell adhesion and cell-matrix adhesion also decreased (36% and 25%, respectively). Thus, COL26A1 may have use as a prognostic marker and actionable target for small molecule inhibitors in PTC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Metastasis,Genomics,CRISPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michelle Carnazza<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Danielle Quaranto<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole DeSouza<sup>1<\/sup>, Sina Dadafarin<sup>2<\/sup>, Augustine Moscatello<sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Geliebter<sup>1<\/sup>, Raj  K.

SCLC remains the deadliest histologic subtype with a median survival of only 12.3 months among those with extensive-stage (ES-SCLC) disease as demonstrated in the IMPower133 trial. Recent research by our group (Gay et al, 2021) has demonstrated that SCLC is defined by four transcriptionally defined subtypes, characterized by the predominant expression of the three transcription factors <i>ASCL1<\/i> (SCLC-A), <i>NEUROD1<\/i> (SCLC-N), <i>POU2F3 <\/i>(SCLC-P), and a fourth, inflamed subtype (SCLC-I). While SCLC is commonly associated with a history of heavy smoking, there is a paucity of information regarding tumors arising in patients with minimal tobacco use. This represents an unmet need given an increasing appreciation for low pack-year and never-smoker SCLC with some studies, like the CAPSTONE-1 trial, demonstrating an incidence of never-smoking SCLC &#62;20%. To address this disparity, we profiled a cohort of 113 SCLC patients with &#8804;10 pack-year smoking history (~12.9% of patients with SCLC seen over that time period) treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Clinical outcomes were analyzed, as was transcriptomic analysis in a subset of patients. The overall survival of limited-stage (LS-SCLC) and ES-SCLC in the low-pack year cohort was 26.9 and 16.5 months respectively (P=0.029); superior to historic medians of roughly 17.0 and 12.3 months respectively. Interestingly,<i> TP53<\/i> and <i>RB1 <\/i>mutations were significantly less common in the low-pack year cohort compared to patients with higher smoking burdens as determined by George et al. who evaluated 110 SCLC samples using whole-genome sequencing. Clinically obtained mutational analysis of our cohort (N=49) demonstrated a <i>TP53<\/i> mutational incidence of 51.0% vs 98.2% from George et al. (P&#60;0.001). Similarly, our <i>RB1<\/i> mutational incidence was 26.5% vs 90.9% from George et al. (P&#60;0.001). Samples lacking <i>TP53<\/i><i>-<\/i><i>RB1<\/i> coexisting mutations frequently demonstrated abnormalities in alternative DNA repair genes including<i> STK11, POLE, PALB2, MUTYH, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, MDM2, BRCA2,<\/i> and <i>ARID1A<\/i>. Given these findings, we performed whole-transcriptome profiling on our low pack-year SCLC samples to determine the SCLC-subtypes and identify unique gene signatures which may drive oncogenesis via mechanisms distinct from loss of <i>RB1<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i>. These data demonstrate that SCLC arising from patients with minimal smoking histories confers a more favorable prognosis and harbors unique RNA signatures with potential therapeutic implications. We anticipate these results will shift the current clinical practice toward routine evaluation of non-<i>RB1<\/i> or <i>TP53<\/i>-mediated drivers of oncogenesis among low pack-year patients with SCLC and promote further work in identifying novel therapies for this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Survival,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Low pack-year,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kyle Concannon<sup><\/sup>, Simon Heeke<sup><\/sup>, Moushumi Sahu<sup><\/sup>, Ximing Tang<sup><\/sup>, Koji Sasaki<sup><\/sup>, Sonia Patel<sup><\/sup>, Maria Gabriela Raso<sup><\/sup>, Hai Tran<sup><\/sup>, <b>Carl Gay<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lauren Byers<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8474354e-5970-4737-b281-7ab89581d062","ControlNumber":"5330","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Because of innate resistance to treatment, these patients have limited therapeutic efficacy and contribute to high mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the molecular characteristics of peritoneal metastasis and search for applicable drugs. This study aims to understand the biological characteristics of peritoneal metastasis in GC through integrative genomic analysis.A total of 66 GC cell lines were used, of which 11 were derived from the stomach, 49 from peritoneal and pleural fluids, and 6 from other origins. Targeted sequencing and RNA sequencing data were obtained from the Songdang Institute for Cancer Research (SICR) database. Cell lines were clustered into EMT and Non-EMT groups according to the expression profiles of 200 genes belonging to the EMT gene set (<i>Nature Cancer, 2021, 2.9: 962-977.<\/i>). We used gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database v.7.0.Hierarchical clustering separated the 49 cell lines derived from peritoneal and pleural fluids into two distinct clusters (EMT group, n=20 and Non-EMT group, n=29). Cell lines in the EMT group were classified as GS (65%, 13\/20) and CIN (35%, 7\/20), whereas cell lines in the Non-EMT group were classified as EBV-positive (3.4%, 1\/29), MSI-H (6.9%, 2\/29), GS (37.9%, 11\/29), and CIN (51.7%, 15\/29). The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that gene sets (HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION, CORDENONSI_YAP_CONSERVED_SIGNATURE, and FRIDMAN_SENESCENCE_UP) shows statistically significant differences between the two compared groups. Gene expression levels were significantly different between the EMT and Non-EMT group. In detail, YAP\/TEAD pathway related genes (TEAD1, TEAD3, CYR61, DKK1, SLC7A5, SLC2A3) and TGF-&#946; pathway related genes (SMAD3, TGF&#946;1, TGF&#946;2, BMP1, INHBA) showed a higher expression level in the EMT group compared to the Non-EMT group (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). Interestingly, GSEA between the EMT and Non-EMT groups of the GS subtype revealed that gene set CORDENONSI YAP CONSERVED SIGNATURE was enriched in the EMT group. Gene set FOROUTAN_TGFB_EMT_UP, on the other hand, was enriched in the EMT group of the CIN subtype (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05).In conclusion, we identified differences in gene expression levels according to molecular subtypes in GC cell lines with peritoneal metastasis. It can provide useful information to gain new insight into the mechanism of peritoneal metastasis and improve successful treatment options. Furthermore, our results suggest that YAP\/TEAD may be considered a potential therapeutic target for GC with peritoneal metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peritoneal metastasis,Gene expression profiling,YAP\/TAZ,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Juin Park<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Woo Sun Kwon<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingmin Che<sup>1<\/sup>, Tae Soo Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Sang Woo Cho<sup>2<\/sup>, Eun Seo Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Hyun Cheol Chung<sup>3<\/sup>, Sun Young Rha<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"31f4cb18-3c59-4aa3-97e1-a5fea74d2bb0","ControlNumber":"8076","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Discerning true fusions from artificial calls in RNAseq-based tests is challenging due to biological and technical noise. We previously developed a method to identify fusion transcripts by a single-tube NGS assay capable of concurrent analysis of DNA and RNA alterations in ALL patients. We expanded the assay with an improved fusion calling algorithm and used it to study the landscape of myeloid RNA fusions in the clinical setting.<br \/><u>Methods<\/u>: Total nucleic acid (TNA) from bone marrow or peripheral blood was analyzed in our clinical laboratory by a CLIA grade custom amplicon-based multimodal NGS assay, targeting 302 genes by DNA-seq and 185 genes by RNA-seq. Libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 instrument, and fusions were called from RNA: de-duplicated and error-corrected UMI reads were processed by an in-house developed BI pipeline leveraging machine learning, to assign a final confidence score (F1). Deidentified patient data was used according to an approved IRB.<br \/><u>Results<\/u>: Distribution of F1 scores was used to improve the discrimination between technical noise and real fusion calls. Analytical validation of RNA fusion calling against FISH and Sanger-seq in 74 hematologic disorder samples demonstrated 98.2% specificity and 97.0% sensitivity. Data from 789 patients was used to study the distribution of myeloid fusion events in community cases. 17% of patients had fusions involving genes from WHO\/NCCN recommendations. Frequencies for most common fusions were 2.3% (18\/789) for KMT2A, 2% for PML::RARA, 1.9% for BCR::ABL1, 0.8% for RUNX1::RUNX1T1 and CBFB::MYH11 and 0.6% for NUP98. Fusions of PDGFRA, ETV6, ZNF384, FGFR1 and other genes were also observed and BCR::ABL1 fusions were seen not only in CML patients but also in a patient with AML. For KMT2A, 25% (2\/8) fusions detected by NGS were confirmed by Sanger-seq but missed by FISH, which correlates with higher sensitivity of the NGS assay. Novel fusions were called in ~8% of patients. This included an AML patient with a CCND2::MGP fusion, resulting in <i>cyclin D2<\/i> (CCND2), frequently activated by DNA mutations in AML, fused to <i>matrix Gla protein<\/i>, a highly expressed gene in hematopoietic progenitor cells. The fusion was confirmed by Sanger-seq, and shown to lack ex5 of CCND2, which contains Thr280, a residue required for <i>ccnd2<\/i> degradation. This fusion is thus predicted to generate high cellular levels of oncogenic ccnd2-mgp.<br \/><u>Conclusions<\/u>: Frequencies of well-known fusions in real world data obtained by a robust low-noise RNA fusion assay were similar to other studies done in academic setting. Reliable detection of <i>bona-fide<\/i> RNA fusions with this clinical test is invaluable for patient care and novel fusion identification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion genes,Diagnostic biomarker,Myeloid disorders,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michal Krawczyk<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chaugiang Duong<sup>1<\/sup>, Lina Zelinger<sup>1<\/sup>, Fei Ye<sup>2<\/sup>, Hyunjun Nam<sup>1<\/sup>, Brad Thomas<sup>3<\/sup>, Vincent Funari<sup>1<\/sup>, Shashikant Kulkarni<sup>3<\/sup>, Fernando Lopez-Diaz<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>NeoGenomics, Aliso Viejo, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>NeoGenomics, Carlsbad, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>NeoGenomics, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2badb590-3163-424d-963d-615aa7c4e6bc","ControlNumber":"5232","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Still, little is known about molecular classification and its clinicopathologic impacts in primary CNS-DLBCL (PCNS-DLBCL). Methods: Next genetic sequencing (NGS) and then LymphGen classification were done in 62 PCNS-DLBCL patients with homogenous R-MVP therapy. Immunohistochemistry of CD8, FOXP3, PD-1, CD68, CD163 and PD-L1 was performed and enumeration of CD8+, Foxp3+ and PD-1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages was done by Aperio ImageScope 12.4.3. Tumoral PD-L1 expression was manually evaluated. Results: One A53, 1 EZB, 1 ST2, 2 MCD\/A53, 43 MCD and 14 other (unclassified) subtypes were identified. As expected, MCD subtype was predominant in PCNS-DLBCL (69.4%). MCD and MCD\/A53 subtypes were correlated with older age (P=0.001), higher MSKCC class (2-3) (P=0.014), and tumor multiplicity (P=0.004), compared to non-MCD subtypes. However, there was no significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between two groups. Other clinicopathologic parameters including sex, performance status, B symptom, elevated LDH, ocular or multiple involvement and Ki-67 labeling index showed no significant difference between two groups. In addition, CD8+ TILs, PD-1+ TILs, FOXP3+ TILs, FOXP3+\/CD8+ ratio, PD-1+\/CD8+ ratio, CD68+, CD163+ and tumoral PD-L1 expression were not different according to molecular subtype. Of note, tumoral PD-1 expression was found in 16.7% of PCNS-DLBCLs including MCD (4\/36, 11.1%) and non-MCD subtypes (4\/12, 33.3%), which was much higher than systemic DLBCL (6\/121, 4.96% in our previous data). Cases with tumoral PD-1 expression showed worse PFS than others (P=0.029). At single gene alteration level, both of MYD88L265P and CD79B mutation and BCL7A mutation tended to be related to poor PFS (P=0.067 and P=0.105, respectively). CDKN2A deletion, TP53 mutation and CD79A mutation tended to be related to poor OS (P=0.075, P=0.104, and P=0.107, respectively). Conclusions: This is the first reporting molecular classification and their clinical significance in PCNS-DLBCL of Asian population. MCD subtype was prevalent but has no prognostic power in PCNS-DLBCL.

Although emerging evidence suggests that NASH would be an important driver of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), molecularly what drives the transition of NAFLD to NASH and then HCC has not been clearly defined. Since NASH is a mitochondrial disease, we aimed to determine genetic variants associated with mitochondrial dysfunction linked to NASH and NASH-related HCC. We performed an integrative genomics analysis by analyzing a large-scale genome-wide association study of the body fat distribution-related variants in 344,369 individuals from multiple ancestries. And we linked these results to the top 24 significant variants to NASH and NASH-related HCC in 1,009 individuals from the NCI-UMD cohort. We also performed the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis on candidate variants. We analyzed the 3D genome architecture especially chromatin topology based on UCSC Genome Browser that influences the expression of candidate variants. As a result, we identified rs3747579-TT, an eQTL to a mitochondrial chaperone Hsp40, also known as <i>DNAJA3 <\/i>rather than a coding variant, as a risk allele linked to NASH-related HCC. HCC patients with rs3747579-TT variant had a poor prognosis compared to HCC patients with rs3747579-CT or CC variant. We confirmed that HCC with rs3747579-TT had a reduced expression of <i>DNAJA3<\/i>, encoding a protein that maintains mitochondrial homeostasis. Consistently, HCC patients with low DNAJA3 expression had a poor prognosis.

Therefore, there is a need to identify potential molecular markers associated with PTC that aid in early diagnosis, prognosis, and that may serve as therapeutic targets. One area of focus for cancer study is trending towards the epigenome and its functional regulators. The largest subclass of RNA molecules in the human genome consists of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) with many of their functions yet to be identified. Evidence supports their roles in the regulation of gene expression, as these molecules can act as scaffolds for RNA and protein localization as well as act as molecular &#8220;sponges&#8221; for binding to and inhibiting action of specific miRNAs. Recently, long non-coding RNA molecules have been demonstrated to play roles in both the development and progression of cancer, deeming them as both attractive and specific biomarkers and\/or therapeutic targets for study. Data from our patient sample biobank identified LINC01614 as being significantly upregulated (~12 fold increase) in PTC, when compared to normal, matched thyroid tissue. There was also ~30 fold increase in LINC01614 expression in male PTC, compared to ~5.5 fold increase in female PTC, highlighting a potential sex correlation for study. Thus, we are studying LINC01614 as a potential PTC biomarker. Functional analysis of LINC01614 in vitro found it to be upregulated in various thyroid cancer cell lines, specifically two PTC cell lines: TPC1 (~5 fold; RET\/PTC rearrangement; female) and K1 (~2 fold; BRAFV600E; male) when compared to the immortalized &#8220;normal&#8221; thyroid cell line (Nthy-ori-3-1). To establish a phenotype for LINC01614 expression, we utilized the CRISPRi technique to knockdown expression of this lincRNA in both TPC1 and K1. Knockdown resulted in decreased healing capacity (~20% for both), clonogenicity (~50% and ~34%, respectively), and proliferation (~55% and ~45%, respectively) in both the TPC1 and K1 PTC cell lines. Studies are underway to further assess migration, invasion, and morphology in both cell lines as well as studies to elucidate potential protein interactions and mechanisms of action of LINC01614 in PTC. Studying lincRNAs and their regulatory roles in cancer cell function can aid in the identification of various molecular markers for therapeutic intervention. Elucidation of how these molecules impact PTC development and progression is a promising avenue of exploration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Noncoding RNA,Epigenomics,CRISPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Danielle Quaranto<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle Carnazza<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole DeSouza<sup>1<\/sup>, Sina Dadafarin<sup>2<\/sup>, Augustine Moscatello<sup>3<\/sup>, Raj Tiwari<sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Geliebter<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle, WA,<sup>3<\/sup>Westchester Medical College, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e6933861-c7d6-49e9-8661-202169b8254e","ControlNumber":"6358","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

ATC is highly refractory and resistant to both traditional therapeutic modalities and recently discovered small molecule inhibitors. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms that contribute to ATC&#8217;s metastatic propensity, and the identification of molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic intervention are critical unmet clinical needs-highlighting the importance of novel avenues of intervention. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been described as regulators of gene expression and cancer cell phenotypes, exhibiting the importance of identifying non-coding profiles that potentially impact ATC behavior. Publicly available datasets provided by Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE33630, GSE85457) enabled investigation of gene expression profiles of ATC vs. normal thyroid patient tissue. Bioinformatic analyses with the GEO2R program identified the lncRNA, Double Homeobox A Pseudogene 10 (DUXAP10), to be highly upregulated in ATC patient-derived tissue samples when compared to normal thyroid tissue by about 5logFC. Analysis using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis shows that high DUXAP10 expression is correlated with decreased survival in thyroid cancer patients. To recapitulate this patient data in an in vitro model, we found that the expression of DUXAP10 is also upregulated in the ATC cell line, T238, in comparison to Nthy-ori-3-1, an immortalized &#8220;normal&#8221; thyroid cell line. To understand the consequences of DUXAP10 overexpression in ATC, we used CRISPRi technology to determine the phenotypic and genotypic effects of DUXAP10 downregulation. CRISPRi knockdown of DUXAP10 significantly reduces the migratory capabilities of T238 by 50%, invasiveness by 37%, clonogenicity by 70%, cell size by 34%, and proliferation by 28%, 45%, and 36% at 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively. This provides evidence that elevated DUXAP10 expression may increase the probability and negative consequences of metastases. Thus, targeting DUXAP10 expression may have beneficial clinical outcomes. Identification of the molecular innervations of DUXAP10 that orchestrate these pro-metastatic phenotypic changes are currently in progress. Immediate next steps are aimed toward determining if DUXAP10 can be utilized as a potential biomarker for ATC diagnosis and prognosis, as well as elucidating the full range of interactions that DUXAP10 has in shaping the ATC phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Noncoding RNA,CRISPR,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicole R.

These cancers, in particular endometrioid carcinomas, are thought to be dependent on or benefit from estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. In this study, we sought to determine the sources of ER signaling in patients with NSMP-EC.<br \/>Methods: We compiled a retrospective database of EC patients who received their primary treatment at our institution from 2014 to 2022, and who had ECs of NSMP based on a surrogate of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prognostic EC molecular subtype. We used ovarian volume (binarized using a cutoff of 40 cm<sup>3<\/sup>), menopausal status, body mass index (BMI&#62;25), and <i>ESR1<\/i> hotspot mutations as surrogate markers for ER signaling.<br \/>Results: A total of 171 patients with NSMP-EC were included in this study. As expected, menopausal status was correlated with ovarian volume (right ovarian volume median 12.3 cm<sup>3<\/sup> vs 32.8 cm<sup>3<\/sup>, p=0.001; left ovarian volume median 10.6 cm<sup>3<\/sup> vs 37.7 cm<sup>3<\/sup>, p&#60;0.001). Of these 171 patients, 135 (79%) had an identifiable source of ER signaling. Tumors with ER signaling sources tended to be endometrioid carcinomas (125\/135, 93%) whereas a lower proportion of ECs without ER signaling were of endometrioid histology (24\/36, 67%; p=0.001). <i>ESR1<\/i> hotspot mutations almost exclusively occurred in post-menopausal (11\/12 mutated cases) and older patients (median age 69 vs 61 years, p=0.012). <i>PTEN<\/i> mutations tended to be more frequent in ECs with ER signaling source (70% vs. 50%, <i>P<\/i>=0.036); in contrast, <i>KRAS<\/i> hotspot mutations were more common in cases without an identifiable ER source (42% vs. 24%, <i>p=<\/i>0.067). Additionally, the presence of <i>PTEN<\/i> mutations was associated with a higher BMI (median 31.1 vs 28.3, <i>p=<\/i>0.012), whereas <i>FBXW7<\/i> mutations were associated with a lower BMI (median 24 vs 30.6, <i>p=<\/i>0.047). Log-rank survival analysis showed that patients whose ECs lacked an identifiable ER signaling source had a markedly worse survival outcome (p<i>=<\/i>0.0024).<br \/>Discussion: We demonstrate that the majority of NSMP-ECs have an identifiable ER signaling source. The minority of NSMP-ECs lacking an ER signaling source may not only represent a hormonally independent tumorigenesis but are also markedly distinct at the molecular, pathologic, and clinical levels. ER protein immunohistochemistry may help in further defining these groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Estrogen receptor,Gene profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Clarissa Lam<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Carol Aghajanian<sup><\/sup>, Nadeem Abu-Rustum<sup><\/sup>, Britta Weigelt<sup><\/sup>, Lora Ellenson<sup><\/sup>, Amir Momeni Boroujeni<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Gynecologic Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f68597a2-3346-46bb-bc0a-cb83abc03e05","ControlNumber":"2480","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Not only tumor infiltrating T cells, but B cells have been recognized as a new hallmark of cancer immunity. However, the roles of each B cell subset remain unclear. We investigated the breast cancer biology from the point of view of tumor infiltrating B cells.<br \/>Methods: Genomic for primary breast tumors and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas in Pan-Cancer Atlas publications. Fraction for 64 immune and stroma cell subsets, such as memory- and class-switched memory B cells and CD4+ memory T cell were quantified by xCell method, a performs cell type enrichment analysis from bulk tumor gene expression data. Individual tumors were dichotomized according to each cell fraction levels by median cut-off value. B receptor repertoire (BCR) recognizing specific receptor molecules on several cancer cells, were quantified from complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 sequences in the variable chains in immunoglobulins by <i>TRUST<\/i> method. Gene set enrichment analysis were demonstrated using Hallmark gene-sets.<br \/>Results: CD4+ memory T cell was the dominant lymphocyte subsets (40.7%) followed by Th1 cells (22.8%) and class-switched memory B cell (3.4%). Patients with higher B cell infiltrating tumor were associated with improved disease-free survival (HR = 0.56, p = 0.01). Moreover, class-switched memory B cell was found to be the most significant prognostic factor (disease-free survival; HR = 0.23, p = 0.095, overall survival; HR = 0.33, p = 0.046). On the other hand, pro-, memory-B cells were not significant for disease outcome. Gene sets related to cell proliferation like mitotic spindle and G2M checkpoint were rather down regulated in tumors with high class-switched memory B cell infiltration compared to those with low (enrichment score = -1.63 and -1.71, p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). The number of unique CDR3 in breast cancer tumor has positive correlation with BCR index (Spearman r = 0.63, P &#60;0.01), and higher class-switched memory B cell infiltrated tumors were associated with more unique CDR3s, also BCR index (P &#60;0.01 and P &#60;0.01, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: We found that increased infiltrating class-switched memory B cell in breast cancer associates with down-regulated cancer cell proliferation with favorable outcome.

The androgen receptor (AR) is paramount in the growth and progression of PC, and insufficient blockade of AR leads to therapeutic resistance. Our previous work shows that CYP3A5 facilitates the activation of AR, promoting the transcription of genes supporting PC growth. CYP3A5 is polymorphic, and the wild-type (wt; *1) variant encoding the full-length active protein is expressed in 73% of AAs and only in 5% of non-Hispanic White Americans (NHWA). The race-linked expression of wt-CYP3A5*1 in AAs can lead to hyperactive AR contributing to therapeutic resistance. We performed an RNA sequencing study utilizing samples from AAs and NWHA patients to understand the allelic influence of CYP3A5 on PC severity.<br \/>Methods: Illumina RNA sequencing was performed using RNA from 13 AA and 12 NHWA prostatic adenocarcinomas. CYP3A5 genotyping separated them into two groups: a) carrying wt-CYP3A5 (*1\/*1 and *1\/*3; N=14); and b) mutant CYP3A5 (*3\/*3; N=11) variants. The samples&#8217; ancestry was confirmed using markers previously described. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wt-*1 and mutant-*3 CYP3A5 carrying groups were identified using DESeq2, at a false discovery rate of adjusted p &#60; 0.05. Alternately we also used the Kallisto method for quantifying the abundances of the transcript from RNA seq data.<br \/>Results: Aligned RNA reads with the human genome using DESeq2 resulted in the identification of 30 DEGs between the two groups, of these, 14 genes are known to be dysregulated in PC and promote aggressive disease (SEMG2, ZNRF3, CCL18, U3, MT-ND6, SCARNA9, NRCAM, LINC00853, TCF4, SLC38A6, HHLA3, DECR1, THTPA, and NEFH). Aberrant TCF4 along with ZNRF3 is known to promote PC growth via Wnt-beta catenin signaling. SLC38A6 is a glutamine transporter and is often upregulated in PC to promote glutamine uptake in an AR-dependent manner. NEFH is an intermediate filament protein that is downregulated in PC metastasis. Kallisto method identified 84 DEGs, 11 of those genes overlap with the previous DFGs identified using the transcriptome alignment method. The additional DFGs identified with the Kallisto method include aberrant expression of multiple genes (MT-CO1\/2, MT-ND1\/6) involved in mitochondrial dysfunction known to contribute towards cell growth and tumorigenesis beyond the Warburg effect. The wt-*1 CYP3A5 expressing group also shows increased expression of several pseudogenes, dysregulation of pseudogenes has been observed in several cancers and can act as a master regulator for gene expression, promoting tumorigenesis.<br \/>Conclusion: The presence of wt-*1 CYP3A5 may be one of the factors leading to aggressive PC in AAs as it shows differential expression of several genes known to accelerate PC growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,CYP3A5 ,RNA sequencing,African American,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jeetesh Sharma<sup>1<\/sup>, Richard Tillett<sup>2<\/sup>, Shirley Shen<sup>2<\/sup>, Jabril Johnson<sup>3<\/sup>, Rick  A.

Betel nut chewing might contribute to (1)strong inflammation, angiogenesis, and invasion ; (2)easy recurrence; (3)refractory to traditional therapies. In our previous research, we found betel-nuts exposed HNSCC cell line, TW2.6, might reflect treatment refractoriness of betel-nuts related HNSCC in Taiwan with high PDL1, defective p53 mutation, p16 loss, and BCL2 overexpression. PI3K\/mTOR dual inhibition, PI3Kalpha inhibitor, AKT inhibitor, FGFR inhibitor, ALK\/IGF1R inhibitor, CDK4\/6 inhibitor, BCl2 inhibitor, WEE1 inhibitor, ATR inhibitor, DNA-PK inhibitor, AT2AR inhibitor, Mcl-1 inhibitor, MEK1\/2 inhibitor, EZH2 inhibitor, HDAC inhibitor, CDK9 inhibitor, DNMT3 inhibitor, BRD4\/BET inhibitor, JAK2 inhibitor, CXCR4 inhibitor, FAK inhibitor, BTK inhibitor, eribulin, &#38; VEGFR2\/ PDGFR\/FGFR or VEGFR2\/c-MET\/Axl triple blockage might be effective on TW2.6 and reverse treatment refractoriness, maybe through the inhibition of mesenchymal transformation, pRB, &#38; PI3K\/AKT \/mTOR signaling and the modulation of stemness &#38; PD1\/PDL1 pathway. Besides, polo like kinase inhibition seemed a good radiosensitizer for TW2.6.<br \/>Methods: We try to prove the difference of TW2.6 reflecting clinical characteristics of HNSCC in Taiwan and design effective treatment combinations. Other HNSCC cell lines will also be evaluated for their genomic signatures. All cell lines will be tried to be categorized as TCGA subtypes for the reference of future drug combinations.<br \/>Results:<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{0BDCE062-C5A5-4225-8B05-DB670C67F497}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Cell lines<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>SCC25<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>KB<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>SAS<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>CAL27<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>FaDu<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>SCC15<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>SCC9<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>SCC4<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>TW2.6<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Differ- entiation<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Well<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Poor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Poor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Poor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Poor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Well<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Well<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Well<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Well, but rapidly replicated, with high hyper-diploidy &amp;

While previous studies presented conflicting results on the prognostic influence of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation among ER+HER2- breast cancer, few have been able to address causes of the prognostic discrepancy on a clinical level. In this study, we investigated clinical and genomic features according to a coexistence of <i>TP53<\/i> mutation in <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutated ER+HER2- breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: Tumor tissue based next generation sequencing (NGS) was analyzed for 224 HR+ HER2- BC patients from April 2017 to August 2021 in Gangnam Severance Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. Matching clinical records with patient information were reviewed retrospectively. Clinicopathologic features including age, tumor size, histologic grade (HG), TNM stage, estrogen receptor (ER) expression, progesterone (PgR) expression, Ki-67, and Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score (RS) were analyzed. Further analysis was carried out using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to explore the relationship of mutation status with intrinsic subtype and risk of recurrence (ROR) score.<br \/>Results: We identified <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutation (PIK3CA <i>m<\/i>) in 105 (46.9%) of 224 patients, and of these,<i> TP53<\/i> co-mutation was found in 25 (23.8%). None of clinicopathologic features were different according to <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutation. When <i>PIK3CA m<\/i> cohort was analyzed according to <i>TP53<\/i> mutation (<i>TP53<\/i> <i>m<\/i>) status, tumors with <i>TP53<\/i> <i>m<\/i> presented unfavorable features such as higher HG (p&#60;0.001), lower PgR expression (TP53 <i>wt<\/i>: Median 7 versus TP53 <i>m<\/i>: Median 5, p=0.027), and higher N stage (p=0.008). It also displayed a significantly higher proliferative profiles with Ki-67 (TP53 <i>wt<\/i>: Median 15 versus TP53 <i>m<\/i>: Median 20, p&#60;0.001) and Oncotype Dx RS (TP53 <i>wt<\/i>: Median 15 versus TP53 <i>m<\/i>: Median 26.5, p=0.002). In the 539 ER+HER2- breast cancer from the TCGA database, <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> co-mutation was found in 33 (6.1%). Distribution of intrinsic subtypes revealed a higher rate of Luminal B in <i>PIK3CA <\/i>and <i>TP53<\/i> co-mutant tumors (51.5%) than in <i>PIK3CA m<\/i> and <i>TP53 wt<\/i> tumors (14.3%, p&#60;0.001).

It has no approved targeted therapies due to the lack of the expression of key biomarkers, namely Estrogen and Progesterone receptors, and HER2 amplification. As a result, TNBC has the worst prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes. We previously showed that chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss is recurrent, correlates with poor prognosis, is an early event in tumor evolution, and confers a proliferative advantage. Here, we propose to leverage chr4p loss as a genetic vulnerability of TNBC by identifying its genetic interactions (GIs) with genes whose inactivation leads to synthetic lethality i.e. loss of viability of chr4p copy loss cells, but not of the chr4p copy neutral cells, or suppression i.e., positive GIs. We first classified breast cancer cell lines with TNBC enriched molecular subtype called basal-like, as chr4p copy loss (9) and chr4p copy neutral (7), using copy number data from CCLE. Associated with chr4p copy loss, the differential expression analysis carried out using CCLE data revealed transcriptomic changes that distinctly cluster the chr4p copy loss and chr4p copy neutral cell lines. We then used the publicly available CRISPR-based genome-wide gene inactivation data from the DepMap project and quantified chr4p loss-associated GIs using multiple scoring methods such as drugZ and MAGeCK. In total, we identified ~200 negative and ~70 positive statistically significant GIs involving genes annotated to biological processes such as translation, metabolism, and others. We have prioritized a subset of them for subsequent experimental validation using CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing in TNBC cancer cell line models. Alongside, using the publicly available drug sensitivity data obtained from the PRISM project, we identified compounds that impair cell growth in a chr4p loss-specific manner, the strongest of which targeted redox balance. Collectively, the set of GIs, the compound sensitivities, and the computational methods we have generated are unique resources for developing precision oncology therapeutic strategies for TNBC, as well as for other cancers harboring chr4p loss.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aneuploidy,Synthetic lethality,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rohan Dandage<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Schwartz<sup>2<\/sup>, Lynn Karam<sup>1<\/sup>, Alain Pacis<sup>3<\/sup>, Traver Hart<sup>4<\/sup>, Guillaume Bourque<sup>3<\/sup>, Morag Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Elena Kuzmin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology, Concordia University, Montréal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Institute, McGill University, Montréal, QC, Canada,<sup>3<\/sup>McGill Genome Centre, McGill University, Montréal, QC, Canada,<sup>4<\/sup>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ed72bd58-4b3e-4791-9429-21a793f5c656","ControlNumber":"1555","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Two major risk factors for development of SCC are carcinogen exposures, such as alcohol and tobacco, and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Viral- and carcinogen-driven SCCs have differential responses to radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, with HPV+ SCCs responding better to these treatments than HPV- carcinomas. Analysis of aneuploidy patterns of genomic samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have shown that squamous cancers cluster together and are characterized by gain of chromosome arm 3q gain and loss of chromosome arm 3p. However, while HPV+ SCCs show similar rates of 3q gain, they have significantly lower rates of 3p loss, suggesting that 3p deletion and HPV infection might have overlapping roles in cancer initiation and\/or progression. In addition, the degree to which these two paths of tumor development contribute to differences in disease progression and outcome has been largely unexplored. We have identified a strong correlation between 3p deletion and high epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signature across all cancer types. Interestingly, interferon signaling has been found to be upregulated in non-squamous cancers upon 3p deletion but downregulated in squamous cancers with 3p deletion. SCCs positive for HPV infection show decreased expression of EMT genes and increased expression of genes in interferon signaling and cell cycle checkpoint pathways. Together, the results of these TCGA analyses suggest mechanisms by which chromosome 3p deletion and HPV infection may affect cancer progression and are currently being validated in vitro<i> <\/i>in a panel of squamous cancer cell lines. Additionally, we will use a targeted CRISPR-Cas9 system developed in our lab to delete chromosome 3p, as well as transfect HPV oncoproteins, in normal keratinocytes to create isogenic models. With these models, we will study the role of individual aneuploidy events in tumorigenesis, tumor development, and metastasis in the context of HPV positive and negative SCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aneuploidy,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Tumorigenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samyukta Mallick<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alison  M.

Molecular biomarkers reported in previous studies have the potential to predict the recurrence risk of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), but the results were controversial.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the molecular characteristics of the 218 early-stage patients with lung adenocarcinoma based on 599 gene-panel target sequencing. All the patients received no neoadjuvant therapy and no EGFR-TKI treatment. The follow-up information on recurrence was complete. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard models to investigate whether the common alterations in <i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i> were prognostic factors for relapse-free survival(RFS).<br \/>Results: Among all the enrolled patients, the mutation rates of <i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i> were 47.6% and 9.3%, respectively. <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation was not proved to be a prognostics signature of relapse for lung adenocarcinoma regardless univariate and multivariate analysis (univariate: HR, 1.11; 95%CI, 0.82-1.50, <i>P <\/i>= 0.49; multivariate: HR, 1.18; 95%CI, 0.86-1.64, <i>P <\/i>= 0.31).

This study&#8217;s goal was to identify the genomic features of ESRD RCC and characterize them for associations with tumor histology and dialysis exposure. In this study, we obtained 33 RCCs, with various histological subtypes, that developed in ESRD patients receiving dialysis and performed whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome analyses.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Frozen kidney samples were obtained from 48 patients who were undergoing dialysis treatment and developed RCC at Iwate Medical University Hospital. Among them, we selected 38 subjects for study from whom matched tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples could be obtained and from which DNA (n=38) or RNA (n=26) could be isolated. We performed whole genome sequencing of genomic DNA using MGIEasy FS DNA Library Prep Set and short read sequencer DNBSEQ-G400. mRNA Sample were sequenced using HiSeq. Driver events, copy-number alteration (CNA) analysis, and mutational signature profiling was performed using an analysis pipeline that integrated data from germline and somatic SNVs, Indels, and structural variants as well as CNAs, while transcriptome data was analyzed for differentially expressed genes and through gene set enrichment analysis.<br \/>Results: ESRD related clear cell RCCs' driver genes and mutations mirrored those in sporadic ccRCCs. Longer dialysis periods significantly correlated with a rare mutational signature SBS23, whose etiology is unknown, and increased mitochondrial copy number. All ACD (acquired cystic disease)-RCCs, which developed specifically in ESRD patients, showed chromosome 16q amplification. Gene expression analysis suggests similarity between certain ACD-RCCs and papillary RCCs and in TCGA papillary RCCs with chromosome 16 gain identified enrichment for genes related to DNA repair, as well as pathways related to reactive oxygen species, oxidative phosphorylation, and targets of Myc.<br \/>Conclusion: This analysis suggests that ESRD or dialysis could induce types of cellular stress that impact some specific types of genomic damage leading to oncogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Oxidative stress,Mutagenesis,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shigekatsu Maekawa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Masahi Fujita<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryo Takata<sup>1<\/sup>, Daiki Ikarashi<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomohiko Matsuura<sup>1<\/sup>, Renpei Kato<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoichiro Kato<sup>1<\/sup>, Mitsugu Kanehira<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Sugimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Takaya Abe<sup>1<\/sup>, Hidewaki Nakagawa<sup>2<\/sup>, Wataru Obara<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Urology, Iwate Medical University, Iwate, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Laboratory for Cancer Genomics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d48a83aa-285b-4a50-9374-79a723e3b399","ControlNumber":"165","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
