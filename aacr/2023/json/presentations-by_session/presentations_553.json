Primary tumors drive this transformation by shedding tumor-derived factors (TDFs), including extracellular vesicles and secreted\/shed proteins (TSPs) into tumor-associated blood and lymphatic vasculature. Despite being the most common site of metastasis across solid tumor types, we know very little about how the lymph node (LN) is primed for metastasis by TDFs. Here, we test the hypothesis that lymph-borne TDFs are sufficient to initiate the formation of the pre-metastatic LN niche. Using a murine melanoma model (YUMM1.7), we demonstrate primary melanomas initiate remodeling in their draining LNs that enhances metastatic outgrowth relative to contralateral, non-draining and na&#239;ve LN controls. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that TDFs isolated from YUMM1.7-conditioned media uniquely activate this pro-metastatic LN phenotype rather than factors derived from benign dermis. The focus of this field has been on the role tumor-derived extracellular vesicles play in establishing this pre-metastatic niche, however our data further demonstrates TSPs are also sufficient to activate this niche. To identify candidate TDFs <i>in vivo<\/i> that have the potential to initiate LN transformation, we adopted a novel chemical biology strategy to ubiquitously tag TDFs <i>in vivo <\/i>using non-canonical amino acids and engineered expression of mutant tRNA synthetases in YUMM1.7 melanoma cells. Using this approach, we identified several TDFs by mass spectrometry present in pre-metastatic LNs, and identified one candidate (CSPG4; Melanoma-Associated Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan) as a potential mediator of pre-metastatic niche development. Shed CSPG4 is found within TSPs isolated from media conditioned by YUMM1.7, but not benign dermal, cells. We generated stable shRNA-expressing YUMM1.7 cell lines for efficient knockdown of CSPG4, and found that loss of CSPG4 confers loss of TSP-dependent pre-metastatic niche development in the draining LN. Furthermore, using an enzyme specific to chondroitins (the main glycan decorating CSPG4), we demonstrate that loss of chondroitin glycosylation of CSPG4 is sufficient to attenuate metastasis, even with the core protein present. We find that fibroblastic reticular cells in the draining LN respond to TSPs by becoming more myofibroblast like, resembling cancer-associated fibroblasts that provide direct trophic support to tumor cells. This phenotypic switch is partially rescued in the absence of CSPG4. Our results collectively indicate TSPs prime the LN for metastasis and we have identified melanoma-shed CSPG4 as a driver of pre-metastatic niche development, potentially through its influence on the LN-resident fibroblasts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-10 Premetastatic niche,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Premetastatic niche,Lymph node metastasis,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Haley du Bois<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Annie  L.

Among such mutations, inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene <i>SMAD4<\/i> is a hallmark of pancreatic and other gastrointestinal cancers and has been associated with metastatic disease. Here, we develop a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that enables <i>Smad4<\/i> depletion in the pre-malignant <i>Kras<\/i>-mutant pancreas and subsequent <i>Smad4<\/i> reactivation in late-stage metastatic tumors. Whereas early <i>Smad4<\/i> deficiency facilitated tumor formation, later <i>Smad4<\/i> restoration had unexpected organ-specific outcomes: no effect on primary tumor growth, suppression of liver metastases, and promotion of lung metastases. Integrative multiomic analysis revealed a near-universal genomic deletion of the <i>Cdkn2a\/b<\/i> locus and organ-specific changes in the tumor cells&#8217; epigenomic state. In particular, the liver and lung differentially favored KLF vs. RUNX dominated chromatin programs, which were confirmed to underpin the divergent effects of <i>Smad4<\/i> restoration in functional studies. Our results show how organ-dependent epigenomic changes lead to altered driver gene function in metastatic disease. This organ-specific gene-chromatin interplay may be a generalizable principle in cancer biology and invites a revised paradigm for precision oncology that considers anatomical site in the interpretation of tumor genetics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Tumor suppressor gene,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kaloyan M.

Early diagnosis is very difficult and thus 53% of patients are diagnosed after metastasis has already occurred, with the liver being the most frequently affected site. Both primary tumors and metastases have highly fibrotic stroma. Thus, stromal targeting agents have the potential to benefit patients, even those with metastatic disease. However, in addition to different resident fibroblasts, a study based on a rapid autopsy program of metastatic PDAC patients showed that tumor ECM density is actually lower at sites of liver metastasis compared to the primary tumor. These results highlight some of the differences between the microenvironment of the liver metastatic niche (LMN) compared to that of the primary tumor. Thus, to best help patients, models which recapitulate the LMN are needed. We developed a 3D biomimetic model to co-culture PDAC organoids and host matching primary CAFs to recapitulate the desmoplastic environment of primary PDAC. Our preliminary results show that primary site derived CAFs induce organoid growth, chemoresistance, and ECM remodeling when co-cultured with PDAC organoids. Utilizing paired organoids which metastasized to the liver (LM organoids), we tested if primary site derived CAFs would have the same effect on LMs. Interestingly, we observed that while LM organoids were intrinsically more drug resistant, co-culture with primary site derived CAFs had no effect on chemoresistance or ECM remodeling. Next, we utilized a metastasis associated fibroblast (MAF) liver cell line to investigate the role of MAFs in tumor growth, chemoresistance, and ECM remodeling. Our results show that primary and metastatic organoids use different mechanism to induce ECM stiffness triggered by fibroblast activation and remodeling in their resident fibroblasts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-10 Premetastatic niche,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Metastasis,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mahsa Pahlavanneshan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Weikun Xiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Chae Young Eun<sup>1<\/sup>, Chang-Il Hwang<sup>2<\/sup>, Reginald Hill<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine, Los Angeles, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California Davis, Davi, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"14735c8e-4c39-422e-923d-0ee21ad6144a","ControlNumber":"3977","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

To identify drivers of metastatic niches, we used a syngeneic mouse melanoma model which recapitulates genomic, metastatic and therapy response patterns seen in patients, and performed a large-scale <i>in vivo <\/i>CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, which identified perturbations that strongly promoted liver but not lung metastasis. The &#8220;top hit&#8221; in this screen associated with LM was loss <i>Pip4k2c<\/i>. Mechanistically, loss of <i>Pip4k2c<\/i> sensitized both mouse and human melanoma to insulin-mediated PI3K\/AKT pathway activation. Interestingly, this observation was dependent on the allosteric but not kinase domain activity. Treatment with different PI3K inhibitors abrogated the pathway <i>in vitro<\/i>, but was partly bypassed in the presence of insulin. As expected, loss of <i>Pip4k2c<\/i> was associated with significant increase in LM but not lung-metastatic burden in both syngeneic and patient-derived xenograft models, and this phenotype was rescued by reconstitution of full-length, but not allosteric domain deficient <i>Pip4k2c<\/i> constructs. We reasoned that Pip4k2cKO cells preferentially colonized the liver by co-opting the insulin-rich milieu in this organ. To test this, we generated <i>Pip4k2c<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/<i>Insr<\/i><sup>shIR-KD<\/sup> and showed that <i>Insr<\/i> was required but not sufficient to enhance LM burden. Surprisingly, treatment with PI3K inhibition <i>in vivo<\/i> resulted in increased and not decreased LM burden as we had expected. PET-CT imaging of animals treated with PI3K revealed increased glucose uptake in LM in the presence of PI3K inhibition. We therefore reasoned that paradoxical activation due to host-mediated increase in glucose and insulin in response to PI3K inhibitor, may results in increased homing and metastasis to the liver. In further in vivo experiments, we showed that breaking this loop with either SGLT2 inhibitor or ketogenic diet circumvented host responses and resulted in reduced LM burden, while having no effect on lung metastasis burden. To further substantiate these findings, we performed single cell RNA-seq of concurrent liver and lung metastasis bearing mice which revealed strong tumor-intrinsic enrichment of central carbon metabolism. Lastly, analysis of 243 human liver vs extra-hepatic metastases across 75 cancers and addition of newly generated RNA-seq data of additional melanoma LM, revealed concordant pathways enrichment of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation LM. Together, we identify an axis of liver-metastatic organotropism that can be abrogated with a combination of PI3K inhibition and SGLT2-inhibition or concurrent ketogenic diet.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Malignant melanoma,Liver,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meri Rogava<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tyler Joseph Aprati<sup>2<\/sup>, Wei-Yu Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Johannes Melms<sup>1<\/sup>, Clemens Hug<sup>4<\/sup>, Amit Dipak Amin<sup>1<\/sup>, Bryan Ngo<sup>5<\/sup>, Michae l Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Patricia Ho<sup>1<\/sup>, Yiping Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ethan Earlie<sup>3<\/sup>, Sean Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Tüting<sup>6<\/sup>, Martin Röcken<sup>7<\/sup>, Thomas K.

Integrated cross-species molecular and transcriptomic analyses identified Y-chromosome gene histone demethylase <i>KDM5D <\/i>as a transcriptionally up-regulated gene driven by KRAS*-mediated activation of the STAT4 transcription factor. KDM5D-dependent chromatin mark and transcriptome changes showed repression of regulators of epithelial cell tight junction and MHC class I complex components. Deletion of KDM5D in iKAP cancer cells increased tight junction integrity, decreased cell invasiveness, and enhanced cancer cell killing by CD8+ T cells. Conversely, iAP mice engineered with a <i>Kdm5d <\/i>transgene to provide constitutive KDM5D expression specifically in iAP cancer cells exhibited an increased propensity for more invasive tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>. Thus, KRAS*-STAT4-mediated upregulation of Y chromosome KDM5D contributes significantly to the sex differences in KRAS* CRC via its disruption of cancer cell adhesion properties and tumor immunity, thus providing an actionable therapeutic strategy for metastasis risk reduction for men afflicted with KRAS* CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,KRAS,Metastasis,Sex,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jiexi Li<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zhengdao Lan<sup><\/sup>, Wenting Liao<sup><\/sup>, Jielin Liu<sup><\/sup>, Shan Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Hong Seok Shim<sup><\/sup>, Max Slotnik<sup><\/sup>, Kyle  A.

As such, this process might provide an opportunity to prevent metastasis. As part of the process of vascular co-option, we observed that brain metastatic cells in the perivascular niche temporarily enter into a novel cell state characterized by a decreased proliferation before resuming their aggressive growth to colonize the organ. Transcriptomic analysis of co-opting metastatic cells confirmed downregulation of MYC signatures, mitotic cell cycle and increased stemness properties. By focusing on one of the top upregulated transcription factors in co-opting cells: MXD4, a MYC antagonist; we have been able to dissect the relevance of this cellular state, that we termed proliferative pause, both respect to the maintenance of the interaction with the vasculature and to the ability to generate macrometastases. As such, targeting MXD4 in lung adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer metastatic models reduced multi-organ metastases to a level that translates into increased overall survival. Mechanistically, this obliged proliferative pause is linked to a cellular response to the increasing environmental pressure involved in organ colonization. For instance, we found that crossing the blood-brain barrier induced an increased DNA damage due to mechanical constrains leading to nuclear deformation. However, the MXD4-dependent proliferative pause during vascular co-option allows metastatic cells to repair this damage to continue the colonization process. Given the enormous potential to prevent metastasis and our findings dissecting the proliferative pause status, we developed a therapeutic strategy to target vascular co-opting cells. As part of the molecular profile of co-opting cells, we validated their high dependency on Bcl proteins. As such, we have used a Bcl-2 inhibitor (obatoclax) permeable to the blood-brain barrier to target these cells in preventive scenarios. Beyond the preventive therapeutic assays in vivo, we have applied additional clinically-relevant models where preventive strategies could easily translate into the clinical practice. As such, obatoclax post-surgery provided a survival benefit by preventing relapse, as the cells left behind after the local therapy are vascular co-opting cells. Furthermore, our national network of brain metastasis (RENACER) provided us with fresh neurosurgeries and, in a limited cohort of 10 surgeries with extended resections, we were able to identify invasive fronts with metastatic cells co-opting the vasculature. The use of obatoclax to target these cancer cells, which are the seeds of relapse post-surgery, confirmed that targeting vascular co-option could be a novel strategy to prevent metastasis in a clinically relevant situation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Vascular co-option,Metastasis-initiating cells,Metastasis prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pedro García-Gómez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Diana Retana<sup>1<\/sup>, Pablo Sanz-Martínez<sup>1<\/sup>, Irene Salgado-Crespo<sup>1<\/sup>, Carolina Hernández-Oliver<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Isabel García<sup>1<\/sup>, Oliva Sánchez<sup>1<\/sup>, Kevin Troulé-Lozano<sup>2<\/sup>, Verona Villar-Cerviño<sup>3<\/sup>, Miguel Lafarga-Coscojuela<sup>4<\/sup>, Fátima Al-Shahrour<sup>2<\/sup>, RENACER Red Nacional de Metástasis Cerebral<sup>5<\/sup>, Manuel Valiente<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Brain Metastasis Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Ctr.

The presence of BM is associated with reduced response to several modern cancer therapies and a poor prognosis, but the underlying molecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we performed multi-modal single-nucleus RNA, T cell receptor, single-cell spatial, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 44 primary NSCLC tumors (PTs) and BMs. Through combination of WGS with inferred copy-number alterations (CNAs) and gene expression snRNA-seq, we robustly identify malignant cells despite the presence of healthy cell mosaicism. We find a strong association of chromosomal instability (CIN) and brain-metastatic organotropism. Through integration with clinical information and thousands of publicly available whole-exome sequencing (WES) profiles obtained from patients with NSCLC, we validate this observation and show that CIN progressively increases from PTs to extracranial metastases (ECMs) and is the highest in BMs. Using non-negative matrix factorization, we identify recurrent transcriptional hallmarks cancer metastasis, and additionally find that cancer cells from BMs strongly enrich for a neuronal-like cell state. At single-cell resolution, we indeed identify a rare cancer cell population genomically define by very high CIN, and transcriptionally characterized by a program of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), neuronal-like differentiation, and loss of lineage attribution. We show in our data and external scRNA-seq data that this cell state does not ecist in healthy lungs, progressively enriches from PTs to ECMs, and is most abundant in BMs, suggesting that these cells may indeed give rise to BMs. Furthermore, through integration of snRNA\/TCR-seq and spatial transcriptomics, we find distinct tumor-microenvironments across disease sites, including, nearly exclusive expansion of tissue-resident myeloid cells in PTs, while BMs are largely dominated by dense infiltration with monocyte-derived macrophages and granulocytes, impaired T cell infiltration, activation and clonal expansion. Lastly, spatial transcriptomics also recurrent, cell-type specific patterns of geographic variability in key pathways, including antigen presentation, EMT, oxidative phosphorylation, and inflammatory response and associated cellular micro-niches. Together, this work identifies cellular, genomic, and transcriptional features of NSCLC BMs and has important therapeutic implications for novel therapies, in particular immunomodulatory approaches targeting cell types\/states unique to disease sites.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Systems biology,Adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Somnath Tagore<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lindsay Caprio<sup>1<\/sup>, Amit Dipak Amin<sup>1<\/sup>, Irving Barrera<sup>2<\/sup>, Johannes Melms<sup>1<\/sup>, Karan Luthria<sup>1<\/sup>, Yiping Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yohanna Georgis<sup>1<\/sup>, Abhi Jaiswal<sup>3<\/sup>, Galina G.
