[{"Abstract":"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex 3D cellular system comprised of a diverse amalgam of cells. To characterize the TME, we developed a 3D cell culture platform which facilitates imaging-based analysis and cell viability for extended durations. We used this platform to collect in-situ spatiotemporal measurements of cytokine concentrations in the tumor vicinity, track cellular activity, and model local tumor invasion of glioblastoma (GBM) using fast-scanning confocal microscopy. The mechanism by which we achieve long-term 3D culture is perfusion, modeled as flow through a porous medium. Perfusion facilitates regulated transport of nutrients and waste within the soft microgel medium: Liquid-Like Solids (LLS). The interstitial space is tuned to mimic a capillary bed, and surface bioconjugation of the microgels promotes cellular adhesion and migration. To measure cytokine concentrations, GBM tumoroids were grown in LLS and printed into a dispersion of ELISA beads in LLS. The mechanical stability of LLS ensures the tumor and ELISA beads remain stationary without impeding cellular activity. Cytokine on and off-rates were referenced alongside measured bead fluorescence intensities and positions to fit spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion models. Fast-scanning confocal microscopy facilitated in-situ observation of the evolutionary dynamics of tumor progression. Co-culture of patient-derived tumor explants and autologous PBMCs printed into type I collagen-bioconjugated LLS enabled studies of cancer-immune interactions. In-situ cytokine measurements revealed local IL-8 concentrations reached a maximum value of 2 ng ml<sup>-1<\/sup> after 10 hours. A cellular production rate was estimated at 2 molecules cell<sup>-1<\/sup> s<sup>-1<\/sup>. Invasive behavior into the proximal space was determined to be super-diffusive; off-lattice agent-based simulations indicated this behavior is a result of the confinement of invasive fronts to the microgel interstitium. The invading glioblastoma cells used anchorage-dependent migration and were guided by geometric cues to traverse the porous bioconjugated LLS network. Cancer-immune interaction studies revealed average CD8+ speeds greater than 2.8 &#181;m min<sup>-1<\/sup> and both chemotaxis and chemokinetic behavior. CD8+ T-cell killing rates were estimated at approximately 3 cancer cells hr<sup>-1<\/sup> initially, monotonically falling over 12 hours to roughly 1 cell hr<sup>-1<\/sup>. The development of the in-situ 3D ELISA assay and imaging-based analysis techniques have enabled the tracking of tumor-immune cell interactions, observation of dynamic tumor progression, and local cytokine concentration profiling at appreciable spatiotemporal resolutions. The combination of a physiologically relevant 3D culture platform with the capacity for in-situ qualitative and quantitative observation may lead to new, powerful, preclinical models that allow for interrogation of the TME and decrease the rate of false discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-09 Physical sciences in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,In vitro,Imaging,Tumoroid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Duy Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander McGhee<sup>1<\/sup>, Diego Pedro<sup>1<\/sup>, Alfonso Pepe<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew Schaller<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Smolchek<sup>2<\/sup>, Jack Famiglietti<sup>2<\/sup>, Stephanie Warrington<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>W.

We leveraged network-based methodologies to dissect the heterogeneity of DMG tumors and to discover Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing pharmacologically accessible, mechanistic determinants of molecularly distinct cell states. We produced the first DMG regulatory network from 122 publicly available RNAseq profiles with ARACNe (Basso et al. Nat Genet 2005), and inferred sample-specific MR protein activity with VIPER (Alvarez et al. Nat Genet 2016) based on the differential expression of their targets. 7 of the top 25 most active MRs found comprise a well-characterized MR block (MRB2) (Paull et al.Cell 2021), frequently activated across aggressive tumors, and enriched in DMG patient MR signatures (Fisher&#8217;s Exact Test p=4.4x10<sup>-18<\/sup>). A CRISPR\/Cas9 KO screen across 3 DMG patient cell lines identified a set of 73\/77 essential genes that were enriched in the MR signature of 80% of patient samples (GSEA p=0.000034). FOXM1 emerged as an essential MR, significantly activated across virtually all patients.<br \/>We then generated RNAseq profiles following perturbation with ~300 oncology drugs in 2 DMG cell lines most representative of patient MR signatures, and used this to identify drugs that invert patient MR activity profiles using the NYS\/CA Dept. of Health approved OncoTreat algorithm (Alvarez et al. Nat Genet 2018). OncoTreat predicted sensitivity to HDAC, MEK, CDK, PI3K, and proteosome inhibitors in subsets of patients, overlapping with published DMG drug screens. Importantly, 80% of OncoTreat-predicted drugs (p&#60;10<sup>-5<\/sup>) from 3 DMG patient tumor biopsies showed <i>in vitro<\/i> sensitivity in cultured tumor cells from the respective patients, with overall 68% accuracy among 223 drugs evaluated by both OncoTreat and <i>in vitro<\/i> (Fisher&#8217;s Exact Test p=0.0449).<br \/>Further analysis of DMG intra-tumor heterogeneity via protein activity inference across DMG single cells from 6 published scRNAseq profiles identified 6 tumor clusters with unique MR signatures co-existing in virtually all patients representing distinct cellular states (2 astrocyte-, 1 oligodendrocyte-, and 3 oligodendrocyte precursor cell-like states). Targetable MRs and OncoTreat-predicted drugs were distinct between these states. Bulk RNAseq analysis recapitulated predictions seen in the more prevalent OPC-like states, but failed to capture MR and drug predictions for the AC-like states (<i>e.g.<\/i> JAK1\/Ruxolitinib and STAT3\/Napabucasin). We are currently validating cell state-specific drug predictions <i>in vivo<\/i> at single-cell resolution in subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft and orthotopic syngeneic DMG models that we have shown recapitulate patient tumor heterogeneity, including with focused ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. This provides a platform to nominate much-needed novel drugs and drug combinations to treat DMG.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Single cell,Systems biology,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ester Calvo Fernandez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Junqiang Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xu Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Hong-Jian Wei<sup>4<\/sup>, Hanna  E.

While the impact of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms has been well-studied in several cancer types, the effects of germline structural variants (gSVs) on cancer biology and clinical outcomes is largely unknown. From our cohort of 300 men with localized, intermediate risk prostate cancer, we identified 6,003 gSVs present in at least 3% of patients; 48 were associated with recurrent somatic alterations or clinical outcome. Of these, approximately 50% were associated with expression of nearby genes or intersected with exons or regulatory regions. Using external cohorts, we validated three gSVs that were strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes, including an inversion at chr14q24.1 present in ~20% of patients. Notably, a strong synergistic effect on outcome was observed in patients with somatic TP53 alterations or high genomic instability, defining a new aggressive prostate cancer subtype with chr14INV as a novel, recurrent biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Structural variants,Genomics,Biomarker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicholas  K.

Due to sustained proliferative signaling and\/or defective DNA repair, cancer cells undergo persistent RS making them strongly dependent on the replication stress response (RSR). A consequence of this dependency is that RS becomes an exploitable therapeutic vulnerability in cancer treatment. Classical RS drugs work predominantly by interfering with DNA replication in dividing cells. Recently, an increasing number of drugs have been designed to specifically target RSR proteins. However, molecular pathways responsible for drug response are incompletely understood. Here we build an interpretable deep-learning model aimed at understanding mechanisms of susceptibility and resistance to replicative stress. Instead of associating genetic alterations with drug responses directly, our approach is to project individual mutations on a map of protein complexes and larger molecular assemblies with prior evidence for involvement in cancer. This approach is prompted and supported by the concept that cancer is a network-based disease arising from the action of hallmark cancer pathways. Through systematic interpretation, the model identifies 37 complexes that integrate rare alterations in hundreds of genes for accurate response prediction. The complexes, which cover roles in transcription, DNA repair, cell-cycle checkpoint, and immunity, are further investigated by directed genetic perturbations, validating 24 for which RS effects are phenocopied by CRISPR guide RNAs. For complexes with poorly characterized functions, further insights are obtained via their profiles of in-silico activation across RS agents. This study creates a library of system-level genetic vulnerabilities governing replication stress, with implications for drug selection and combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA replication,Systems biology,Machine learning,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xiaoyu Zhao<sup><\/sup>, <b>Akshat Singhal<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Trey Ideker<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0b8019a9-4d82-491d-bcc1-192c9a02033a","ControlNumber":"8025","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

However, the multi-omics profiles have not been systematically integrated to define the integrative molecular subtypes of AML. There is a great clinical interest to identify the patterns across multi-omics profiles that could be used for prognosis and guiding targeted therapy in AML.<br \/>Methods: To identify integrative molecular subtypes (iSubtypes) of AML, we performed an integrative clustering (iCluster) analysis of the AML multi-omics data (n=160) generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which consisted of somatic mutation, DNA copy number, DNA methylation and RNA-seq gene expression data for 160 AML samples. We identified the multi-omics signatures that drove the molecular classification of AML. Based on the methylation and gene expression signatures, we derived a gene panel for classification of AML and verified the prognostic power of the gene panel using three independent AML datasets (n=1382).<br \/>Results: We identified four iSubtypes of AML that featured distinct multi-omics signatures. At the DNA level, the iSubtype 1 was characterized by chromosomal abnormalities and high-frequency mutation of <i>TP53<\/i> (30%) and <i>RUNX1<\/i> (27%); the iSubtype 2 was characterized by chromosomal abnormalities and high-frequency mutation of <i>CEBPA<\/i> (20%) and <i>FLT3<\/i> (26%); while the iSubtypes 3 and 4 were characterized by chromosomal normality and high-frequency mutation of <i>FLT3<\/i> (34%, 41%), <i>NPM1<\/i> (37%, 57%) and <i>DNMT3A<\/i> (20%, 41%). At the epigenomics level, the iSubtypes 1, 3 and 4 were characterized by hypomethylation of subtype driver genes, while the iSubtypes 2 was characterized by hypermethylation of subtype driver genes. At the transcriptomics level, the 4 iSubtypes were distinguished by differentially expressed genes involved in immune process, regulation of immune process, angiogenesis, leukocyte cell activation and migration, wound healing and cell structure organization, etc. The iSubtypes 1 and 4 had the worse overall survival (OS), while the iSubtype 3 had the best and the iSubtype 2 had the middle OS. Based on the subtype-driving methylation and transcription signatures, we derived a 571-gene panel for classification of AML. Using 3 independent AML transcriptomics datasets, we demonstrated that the excellent power of the gene panel in classifying AML into 4 gene expression subtypes with similar survival outcomes.<br \/>Conclusions: iSubtypes of AML are jointly determined by multi-omics profiles. The subtype-driving methylation and transcription signature have excellent power in classifying AML into clinically relevant subtypes. This integrative analysis provides insights into the biological processes underling AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Cancer genomics,Molecular subtypes,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qianxing (Quincy) Mo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Seongseok Yun<sup><\/sup>, David  A.

These understandings have been immensely informative, but physical changes are only one of several ways to understand what cancer is and why it behaves the way it does. An alternative perspective builds upon Claude Shannon's work in information theory, and sees cancer as a result of missing, noisy, and\/or distorted information. In this talk I summarize existing research and discuss the implications for understanding cancer as a disease of information. I then explain how detecting and treating cancer look different when viewed through this lens. In particular, I discuss how this approach offers the hope for rehabilitating cancer cells by restoring expected information flows, in contrast to some current treatments which exacerbate information disruptions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-07 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Stress response,Mutation detection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Adam Julian Goldstein<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d8686227-ae65-414d-8af9-1d8679456664","ControlNumber":"2439","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

Nonetheless, determining how effective an approved drug will be for an individual cancer patient, as well as identifying novel compounds that may be beneficial to a specific population often requires the use of primary tumor cells. Patient-derived organoids represent an intermediate between primary tumor cells, whose limited supply may hinder reliable drug testing, and cell lines, which often do not reflect what happens in vivo. Herein, we describe the development of a novel assay platform, termed 3D-DBP (3D dynamic BH3 profiling), to detect early apoptotic measurements in ovarian cancer patient-derived organoids and present evidence that this method can be used to predict patient response to therapy. We have optimized the use of patient-derived organoids from 16 individual tumors in a microscopy-based imaging assay. We image the BH3 peptide-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which indicates permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, in intact organoids. The less cytochrome c retained in each organoid, the more primed that organoid is for apoptosis. By comparing results of drug-treated and untreated cells, we can identify drugs that cause a significant increase in apoptotic priming in organoids. In the 16 patient-derived organoids investigated this 3D DBP technique was an effective means of predicting patient response to carboplatin therapy. In summary, we have not only created a means of visualizing drug response in intact organoids, but also have demonstrated its clinical utility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Ovarian cancer,Precision medicine,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kelley E.

Most spatial technologies yield single analyte proteomic or transcriptomic datasets from separate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues sections. Multiple studies have demonstrated a poor correlation between RNA expression and protein abundance owing to transcriptional and translational regulation, target turnover, and post-translational protein modifications. Therefore, a workflow that accurately measures RNA and protein simultaneously within a single tissue section with distinct spatial context is critical to a more complete biological understanding of cellular interactions and activities. Such multimodal omic datasets of protein and DNA or RNA have been termed &#8220;spatial proteogenomics&#8221;.<b><\/b> Here we present a novel spatial proteogenomic (SPG) assay on the GeoMx<sup>&#174;<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>Digital Spatial Profiler platform with NGS readout that enables ultra high-plex digital quantitation of proteins (147-plex) and RNA (whole transcriptome, &#62; 18,000-plex) from a single FFPE sample. We demonstrated high concordance, <i>R<\/i> &#62; 0.85, and minor change in sensitivity (&#60;11%) between the SPG assay and the single analyte GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas and GeoMx NGS Protein assays. We used the SPG assay to interrogate 23 different glioblastoma multiforme samples across 4 pathologies. We observed clustering of both RNA and protein based on cancer pathology and anatomic location. The in-depth investigation of giant cell glioblastoma multiforme (gcGBM) revealed distinct protein and RNA expression profiles compared to that of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Spatial proteogenomics allowed simultaneous interrogation of critical protein post-translational modifications alongside whole transcriptomic profiles within the same distinct cellular neighborhoods. Within our dataset, we observed &#62;2-fold higher protein expression levels of phospho-GSK3&#946; (Ser9) in gcGBM compared to GBM. Inactivation of GSK3&#946; through phosphorylation has been shown to enhance proliferation of GBM cells. We also observed differential protein expression phosphorylated Tau variants. Phospho-Thr231 Tau was &#62;2-fold higher in GBM compared to gcGBM. Associated with neurodegenerative Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, changes in Tau expression and phosphorylation have also been observed in glioblastoma.

Earli is developing a highly sensitive, orthogonal approach that uses a genetic construct that usurps dysregulated pathways and actively forces cancer cells to drive the expression of a detectable &#8216;synthetic&#8217; biomarker. Identification of abnormally elevated transcription factors (TF) in cancer is crucial when developing a cancer-activated expression platform. Evaluating TF function in a genome wide fashion is a challenge, especially since TF activity is not solely reflected by just its RNA expression or even by protein abundance, but also its post-translational modification including phosphorylation. In this study, we use the publicly available multiomics dataset from Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) which includes RNA-seq based transcriptional profiling, MS based protein abundance and phosphorylation from 211 paired tumor and normal adjacent samples derived from NSCLC patients. Performing Multiomics Factor Analysis (MOFA) analysis, we identified a short list of 34 dysregulated TFs in NSCLC that displayed high expression levels in at least two of the three omics platforms relative to normal tissues, six of which scored highly across all three. A subset of candidate TF binding sequences were subcloned as multimers into expression constructs with a basal promoter and empirically evaluated in multiple cancer cell lines, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines and normal cell lines.Transfection experiments demonstrated that these novel chimeric synthetic promoters could produce robust levels of expression in PDX-derived cell lines that was 10-20x higher than expression mediated by known cancer-activated promoters such as the endogenous survivin (BIRC5) promoter. Furthermore, levels achieved were only 3-4 fold lower than a control EF-1a promoter, one of the strongest promoters, typically used to drive constitutive expression in mammalian cells. Currently, a small subset of these chimeric constructs is being tested in murine tumor models and in large animal cancer models such as oncopigs. These experiments will further drive the development of this approach for use in early cancer detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Early detection and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Transcription factor,Expression analysis,Diagnostic marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yue Wendy Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Shireen Rudina<sup><\/sup>, Dariusz Wodziak<sup><\/sup>, Chloe Xia<sup><\/sup>, Maggie Louie<sup><\/sup>, Albert Park<sup><\/sup>, <b>David Suhy<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Earli Inc., Redwood City, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0712394a-dfda-436a-b97c-586993941596","ControlNumber":"7800","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

This repository catalogs the ever-increasing abundance of cancer mutations and their diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarker associations in canine oncology. However, the design of cancer research\/clinical studies in dogs and the interpretation of the data, still rely heavily on inferences from human cancers. To leverage the wealth of well-annotated human mutation data and close the canine cancer genomics knowledge gap, we recently \"caninized\" ~ 400K cancer mutations from the largest human mutation database, COSMIC. Here, we aim to systematically assess the cross-species conservation status of mutations found in parallel human and canine cancers.<br \/>Methods: Human mutations from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census (CGC) dataset were &#8220;caninized&#8221;, i.e. structured analysis of protein sequence conservation and conversion of human cancer mutations to their canine homologous sites. Caninized point and indel mutations, as well as copy number alterations, were subsequently intersected with curated primary canine data in Vidium Insight&#8482; to determine if they have been previously reported in canine cancers. Cancer-wise mutation data were also parsed and assessed for any shared mutations in equivalent human and canine cancers.<br \/>Results: Over 90% of the coding point and indel mutations in COSMIC CGC were successfully converted to the canine genome, i.e. caninized. We found 436 unique caninized mutations reported in 27 primary canine cancers across 78 studies. Of these, 410 were predicted pathogenic mutations that likely contribute to oncogenesis. Genes affected by copy number alterations in human cancers have published evidence in canine cancers as well. We then assessed concordance in putative cancer driver mutations recorded in both species. Of the 27 primary canine cancers that have mutation data to date, 26 have been shown to share somatic mutations with corresponding human cancers.<br \/>Conclusion: It has long been recognized that human and canine cancers share similar etiology, histopathology, clinical manifestations, and treatment responses. We have demonstrated high-level conservation of mutation profiles across many parallel human and canine cancers. Our work suggests that pathogenic mutations found in one species can inform the other's genomic and molecular underpinnings, guide basic\/clinical research, drive drug development, facilitate clinical management, and ultimately, empower genomic-guided precision medicine across species.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Mutations,Human and dogs,Comparative oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sharadha Sakthikumar<sup><\/sup>, Salvatore Facista<sup><\/sup>, Derick Whitley<sup><\/sup>, Manisha Warrier<sup><\/sup>, <b>William Hendricks<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Guannan Wang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Vidium Animal Health, a TGen subsidiary, Phoenix, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"52a5c91b-eda8-4ecc-bfbf-5f78c9a1efe3","ControlNumber":"3481","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

We developed a biophysical modeling framework that combines the accuracy of small-scale networks with the power of large-scale datasets. As a proof of principle, we implemented this framework on a cohort of 844 multiple myeloma (MM) patients&#8217; (and 1092 TCGA breast cancer patients) z-normalized RNAseq data using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding to construct a disease-specific transcriptomic map, where genes closer to each other co-express within the cohort. Fuzzy c-means clustering is carried out to identify clusters of genes that are likely regulated by a common transcription factor (TF). We construct a gene regulatory network (GRN) for each cluster of co-expressing genes on a disease-specific transcriptomic map by identifying upstream TFs for each cluster using publicly available databases ENCODE and ChEA, and kinases that phosphorylate these TFs using PhosphoSitePlus and PhosphoPoint. An exhaustive list of TFs and kinases are reduced to a few key predictor variables using regression tree modeling for each gene in that cluster. This leads to a cascading network of kinases that phosphorylate TFs, which regulate expression of genes in a cluster. We derived a mechanistic model from first-principles to define functional relationships governing the GRN; where transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications are modeled using first-order reversible reaction kinetic equations. The patient-specific rate constants of the model are parametrized by single sample gene set enrichment analysis scores of key KEGG pathways like ribosome, protein synthesis, RNA degradation, etc. The system of differential equations, under steady-state, reduce to an algebraic equation that can predict the expression of every gene in a cluster from the expression of its upstream TFs and kinases alone, which is fitted to RNAseq data of 422 MM patients to estimate undetermined parameters. The remaining patients&#8217; data is used to estimate the accuracy of the model using Pearson&#8217;s correlation (model predicted vs actual) coefficient, r. Out of 16,738 genes, 7,936 were predicted accurately (r&#62;0.5), while the remaining genes were shown to have a significant overlap (hypergeometric test; p-value&#60;1e-48 and representation factor = 7.27) with genes that have high variability in chromatin accessibility across patients. A reduced GRN with only accurately predicted genes is obtained for each cluster, followed by linking GRNs to each other through TFs and kinases that are featured in other GRNs; where betweenness centrality measures of the resulting directed graph identifies disease-specific master regulators. MYC, STAT3, CREB1, POLR2A, PLK1, and TP53 are found to be key hubs in MM network; similar analyses are being conducted for other cancers featured in TCGA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-07 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Gene regulatory network,Master regulator,Regression trees,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Praneeth Reddy Sudalagunta<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rafael Renatino Canevarolo<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Meads<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Coelho Siqueira Silva<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaohong Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Raghunandan Reddy Alugubelli<sup>1<\/sup>, Joon-hyun Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Erez Persi<sup>3<\/sup>, Mehdi Damaghi<sup>2<\/sup>, Kenneth  H.

PanCa is the 4th leading cause of cancer death with a 5-year survival rate of only 9%, along with a poor prognosis. Generally (around 85-90%) PanCa are adenocarcinomas, such as Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). PDAC is now one of the most challenging tumor entities worldwide, characterized as a highly aggressive disease with dismal overall prognosis with a mortality rate near the incidence rate. For PDAC, no early tumor specific biomarker is available, therefore, novel early detection biomarker strategy is immediately required to upgrade the narrow diagnostic portfolio against PanCa. Considering this alarming situation, our team has identified a novel oncogenic protein, Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 7 (CEACAM7). Our studies suggested high CEACAM7 expression in PDAC tumors and its association with patient survival. In this study we have investigated the potential role of CECAM7 for early PDAC diagnosis and its role in PDAC progression.<br \/>Methodology: This study includes bioinformatics pre-screening using publicly available cancer databases followed by molecular biology techniques. To detect the degree of expression of CEACAM7 in normal pancreatic cell (HPNE) and PDAC progressive cellular models, we have minutely scrutinized the PDAC cell panel (HPAF-2, SU86.86 &#38; Panc-1) &#38; TMAs of PDAC patients, in terms of mRNA &#38; protein expression level of CEACAM7. The confocal microscopy was performed to identify the intensity and localization of CEACAM7 protein. IHC analysis was also performed to identify the protein expressions in the pancreatitis and tumor cores along with their locations, grading and Mean Composite Score.<br \/>Results: Bioinformatic results confirmed the relevance of CEACAM7 as a potential early diagnostic and prognostic marker of PDAC. HPAF2 (well differentiated) expressed highest mRNA and protein expression analyses, followed by SU86.86 (moderately differentiated) and very low expression in AsPc1 (poorly differentiated), and Panc1 (poorly differentiated). The IHC analyses of TMAs exhibited negligible or faint staining in pancreatitis (chronic and acute) and most of the positive cases were in tumor grading 1 &#38; 2.<br \/>Conclusion: Our observations clearly cite that CEACAM7 can serve as a potential early diagnostic and\/or prognostic marker of PDAC and may also potentiate the sensitivity of the existing biomarker panel of PDAC. However, further studies are warranted to determine its clinical significance.<br \/>Keywords: Pancreatic cancer, PDAC, CEACAM7, Early detection biomarker, Tumor grading","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Early detection and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Early detection,Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anupam Dhasmana<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Swati Dhasmana<sup><\/sup>, Sheema Khan<sup><\/sup>, Murali  M.

A pathologic grading system defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) scaled 1-3 offers a means to guide the course of treatment. While Ki-67 is considered a gold standard tumor grading marker, Somatostatin Receptor 2 (SSTR2) has been strongly associated with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors, as it mediates the effects of somatostatin, an anti-cell-proliferation hormone. This study aims to focus on only SSTR2 and its stratified relationship with tumor grade to perform a similar role as Ki-67, given previous association with low-grade tumors. The main purpose of this study is to extract a variety of features from tumor histology images including SSTR2 expression, as well as textural features. Textural analysis offers an exhaustive method to extract morphologic characteristics from images and explore patterns unrecognizable to the human eye. This study will be accomplished through 3 objectives: first, to explore the relationship of SSTR2 expressive features to tumor grade. Second, to create a classification task to determine if machine learning models are able to accurately predict tumor grade directly from values of SSTR2 expression. The final objective of this study is to incorporate textural features into the classification task, and determine whether adding textural features to the classification dataset will improve the ML models&#8217; ability to predict tumor grade. TMAs were stained for SSTR2, then scanned and analyzed to determine various quantifiable values: percent SSTR2, percent 1+ cells, percent 2+ cells, and percent 3+ cells, and H-score. From the data analysis, percent SSTR2 was the only value with nonconcurrent thresholds per grade: 51-98% for grade 1, 24-47% for grade 2, and .03-20% for grade 3. Textural features local binary pattern (LBP) as well as Grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were extracted from the tumor images as well. Four separate machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, naive bayes, and support vector machine) were run on this collected dataset in 3 separate combinations: SSTR2 alone, Textural features alone, and a combination of SSTR2 and textural features. The dataset with the highest average classification metrics was SSTR2 expression alone, with the random forest classifier yielding 100 percent precision and accuracy. Two of the machine learning models improved in precision and accuracy when textural features were added to the SSTR2 dataset. The lowest-performing dataset was the textural features dataset, due to a heavy class imbalance that impacted the performance of the ML models. The results of this study depict a highly stratified relationship between SSTR2 percentage and tumor grade, and that adding textural features to the SSTR2 dataset will increase grade-classification abilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Biomarkers,Immunohistochemistry,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leah Sherbansky<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Patrick Savickas<sup><\/sup>, Sharwari Phanse<sup><\/sup>, Jack Casey<sup><\/sup>, Julie Feldstein<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>HistoWiz, Brooklyn, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"401dee1d-14c4-4a88-b4d0-acc9abb1aeed","ControlNumber":"5085","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Multiple IHC stainings are required for an accurate detection of TLS, making it challenging to implement as a clinical biomarker. Here, we developed a deep learning (DL) model that extracts nuclear morphology features to detect TLS from H&#38;E slides and demonstrated its prognostic role in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.<br \/>Methods: A publicly available dataset consisting of 140 tissue cores from 35 CRC pts stained with H&#38;E and 56 protein markers using the CODEX multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) system was analyzed. Immune cell aggregates on the H&#38;E were annotated by expert pathologists as either TLS or lymphocyte aggregates (LA), based on marker expression from the mIF stain on the same core. TLS were defined as dense aggregates of CD3+\/CD20+\/CD21+ cells, while all other immune cell aggregates were defined as LA. Next, HoVerNet was used to perform nuclear segmentation on cells within the TLS and LA on the H&#38;E. Nuclear features including eccentricity, solidity, convexity, and nuclear intensity per cell were extracted and the mean and variance of each feature was summarized per tissue core. Based on these features, a univariate analysis comparing TLS and LA was performed, and a TLS classifier was trained using multivariate logistic regression. The classifier performance was assessed using 5 repeats of 5-fold cross validation and average accuracy and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated. Overall survival (OS) was compared between patients with predicted TLS and LA using a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.<br \/>Results: From the 140 tissue cores, we identified cores with either TLS (n=18), LA (n=34) or none (n=92). No core presented both TLS and LA. In a Mann Whitney univariate analysis, cells in TLS areas demonstrated a higher mean nuclear eccentricity (p&#60;0.0001) and solidity (p=0.01) along with lower variance in these features (p&#60;0.0001 and p=0.001, respectively) compared to cells in LA. The multivariate classifier trained on nuclear features exhibited a 90.4% average accuracy (p&#60;0.0001) and 94% AUC (p&#60;0.0001) in differentiating between TLS and LA. Median OS was significantly higher in patients with at least one predicted TLS (n=13) vs. patients with at least one predicted LA (n=13) detected on H&#38;E (NR vs. 19 months, HR=0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.78; p=0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Nuclear based morphological features can be used to accurately detect the presence of TLS and LA from H&#38;E slides, without the need for mIF or IHC stainings. Given the predictive value of TLS presence, this work demonstrates the potential for H&#38;E slides to be used for patient selection for immunotherapy treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Becky Arbiv<sup><\/sup>, Tal Dankovich<sup><\/sup>, Sun Dagan<sup><\/sup>, Yuval Shachaf<sup><\/sup>, Tomer Dicker<sup><\/sup>, Ron Elran<sup><\/sup>, Avi Laniado<sup><\/sup>, Amit Bart<sup><\/sup>, Ori Zelichov<sup><\/sup>, <b>Ettai Markovits<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nucleai, Tel Aviv, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"174f7794-cc4f-4295-a419-b268f73ee28c","ControlNumber":"5994","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;B.

Detection of plasma miRs is typically performed using qRT-PCR, which is time-intensive and laborious. We developed a novel technique, SiM-Flow, that rapidly and accurately quantifies miRs from low blood volumes (~100 uL). SiM-Flow uses a fluorescence-based flow cytometer to digitally count nucleic acids that have been extended and fluorescently tagged. Our goal was to compare plasma miR detection using SiM-Flow with qRT-PCR assays and determine clinical outcomes in mCRPC stage.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Forty mCRPC patients undergoing state-specific treatment were enrolled prospectively. Uniform processing of plasma was performed on patient blood samples. Total RNA was extracted from 100 &#181;L of plasma and qRT-PCR was performed using TaqMan miRNA assays for targets miR-375 and miR-1290, endogenous controls miR-30a-5p and miR-16, and exogenous control cel-miR-39. SiM-Flow was conducted using a commercial flow cytometer to count fluorescent barcoded rolling-circle-amplification-extended miR nanoparticles for the same targets. Target miR-375 and miR-1290 were normalized using the geometric means of endogenous controls miR-30a-5p, miR-16, and miR-39 and compared across the two assays by Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation analysis. Survival analysis was calculated from date of developing mCRPC to death using Cox Proportional Hazard Regression (CPHR) for association with mean of the miR targets normalized by miR-16.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>qRT-PCR assays were optimized to detect native targets, endogenous controls, and spike-in miRs from plasma with &#8804;100 aM limit of detection (LOD), while SiM-Flow was able to detect miRs from plasma with &#8804;10 aM LOD. After normalization, target miRs in plasma were detected in 26\/40 mCRPC patients by qRT-PCR and in 31\/40 patients by SiM-Flow. The Spearman Rho for normalized miR-375 was 0.738 and normalized miR-1290 was 0.130.

However, the specific interactions between malignant and non-malignant cells that predispose drug resistance and their changes during treatment remain widely unknown. Here we examine the composition, communication, and phenotypic diversity of tumor-associated cell populations in serial biopsies from early-stage ER+ breast cancers. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile over 400 thousand malignant and non-malignant cells from patient tumor samples obtained before, during and after treatment. The patients received either endocrine therapy (letrozole) alone or in combination with a CDK4\/6 cell cycle inhibitor (ribociclib). Our analyses reveal that cancer cells from ribociclib-resistant tumors stimulate macrophage differentiation towards an immune-suppressive phenotype through upregulation of a diversity of cytokines and growth factors. The macrophage phenotype shift leads to reduced crosstalk with cytotoxic T-cells via IL-2\/15\/18 receptors, diminishing T-cell activation and recruitment. These results indicate that cancer communications promoting an immune-cold TME predispose tumors to develop CDK4\/6 cell cycle inhibitor resistance, and that the beneficial effects of blocking cancer cell proliferation must be balanced against their inhibitory effect on immune cell division and activation. An optimal treatment strategy will require coupling the prevention of cancer division with activation of an effective cytotoxic T-cell response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle inhibitors,Immune response,Macrophages,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jason  I.

Given the limited capacity within a scientific manuscript to share experimental data, various approaches have been developed: some data are simply excluded from the publication, moved to the supplementary materials, external repositories are used, and big research programmes present their integrated results on dedicated websites. This last approach has been extremely successful in generating comprehensive and unbiased datasets used by legions of scientists to discover new mechanisms driving cancer, biomarkers and drug targets. However, journal publications are still delivering more data globally, especially from rare cancers and underrepresented populations. To bring the full potential of these data and to make all this knowledge fully available, several challenges need to be addressed. COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) has an in-house expert curation team that extracts information about genetic variants, their significance, patients and their response to therapy from publications and integrates it into a standardised cross-referenced database available to the scientific community. Although curators are able to extract data presented in non-standard forms (e.g. manuscript figures), interpret and translate between various data formats, they cannot extract data that are not included in the publication. Approximately one third of manuscripts that are curateable are discarded due to the absence of data generated in the research process but not included in the publication. This clearly shows an urgent need for bringing researchers, publishers, and curators together to develop new publication standards that would allow communities to fully exploit the potential of published data and make them re-usable for further discoveries. We would like to propose several suggestions to start this discussion: - Use accepted naming conventions and standards to make your data interoperable, think about your work as part of the world heritage - Include all data you generate; even if not directly relevant to the manuscript topic, they may be invaluable for somebody else&#8217;s research - Share full data and use service providers that share all the data with you - When possible, share the data per patient or sample, not per cohort - Publishing a manuscript is not an endpoint, there&#8217;s a huge potential in your data to be further utilised to fight cancer","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Cancer genomics,Precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexander Holmes<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sari  A.

The samples are ready for use in off-the-shelf molecular analysis workflows (qPCR, Next Gen Sequencing,&nbsp;etc).&nbsp; The system decreases the tumor cellularity requirements for clinical analysis by extracting only the area enriched for informative biomarkers.&nbsp;&nbsp;To demonstrate the capability of the system we used an AI based digital pathology model that was developed to identify multiple cellular phenotypes from a H&#38;E stained colorectal cancer FFPE tissue sections.&nbsp; We used the digital pathology output to guide the microdissection of RNA from tumor buds, carcinoma, immature stroma and inflammatory stroma in a paired designed RNA seq experiment.&nbsp; The data showed that the system is capable of enriching the tumor-bud tissue content&nbsp; from&#60;1% in the tissue to ~50% purity in the crude lysate.&nbsp; Bioinformatic analysis of the RNAseq signatures showed that the&nbsp; tumor buds had a distinct RNAseq signature relative to the other three cell types and that the gene expression pattern was consistent with EMT pathways. The methodology is scalable, robust, and simpler than current microdissection techniques. This technology can be used to develop novel tests by integrating with AI algorithms, targeting tissue enriched for predictive biomarkers, and enabling low tumor cellularity samples to be analyzed with high precision.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Metastasis,Cancer markers,Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>John  H.

Previous work has shown that the Cytosponge, a non-endoscopic test, coupled with biomarkers (TFF3, atypia, p53) can be used to identify and risk-stratify individuals with BE. However, the Cytosponge workflow to date has required a time consuming pathology review.<br \/>Methods: We collected 1,700 BE Cytosponge WSIs from over 800 patients. We hand-drew over 30,000 digital annotations on the WSIs, a 300-hour collaborative effort between a computer scientist and 4 pathologists. Using these data for training, validation, and testing, we developed a deep learning system to determine whether cellular atypia and\/or p53 overexpression is present. We used this system in a machine-assisted (MA) review process to highlight the most diagnostically interesting regions of WSIs for pathologist review. In our proposed system, patients are automatically triaged into high or low confidence positive, and high confidence negative classes for both atypia and p53 status, and only low confidence cases are sent for MA review.<br \/>Results: Out of 23 architectures, the best atypia model achieves an accuracy of 0.90, and the best p53 model 0.96. The model was concordant with pathologists in 342\/425 (80.5%) validation and 301\/330 (91.2%) test-set patients. The system also identified 83 validation cases with atypia and\/or p53 that were not previously reported by the pathologists. Of these, 29 (35%) were confirmed abnormal with the ground truth endoscopy biopsies (11 high grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma, 14 low grade dysplasia, 5 indefinite for dysplasia). In the test set 29 results were discordant with pathology including 6 (21%) confirmed abnormal on endoscopy biopsies (3 HGD\/IMC, 2 LGD, 1 IND). We used the models&#8217; outputs to localize where these &#8220;missed&#8221; regions lie in the WSIs, and pathologist MA review confirmed the presence of focal abnormalities (cellular atypia +\/- p53 aberrance) correctly identified by the algorithm. If pathologists only review cases for which the model had low confidence, this preserves overall performance while reducing pathologist workload over twenty-fold. MA review on the remaining WSIs is 4.7 times faster than standard review for atypia screening and 16.0 times faster for p53.<br \/>Conclusion: This work shows the potential of an integrated human-AI WSI review process to drastically expedite a time consuming task and improve on pathologist performance when abnormal regions are easy for human eyes to miss. This work therefore lays the groundwork for similar machine-doctor approaches in other areas of medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Esophageal cancer,Deep learning,Histopathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Adam  G.

TLS presence in the tumor environment has been associated with positive clinical outcomes and response to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Using a fluorescent multiplex panel consisting of Pan-cytokeratin (PanCK), Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1), cluster of differentiation (CD) 8, CD3, and CD68 we developed a HALO-based artificial intelligence (AI) classifier to detect TLSs in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue. In conjunction with cell-type and spatial analyses, we used the AI TLS classifier to characterize several features of the TLS and peri-TLS environment. We trained the AI classifier using 51 examples of TLSs from 8 patients, and applied it to images of 21 CRC patient tissues. TLSs were detected in 9\/21 patient samples. We then used cellular detection and spatial analysis to characterize features of the TLS, including the germinal center (GC), T cell zone and peri-TLS area. We detected a higher cell density (Mean=12250 &#177;2039 SD; cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>) within the interior of AI-detected GCs relative to the 1<sup>st<\/sup> 200 &#956;m outside of the AI-defined GC border (8005&#177;1870). In addition, we examined the spatial distribution of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells relative to the TLS GC. We found elevated CD3+ cell density in the interior of the GC (5784&#177;1649) and within 200 &#956;m of the GC border (5126&#177;2239) which decreased at distances &#62;200 &#956;m from the GC border. We found CD8+ density to be elevated within the 1<sup>st<\/sup> 200 &#956;m of the GC border (1903&#177;1182) and declined 400 &#956;m away from the GC border (963&#177;828). The spatial distribution of T cells surrounding an area of high cell density is indicative of a T cell zone surrounding germinal center. Further analysis of the AI-detected TLS GCs indicated that PD-L1+ cell density was highest within the germinal center ( 355&#177; 534;9) relative to the exterior of the germinal center (1<sup>st<\/sup> 150&#956;m outside germinal center:276&#177; 441). We created an AI classifier that can detect TLS(s) within patient tissue in the absence of a B-cell marker and confirmed that our AI classifier was detecting TLSs by characterizing canonical features of TLSs. Further exploration of the TLS and peri-TLS area may offer insights into immune-tumor interaction within the tumor microenvironment, and paired detection of TLSs in a clinical cohort with outcome data may predict patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,Tertiary Lymphoid Structure,Immune cells,Artificial Intelligence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samantha Burg<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nathaniel Hart<sup>1<\/sup>, Astin Powers<sup>2<\/sup>, Wenjun Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pharma Services Assay Development, Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ,<sup>2<\/sup>Pathology, Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6ac269b7-5415-47c3-b355-ee0ea23883a4","ControlNumber":"5152","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.
