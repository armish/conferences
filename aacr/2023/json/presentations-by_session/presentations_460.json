[{"Abstract":"SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCA2 (BRM) are the two paralogous ATPases of the SWI\/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes. These two ATPases are frequently inactivated in cancers and cancer cells deficient in either of them have been shown to depend on the remaining counterpart for survival. Contrary to this paralog synthetic lethality, concomitant loss of SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 occurs in a subset of cancers that are often associated with very poor patient outcomes. Here, we uncover that dual loss of SMARCA4\/A2 represses the expression of SLC2A1, encoding the glucose transporter GLUT1, which results in reduced glucose uptake and glycolysis accompanied with increased dependency on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); adapting to this, these SMARCA4\/A2-dual deficient cells rely on elevated SLC38A2, an amino acid transporter, to increase glutamine import for fueling OXPHOS. Consequently, SMARCA4\/A2-dual deficient cells and tumours are highly sensitive to inhibitors targeting OXPHOS or glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, supplementation of alanine, also imported by SLC38A2, restricts glutamine uptake through competition and selectively induces death in SMARCA4\/2-dual deficient cancer cells. At a clinically relevant dose, alanine supplementation synergizes with OXPHOS inhibition or conventional chemotherapy eliciting marked antitumor activities in SMARCA4\/A2-dual deficient cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Our findings reveal multiple druggable vulnerabilities of SMARCA4\/A2-dual loss exploiting a GLUT1\/SLC38A2-mediated metabolic shift. Particularly, unlike dietary deprivation approaches, alanine supplementation can be readily applied to current regimens for better treatment of these aggressive cancers. * Authors contributed equally# Co-corresponding","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,SWI\/SNF,Glucose metabolism,Glutamine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xianbing Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Zheng Fu<sup>1<\/sup>, Shary Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Dionzie Ong<sup>2<\/sup>, Giulio Aceto<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Ho<sup>2<\/sup>, Jutta Steinberger<sup>1<\/sup>, Eunice Li<sup>2<\/sup>, David Huntsman<sup>2<\/sup>, William Foulkes<sup>3<\/sup>, Sidong Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Yemin Wang<\/b><sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada,<sup>3<\/sup>Departments of Medicine, Oncology and Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>4<\/sup>Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6ead3c45-8609-4afc-a014-10cd3bffaba8","ControlNumber":"3272","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

RNA pseudouridylation is catalyzed by the family of pseudouridine synthases (PUS). The functional significance and biological relevance of mRNA pseudouridylation are poorly understood. Here we report that the oncogene MYCN, which drives the development of high-risk neuroblastoma, transcriptionally upregulates the PUS1 gene. Further, examination of gene expression profiling data from neuroblastoma patients (the SEQC dataset) reveals that higher PUS1 expression is associated with poor prognosis. The transcriptional upregulation of PUS1 expression in MYCN amplified cell lines is of functional significance, as our studies reveals that knockdown of PUS1 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines suppresses cell survival and proliferation. Our RNA-seq analysis reveals that a key downstream target of PUS1 is cholesterol metabolism. PUS1 knockdown reduces the expression of key enzymes in the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol synthesis. Mechanistically, PUS1 may targets SREBP2, a master regulator of cholesterol metabolism responsible for transcriptional upregulation of enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis. We showed that PUS1 expression is essential for maintaining SREBP2 expression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells and for statin-induced feedback activation of the mevalonate pathway, a commonly used system for assessing the transcriptional activity of SREBP2. These findings suggest that a function of PUS1 in sustaining the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells is to promote cholesterol metabolism, which could be exploited as a therapeutic strategy against high-risk neuroblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,RNA modification,PUS1,Cholesterol metabolism ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mohit Bansal<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Anamika Gupta<sup><\/sup>, Han-Fei Ding<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"87c852d4-84c4-4245-9551-13089d2021b6","ControlNumber":"1493","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancer, but how the tumors fully take advantage of deregulated metabolism is an enigma. Here, we found that Plk1 could divert serine metabolism from de novo synthesis to exogenous uptake by regulating PHGDH (phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase), the first rate-limiting enzyme of de novo serine biosynthesis. We show that PHGDH is phosphorylated by Plk1 at a cluster site (S512, S513, S517) and that Plk1-associated phosphorylation of PHGDH results in its protein degradation, thus reduced de novo serine biosynthesis. As a compensatory response, cells with an elevated level of Plk1 significantly increase the uptake of serine to produce more sphingosines, which are pivotal metabolites for the growth of cancer cells. Our finding may provide guidance on how to target de novo biosynthesis of serine, serine uptake or sphingosine metabolism to treat advanced prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polo-like kinase,Metabolism,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiongjian Rao<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Derek  B.

Glutathione peroxidase 4(GPX4)\/glutathione and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1(FSP1)\/Coenzyme Q10(CoQ10) are two major anti-ferroptosis systems that prevent lipid ROS-induced cell death. Our current study unprecedentedly uncovered that the Mevalonate pathway (MVA) protects HCC from ferroptosis by two parallel mechanisms: 1) by providing the lipophilic antioxidant CoQ10 for FSP1; 2) by generating isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), a substrate for Selenocysteine (Sec)-tRNA modification for selenoprotein GPX4 translation. Selenoproteins are a class of proteins composed of selenocysteine, the 21<sup>st<\/sup> amino acid not found in the codon table. Selenocysteine is recoded by the stop codon UGA and synthesized on its tRNA. The Sec-tRNA incorporates Sec into selenoproteins such as GPX4. We showed that perturbation of the MVA pathway by genetic knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition repressed CoQ10 synthesis and the translation of selenoproteins, thereby leading to lipid-derived ROS and ferroptotic cell death. Furthermore, we showed that Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD), a MVA enzyme, was a transcriptional target of Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2- related factor 2 (NRF2), a master regulator of oxidative stress response. High expression of MVD was associated with poor prognosis in HCC. Strikingly, MVD inhibitor treatment profoundly suppressed HCC. Reduced tumor size and increased tumor-infiltrated effector T cells and macrophages were found <i>in vivo<\/i>. To conclude, our study has provided novel mechanistic insight about how NRF2\/MVA pathway promotes HCC and suggested that MVD might be a good prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in human HCC.<br \/>Funding Support: RGC Postdoctoral Fellowship Scheme 2021\/22 (Project #102010048)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Ferroptosis,selenoprotein,Mevalonate pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yiling Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Derek Lee<sup><\/sup>, Misty Shuo Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jacinth Wing-Sum Cheu<sup><\/sup>, Carmen Chak-Lui Wong<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"544832c7-dbf9-4087-9ae6-4584d82154d7","ControlNumber":"3374","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Targeting lipid synthesis through FASN blockade can inhibit prostate tumor growth. Another metabolic pathway commonly altered in PCa is the mevalonate pathway, responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA. The rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), can be targeted with statins, drugs commonly prescribed for the management of hypercholesterolemia. Following FASN inhibition with IPI-9119, genes involved in the mevalonate pathway and cholesterol synthesis are transcriptionally upregulated. Metabolomics data confirmed an increase in intracellular levels of cholesterol after FASN inhibition, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to support PCa cell survival in the absence of <i>de novo<\/i> synthesized lipids. Interestingly, we also observed an increase in mRNA levels of Acyl-CoA Synthetase Short Chain Family Member 2 (ACSS2), the enzyme that converts acetate into acetyl-CoA. Next, we evaluated how FASN blockade affected acetate utilization by PCa cells and observed that acetate uptake increases with DNL inhibition. Metabolic analysis confirmed that <sup>14<\/sup>C-acetate incorporation into lipids was increased after IPI-9119 treatment. The concomitant inhibition of FASN and HMGCR reduced acetate lipid incorporation, suggesting that acetate is fueling cholesterol synthesis. To better understand this effect, we analyzed the cell membrane after FASN inhibition, and an increase in fluidity was seen, which could be rescued by palmitate. Lipidomics analysis showed an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) esterified to phospholipids, as well as overall increase in fatty acyl chain length, events that can affect membrane structure and fluidity. Due to the important role of lipids as energy reservoir, we also analyzed the effect of FASN blockade in neutral lipids. IPI-9119 treatment caused depletion of triacylglycerides, while levels of cholesterol esters (CE) and Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), an enzyme involved in CE synthesis, are upregulated. Acyl chain length and unsaturation are also increased in CE fatty acids, indicating further utilization of PUFAs in the absence of FASN activity. As expected, the combination of FASN and HMGCR inhibitors significantly potentiates cell death, observed by stronger reduction in cell growth than either of the single agents, both in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant models of PCa. Altogether, our data suggests that cholesterol synthesis is a survival mechanism of PCa induced by DNL inhibition, likely to correct for membrane fluidity and energy supply. Finally, statin therapy can be combined with FASN inhibition to suppress PCa growth more efficiently than monotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fatty acid synthase,Cholesterol,Lipogenesis,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Caroline Fidalgo Ribeiro<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Silvia Daniele Rodrigues<sup>1<\/sup>, Guilherme Tamarindo<sup>2<\/sup>, Hubert Pakula<sup>1<\/sup>, Massimo Loda<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Institute of Biology, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3fbf1a41-afda-4481-b8ea-48409eb13c72","ControlNumber":"4800","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

We have found this therapeutic resistance is mediated by alterations in tumor cellular metabolic activity. Our group and others have found that metabolites can regulate DNA repair and RT resistance in brain tumors, but little is known about how DNA damage regulates metabolic pathway activity in cancer. Here, we show that DNA damage acutely increases guanine-containing purine metabolites in multiple <i>in vitro<\/i> and intracranial GBM models. By interrogating metabolic fluxes <i>in vitro <\/i>using a variety of stable isotope tracers, we confirmed RT-induced elevation in guanylates was due to increased <i>de novo <\/i>purine synthesis (DNPS) rather than activation of purine salvage. By developing and using novel stable isotope tracing methods to directly measure DNPS in awake, unrestrained mice, we confirmed that orthotopic GBMs have higher DNPS rates than adjacent cortical tissue that further increase after treatment with RT. Neither salvage synthesis of purines nor pyrimidine synthesis were impacted by RT in any intracranial tissues. With these findings, we opened a clinical study to directly measure purine synthesis in patients, and we found that human GBMs have similarly high purine synthesis rates compared to normal brain tissue. Because DNA damage activated DNPS without affecting purine salvage or pyrimidine synthesis, we reasoned that active signaling may be involved. Indeed, therapy-induced DNPS increases are lost <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>upon pharmacological or genomic inhibition of the DNA-damage sensing kinase DNA-PK. Moreover, RT and DNA-PK have direct influence over the spatial organization of DNPS enzymes, including IMPDH, the rate-limiting step in guanylate synthesis. Because purines can promote DNA repair, these findings suggest that DNA-PK signaling helps promote DNA repair in part by causing the spatial reorganization of DNPS enzymes, thereby activating purine synthesis. To determine if disrupting this regulation can augment GBM treatment efficacy, we combined an FDA-approved inhibitor of purine synthesis with chemoradiation in a variety of mouse models of GBM. Critically, targeting GTP synthesis improved the efficacy of both RT alone and chemoradiation in multiple patient-derived and syngeneic intracranial models, suggesting a potential therapeutic targeting opportunity in patients. In this study, we have developed novel methodology to directly measure purine synthesis in brain tumors in mice and humans. With these tools, we discovered that after DNA damage, DNA-PK mediates a novel pathway controlling the spatial reorganization of purine synthesis enzymes and subsequent DNPS increases. The resulting elevation of GTP levels promotes therapy resistance in tumors, and we are now directly measuring and inhibiting this molecular activity in patients with GBM in an effort to improve standard therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Metabolomics,Brain tumors,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew  J.

Biallelic <i>NF1 <\/i>inactivation in Schwann cells leads to the onset of neurofibromas, benign neoplasms that can cause severe medical complications and give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), for which no treatment exists. Neurofibroma cells undergo bioenergetic changes required to sustain their malignant transformation. Our group has shown that inhibition of the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1, a master metabolic regulator, hampers MPNST cell tumorigenicity. A growing number of evidence indicates that urea cycle (UC) dysregulation can redirect metabolic substrates to specific biosynthetic routes in many tumor cell types. We have found that a complete UC is absent in MPNST cell models, as they lack ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), a key UC enzyme that converts ornithine into citrulline. In the absence of TRAP1, MPNST cells strongly reduce arginine levels and accumulate ornithine through the activity of the mitochondrial enzymes arginase 2 (ARG2) and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT). These changes can reverberate on glutamine and proline levels ultimately affecting extracellular matrix deposition, motility and ROS homeostasis, as well as on ornithine-dependent polyamine biosynthesis that can regulate cell growth and proliferation. Surprisingly, in the absence of TRAP1 MPNST cells also accumulate citrulline, even though they do not express either OTC or any nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoform that converts arginine into citrulline. We ascribe citrulline production to the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) enzymes, involved in the catabolism of asymmetric dimethylarginines. Induction of DDAHs indicates an elevated protein catabolism that could contribute to tune MPNST cell tumorigenicity. A thorough comprehension of the amino acid metabolism rewiring in NF1-related tumors may unveil new targetable liabilities of cancer cells to be exploited for the design of new effective therapeutic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Neurofibromatosis type 1,TRAP1,Urea cycle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Martina La Spina<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Padova, Padova, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ff003cc6-28c6-4202-b779-53f98a807a5c","ControlNumber":"2786","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

A fusion between DNAJB1, a heat shock chaperone protein, and PRKACA, the catalytic domain of protein kinase A (PKA) has been identified as a signature genomic event in FLC, but the effect of this fusion on the tumor immune microenvironment is not understood. We created an orthotopic, syngeneic model of FLC (TIBx-FLC) by inducing the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion in a murine hepatoblastoma-derived cell line (TIBx). CD8 T cells isolated from TIBx-FLC tumors demonstrated markedly impaired activation as compared to CD8 T cells isolated from control TIBx tumors. We investigated metabolic programming as a potential mechanism for DNAJB1-PRKACA immunosuppression in FLC. Labeled glucose metabolomics performed on TIBx-FLC and TIBx tumor cells demonstrated a metabolic shift away from aerobic metabolism to an increased glucose contribution towards the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and purine synthesis, which requires glutamine as a nitrogen source. As compared to the parental TIBx cell line, the TIBx-FLC cell line demonstrated high sensitivity to glutamine antagonism <i>in vitro<\/i>, consistent with glutamine addiction. Systemic treatment of BALB\/c mice bearing TIBx-FLC tumors with JHU-083, a glutamine antagonist, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy enhanced survival as compared to vehicle or monotherapy. These data identify altered glutamine metabolism as a target in FLC, and may provide an explanation for immune suppression seen in the FLC tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Fusion proteins,Glutamine metabolism,Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zeal Kamdar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cissy Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Kathryn Howe<sup>1<\/sup>, Kayla Bendinelli<sup>1<\/sup>, Kylie Belager<sup>1<\/sup>, Tamara Lopez-Vidal<sup>1<\/sup>, Kabeer Munjal<sup>1<\/sup>, Pratik Khare<sup>1<\/sup>, Donald Long<sup>2<\/sup>, Ali Saeed<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Zabransky<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Shu<sup>1<\/sup>, Gabriella Longway<sup>1<\/sup>, Emma Kartalia<sup>1<\/sup>, Aditya Mohan<sup>3<\/sup>, James Leatherman<sup>1<\/sup>, Won Jin Ho<sup>1<\/sup>, Erika Pearce<sup>1<\/sup>, Marina Baretti<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Leone<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Furth<sup>4<\/sup>, Anne Le<sup>5<\/sup>, Praveen Sethupathy<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul Thomas<sup>6<\/sup>, Elizabeth Jaffee<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Yarchoan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Cornell University, Ithaca, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Duke University, Durham, NC,<sup>4<\/sup>Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation, Greenwich, CT,<sup>5<\/sup>Gigantest, Baltimore, MD,<sup>6<\/sup>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ad2f0f26-846c-4dbf-bc13-60246fcd63f6","ControlNumber":"4308","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

Interestingly, both proteomic and metabolic profiling results revealed dramatically different molecular signatures in non-pCR relative to pCR. Non-pCR were enriched in metabolites involving aspartic acid, fumarate, nicotinamide, and adenosine that are critical intermediates for nitrogen recycling and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which are essential fuels for tumor biomass. Moreover, non-pCR were enriched in urea cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, sirtuin signaling, nucleotide <i>De Novo<\/i> biosynthesis, which are resistance-associated.

Genetic alterations can modify the epigenome through metabolite availability that act as substrates in histone modifications, but how this translates into specificities in gene regulation is unclear. Here, we report a novel involvement of c-MAF in metabolically-driven histone acetylation, including the superenhancer mark H3K27ac, through altering acetyl-CoA metabolism. To sustain high levels of acetylation, c-MAF acquired the metabolic flexibility to utilize glutamine in addition to glucose, feeding into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as acetyl-CoA sources. Loss-of-function studies indicated that c-MAF is important for citrate-derived acetyl-CoA and H3K27ac levels through metabolic enzymes citrate synthase (CS) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Furthermore, blocking citrate export from mitochondrial via CRISPR\/Cas9 targeting of SLC25A1 reproduced the reductions in H3K27ac. Silencing of c-MAF also displayed defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation attributed to reduced metabolic flux through TCA cycle and downregulation of electron transport chain complex I\/II expression, without affecting mitochondrial DNA content. To identify c-MAF-regulated superenhancer genes, we overlapped our previously published H3K27ac ChIP-seq dataset on t(14;16) MM cell lines with c-MAF RNA-seq data. We found signal enrichment of H3K27ac at ZC3H3 locus responsible for its transcriptional upregulation, and knockdown of ZC3H3 inhibited cell growth specifically in the t(14;16) subtype. Altogether, we demonstrated a non-canonical c-MAF role in epigenetics that is connected to its altered metabolic state, and suggest metabolic disruptions as a new therapeutic direction in t(14;16) myeloma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Acetylation,Multiple myeloma,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Phyllis SY Chong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sze Lynn Julia Lim<sup>2<\/sup>, Jianbiao Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Aaron Chung Yong Leow<sup>2<\/sup>, Wee Joo Chng<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>Cancer Science Institute Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>3<\/sup>National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS), Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c3b3c07f-1c34-478e-b3de-7a05cc0ce4e2","ControlNumber":"2756","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Clinically, patients with t(14;16) translocation constitute a high-risk group with adverse survival outcomes. Since transcription factors are not classical targets for the development of small molecule inhibitors, elucidating pathways downstream of c-MAF could present as potential therapeutic targets. Critically, gene expression profiling studies of c-MAF showed a class of recurrently deregulated metabolic genes. Hence, this warrants further studies into the underexplored role of metabolism and the deregulated metabolic pathways mediated by c-MAF. First, we confirmed that t(14;16) cells were dependent on c-MAF expression for cell viability. Abrogation of c-MAF deregulated sensitivity to glycolytic inhibitors and influenced metabolite readouts. Importantly, analysis of quantitative metabolic profile of c-MAF driven myeloma using metabolomics identified 41% (48\/116) of metabolites to vary significantly. Classification of differential metabolites into metabolic pathways was performed using the software MetaboAnalyst 5.0 to elucidate a role of c-MAF in de novo purine metabolism. Despite an increased source of PRPP derived from the pentose phosphate pathway, we observed significant decrease in output of IMP (fold change=0.6, p=0.028). We postulate that this might result from lowered levels of some non-essential amino acids substrates needed by enzymes in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway such as glutamine (fold change=0.08, p=0.155) and aspartate (fold change=0.3, p=0.022). Furthermore, GSEA from RNA-seq data performed by c-MAF loss-of-function studies identified <i>ADCY1, ADCY5<\/i> and <i>GALR3<\/i>, suggesting a direct regulation of purine metabolic genes by c-MAF. Notably, to validate whether c-MAF displayed metabolic dependency on glutamine to drive purine biosynthesis, we performed nutrient starvation studies which showed glutamine dependency in c-MAF overexpressed cells. We also systematically knockdown glucose transporters (GLUT8 and GLUT4) or glutamine transporters (ASCT2 and SNAT1) and saw a greater dependency on glutamine transporters for cell viability. As a proof of concept, c-MAF overexpressed cells were more sensitive to purine depletion by LTX suggesting its dependency on purine metabolism. The downstream identification of biological association of c-MAF with cancer metabolism may emerge as a new therapeutic strategy for MM patients. Taken together, our study suggests that metabolic perturbations present as a likely key Achilles heel in MM, and could potentially shift the current treatment paradigm.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Glutamine,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julia Sze Lynn Lim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Phyllis Shu Yun Chong<sup>2<\/sup>, Wee-Joo Chng<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, NUS, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e49d57a7-8f30-4a78-bb62-859cdd586df2","ControlNumber":"3300","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

The impacts of purine metabolism on HCC survival and therapeutic vulnerability were investigated. Biological functions of purine metabolic alterations were assessed <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> on multiple HCC cell lines. Results Using multi-omics integrative analyses, we found a tumor-specific activation of purine anabolism, induced by upregulation of purine de novo biosynthesis and inhibition of purine degradation, in HCC. A high purine anabolic status was associated with dysregulation of the DNA damage repairing (DDR) machinery in HCC, accompanied by unique somatic mutational signatures linked to patient prognosis. By examining drug responses to 180 molecular targeted agents in HCC cells, we found that increasing purine anabolism induced a therapeutic vulnerability of HCC to DDR targeting agents. Mechanistically, we found that excessive purine metabolites induced N6-methyladenosine (m6A)<i> <\/i>modification on<i> <\/i>DTL, a DDB1 cullin4 associated factor, thereby delaying the degradation of DTL mRNA transcriptomic remodeling of the DDR machinery and tumor fitness. Experimentally, we demonstrated that suppressing purine anabolism or exposing to DDR targeting agent, such as berzosertib, inhibited the growth of HCCs with high purine anabolism<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Conclusion Our study suggests that targeting purine anabolism or DDR may represent as attractive strategies in patients with high purine anabolic HCCs, and purine anabolic status could be a valuable biomarker to allocate systemic treatments for patients with advanced HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Purine Metabolism,DNA damage response,Targeted therapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Man-Hsin Hung<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ching Wen Chang<sup>1<\/sup>, Kathy Cheng Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jittiporn Chaisaingmongkol<sup>2<\/sup>, Mathuros Ruchirawat<sup>2<\/sup>, Tim F.

Patients have few therapeutic options, and disease progression is inevitable. Anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 antibodies can induce potent anti-tumor immunity and have been approved as a first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, only ~20% of all NSCLCs benefit from checkpoint blockade, underscoring the critical need for the development of new and innovative approaches to identify actionable therapeutic targets to treat NSCLC. We identified the Transmembrane Serine Protease <i>TMPRSS11B<\/i> as a novel gene that promotes the transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and induces tumorigenesis <i>in vivo <\/i>(Updegraff et al., <i>Cell Reports<\/i>, 2018). Our data show that TMPRSS11B promotes solubilization of Basigin, an obligate chaperone of the lactate monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4, and that TMPRSS11B interacts and co-localizes with Basigin and MCT4. Moreover, Basigin release mediated by TMPRSS11B enhances lactate export and glycolytic metabolism, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. This is of significant interest because <i>TMPRSS11B<\/i> is frequently overexpressed in human lung squamous cell cancers (LSCC) and high expression is associated with poor survival of NSCLC patients. Moreover, as a cell surface protein and enzyme, TMPRSS11B represents an exciting putative target for therapeutic intervention. Our new studies demonstrate that the catalytic activity of TMPRSS11B may be important for the interaction with Basigin and enhanced lactate export. We also evaluated the effect of <i>Tmprss11b<\/i> depletion in the KLN205 syngeneic LSCC mouse model. CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout of <i>Tmprss11b <\/i>in KLN205 LSCC cells significantly reduced tumor burden in immunocompetent DBA\/2 WT mice. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis revealed TMPRSS11B-interacting proteins that may represent novel substrates of this enzyme. Current studies are focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which TMPRSS11B promotes tumorigenesis and investigating the efficacy of TMPRSS11B inhibition in syngeneic and autochthonous mouse models of LSCC, where the effects on immune cell function will be assessed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncogene,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Glycolysis,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hari Shankar Sunil<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Barrett Updegraff<sup>2<\/sup>, Jingfei Zhu<sup>3<\/sup>, Bret  M.

However, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, glucose deprivation for 24 h did not reduce ATP levels, whereas it suppressed lactate production. We found that ATP production in PDAC cells critically depended on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) while normal cells showed no dependency on fatty acid. Therefore, FAO inhibition significantly decrease oxygen consumption rate as well as ATP production only in cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: To test whether cancer depends on fatty acid for energy metabolism, high- or low-fat diet was tested in spontaneous PDAC cancer model (KPC mouse: Kras(G12D)\/p53(R172H)\/Pdx1-Cre model). To test whether FAO is absolute requirement for ATP production in cancer, overall survival (OS) was monitored in KPC mice by crossbreeding with FAO gene knock out mice.<br \/>Results: First, the effects of calorie balanced high- or low-fat diets were tested to determine whether cancer growth is modulated by fatty acid instead of calories. A low-fat diet caused a 70 % decrease in pancreatic preneoplastic lesions accompanying decrease of body weight 20% compared with the control, whereas high-fat diet caused a 2-fold increase in preneoplastic lesions accompanied with 25% increase of body mass index in Kras(G12D)\/p53(R172H)\/Pdx1-Cre model (KPC model; spontaneous PDAC model). Second, the effect of FAO gene knock down was tested to determine whether OS is increased in KPC model. The crossbreeding of FAO gene knockout (+\/-) and KPC mice resulted in 2-fold increase of OS.<br \/>Conclusions: The two results suggest that controlling obesity by diet as well as targeting FAO can enhance anti-cancer effect of cancer therapeutics including conventional anti-cancer drug or immune-oncology drug.<br \/>Clinical Trial Identification: IND for PDAC therapy with drugs targeting FAO will be submitted in 2022.<br \/>Legal Entity Responsible for the Study: This study is legally under review by IRB in National Cancer Center, Korea, and sponsored by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and NCC-Bio Co.<br \/>Funding: Funding source: Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2019M3A9G1104345)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Pancreatic cancer,ATP,Obesity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sang  M.

Past studies have demonstrated that targeting OXPHOS robustly inhibits glycolysis-deficient cancer cell viability and tumorigenicity. However, the therapeutic potential of OXPHOS inhibition in metabolically flexible glycolysis-competent cancers is unclear. Furthermore, whether the depletion of OXPHOS-derived ATP or the abolition of OXPHOS-supported biosynthesis is the major determinant of cancer cell susceptibility remains obscure. To address these questions, we exposed a panel of metabolically flexible glycolysis-competent cancer cell lines to OXPHOS inhibitors and tested cell survival and proliferation. We monitored metabolic phenotypes and changes in metabolites using seahorse metabolic flux assays and targeted metabolomics, respectively. Stable isotope-tracing was carried out with uniformly labelled [<sup>15<\/sup>N]-\/[<sup>13<\/sup>C]-aspartate. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of colorectal cancer in NSG mice were used for <i>in vivo<\/i> validation. Here we provide evidence that OXPHOS inhibition potently diminishes metabolically flexible glycolysis-competent cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity without causing devastating energy stress. The inhibition of cell proliferation by OXPHOS inhibitors is associated with S-phase cell cycle arrest and the enrichment of the G2\/M DNA-damage check point regulation pathway, suggestive of replication stress. Indeed, IACS treatment significantly reduces the purine\/pyrimidine nucleotide pools, which is primarily caused by aspartate deficiency resulting from a shortage in the electron acceptor NAD<sup>+<\/sup>. The supplementation of exogenous nucleosides, aspartate, or pyruvate that can accept electron generating NAD<sup>+<\/sup>, into the culture medium rescues cells from IACS-induced cell cycle arrest. Instructively, inhibition of GOT1, which catalyzes cytosolic aspartate biosynthesis when mitochondrial aspartate production is dampened, renders cancer cells grown in two- and three-dimensional cultures more susceptible to OXPHOS inhibition. Collectively, these results indicate that 1) disruption of nucleotide homeostasis is a major determinant of cancer cell susceptibility to OXPHOS inhibition; 2) OXPHOS inhibition is a promising avenue for the treatment of cancers that are metabolic flexible and glycolysis competent; and 3) GOT1 targeting is potentially a useful approach to improve the therapeutic efficacy of OXPHOS inhibition for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Oxidative phosphorylation,OXPHOS inhibitors,nucleotide homeostasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaohong Zhao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuan Yuan Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Liang Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ting La<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Chen Feng<sup>1<\/sup>, Hai Jie Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ran Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Vinod K.

Here, we investigated the metabolic determinants of the two major subtypes of castration-resistant prostate cancer (androgen receptor-expressing prostate cancer, ARPC; and aggressive variant prostate cancer, AVPC). Transcriptomic analyses revealed enrichment of gene sets involved in oxidative phosphorylation in ARPC tumor samples compared to AVPC. Unbiased screening of metabolic signaling pathways in PDX models by proteomic analyses further supported an enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation in ARPC compared to AVPC, and a skewing toward glycolysis by AVPC. Metabolic in vitro analyses showed that C4-2B cells depended on aerobic respiration, while PC3 cells relied more heavily on glycolysis, as further confirmed by pharmacological interference using IACS-010759, a clinical grade inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation tested in patients. In vivo studies confirmed a significant reduction by IACS-010759 in C4-2B tumors implanted subcutaneously or in bone, and no effect in subcutaneous PC3 tumors. Unexpectedly, PC3 tumors in bone responded to IACS-010759, indicating a microenvironment-induced metabolic reprogramming. These results suggest that castration-resistant ARPC and AVPC exhibit different metabolic dependencies with aerobic respiration being a major driver of ARPC, while AVPC depends on glycolysis, but can undergo metabolic reprogramming in bone. Such metabolic vulnerabilities may be exploited to either introduce further lines of treatments or in combination with the existing therapies. These findings also underscore the important role that the tumor microenvironment can play in reprogramming prostate cancer metabolism and thus, influence the efficacy of metabolically targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Metabolism,Bone metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Federica Mossa<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniele Robesti<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Vellano<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Titus<sup>1<\/sup>, Joe Marszalek<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Frigo<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Logothetis<sup>1<\/sup>, Taranjit Gujral<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Eleonora Dondossola<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6bb0ce8d-d2aa-43b0-9654-e9c7b3c62696","ControlNumber":"2098","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Only 60% of these cases are curable, with activated B cell DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL) having inferior outcomes than the germinal center (GCB) DLBCL. The use of ibrutinib to treat non-responsive\/relapsed ABC-DLBCL cases has significantly improved the treatment of this disease. However, in more than 40% of ABC-DLBCL cases, the disease progresses or develops resistance to ibrutinib. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need to understand the molecular basis of resistance mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic regimens to treat IR DLBCL. Utilizing high throughput metabolomics, we identified cysteine-methionine metabolism and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism to be deregulated in IR cells. We further identified interleukin four induced 1 (IL4I1), an L-amino acid oxidase that partakes in cysteine and methionine metabolism by contributing to the methionine salvage pathway. The amino acid cysteine contributes to cancer metabolic remodeling by a), in its free form, in redox control, as a component of the antioxidant glutathione or its involvement in protein s-cysteinylation, b), as a substrate for the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which feeds the mitochondrial electron transfer chain and mediates persulphidation of ATPase and glycolytic enzymes, thereby stimulating cellular bioenergetics; and, c), as a carbon source for epigenetic regulation, biomass production, and energy production. Consistent with this, we show that loss of IL4I1 expression induced aberrant cysteine and methionine metabolism accompanied by metabolic reprogramming to OXPHOS, which collectively enabled increased drug tolerance of DLBCL. This adaptive metabolic mechanism exhibited increased cysteine and cystathionine intracellular levels in IR-DLBCL lacking IL4I1 expression. As cysteine and glutathione are scavengers of free radicals (mainly reactive oxygen species (ROS)), they can nullify the effects of the majority of oxidative or alkylating drugs used in cancer therapy, affording a vital resistance mechanism and disruption of cysteine homeostasis appears to be promising strategy for induction of cancer cell death and provide therapeutic approaches to treat Ibrutinib-resistant-ABC- DLBCL for improved patient care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Metabolomics,Drug resistance,Cancer metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Satishkumar Singh<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Fouad Choueiry<sup><\/sup>, Anuvrat Sircar<sup><\/sup>, Narendranath Epperla<sup><\/sup>, Jiangjiang Zhu<sup><\/sup>, Lalit Sehgal<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Ctr., Columbus, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a6868fd7-5bd6-49e1-9795-f904955a8271","ControlNumber":"3779","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
