[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Over 4,300 children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) are diagnosed with cancer each year in Canada, 1\/3 of whom have refractory\/metastatic disease or will relapse. The PRecision Oncology For Young peopLE (PROFYLE) national, collaborative program, was created to provide equitable access to molecular profiling to identify novel targeted treatment options in a clinically relevant timeframe for all CAYA with hard-to-cure cancers in Canada.<br \/><b>Design: <\/b>Building upon 3 pre-existing regional precision oncology programs, PROFYLE now includes &#62;20 institutions and has united an interdisciplinary team of experts, leaders, research teams, end-users and advocates from across Canada. The program has 14 domain specific nodes that are unified by a shared governance structure, and has harmonized biobanking, genomics, bioinformatics and reporting procedures. PROFYLE includes genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of paired germline and cancer fresh\/frozen samples, proteomic analysis, and cancer modelling. Inclusion criteria: &#8804;29y; treatment at a Canadian center; diagnosis of a hard-to-cure cancer. Profiling results are reviewed by multidisciplinary Molecular Tumor Boards. A report including a results\/recommendations summary of actionable findings (therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic, cancer predisposition), potential targeted therapy options including available clinical trials, clarification of diagnosis, and genetic counseling recommendations is provided to the treating oncologist.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>&#62;1,000 CAYA are included from all of the provinces. Cancer diagnoses: 34% sarcoma, 16% leukemia\/lymphoma, 16% CNS tumor, 11% neuroblastoma, 23% other. 17% of participants had a cancer-predisposing pathogenic\/likely pathogenic germline variant, 45% had &#8805;1 potentially actionable somatic alteration, 22.6% had a therapeutically targetable somatic alteration. The most frequent classes of therapeutic alterations were RAS\/MAPK (15%), cell cycle (14%), epigenetic (13%), RTK (12%), PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR (11%), DNA repair (9%), immune checkpoint (8%). Of clinicians who reported the utility of results, 55% indicated the findings were useful for clinical management.<br \/><b>Future Directions: <\/b>Collaborations with other national and international initiatives and data from this interdisciplinary, multi-institutional research program will inform the development of a framework to innovatively link research, clinical and system considerations with Canadian values relevant to multi-omic profiling and drug access for CAYA. In addition, we believe that with a comprehensive molecular view of cancer, PROFYLE will transform our understanding of underlying disease mechanisms, facilitate and improve diagnostic and prognostic indicators, and identify new therapeutic strategies and targets for CAYA patients with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Pediatric cancers,Targeted therapy,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stephanie  A.

Accelerating the progress of pediatric oncology requires both therapeutic advances and attention to reducing the long-term cytotoxic treatment-related side effects. This could be achieved by targeting specific molecular changes that drive pediatric malignancies.<br \/>Material and Methods: From September 2016 to August 2020, a total of 192 patients with pediatric high-risk solid tumors successfully underwent comprehensive genomic profiling. Since more than thirty patients had two or more biopsies from recurrent relapses, the total number of samples examined was 295. In the cohort, there were 78 cases of central nervous system tumors, 68 sarcomas, 14 neuroblastomas, 10 lymphomas, and 22 tumors of other histology. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in all patients, fusion gene analysis in 96% of patients, whole-transcriptome profiling in 84% of patients, and CNV analysis in 63% of patients.<br \/>Results: The diagnostic yield of therapeutically actionable findings was 40%, with single-nucleotide variants and small insertions\/deletions being the most common actionable alteration types. In 23% of patients, a clinically relevant gene fusion was identified. The majority of the identified fusions were of diagnostic significance, and 18% of those were therapeutically targetable gene fusions involving BRAF, RAF1, ALK, FGFR1, or NTRK2. Four patients were eligible for immunotherapy based on high tumor mutational burden (&#62;10 mut\/Mb). Lymphomas and CNS tumors showed the highest rate of patients with therapeutically actionable findings (60% and 56%, respectively), followed by neuroblastomas (36%), sarcomas (25%), and other solid tumors (23%). All results and individual treatment plans were discussed at multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards.<br \/>Conclusion: Precision medicine in pediatric oncology has rapidly developed over the last decade and resulted in new therapeutic options based on molecular biomarkers and increased our understanding of the complexity of pediatric malignancies.

For patients coming to the Clinical Center, blood samples are collected for immune phenotyping and cytokine analysis. Clinical staff extract medical records for downstream analyses. Tumors are analyzed using a 500+ gene panel and genomic analysis.

Cancer survivorship research relies on large-scale, longitudinal studies that generate a wide range of demographic, clinical, and genetic data on cancer survivors at multiple time points. To maximize the utility of these comprehensive datasets, we must be able to store and share these datasets in a web-based environment that can be accessed by the broader survivorship research community. Furthermore, this environment should be integrated with analytical tools for performing statistical analyses on the stored data without needing to download the data and import it into third-party analytical software. To address this need, we have created the St. Jude Survivorship Portal (https:\/\/survivorship.stjude.cloud &#62; Clinical Data Browser), a web-based data portal for exploring, sharing, and analyzing data from survivors of pediatric cancer. The portal hosts data from two large cohorts of pediatric cancer survivors: the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study and the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. The data stored on the portal consists of demographic data, clinical data, including cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, clinical outcomes, and patient-reported data, and genetic data, including whole-genome-sequencing-derived genotypes and published polygenic risk scores computed for &#62;500 traits. This data is organized hierarchically in a data dictionary that can be easily explored by the user. Charts and plots of variables can be quickly created, customized, and stratified with other variables, all within the portal environment. Statistical analyses, including cumulative incidence analysis and regression analysis, may also be performed within the portal. In cumulative incidence analysis, users can analyze the incidence of a variety of CTCAE-graded adverse events (e.g., cardiovascular dysfunction, neurological disorders, subsequent neoplasms) in survivors and can also compare them across different survivor populations defined by other variables. In regression analysis, users have the option to perform either a linear, logistic, or cox regression analysis and may use any of the demographic, clinical, or genetic variables on the portal as outcome or explanatory variables in the analysis. In this way, users can assess any risk factor associations within a survivor cohort and generate predictive models for outcomes of interest. Lastly, we also provide the user with the option to download the data on the portal for use in any future analyses. The St. Jude Survivorship Portal provides a comprehensive, powerful, and easy-to-use interface for sharing and analyzing childhood cancer survivorship data that will serve as a valuable research tool for the broader survivorship research community.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-05 Survivorship, late effects, and second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Pediatric cancers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gavriel Matt<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Edgar Sioson<sup>1<\/sup>, Jian Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Congyu Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Airen Zaldivar Peraza<sup>1<\/sup>, Karishma Gangwani<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Acic<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaimin Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Robin Paul<sup>1<\/sup>, Colleen Reilly<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyla Shelton<sup>1<\/sup>, Qi Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Weiyu Qiu<sup>2<\/sup>, Cindy Im<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhaoming Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Carmen  L.

Among 370 AA CCS (53.2% female, median age at blood draw=31.2 [range=18.4-65.1] years), treatments included alkylating agents (54.6%), anthracyclines (48.6%), epipodophyllotoxins (29.2%), corticosteroids (33.0%), and vincristine (61.6%), and radiation therapy (RT) to brain (26.5%), chest (27.6%), abdomen (22.7%), and pelvis (21.6%). Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for each treatment, using multivariable linear regression adjusting for sex, age at blood draw, leukocyte cell subtype proportions, genotype principal components and DNAm principal components, showed little inflation with genomic control (GC) factor between 1.1 (brain-RT) and 1.2 (chest-RT). A total of 93 5&#8242;-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3&#8242; (CpG) was associated with one or more cancer treatments (GC-adjusted P&#60;9&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>), including epipodophyllotoxins (n=46), alkylating agents (n=38), corticosteroids (n=3), anthracyclines (n=3), abdominal-RT (n=3), chest-RT (n=2), and pelvic-RT (n=1). A total of 60 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was identified using DMRcate R package, including alkylating agents (n=28), epipodophyllotoxins (n=22), corticosteroids (n=3), abdominal-RT (n=4), chest-RT (n=2), and anthracyclines (n=1). A total of 39 CpGs from EWAS were nested within 21 DMRs. 92.1% (650\/706) chemo-associated CpGs in EA were replicated in AA CCS, and 98.9% (86\/87) chemo-associated CpGs in AA were replicated in EA CCS. In contrast, 66.7% (4\/6) RT-associated CpGs in AA were replicated in EA CCS, and 71.7% (638\/890) RT-associated CpGs in EA were replicated in AA CCS. Moreover, the four CpGs that partially mediated the effect of abdominal-RT on hypercholesterolemia in EA were not associated with abdominal-RT in AA CCS, further suggesting substantial difference in RT-associated CpGs as compared to chemo-associated CpGs between AA and EA CCS. Future studies by including a larger sample size of AA CCS are warranted to assess the difference in treatment-associated DNAm alterations and subsequent disparity in risk of treatment-related CHCs between AA and EA CCS. The DNAm sites can be used as predictors for risk management (treatment decision-making) and potential mechanistic targets for intervention for those at the greatest risk of CHCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-05 Survivorship, late effects, and second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Cancer treatment,Childhood cancer survivorship,Epigenome-wide association study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qian Dong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sarmistha Das<sup><\/sup>, Cheng Chen<sup><\/sup>, John Easton<sup><\/sup>, Heather  L.

However, optimal cell surface targets in many childhood cancers remain elusive and tools for novel target discovery are limited. We developed a proteogenomic approach to identify high confidence cell surface proteins for immunotherapy development and applied it to neuroblastoma, an often fatal childhood cancer. Through the Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development Network (PI-DDN), we have extended this approach to 14 high-risk childhood cancers. This effort includes MS-based surfaceome data generation for 175 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, 30 primary patient tumors, and 10 human derived cell line models.<br \/>Methods\/Results: To optimize the utility of our approach and data, we are developing a web-based application called PIONEER (Pediatric Integrative Omics Network Enhancing Early Research). The goal of PIONEER is to disseminate data to the broader scientific community and to provide the necessary analysis, query and visualization tools to make these data accessible to everyone, regardless of computational expertise. A pilot version of PIONEER was developed using R Shiny Dashboard and is derived from our neuroblastoma efforts. The application is comprised of two main categories: (1) target discovery data and prioritization (2) target validation and preclinical development. Modules include proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, multi-omics, validation and pre-clinical drug development. Cancer &#8216;omics data currently housed in PIONEER include tumor and cancer cell line mass-spectrometry based proteomics, RNA-sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing. Extensive normal tissue expression data from GTEx and mass spectrometry will be integrated. Surface proteins are prioritized through an integrative multi-omic analysis of tumor and normal tissue data. Users can perform queries and cancer subtype and cross-histotype studies, apply custom cutoffs, and generate plots for visualization. We are currently adding functionality to support automatic data analysis and integration for surface proteins (SPACE: Surface Protein Analysis for Collaborative Efforts). Through the target validation and preclinical development modules, users can view an antibody repository, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, drugs in development for each protein, and efficacy in patient derived xenograft models. PIONEER will be deployed using R Connect; data for additional histotypes will be incorporated as available.<br \/>Conclusion: PIONEER will provide a comprehensive characterization of the surfaceome of high-risk pediatric cancers and a web-based application for data integration, visualization and sharing. This interface facilitates the discovery of optimal immunotherapeutic drug targets in high-risk childhood cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Databases,Immuno-oncology,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amber K.

A total of 2,695 ALL cases with whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing were available for rare variant analyses. Pathogenic\/likely pathogenic (P\/LP) variants in 60 genes associated with autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndromes were characterized and classified with &#8220;PeCanPIE&#8221; - the Pediatric Cancer Variant Pathogenicity Information Exchange, a web- and cloud-based platform. We subsequently carried out an enrichment analysis of P\/LP variants by comparing ALL survivors with a general population from the GnomAD database and found seven significant genes after adjustment for multiple testing (P&#60; 8.3x10-4, i.e., 0.05\/60) including: BRCA1 (odds ratio [OR]=4.06; 95% CI, 2.00-7.59; P=1.21&#215;10-4), BRCA2 (OR=3.48; 95% CI, 1.82-6.15; P=1.50&#215;10-4), CDKN2A (OR=22.30; 95% CI, 5.13-96.68; P=3.07&#215;10-5), PALB2 (OR=5.12; 95% CI, 2.39-10.00, P=3.77&#215;10-5), PAX5 (OR=44.58; 95% CI, 6.49-490.68; P=4.77&#215;10-5), PTPN1 (OR=66.85; 95% CI, 11.96-670.57, P=1.63&#215;10-7), and TP53 (OR=17.86; 95% CI, 6.12-50.36; P=3.43&#215;10-7). Two of these genes have also been previously linked with pediatric ALL (CDKN2A and TP53). Repeating these analyses with 309 newly diagnosed patients from the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project, we observed similar results for five of these genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, PALB2, and TP53). To further investigate common germline variants associated with ALL risk, we performed a genome-wide association analysis using 2,777 ALL cases and 6,255 controls (5,881 other pediatric cancer cases and 374 non-cancer controls) with whole-genome sequencing or imputed SNP-array data. In addition to replicating known associations at ARID5B, IKZF1, CDKN2A, BMI1, PIP4K2A, CCDC26 and CEPBE, we identified a novel variant (rs112425636, chr17:82324152:G:A; OR=1.65; 95% CI, 1.42-1.93; P=2.48&#215;10-10) mapped to the intronic region of SECTM1 gene. Based on RNA sequencing data for 164 pediatric hematological cancer samples, we found that the expression of SECTM1 gene was significantly higher among patients with GG genotype than patients with AA or AG genotypes for rs112425636 (FPKM=1.34 vs. 0.71, P&#60;0.01). Among the subset of 32 B-ALL samples, the magnitude of difference was larger (FPKM=1.90 vs. 0.70, P=0.017). In summary, we found statistical evidence for several cancer predisposition genes harboring rare high-penetrance variants and a novel common low-penetrance variant associated with risk of pediatric ALL. Our novel findings add new knowledge to the full allelic spectrum of genetic architecture of pediatric ALL susceptibility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,deconvolution,tensor composition,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhaoming Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cheng Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Na Qin<sup>3<\/sup>, Nan Song<sup>4<\/sup>, Hui Wang<sup>5<\/sup>, Gregory T.

Crucially, our sequential in<i> vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>studies identified that RD3 regulates NB progression and metastasis, and its loss prompts the evolution of therapy defying progressive disease (PD). Here we investigated the prognostic significance of RD3 in NB, its predictive benefit and, its association to clinical outcomes. RNA-Seq data mining (4 independent study cohorts, total n&#8201;= 1013) indicated that high RD3 can predict good NB prognosis. RD3 expression (immunohistochemistry) gauged in our NB patient cohort (n&#8201;= 100) showed a positive correlation with longer overall survival (OS, P&#8201;=&#8201;1.0E-04) and relapse-free survival (RFS, P&#8201;=&#8201;2.1E-02). Similarly, high RD3 correlated with longer OS (P&#8201;=&#8201;1.2E-03) and RFS (P&#8201;=&#8201;2.1-02) in children presented with high-risk NB (HR-NB), irrespective of MYCN amplification status (MYCN amplified, P&#8201;=&#8201;1.4E-02; non-amplified, P&#8201;=&#8201;5.5E-03) and patient age (&#60;2Y age, P&#8201;=&#8201;2.8E-02; &#62;2Y age, P&#8201;=&#8201;1.0E-04) groups. Significantly, we observed a gradient loss of RD3 with NB progression, from stage 1 through stage 4 disease. Consistently, RD3 loss was substantial in metastatic disease when compared to the primary neuroblastomas, and this loss associated with poor OS in patients presented with metastatic disease (P&#8201;=&#8201;4.0E-02). More importantly, RD3 is significantly lost in therapy resistant progressive NB and corroborated significantly (P&#8201;=&#8201;9.5E-03) with the poor progression free survival. Multivariate analysis identified RD3 as an independent (P&#8201;=&#8201;4.4E-02) prognostic factor for NB. These results demonstrate that RD3-loss can forecast poor prognosis in NB, and further imply that assessing RD3 loss could serve as the good predictor for therapy response and \/ or PD evolution. Together, these data identify a novel prognostic and predictive factor for neuroblastoma.

Early life exposures, to carcinogens may affect different phases of the multi-tage clonal expansion model of carcinogenesis. Critical development periods, in-utero and puberty, exposures may induce permanent changes in tissue differentiation, metabolism, and gene expression that influence cancer risk. Epigenetic modifications are also critical for regulating cellular processes and responses during development that are maintained overtime. Therefore, promising strategies should develop for cancer prevention mainly on environmental approaches. We aim in this study to assess the prevalence of risk factors of childhood cancer in Almadinah City, a local community in Saudi Arabia, and to address cancer prevention opportunities during prenatal, natal and early children life.<br \/>Patients and Methods: The study is a cross section observational study. The population includes convenient samples of pregnant mothers, neonates and preschool children. Data regarding natal, prenatal and early childhood risk factors of cancer collected using a predesigned questionnaire.<br \/>Results: Early life exposure to cancer risks increases prevalence of cancer. Risk factors like high birth weight, maternal obesity and smoking are the most frequent risks followed by chromosomal anomalies and genetic syndromes.
