[{"Abstract":"CD19 directed chimeric antigen receptor T (CART19) cell therapy has resulted in remarkable outcomes in B cell malignancies and was FDA approved in multiple indications. However, durable remissions are limited to 40% of treated patients. Inhibitory myeloid cells in tumor microenvironment have been found to suppress T cell expansion and contribute to failure of CART19 cell therapy. In this study, we aimed to unravel the interactions between monocytes, CART19 cells and tumor cells to understand how monocytes-CART19 cell interactions impact CART19 cell effector functions and clinical outcomes. Two sets of experiments were conducted, 1) use of healthy CART19 cells, CD19+ tumor cells, and healthy monocytes; 2) use of brexu-cel products from ZUMA-2 clinical trial treating mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), patient-matched monocytes and circulating MCL tumor cells (n = 11; 6 durable responders, 2 relapsed after initial response and 3 non-responders).<br \/>CD28 costimulated CART19 (CART19-28&#950;) cells generated in the lab from healthy donors were co-cultured with donor freshly isolated monocytes in the presence of Jeko-1 cells (a CD19+ MCL cell line). CART19 antigen specific proliferation was not inhibited by freshly isolated monocytes . When monocytes were co-cultured with CART19 and tumor cells, higher levels of eotaxin, GRO, MCP-3 and IL-7 were detected. When CART19 cells were co-cultured with the CD19+ JeKo-1 cells in the presence of ex vivo M2 polarized macrophages, CART19 antigen specific proliferation was inhibited (p=0.0045). Transwell experiments demonstrate that M2-induced CART19 inhibition is not contact dependent. Cytokine profile analysis indicated increased level of IL-1ra, IP-10 and MCP-1 and decreased level of IL-17A, sCD40L, IL-9 and MIP-1&#945; when M2 macrophages were co-cultured with CART19 and tumor cells compared to co-cultures of tumor cells and CART19.<br \/>Then we conducted ex vivo co-cultures of brexu-cel products, autologous monocytes and circulating MCL tumor cells from MCL patients (ZUMA-2) collected prior to CART19 cell infusion. Here we observed trends of elevation of IL-13 and IL-5 and reduction of GRO, MCP-3, MIP-1&#946; and IL-8 in non-responders, compared to responders (durable responses or relapsed patients).<br \/>Our results support that monocyte- and macrophage-dependent cytokine release could modulate CART19 effector and trafficking functions, and thus CART19 clinical outcomes. This warrants further investigation around strategies to improve durable responses to CART cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,CAR T cells,Monocyte,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kun Yun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Reona Leo Sakemura<sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle J.

In particular, the scarcity of recognised effective target antigens in solid tumours remains a significant hurdle. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor (LGR5) is a cancer stem cell marker, which mediates important roles in tumor initiation and metastasis. Upregulated LGR5 expression in malignant cell contexts highlights this surface receptor as a promising target for CAR-T cell therapy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells against a range of human cancers. We demonstrate that LGR5 is expressed, both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, by numerous human cancers, including colorectal, ovarian, hepatic, brain, and pancreatic cancer. LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells effectively kill LGR5-expressing cancer cells in <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity assays and display significant anti-tumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i> when administered at 1, 2 or 3 weeks post-tumor inoculation in a subcutaneous human colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells that induce primary tumor rejection confer complete protection against a secondary tumor challenge 5 weeks post-T cell transfer. <i>In vivo<\/i> spatiotemporal distribution and repeated dosing studies demonstrate that LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells accumulate at the tumor site until tumor elimination, do not persist in off-target organs by d28 post-tumor inoculation and are safe and well-tolerated under the conditions tested. Together, these results provide the foundation for furthering the development of LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells for use in the clinic against colorectal cancers and other solid tumours.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Adoptive cell therapy,Cancer stem cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dylan McPeake<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Timona Tyllis<sup>1<\/sup>, Caitlin Abbott<sup>1<\/sup>, Jade Foeng<sup>1<\/sup>, Veronika Bandara<sup>2<\/sup>, Batjargal Gundsambuu<sup>2<\/sup>, Elaheh Rohani-Rad<sup>1<\/sup>, Silvana Napoli<sup>2<\/sup>, Timothy Sadlon<sup>3<\/sup>, Simon Barry<sup>4<\/sup>, Shaun McColl<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Molecular & Biomedical Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia,<sup>2<\/sup>The Robinson Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia,<sup>3<\/sup>The Robinson Research Institute\/Women and Childrens' Health Network, Adelaide, Australia,<sup>4<\/sup>The Robinson Research Institute\/Women and Childrens' Health Netwok, Adelaide, Australia","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f39102d8-7208-45e7-bc08-09810d996182","ControlNumber":"5965","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Cancer stem cells are a small population of cells within a tumour that have the capacity to self-renew, differentiate, and initiate new tumours. Cancer stem cells are known to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and are enriched in residual disease, which allows relapse. Targeting cancer stem cells is desirable as it will reduce a tumours&#8217; ability to generate new cells, resulting in tumour remission. Leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) expression is restricted to stem cell populations in several tissues in adults. In addition, LGR5 is a marker of cancer stem cells and LGR5<sup>+<\/sup> cancer cells are implicated in tumour progression and metastasis. We have designed and tested a CAR targeting the extracellular domain of LGR5, and optimised gene delivery to purified human CD3+ T cells showed robust CAR expression. Having confirmed on target specificity and cytotoxicity we show antigen-specific IFN&#947; release against colorectal cancer (CRC) and neuroblastoma cell lines <i>in vitro. <\/i>We confirmed the specificity and safety of the LGR5 targeting CAR-T cells by testing against normal human tissues from colon, liver, kidney, lung and heart. Using optimised gene delivery and CAR-T manufacturing protocols, we generated clinical scale batches to evaluate their potency in a preclinical CRC xenograft mouse model. A protocol for clinical scale manufacture of LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells has been developed using CD3+ T cells from healthy donors and now we have successfully tested this protocol using CRC patient-derived CD3+ T cells. This protocol is GMP ready and has been tested in a GMP manufacturing facility. Using T cells from healthy donors and CRC patients we were able to generate optimal cell numbers (80-fold expansion) with high CAR expression. These CAR-T cells showed high <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity and IFN&#947; release when co-cultured with LGR5 expressing CRC cell line. Post expansion, CAR-T cell products expressed markers of self-renewing na&#239;ve-like and central memory phenotype and showed very low percentage of cells that were triple-positive for PD1, TIM3 and LAG3. These results suggest a CAR-T targeting LGR5 may provide long-term protection against tumour growth. Our data positions LGR5-targeting CAR-T therapy as a viable therapeutic for human metastatic colorectal cancer types with minimal off-target effects, which we now aim to test in human clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Stem cells,Colorectal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Veronika Bandara<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Batjargal Gundsambuu<sup>2<\/sup>, Silvana Napoli<sup>2<\/sup>, Stuart Mills<sup>3<\/sup>, Emma Thompson<sup>4<\/sup>, Lih Tan<sup>4<\/sup>, Jade Foeng<sup>5<\/sup>, Dylan McPeake<sup>5<\/sup>, Timona Tylis<sup>5<\/sup>, Caitlin Abbott<sup>5<\/sup>, Allison Cowin<sup>3<\/sup>, Claudine Bonder<sup>6<\/sup>, Timothy Sadlon<sup>7<\/sup>, Shaun McColl<sup>8<\/sup>, Simon  C.

Aberrant expression of Globo H has been reported to be associated with the metastatic potential and poor prognosis of these cancers. However, in normal tissues, GH expression is limited to the secretory borders of apical epithelial cells, making it difficult to access by the immune system. GH is therefore a promising target for anticancer therapeutics. Clinical studies with the Globo H vaccines (OBI-822 and OBI-833) and the humanized anti-Globo H antibody (OBI-888) demonstrating an excellent safety profile. In recent years, cell therapy using chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells have shown impressive clinical outcomes. As a result, development of CAR T targeting GH may offer a novel anticancer therapeutic agent.<br \/>Aim: The aim of this study was to develop a CAR T cell therapy targeted against Globo H (obi-R007) using lentivirus-mediated genetic engineering with a proprietary Globo H-specific antibody. Methods: We conducted <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies to determine the characteristics of GH CAR T obi-R007.<br \/>Results: <i>Ex vivo<\/i> expansion of obi-R007 from healthy donors ranged from 40- to 200-fold post-activation for 10 days.

In our study, there was less differentiation in the CD62L<sup>+<\/sup> population (T<sub>SCM<\/sub> and T<sub>CM<\/sub>) in greater than 80% of obi-R007 cells, and no significant exhaustion markers (PD-1, LAG-3, etc.) were detected. obi-R007 showed specific cytotoxicity against Globo H-positive tumor cells with an E\/T ratio of 0.5:1~2:1 and exhibited Globo H-specific activation through the expression of CD69, CD25, and Granzyme B as well as the release of Interferon &#947; and IL-2. Moreover, the activation and proliferation of obi-R007 were dependent on the presence of target cells. All the <i>in vitro<\/i> results indicate the specific targeting of obi-R007 to Globo H resulting in cytotoxic T cell responses. In the<i> in vivo<\/i> study, the efficacy of obi-R007 was demonstrated by adoptive cell transfer in several xenograft models and obi-R007 was shown to be persistent under multiple tumor challenges in the NCI-N87 gastric cancer model.

However, CAR-T therapy has not yet been proven effective in other hematological malignancies, such as T cell lymphoma and leukemia (T-NHL\/T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Developing CAR-T cells for patients with T-cell malignancies remains challenging as most CARs targeting T-lineage antigens, such as CD5, CD7, and CD3, target themselves, potentially resulting in fratricide of CAR-T cells. Thus, there is a need for technical approaches to alleviate the fratricide of CAR-T to treat T-cell malignancies successfully. As part of the approach, we studied whether the affinity of CAR and cognate antigen expression of CAR-T cells influence the intensity of CAR-T`s fratricide and hypothesized that if a single chain Fragment variable (scFv) with a low intensity of fratricide is applied to T-lineage antigen-downregulated CAR-T cells, the effector function of CAR-T cell targeting T cell antigen can be maximized. For this, we screened full human scFvs targeting CD5, a pan T-cell marker, tested the affinity of scFvs for CD5 antigen, and generated anti-CD5 CAR-T cells (CAR5). We evaluated the intensity of <i>in vitro <\/i>fratricide in CAR5 based on cell expansion and cytokine secretion <i>in vitro <\/i>and tested their anti-tumor activity in a CD5+ T-ALL xenograft model (Jurkat). In addition, to minimize CAR recognition to a cognate antigen expressed in CAR-T cells, we also generated CD5-downregulated CAR5s (CD5-KD CAR5) using a short hairpin RNA cassette integrated into an anti-CD5 CAR vector to test if the downregulation of CD5 in CAR5s can reduce the fratricide. We found that a CAR5 clone (C7CAR5) with the lowest level of fratricide in vitro, showed superior anti-tumor activity compared to other CAR5s <i>in vivo<\/i> and that CD5-downregulated C7 CAR5 (CD5-KD C7CAR5) further reduced the fratricide, maximizing the anti-tumor activity. In conclusion, we demonstrate that high-affinity CAR may not always show superior functionality in T cell malignancy CAR-T therapy, explaining one or more strategies to alleviate the fratricide are required. These studies provide the foundation for developing CD5 CART products to treat relapsed T-cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Adoptive cell therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lee Young Ho<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Seung Rok Yu<sup><\/sup>, Jeong Hoon Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Hyeong Ji Lee<sup><\/sup>, Hyeon Jeong Cho<sup><\/sup>, Hyung Cheol Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Curocell Inc., Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"75a0304e-9af3-4779-a900-28c08e8bcfe9","ControlNumber":"3255","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

We investigated multiple approaches to engineer and enhance CAR-T activity in solid tumors. It has been previously reported that improvement in the quality of CAR-T cells, through CAR design or manufacturing optimization, could enhance the therapeutic potential of CAR-T cells. One parameter influencing the effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy is the differentiation status of the final product: CAR-T cells that are less-differentiated and less exhausted are more therapeutically potent. It is well known that IL-2 is the main cytokine used to culture cells for adoptive cell therapy, as it plays an important role in the proliferation and functional effect of T cells. However, it has been noted T cells cultured with IL-2 are phenotypically heterogeneous, being predominantly composed of effector memory cells. In comparison with IL2, IL-15 can induce a memory stem-like T cell phenotype, which is less differentiated and with a superior capacity for cell expansion and survival. Several groups reported that compared with cells cultured with IL-2, CAR-T cells expanded with IL-15 preserve a less-differentiated stem cell memory (Tscm) phenotype and exhibited reduced expression of exhaustion markers, higher antiapoptotic properties, increased proliferative capacity upon antigen challenge, and promoted superior anti-tumor responses in vivo.<br \/>Method: To provide localized IL-15 mediated signaling to T cells, we constructed a version of IL-15 as a membrane-bound molecule (mIL-15) designed to stimulate T cells in cis and in trans, and mIL-15 is tethered to the cell surface and functions locally to enhance the functionality of the CAR-T cell without systemic delivery of IL-15.<br \/>Result: Expression of mbIL-15 is shown to enhance T cell expansion, preserve a less-differentiated Tscm phenotype and prevent CAR-T cell exhaustion, leading to longer persistence and an enduring anti-tumor response over the conventional CAR-T cells.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate that CAR-T activity and persistence can be enhanced by simultaneous expression of mIL-15, which preserves the CAR-T cell Tscm phenotype and improves their metabolic fitness, resulting in superior antitumor activity. These preclinical data support the notion that CAR-T cells are designed and optimized to persist in the hostile tumor microenvironment and potentially improve efficacy against solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cytokines,CAR T cells,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cuiqing Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fuwei Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yifang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Tingting Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chao Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingyang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Gang Ye<sup>1<\/sup>, Renhong Tang<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhuoxiao Cao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Shanghai Simnova Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

We have developed an Integrated Circuit T cell (ICT) that encodes multiple synthetic &#8220;modules&#8221; in order to overcome diverse barriers to efficacy in ccRCC; ICT cells are generated via CRISPR-mediated, targeted knock-in of a single large transgene into the novel GS94 safe-harbor locus. Both primary and metastatic sites of ccRCC are highly vascularized, with the majority of tumor cells expressing elevated levels of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), suggesting CA9 may be an excellent CAR target. However, CA9 is also expressed in healthy bile ducts and stomach tissue which has led to on-target, off-tumor toxicities in patients treated with constitutive CA9 CAR T cells. To improve the therapeutic index of CA9 CAR T cells, we developed an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic gated ICT cell that requires the presence of two antigens to trigger tumor cell killing, thereby enhancing tumor specificity. Induction of the CA9 CAR is gated on the expression of PSMA found on the tumor neovasculature of ccRCC. Importantly, PSMA and CA9 are not co-expressed in normal tissues. When the anti-PSMA priming receptor (PrimeR<sup>TM<\/sup>) binds PSMA, PrimeR<sup>TM<\/sup> engagement triggers proteolytic release of a chimeric, fully human transcription factor that induces expression of a CA9 CAR. We confirmed the feasibility of vascular priming using a transwell assay where ICTs were primed by a PSMA expressing endothelial cell line and then migrated across the transwell membrane to kill CA9 expressing RCC cells. In addition, a dual flank xenograft model was used to show logic gated circuits selectively kill tumors that express both CA9 and PSMA, and not tumors that express CA9 alone.<br \/>Transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) is an immunosuppressive cytokine known to be highly expressed in ccRCC. To further increase the potency and persistence of the ICT cells an shRNA cassette was developed targeting both FAS and TGFBR2, a receptor required for TGFB signaling in T cells. Addition of FAS\/TGFBR2 shRNA enhanced antitumor activity of PSMAxCA9 logic gate expressing T cells during in vitro chronic stimulation assays conducted in the presence of exogenous TGFb. Furthermore, FAS\/TGFBR shRNA containing ICTs demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity in multiple xenograft RCC models. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PSMAxCA9 ICT cells can (i) selectively target antigens that cannot be safely targeted by conventional CARs and (ii) overcome multiple suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carbonic anhydrase IX,CAR T cells,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor neovasculature,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Angela  C.

While this therapy has been effective in hematological malignancies, therapies against solid tumors not achieved the same efficacy due to a multitude of additional challenges, including a lack of tumor specific antigens and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. One strategy to increase T cell potency is to use fourth generation CAR-T cells that also secrete an immunostimulatory factor, such as a cytokine. We have created CAR-T cells targeting Tn-MUC1 utilizing a scFv from the 5E5 antibody that also secrete interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and interleukin-23 (IL-23). These cytokine-secreting CAR-T cells have shown an increase in efficacy against multiple epithelial based tumors in impedance-based killing assays. In a xenograft model of human breast cancer, CAR-T cells secreting IL-12 and IL-23 were able to significantly delay tumor growth compared to non-transduced T cells, CAR-T cells alone, and CAR-T cells secreting IL-18. While these cells showed good efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>, clinical translation is difficult due to concerns over cytokine storm due to the constitutive secretion of cytokines. To overcome this, we created a fusion protein utilizing an antibody specific to an invariant region found in majority of CAR molecules, including those utilized commercially available therapies and under pre-clinical development, fused to the three immunostimulatory cytokines. In impedance-based killing assays, antibody-cytokine fusions stimulated non-cytokine secreting CAR-T cells to completely clear the tumor at an E:T ratio in which the CAR-T cells incubated with only the antibody alone were unable to control the tumor growth. Interestingly, combination therapy of CAR-T cells and antibody-cytokine fusions outperformed CAR-T cells constitutively secreting the same cytokines in <i>in vitro<\/i> assays. This work highlights the use of a single reagent capable of increasing the efficacy of the majority of CAR-T cell therapies and may be an important contribution towards treating solid tumor malignancies with CAR-T cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Fusion proteins,Cytokines,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>John  T.

Intense investigation is underway to improve CAR T cells trafficking, persistence and efficacy. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that recruits and activates various endogenous and adoptively transferred immune cells, but development of its clinical applications is hindered by toxicity of systemic IL-12 signaling. In this study, we engineered and expressed membrane-bound IL-12 (mbIL12) in CAR T cells to overcome current limitations in CAR T cell and IL-12 therapies.<br \/>We evaluated CAR T cell function using co-culture assays and preclinical murine models bearing human tumor xenografts. We modeled systemic metastasis of ovarian and breast cancer and assessed the impact of mbIL12 in CAR T cells on targeting regional and systemic diseases. Syngeneic mouse models were used to evaluate toxicity induced by mbIL12 in CAR T cells.<br \/>We observed a greater number of CAR T cells in the peripheral blood of mice receiving locoregionally delivered CAR T cells engineered with mbIL12, suggesting that mbIL12 improves CAR T cell trafficking and persistence. Furthermore, mice bearing regional and systemic diseases experienced more potent and durable anti-tumor activity when treated with mbIL12 endowed CAR T cells. These results were mirrored in vitro where mbIL12 improved CAR T cells activation, proliferation and IFNg secretion when co-cultured with tumor cells, recapitulating our findings in vivo. Toxicities observed in immune-competent mice receiving systemic IL-12 delivery were not detected in those administered CAR T cells with mbIL12.<br \/>We demonstrated that mbIL12 enhances anti-tumor function of CAR T cells for treatment of solid tumors. This study also showed that mbIL12 is safe, providing a translatable engineering strategy to improve CAR T cell therapy. IL-12 signaling is well known to modulate function of various immune cells, but the impact of CAR T cells with mbIL12 on immune tumor microenvironments remains to be elucidated.

However, the vigorous host-versus-graft immune response against histoincompatible T cells prevents expansion and persistence of allogeneic CAR T cells and mitigates the efficacy of this approach. A major challenge is that, while HLA deletion can result in adaptive immune evasion, innate reactivity is enhanced with this approach. CD47 overexpression can block both NK cell and macrophage killing (J Exp Med 2021;218(3):e20200839), and we hypothesized that T cells would lose their immunogenicity when human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II genes are disrupted and CD47 is over-expressed. We describe here the engineering of human immune evasive CAR T cells building on our previously described hypoimmune technology (Nat Biotechnol 2019;37(3):252-258 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2021;118(28):e2022091118).Human T cells from healthy donors were obtained by leukapheresis. CRISPR\/Cas12b technology was used to disrupt the B2M, CIITA, and TCR genes, and lentiviral transduction was used to overexpress CD47 and to express a CD19 CAR to generate hypoimmune (HIP) CD19 CAR T cells. Control T cells were unmanipulated except for overexpression of the CD19 CAR (unmodified).For 3 months persistence studies, allogeneic SGM3 humanized mice were injected with 1&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> Luc<sup>+<\/sup> Nalm6 cells and received 7&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> control CD19 CAR T cells or HIP CD19 CAR T cells.In the mice treated with either unmodified CD19 CAR T cells and HIP CD19 CAR T cells, tumor control was initially rapidly achieved. However, unmodified CD19 CAR T cells were eventually rejected by the host and the loss of these cells resulted in re-growth of tumor. By contrast, in HIP CD19 CAR T injected mice, tumor control was maintained throughout the study, including following a rechallenge at day 83 with NALM6 cells without further administration of HIP CD19 CAR T cell. Flow cytometry at endpoint from bone marrow and spleen confirmed persistence of HIP CD19 CAR T cells.These findings show that HIP CD19 CAR T cells are immune evasive in allogeneic recipients and data suggest that HIP CD19 CAR T cells are able to persist and maintain efficacy without immunosuppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Tumor,HLA class I,In vivo imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaomeng Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Pascal Beauchesne<sup><\/sup>, Karl Manner<sup><\/sup>, Corie Gattis<sup><\/sup>, Priscilla Ngo<sup><\/sup>, Rowena De Jesus<sup><\/sup>, Ramya Ankala<sup><\/sup>, Chi Young<sup><\/sup>, Frank Wells<sup><\/sup>, Lindong Weng<sup><\/sup>, Kathy White<sup><\/sup>, William E.

In contrast, the antitumor activity of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors has been modest so far in clinical studies. The suboptimal clinical efficacy is a result of multiple factors including limited T cell trafficking, persistence, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While current strategies utilize costimulatory molecules and cytokines to activate CAR T cells, a key but largely overlooked problem of CAR T cell therapy is nutrient competition between tumor cells and T cells in the nutrient-poor TME. In our previous studies, a metabolic screen identified inosine as an alternative fuel for T cells which can support T cell growth and function in the absence of glucose. T cells could metabolize inosine into hypoxanthine and phosphorylated ribose by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Moreover, we demonstrated that T cells have advantage over cancer cells in utilizing inosine, and supplementation with inosine enhances the antitumor efficacy of PD-1 mAb and adoptive T cell transfer in mouse models. In this study, we therefore engineered CAR T cells to express CD26 on the cell surface and a secreted adenosine deaminase (ADA) fused with an anchor. These metabolic reprogrammed CAR (designated as <sub>MR<\/sub>CAR) T cells exerts their activities through different mechanisms. ADA irreversibly converts adenosine to inosine, overcoming adenosine-mediated immunosuppression and providing inosine for CAR T cell growth, while CD26 induces a rich chemokine receptor profile enabling CAR T cells to traffic to solid tumors. We demonstrated that CD26-overexpressed CAR T cells displayed superior migration capacity and resisted TGF-beta suppression, while the CD26 expression on unmodified CAR T cells was significantly down-regulated by TGF-beta. We further proved that ADA is conditionally secreted in stress condition (i.e., low pH, lack of nutrient and oxygen) based on ADA&#8217;s biological characteristics, suggesting that ADA activates CAR T cells as a trans-signaling to the CAR construct in a tumor specific manner. Remarkably, we observed that the <sub>MR<\/sub>CAR T cells inhibit tumor growth more effectively than unmodified CAR T cells in both Huh7 human hepatocellular carcinoma (GPC3-<sub>MR<\/sub>CAR) and A549 human non-small cell lung cancer (HER2-<sub>MR<\/sub>CAR) mouse models. Thus, MR-CAR T cell therapy represents a promising approach to improve CAR T cell therapy against solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Adenosine deaminase,CD26,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yue Hu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Abhijit Sarkar<sup>1<\/sup>, Kevin Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Magnus Hook<sup>1<\/sup>, Andras Heczey<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaotong Song<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Texas A&M University, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6404a6b5-3f25-4452-b730-72299ea2d829","ControlNumber":"2431","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Furthermore, &#947;&#948; T cell infiltration of the hostile, solid tumor microenvironment is a prognostic marker of favorable disease outcome. Our team recently opened a first-in-child evaluation of unengineered allogeneic &#947;&#948; T cells in combination with dinutuximab, an anti-GD2 antibody, and chemotherapy (NCT05400603). Our focus now is to optimize a second-generation &#947;&#948; T-cell therapy by engineering the expression of tumor targeting chimeric antigen receptors (CAR). We hypothesize that CAR-targeting will further enhance &#947;&#948; T-cell homing and antitumor potency. While anti-GD2 antibodies have been clinically successful immunotherapies for NB, GD2-targeted cell therapies need improvement. Our team recently validated a novel immunotherapy target for NB, protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), an inactive tyrosine kinase expressed highly amongst all NBs with low to no normal pediatric tissue expression.<br \/>We designed a dual-targeting platform directed against both GD2 <i>and<\/i> PTK7 using &#947;&#948; T cells, where CARs are separately encoded and dually expressed. Previously optimized transgenes containing GD2 or PTK7 scFv targeting domains followed by a CD8 hinge region, CD28 co-stim\/trans-membrane domain, and CD3&#950; signalling domain were inserted under the T7 promoter for mRNA production. Purified mRNA was electroporated into &#947;&#948; T cells following their thaw from cryopreservation. Electroporation titrations were performed to optimize CAR expression to be detected up to 72 hours post-modification, which is compatible with the approximate <i>in vivo <\/i>lifespan &#947;&#948; T cells in mice. Simultaneous expression of both CARs appears highest 24 h after electroporation, with ~70% of the target &#947;&#948; T cell population modified. Anti-GD2\/PTK7 &#947;&#948; T cells are potent against the NB cell line IMR5 (GD2+PTK7+) in a 4 h cytotoxicity assay at effector:target ratios as low as 0.5:1. Importantly, specificity is also shown against NB cell lines genetically engineered to represent the clinical heterogeneity of GD2 and PTK7 expression that may be observed, where the dual CAR therapy is effective against GD2<sup>+<\/sup>PTK7<sup>+<\/sup>, GD2<sup>+<\/sup>PTK7<sup>-<\/sup>, and GD2<sup>-<\/sup>PTK7<sup>+<\/sup>, but<sup> <\/sup>not GD2<sup>-<\/sup>PTK7<sup>- <\/sup>NBs.<br \/>In conclusion, we developed a dual CAR-based cellular therapy for NB using &#947;&#948; T cells as an effector population in place of classical &#945;&#946; T cells. Early studies demonstrate feasibility for innovative dual CAR expression and show promise for strong anti-NB potency.

To identify T cell exhaustion promoting genes which may be targeted by new therapies, we combined highly efficient CRISPR\/Cas9 gene knockouts in primary human T cells with functional assessment of effector function under exhaustion-inducing chronic T cell activation conditions. We conducted an initial CRISPR\/Cas9 T cell exhaustion screen focused on previously identified genes reported as enhancers of anti-tumor T cell response in mouse tumor models, published exhaustion genes, and genes associated with CD8 T cell activation. Based on these results, we constructed gene networks from these screen hits and performed a secondary CRISPR-Cas9-based screen. We found that eight genes, when efficiently knocked out, limited T cell exhaustion, as measured by increased proliferation under chronic activation, reduced expression of T cell exhaustion markers, and improved tumor cell killing in CD3-bispecific antibody-mediated tumor\/T cell co-culture assays. Prioritized T cell exhaustion gene hits were also evaluated in assays assessing anti-CD19 CAR-T cell function. The CRISPR-mediated ablation of five T cell exhaustion gene hits resulted in significantly more effective CD19-positive human tumor cell killing, compared to the non-targeting control CAR-T cells. These five genes included a transcriptional regulator, a member of a CD28-independent costimulatory pathway, and a series of ligand\/receptor pairs that have been previously associated with T cell exhaustion and dysfunction. Interestingly, knockdown of combinations of the top three T cell exhaustion gene hits resulted in CAR-T cells that were more effective in tumor killing than any of the single gene knockouts, suggesting a non-redundant role for each gene, most likely comprising independent pathways. Furthermore, enhanced tumor cell killing was observed when each T cell exhaustion gene hit was ablated in combination with PDCD1 (PD-1) in double knockout CAR-T cells, suggesting that the T cell exhaustion pathways we identified were complementary to the PD1-PDL1 immune checkpoint pathway in regulating effector T cell function. By using a multidimensional, functional CRISPR-Cas9-based T cell exhaustion screen, we have uncovered genes that are involved in T cell exhaustion. These gene knockouts can be universally applied individually or in combination to create CAR-T cells with more durable effector activity, with the potential to achieve superior patient outcomes in a variety of tumor indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Target discovery,Screening,CAR T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Oksana Sergeeva<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Amber Fearnley<sup><\/sup>, Shu Shien Chin<sup><\/sup>, Xingyue An<sup><\/sup>, Nana Adjoa Pels<sup><\/sup>, Kristen Metzler<sup><\/sup>, Kyla Joinville<sup><\/sup>, Lizet Aquino Calderon<sup><\/sup>, Abudukadier Abulizi<sup><\/sup>, Hayden Karp<sup><\/sup>, Julio Rodriguez<sup><\/sup>, Louis Matis<sup><\/sup>, Jay Fine<sup><\/sup>, Jeremy Myers<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>EvolveImmune Therapeutics, Inc, Branford, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a36eb275-c775-4fce-a28a-950ba53e8b16","ControlNumber":"6366","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;O.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated significant efficacy in B cell malignancies. Breakthrough of conventional CAR-T technology in AML has been hampered by expression of suitable target antigens on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells posing a risk for continued aplasia. Thus, innovative approaches putting the power of CAR-T technology under the control of reliable and fast-acting on\/off switches to avoid and\/or abrogate acute and long-term side effects are required. We have recently reported clinical proof-of-concept for autologous switchable CAR-T cell therapy in AML (Wermke et al. <i>Blood <\/i>2021). However, manufacturing of autologous products is very costly and rrAML patients are often in urgent need for a product and multiple prior lines of treatment may be detrimental for product quality. While current clinical allogeneic approaches successfully prevent graft-versus-host disease, observed persistence has been limited due to rejection of the grafted T cells by host immune cells. Here, we report preclinical development of a donor-derived allogeneic switchable CAR-T therapy for CD123-positive hematologic and lymphatic malignancies (AVC-201). The reverse universal chimeric antigen receptor platform (RevCAR) is a 2-component CAR-T platform. The first component is a universal CAR-T cell. Its binding domain is a short, non-immunogenic peptide that by itself does not recognize any human cell surface antigen but is specifically bound by an scFv included in the second component, a soluble adaptor called targeting module (TM). To target CD123, a TM with a short half-life was selected (R-TM123), enabling a rapid switch-off of the RevCAR system by TM withdrawal to avoid acute and long-term toxicity usually associated with continuous activation of CAR-T cells. The allogeneic cells are generated by three edits with CRISPR-Cas9, which is meant to fully overcome graft-versus-host disease as well as graft rejection by host T and NK cells. Therefore, we expect a persistent T cell product that can be re-expanded with additional TM cycles. A summary of preclinical characterization of AVC-201 will be presented at the meeting including <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacology and toxicology experiments. Activation of Allo-RevCAR-T cells is strictly dependent on the presence of CD123-positive target cells and R-TM123. Allo-RevCAR-T cells redirected by R-TM123 efficiently lyse CD123-positive AML cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo,<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> EC<sub>50<\/sub> values are in the low picomolar range of R-TM123 concentrations.

However, side effects such as cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity often accompany and remain unpredictable. While autologous CAR-Ts are FDA-approved, allogeneic CAR-Ts are in active development in pursuit of &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; availability and reduced manufacturing costs. However, the same concern for adverse events applies. Importantly, how the immune characteristics of the patient may predispose towards toxicity is not well modeled. Further, it is unclear how autologous versus allogeneic products interact with the patient immune system. Toxicity does not correlate with in vitro characterization of the CAR-Ts, adding unpredictability to the toxicity and efficacy. These highlight the need for in vivo mouse models to explore biological variation, predictive biomarkers, and therapeutic intervention. Therefore, we developed a humanized mouse model using NSG&#8482;-MHC Class I\/II double knock-out (DKO) mice engrafted with human PBMCs to access individual variability in CAR-T-induced toxicity and efficacy. DKO mice are optimal for assessing human cytokine induction from CAR-Ts as they show delayed onset of GvHD and low baseline cytokine levels. To test donor variation in autologous CAR-T toxicity, we humanized mice and treated with autologous CD19 CAR-Ts containing the CD28 costimulatory domain and CD3z chain from two human PBMC donors (Donor A and B). CAR-T successfully eliminated human B cells from both PBMC donors in vivo. We observed drastic body weight loss and 83% of Donor A mice (engrafted with 17M PBMCs) reached the humane endpoint. In contrast, Donor B mice did not experience body weight loss. CAR-T induced human cytokines such as IFN-&#42857;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF&#945;, MIG, MIP-1a, and IP-10, recapturing clinical data. To test donor variation in allogeneic CAR-T toxicity, we engrafted mice with 10M PBMCs from 6 healthy donors and treated with allogeneic CAR-Ts from Donor A or B. Allogenic efficacy was greater in Donor B CAR- than Donor A CAR-Ts. Donor-specific variability was observed; mice humanized with one of the six donors, experienced significant body weight loss only from the Donor B CAR-Ts but not from Donor A CAR-Ts. Principal component analysis of cytokine data revealed that Donor B CAR-Ts induced more distinguished cytokine responses than Donor A CAR-Ts, driven by IFN-&#42857; and IL-10. Lastly, the data indicates that the CAR-T cells show poor expansion in allogeneic treatment, corresponding to the current literature. PBMC-humanized mice provide an in vivo platform to assess the toxicity and efficacy of autologous and allogeneic CAR-T treatment.

CAR technology is advancing rapidly, with notable improvements in efficacy, safety and complexity as human ingenuity seeks solid tumor applicability. Here we describe how to efficiently generate, expand and validate <i>in-vitro<\/i> and <i>in-vivo <\/i>efficacy of a clinically tested CD19-specific CAR. HLA-A*02:01+ CD3+ T-cells were transduced to express a CD19-CAR to &#62;80% efficiency (in 5 donors) and reproducibly expanded to &#62;68 fold over a 19 day period. <i>In-vitro<\/i> studies were used to assess tumor killing ability, utilizing a HLA-A*02:01+ patient derived xenograft (PDX) CD19+ cell line, alongside human cancer cell lines RAJI (CD19+) and K562 (CD19-). Analysis revealed the potent ability of CD19-CAR-T cells to specifically target CD19+ cells in a dose dependent manner. Supernatant analysis showed highly elevated IFN&#947; concentrations, identifying enhanced activation of CAR-T cells in the presence of CD19+ target cells only. <i>In-vivo<\/i> survival studies were completed to identify translatability &#38; efficacy in both systems. Mice were inoculated with CD19+ cells to produce multiple tumor burdened models (RAJI, JEKO-1 &#38; PDX4009). This demonstrated high efficacy of CAR-T at targeting both tumor cell line RAJI or PDX <i>in vivo<\/i>, with almost complete tumor regression seen in both models. JEKO-1 tumors saw progression slowed in comparison to non-transduced or no treatment controls however due to the nature of this cell line (highly tumorigenic) the level of tumor regression was not matched to the other models. Cell bio-distribution was assessed with CAR-T cells tracking successfully to the tumors as well as the highly vascularized tissues, which was expected and consistent with previous data. These assays can be translated to any CAR construct aimed at targeting either solid or hematological tumors and demonstrates an integrated platform for translating CAR research that can be utilized end to end.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Chimeric antigen receptor,T cell,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lauren Kelsey<sup>1<\/sup>, Karin Latta<sup>2<\/sup>, Joey Kolb<sup>2<\/sup>, Bincy John<sup>2<\/sup>, Ilona Aylott<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Rocca<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandru Bacita<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Kirkham<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Walters<sup>1<\/sup>, Charlotte Humphery<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorena Sueiro Ballesteros<sup>1<\/sup>, Jezrom Self-Fordham<sup>1<\/sup>, Louise Brackenbury<sup>1<\/sup>, Chassidy Hall<sup>2<\/sup>, Harris David<sup>2<\/sup>, Julia Schueler<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Robert Nunan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Bristol, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Morrisville, NC,<sup>3<\/sup>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Freiburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"35cb2ce2-e939-4978-b348-ab2234c2aed3","ControlNumber":"6655","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

However, relapse rates of around 50% have been observed in all patient subsets, with one major mechanism associated with CAR T failure being cancer cell resistance to apoptosis. A form of cancer therapeutic named BH3-mimetics has been designed to inhibit members of the anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family and, therefore, directly activate the apoptotic machinery in malignant cells. We hypothesized that integration of these anti-apoptotic molecules into CAR T cells would induce resistance towards the BH3 mimetics and allow combinational therapeutic approaches.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 4-1BB and CD28 CAR constructs were designed to overexpress one of four anti-apoptotic proteins: wildtype Bcl-2, a Venetoclax-resistant Bcl-2 variant (G101V), B cell extra-large (Bcl-xL), or myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). CAR T cells made from these constructs were tested against leukemia (Nalm6) and lymphoma (JeKo-1) cell lines in combination with three different BH-3 mimetics: Venetoclax (ABT-199, an FDA-approved Bcl-2 inhibitor), Navitoclax (ABT-263, a Bcl-2\/Bcl-xL inhibitor), and AZD5991 (an Mcl-1 inhibitor).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> CAR T cells with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain tended to have increased killing over CARs with CD28 and were less susceptible to apoptosis; therefore, 4-1BB CARs were used for all further testing.

One reason for this discrepancy may derive from the immunologic and physical barriers created by infiltration of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) into solid tumors. These CAFs, which can comprise 15-85% of the stromal cells in a tumor mass, are correlated with poor patient survival and can reduce CAR T cell efficacies by secreting immunosuppressive cytokines, stimulating tumor cell proliferation, and depositing fibrotic barriers to CAR T cell penetration. Here, we are pursuing a method to suppress or eliminate CAF activities in the tumor microenvironment (TME).<br \/>A potential CAR T cell target that is uniquely expressed on CAF surfaces is fibroblast activation protein (FAP). In this study, we have employed a novel, highly specific FAP targeting small molecule to direct our universal CAR T cells to CAFs. For this purpose, we have designed a CAR that contains an otherwise classical CAR except the extracellular scFv specifically binds fluorescein. Upon addition of a bispecific adaptor comprised of fluorescein linked via a short spacer to our FAP ligand, a bridge is formed between the anti-fluorescein CAR on the T cell and FAP on the CAF, resulting in formation of an immunologic synapse between the CAR T cell and CAF that triggers CAF destruction and CAR T cell proliferation. Importantly, this CAR T cell design also permits simultaneous administration of a second bispecific adaptor (i.e. fluorescein linked via a short spacer to a cancer-specific ligand) that can enable the same CAR T cell to concurrently kill adjacent cancer cells.<br \/>To test whether this universal CAR T cell can eliminate both cancer cells and CAFs, we have implanted KB cells (i.e. a cell line that creates an immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; folate receptor (FR) expressing solid tumor) into NSG mice and quantitated the CAR T cell&#8217;s toxicity in the presence of one or both bispecific adapters. While administration of the universal CAR T cells followed by intravenous injection of an FR-targeting bispecific adaptor achieved significant anti-tumor efficacy, co-injection of a FAP-targeted bispecific adaptor enhanced this efficacy without apparent toxicity. Analyses of tumor masses from the therapy further revealed that co-administration of the FAP-targeted bispecific adaptor not only promoted CAF elimination but also enhanced CAR T infiltration and activation. Importantly, a similar improvement in anti-tumor efficacy could be readily demonstrated in a second immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; PSMA-expressing solid tumor model. Taken together, we conclude that the bispecific adaptor\/universal CAR T approach offers a unique opportunity to concurrently eradicate cancer cells and tumor-supporting CAFs in a manner that can improve the overall performance of the CAR T cells in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Dual targeting,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bo Huang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Suilan Zheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Haiyan Chu<sup>2<\/sup>, Ramesh Mukkamala<sup>1<\/sup>, Suresh  K.

However, only a third of CLL patients can achieve complete remission with persistent effect featured by early memory T cells. This disparity is attributed to T cell-intrinsic defects or tumor-mediated immunosuppression. The mechanism how CLL cells impact CAR T cell potency still remains poorly understood. Here we used second-generation CD19- and ROR1-directed CAR T cells with a 4-1BB intracellular signaling domain. To recapitulate CLL-derived T cell defects, we developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> model of chronic antigen stimulation using CAR T cells recursively exposed to primary CLL cells. Upon each round of CLL stimulation, both types of CAR T cells were lack of proliferation and differentiation, accompanied with cytokine production failure in IL-2, suggesting hypofunction of CAR T cell induced by CLL. We next found that this lack of CAR T cell response is not permanent but can be rescued by strong antigen stimulus or IL-2 administration. On the other hand, IL-2 affects phenotype of CLL cells by enhancing expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, suggesting that IL-2 supplementation or auxiliary co-stimulation via CD80\/CD86 can rescue CAR T cell reactivity against these tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we employed the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide that have previously been demonstrated to upregulate co-stimulatory molecules on CLL and restore T-cell function via IL-2 upregulation. We sought to test if IMiDs can improve CAR T cell response to CLL. CAR T cells repeatedly exposed to primary CLL cells were co-treated with IMiDs at each round, showing significantly increased proliferation compared to the group without drug treatment. Furthermore, IMiDs can enhance the functions of these CLL stimulated CAR T cells, including differentiation (higher frequency of effector memory T cells), activation (HLA-DR, CTLA-4), proliferation (Ki67), and effector function (Granzyme B). In addition, IMiDs can increase cytotoxic efficacy of CD8+ CAR19 T cells on CLL cells. Overall, our study unveiled that in CLL, activation defect of 4-1BB, CD3-signaling anti-CD19 CAR T cells was attributable to low levels of co-stimulatory molecules on CLL cells and can be effectively overcome via upregulation of co-stimulation. Our data suggested that CLL resistance to CAR T cell can be successfully rescued by concurrent treatment with IMiDs. This study provides a potential translational approach to overcome the bottleneck of CLL treatment by CAR T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Costimulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ziran Zhao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, McKensie Collins<sup>2<\/sup>, Clare Sun<sup>3<\/sup>, Adrian Wiestner<sup>3<\/sup>, J.

CAF-targeted CAR-T cell therapy does not impair ECM components such as collagen. In this study, we investigated whether the recently invented attIL12-T cells could destroy CAFs to disrupt the ECM and uncovered the underlying mechanism by which attIL12-T cells penetrate stroma-enriched osteosarcoma tumors. RNA sequencing demonstrated that attIL12-T cell treatment altered ECM-related gene expression. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed disruption or elimination of high-density CAFs and ECM in osteosarcoma xenograft tumors following attIL12-T cell treatment and that CAF\/ECM density was inversely correlated with T-cell infiltration. Other IL12-armed T cells, such as wild-type IL12-T or ttIL12-T cells, did not disrupt the ECM because this effect depended on the engagement between cell-surface vimentin (CSV) on the tumor cell surface and its ligand on the attIL12 -T cells. Mechanistic studies found that attIL12-T cell treatment elevated IFN&#947; production upon interacting with CSV<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells to suppress TGF&#946; secretion and in turn upregulate FAS-mediated CAF apoptosis. CAF destruction reshaped the tumor stroma to favor T cell infiltration and tumor destruction. Thus, this study unveiled a novel therapy&#8212;attIL12-T cells&#8212;for targeting CAFs\/ECM. These findings are highly relevant to humans because CAFs are abundant in human osteosarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Osteosarcoma,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jiemiao Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alexander Lazar<sup><\/sup>, Davis Ingram<sup><\/sup>, Wei-Lien Wang<sup><\/sup>, Wendong Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Zhiliang Jia<sup><\/sup>, Dristhi Ragoonanan<sup><\/sup>, Jian Wang<sup><\/sup>, Xueqing Xia<sup><\/sup>, Kris Mahadeo<sup><\/sup>, Richard Gorlick<sup><\/sup>, Shulin Li<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4054bf6a-57d7-440a-bcd5-df8070f9abe9","ControlNumber":"3829","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Advanced mCRPC often comprises a heterogeneous population of prostate adenocarcinoma (PrAd) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and current targeted therapies often result in transient anti-tumor responses. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are being actively investigated to target mCRPC, including CARs targeting antigens that are overexpressed in PrAd. Our group has developed a CAR T cell targeting the PrAd antigen, prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and have an ongoing phase 1 trial at City of Hope in patients with mCRPC. However, we anticipate that targeting NEPC in addition to PrAd will be required to achieve durable anti-tumor responses in patients. Here, we have developed novel dual-targeting approaches for the simultaneous treatment of both PrAd and NEPC. Our first approach optimizes a tandem CAR T-cell approach capable of targeting distinct antigens found on both PrAd and NEPC. Additionally, we are actively developing combinations of PSCA-CAR T-cells with secretable T-cell bispecific antibodies to target NEPC antigens.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in CCA contribute to tumor heterogeneity and resistance to conventional therapies. Thus, CSCs are notable targets for cancer immunotherapy. CD133 is a potential CSC surface marker overexpressed in various cancers. T cell-based immunotherapy, namely chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell targeting CD133 has shown potential in eradication of some solid tumors including CCA. Nevertheless, anti-tumor function of CAR T cell could be decreased under immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Thus, to improve its function under TME, the next-generation of CD133-specific CAR T-cell is required. We therefore constructed two lentiviral vectors containing: (i) anti-CD133 single-chain variable fragment (scFv), 4-1BB costimulatory molecule, and CD3&#950; (133CAR), and (ii) anti-CD133 scFv, 4-1BB, and CD3&#950; in tandem with anti-PD-L1 scFv (133CARsL). The lentiviruses were transduced to generate CD133-specific CAR T cells expressing the second-generation (133CART) or anti-CD133 CAR with self-secreting anti-PD-L1 scFv (133CARTsL). The latter was able to simultaneously target CD133 and PD-L1 molecules on CCA cells. CCA cells endogenously expressing CD133 and PD-L1 were cocultured with either 133CART or 133CARTsL. In short-term coculture, the antitumor effects of 133CARTsL were not different from that of 133CART. However, in long-term coculture and after tumor re-challenge, 133CARTsL showed lower expression of programmed cell death protein (PD-1) and better cytotoxic function against high CD133 and PD-L1 CCA cells. The higher potential of 133CARTsL with reduced exhaustion profile would offer great promise for application of CD133-targeting CAR T cells in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD133,PD-L1,Cholangiocarcinoma,CAR T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thanich Sangsuwannukul<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kamonlapat Supimon<sup><\/sup>, Thaweesak Chieochansin<sup><\/sup>, Kornkan Choomee<sup><\/sup>, Jatuporn Sujjitjoon<sup><\/sup>, Mutita Junking<sup><\/sup>, Pa-thai Yenchitsomanus<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Division of Molecular Medicine, Research Department, Siriraj Center of Research Excellence for Cancer Immunotherapy (SiCORE-CIT), Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7f148252-9ed8-48de-bff9-67d07eb7a406","ControlNumber":"1446","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

PD-L1 is highly enriched in TNBC and has been considered a therapeutic target. Despite the excellent anti-cancer activity, the atezolizumab-based chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells showed a robust off-target effect. In addition, the treatment of solid tumors with CAR-T is limited by abnormal glycosylation in malignant tumors. Targeting glycosylated PD-L1 (gPD-L1) provided tissue specificity against TNBC, implying it can prevent antigen escape and off-target effect. In this study, we generated gPD-L1 CAR-T cells using lentiviral vectors expressing the scFv regions of the anti-gPD-L1 antibody. The gPD-L1 CAR-T cells exhibited antigen-specific activation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity against TNBCs <i>in vitro<\/i> and in the xenograft tumors model. CyTOF and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed distinct IFN&#947;-positive cell types. Mechanistically, IFN&#947; crosstalked with EGFR signaling through Src activation and, in turn, triggered B3GNT3-mediated PD-L1 glycosylation. Inhibition of Src resulted in reduced gPD-L1 expression in TNBC. CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout of B3GNT3 in TNBC cells impaired gPD-L1 CAR-T response. As a result of nonautonomous gPDL1 amplification in TNBCs, gPD-L1 CAR-T cells continued to annihilate TNBCs. Additionally, since gPD-L1 CAR-T cells provided higher specificity on TNBC, they had lower normal tissue toxicity. Overall, gPD-L1 CAR-T exhibits excellent anti-tumor activity against TNBCs, and it could be a promising immunotherapy tool to treat TNBCs in clinic. Furthermore, targeting glycosylation moiety on the tumor antigen is a novel approach to lessen CAR-T toxicity in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Breast cancer,PD-L1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chia-Wei Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shih-Han Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yun-Ju Lai<sup>2<\/sup>, Jyun Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Chun-Tse Kuo<sup>1<\/sup>, Shih-Duo Hsu Hung<sup>1<\/sup>, Shou-Hou Liu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Academia Sinica - Institute of Biomedical Sciences (IBMS), Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Solomont School of Nursing,, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Topmunnity Therapeutics, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a6059158-1871-4894-847b-c30c9b1e2dab","ControlNumber":"4593","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

In addition, CTLs that arrive at tumor tissues meet the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. To reduce these limitations in adoptive T-cell therapy against solid tumors, we here exploited CTLs dual-labeled with IL-4 receptor (IL4R)-targeting peptide and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-blocking peptide. IL4R is commonly upregulated in many solid tumors including lung tumor. PD-L1, an immune checkpoint, is frequently upregulated in tumor cells and contributes to the suppression of CTLs in the tumor microenvironment. CTLs were isolated from the splenocytes of LLC lung tumor-bearing mice and non-genetically labeled with IL4RPep-1, an IL4R-targeting peptide, and PD-L1Pep2, a PD-L1-blocking peptide, using a sulfhydryl-reactive cross linker. Compared to unlabeled CTLs, IL4R-targeted, PD-L1-blocking CTLs showed more robust cytokine secretion and tumor cell lysis during co-culture with LLC tumor cells. The CTLs armed with the dual-acting peptides exerted higher levels of tumor homing and anti-tumor growth activity in LLC lung tumor-bearing mice, which was accompanied by decrease of immune-suppressive cells in the tumor tissues. These results suggest that the IL4R-targeted, PD-L1-blocking CTLs can be a promising strategy in adoptive T-cell therapy against solid tumors.<br \/>Key words: Adoptive T-cell therapy, CTLs, IL-4 receptor, lung tumor, PD-L1","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive immunotherapy,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,interleukin 4 receptor,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dong Gyun Jo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gunassekaran Gowri Rangaswamy<sup><\/sup>, Poongkavithai Vadevoo Sri Murugan<sup><\/sup>, Byungheon Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Kyungpook National Univ.

To combat these inherent challenges, Turn Biotechnologies is developing its novel and proprietary mRNA-based technology, Epigenetic Reprogramming of Aging (ERA<sup>TM<\/sup>), to i) preserve a less differentiated status; ii) diminish (or even eliminate) exhaustion; and iii) improve the cytotoxicity and efficacy of CAR-T cell cells. Prolonged CAR-T cell manufacturing process leads to a more differentiated and effector-like phenotype, which is susceptible to accelerated exhaustion <i>in vivo<\/i>. Unfortunately, clinical evidence suggests that less differentiated and stem-cell like CAR-T products have increased proliferative capacity, reduced exhaustion, and greater efficacy. Additionally, aging is known to compromise T-cell function, reducing chances of CAR-T therapy candidacy for older patients<i>.<\/i> These compounded effects of manufacturing and aging severely limit CAR-T cell functionality in terms of proliferation, perdurance, and cytotoxic capacity, as well as precluding wider patient access. Leveraging our previous work with other aged human cells, we hypothesized that the transient expression of ERA<sup>TM<\/sup> factors could impact manufacturing of CAR-T cells by mitigating their differentiation, promoting T stem cell memory (Tscm) phenotype, reducing\/eliminating exhaustion, and resetting the epigenetic clock in CAR-T cells. Here, we present preclinical data showing that ERA<sup>TM<\/sup> treatment of T cells delivered using our proprietary eTurna<sup>TM<\/sup> platform can restore youthful functionality, reducing exhaustion and effects of aging, improving their ability to fight cancer while safely maintaining cellular identity. ERA<sup>TM<\/sup> -treated T cells have higher proliferation capacity and cytotoxicity upon tumor cell engagement <i>in vitro <\/i>compared to control cells<i>.<\/i> Treatment of ERA<sup>TM<\/sup> -treated T-cells also increases the production of beneficial cytokines to support their survival and cytotoxic activity. Importantly, ERA<sup>TM<\/sup> treatment preserves T-cell identity and T-cell repertoire, while avoiding unwanted hyperproliferation or clonal expansion. In murine models of hematological cancers, these effects of ERA<sup>TM<\/sup> treatment on T-cells results in superior cancer cell killing and clearance. These benefits of ERA<sup>TM<\/sup> technology to current CAR-T manufacturing processes have the potential to translate into the clinic as improved patient outcomes and survival with reduced side effects, thereby expanding patient access and enabling immunotherapies to serve as a first-in-line lifesaving solution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T-cell Exhaustion,T-cell Rejuvenation,Epigenetic Reprogramming,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Alec McQuiston<sup><\/sup>, Junbao Yang<sup><\/sup>, Jason Romero<sup><\/sup>, Naveen Bojjireddy<sup><\/sup>, Travis McQuiston<sup><\/sup>, Vittorio Sebastiano<sup><\/sup>, <b>Mustafa Turkoz<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Immunology, Turn Biotechnologies, Inc., Mountain View, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b3586fbd-d754-41da-a75e-d1401cd60815","ControlNumber":"3701","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.
