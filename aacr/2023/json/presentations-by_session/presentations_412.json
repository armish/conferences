[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy is capable of mediating durable complete responses in melanoma. While solid tumors such as colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian and breast have been shown to contain neoantigen reactive TIL, the success of bulk TIL therapy in these tumors has been limited. Enhancing tumor reactivity through the selective expansion of neoantigen-reactive subpopulations, has demonstrated success in cancers outside of melanoma underscoring the potential of a neoantigen selected TIL approach in indications with lower tumor mutational burdens. Here we demonstrate that the TIDAL-01 process, which utilizes tumor-specific mutation containing peptides to select neoantigen reactive TIL produces TIL products significantly enriched in neoantigen reactivity.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Fresh tumors were cut into fragments or dissociated and cultured in a primary expansion (preREP). Antigen presenting cells (APCs) were isolated and expanded from patient matched blood. Whole exome and RNA sequencing was performed on tumor tissue and autologous PBMCs and used to predict and prioritize neoantigen mutations. Peptides encoding the mutations were synthesized, loaded onto APCs and co-cultured with autologous TIL. Neoantigen reactive TIL were selected by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), based on the upregulation of the activation markers CD134 and CD137 and expanded with a rapid expansion protocol (REP). Bulk and unselected TIL were expanded alongside for comparison. Neoantigen reactivity was quantified and deconvoluted by cytokine secretion, degranulation, upregulation of CD134\/CD137 by flow and when practical, killing of autologous tumor cell lines or organoids.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Successful TIL expansion was achieved in 31\/34 (91%) tumors (14\/17 CRC, 10\/10 NSCLC, 3\/3 ovarian and 3\/3 melanoma) using both tumor fragments and dissociated tumors. CRC tumors accounted for half of the samples (17\/34), and the tumor mutational burden within these samples varied substantially, ranging from 229 to 5436 mutations. Upregulation of CD134 and CD137 and increased IFN-&#947; production was observed in all samples upon co-culture with peptide loaded APCs. Peptide restimulation and deconvolution revealed that the TIDAL-01 process is capable of enriching for both CD4 and CD8 reactivities. Selected TIL products produced up to 50x more IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945; and Granzyme B than bulk TIL and at least 2x higher levels of degranulation, indicative of greater killing potential.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: TIL from metastatic CRC, melanoma, NSCLC and ovarian tumors were successfully expanded from the majority of patients. Co-culture of TIL and peptide loaded APCs followed by FACS significantly enriched for neoantigen reactivity compared to bulk TIL, demonstrating the potential of the TIDAL-01 process to produce selected TIL products for the treatment of non-melanoma tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Adoptive cell therapy,Immunotherapy,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Larissa  A.

However, many tumors do not attract TILs, or the TILs themselves are exhausted which limits treatment availability and efficacy. Consequently, there is a need for alternative sources of tumor reactive T cells. Here, we address this need through the <i>ex vivo<\/i> 3D cell culture biofabrication of immune competent patient tumor organoids (iPTOs). These constructs, composed of patient-matched cancer cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs), and stromal cells encapsulated in extracellular matrix (ECM)-like hydrogel, closely mimic the <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor microenvironment. We demonstrate that constant circulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) through a microfluidic device housing iPTOs can emulate lymph node activation of immune cells to the tumor, yielding organoid interacting lymphocytes (OILs) that possess increased markers of activation, cytotoxicity, proliferation, homing markers, and inflammatory cytokine production relative to uncirculated PBMCs.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tumor tissue, APCs (from lymph nodes or spleen), and peripheral blood were collected from 8 patients with mesothelioma (3), melanoma (2), and appendiceal cancer (3). Chips were built from a glass slide and laser cut Polymethyl methacrylate. IPTOs were made such that a concentration of 3 APCs for every 1 tumor cell were added to a collagen and hyaluronic acid mixture that was then photocrosslinked in the chip chamber. PBMCs were circulated through chips housing the photocrosslinked iPTOs for 7 days and then expanded. Following expansion, a subpopulation of these cells were cocultured with tumor only organoids for a 7 day period. Single and secondary tumor exposure populations of effector, memory, and reactive T cells were analyzed via flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and cell culture medium proteomic analysis, and compared with both uncirculated PBMCs and patient TILs.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Data collected from patients with appendiceal, melanoma, and mesothelioma tumors shows generation of OILS with increase in cytotoxic T lymphocyte, effector memory, and central memory phenotypes when compared to uncirculated PBMCs, greater than or comparable to TILs and with similar effector cytokine and enzyme expression. OILs were also found to express less immunosuppressive signals (i.e., Tim3, PD1, and IL 10). Critically, chip-based T cell activation resulted in 10x more viable OILs than were typically observed with TILs following parallel growth period of 14 days.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This data suggests that microfluidic incubation of lymphocytes with lymph node and tumor cells can generate large amounts of viable tumor-specific T cells on-demand with characteristics similar to TILs but with increased viability, cell expansion propensity, and cytotoxic responsiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microfluidics,T lymphocytes,Ex vivo,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Damian  C.

A significant obstacle is the exclusion of T cells from the tumor microenvironment (TME). In contrast, monocytes\/macrophages are naturally recruited to the TME. These cells then have the potential to phagocytose tumor cells, activate the TME, and prime a broad anti-tumor adaptive immune response via T cell recruitment and activation. We have previously developed CT-0508, a chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) targeting HER2 which showed efficacy in a variety of pre-clinical models and is currently in a Phase I clinical trial for patients with HER2+ solid tumors. Mesothelin is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, including mesothelioma, lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. To leverage tumor biology with myeloid cells, we engineered primary human macrophages using the chimeric adenoviral vector Ad5f35 to express a CAR containing a human scFv against human mesothelin. We used both <i>in vitro<\/i> cell based assays and <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft models to assess the activity of CT-1119. CAR-M engineered with an Ad5f35 vector demonstrated high CAR expression, high viability, upregulated M1 (anti-tumor) macrophage markers, and downregulated M2 (pro-tumor) macrophage markers. CT-1119 specifically phagocytosed multiple mesothelin expressing tumor cell lines in a CAR-dependent and antigen-dependent manner. CT-1119 demonstrated robust <i>in vitro<\/i> killing of the relevant tumor cell lines A549 and MES-OV expressing mesothelin. CAR engagement also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#945; following stimulation with mesothelin in both cell-free and cell-based contexts in a dose-dependent manner. <i>In vivo<\/i>, CT-1119 significantly reduced tumor burden in a murine xenograft model of lung cancer. Similarly, human monocytes targeting mesothelin were successfully generated using the same Ad5f35 vector and demonstrated specific activity against mesothelin positive tumor cells. The presented results demonstrate that CT-1119, an autologous human anti-mesothelin CAR-M, can cause phagocytosis, tumor cell killing, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in response to stimulation with mesothelin. These results show that CAR-M is a feasible approach for the treatment of mesothelin expressing sold tumors via the potential for induction of a systemic anti-tumor response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Mesothelin,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicholas  R.

Dysregulated cytokines cause deleterious immunosuppression or inflammation, which underpins the pathophysiology of solid tumors, chronic kidney disease, and more. Rebalancing inflammation\/immunosuppression by rectifying cytokine signals offers a generalizable approach for treating numerous diseases. While doing so through cytokine blockade carries risks due to systemic administration, cellular immunotherapies offer a localized approach that could detect pathogenic cytokines then proportionately rebalance inflammation as needed. Specifically, macrophages are homeostatic regulators responsible for initiating and resolving inflammation. Here, we leveraged macrophages&#8217; ability to regulate inflammation by equipping them with synthetic cytokine switch receptors (SR) that convert immunosuppressive M2 signals into pro-inflammatory M1 responses for solid tumor microenvironment conversion, or <i>vice versa<\/i> for inflammatory disease. We termed this platform &#8220;Engineered Microenvironment Converters&#8221; (EM-C) and evaluated its modular ability to target disease-associated cytokines.<br \/>Methods: EM-Cs targeting IL10, TGF&#946;, IFN&#947; and IL17A were generated by expressing SR in primary human macrophages. M2-to-M1 SR were designed to convert IL10 or TGF-&#946; into pro-inflammatory stimuli, and M1-to-M2 SR were designed to IFN&#947; or IL17A into immunosuppressive signals. The <i>in vitro<\/i> response of EM-Cs to their target cytokine was monitored using phenotypic characterization of surface molecules, measurement of cytokine production, mRNA sequencing, and biochemical analysis of downstream signaling. Co-culture assays with bystander cells were used to assess the ability of EM-Cs to alter their microenvironment.<br \/>Results: Pro-inflammatory EM-Cs converted IL10 and TGF&#946;, two prevalent immunosuppressive cytokines in the TME, into pro-inflammatory signals. Unlike wildtype macrophages, these EM-Cs responded to IL10 or TGF&#946; with upregulated M1 markers and cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, EM-Cs repolarized bystander M2 macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype following co-culture. Similarly, anti-inflammatory EM-Cs responded IFN&#947; and IL17A, two cytokines canonically overexpressed in inflammatory disease, by upregulating M2 markers and inducing an anti-inflammatory environment.<br \/>Conclusion: We present for the first time a novel immunotherapy platform that harnesses macrophages as &#8220;living converters&#8221; to locally regulate inflammation for oncology and inflammatory applications. By demonstrating EM-Cs in the M2-to-M1 and M1-to-M2 direction, this platform offers modularity in controlling the inflammatory status of tissue microenvironments without systemic cytokine antagonism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Microenvironment,Cytokines,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chris Sloas<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yuhao Huangfu<sup><\/sup>, Rehman Qureshi<sup><\/sup>, Michael Ball<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Condamine<sup><\/sup>, Michael Klichinsky<sup><\/sup>, Yumi Ohtani<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Carisma Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"25c87541-4c3a-4633-8fe2-889ece0226b5","ControlNumber":"795","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Multiple factors may determine the quality of the TIL product including components of the tumor microenvironment. In this work, we analyzed the role of melanoma infiltrating B cells in the context of TIL expansion based on their documented association with response to other types of immunotherapies<sup>[3]<\/sup>. We stimulated melanoma infiltrating B cells using human recombinant CD40L on the first day of <i>ex-vivo<\/i> TIL expansion. Samples were expanded from cryopreserved melanoma tumor single cell suspensions, in high dose IL-2 alone (standard protocol), or in high dose IL-2 plus CD40L. After 48h, analysis of activation markers on the CD40-expressing cells by flow cytometry was performed. For further investigation of the changes induced by CD40L stimulation, TIL expansion cultures (+\/- CD40L) were analyzed using scRNA-seq (10X Genomics Chromium NextGEM Single Cell 5&#8217; v2 and V(D)J Reagent kits; Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument with S4 sequencing flow cell) at 48h of culture (n=7 patients). The TIL expansion success rate was 68% with the CD40L treatment condition compared to 36% with the standard protocol. TILs cultured in the presence of CD40L expanded to on average three times more than with the standard protocol (<i>P<\/i> &#8804; 0.01). Treatment with CD40L increased the percentage of CD39- CD69-<sup> <\/sup>T cells (<i>P<\/i> &#8804; 0.05). Within the tumor digests, a higher percentage of B cells, including switched memory B cells (CD27<sup>+<\/sup> IgD<sup>- <\/sup>), was associated with successful TIL expansion (P=0.04). scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated different clustering patterns within the B cell compartment based on culture conditions. No clear partition was observed for other cell types, including the myeloid compartment. B cells displayed 126 DEGs associated to CD40L addition, CCL22, CD83, EBI3 and CD58 were among the upregulated genes in the CD40L-treated B cells. Other cell types experienced minimal to no change in transcriptomic profiles. B cell clusters were sub-classified based on CD27 and IgD expression<sup>[4]<\/sup>, showing a predominance of na&#239;ve and switched memory B cells. Our results show that higher presence of B cells within tumors is associated with better TIL expansion, suggesting an interplay between T and B cells, and providing rationale for the design of improved TIL expansion protocols based on B cell stimulation with CD40L.

However, novel strategies are needed to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and to enhance the efficacy of TCR-T cell (TCR-T) therapies in solid tumors. NY-ESO-1 is a cancer\/testis antigen that is highly expressed in various solid tumor indications while its expression in healthy tissues is restricted to male germ cells. Our HLA-A2-restricted, NY-ESO-1-specific TCR used here was selected from a non-tolerized T cell repertoire of a healthy donor using Medigene&#8217;s proprietary Allo-HLA TCR priming technology and high-throughput TCR isolation and characterization processes. To prevent inhibition of TCR-T cell function via the PD1-PDL1 axis within the TME, the NY-ESO-1-TCR was co-expressed with a chimeric PD1-41BB co-stimulatory switch receptor, consisting of the extracellular domain of PD1 and the intracellular domain of the 41BB co-stimulatory receptor. Thereby, an inhibitory signal from the PD1-PD-L1 axis is turned into a co-stimulatory one, which results in a dual mechanistic benefit, and superior TCR-T cells with respect to tumor cell killing, cell proliferation and poly-cytokine secretion. Co-expression of PD1-41BB on NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cells led to a 3-fold increase in IFN-&#947; release and a higher proliferation index (~1.5 fold) (after antigen encounter. Under conditions of repeated antigen exposure <i>in vitro<\/i> using HLA-A2\/NY-ESO-1\/PDL1-positive tumor spheroids, TCR-T cells co-expressing PD1-41BB showed enhanced functional activities compared to TCR-T cells carrying the TCR alone. <i>In vitro <\/i>single-cell<i> <\/i>secretome<i> <\/i>analyses demonstrated up to a 5-fold increase in polyfunctional T cells and a higher polyfunctional strength index (PSI) for NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cells expressing PD1-41BB compared to &#8220;naked&#8221; NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cells lacking PD1-41BB. Typical Th1 cytokines\/proteins like IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945; and Granzyme B mainly contributed to the superior PSI of NY-ESO-1-TCR-T cells co-expressing PD1-41BB. Importantly, our data indicate that transgenic PD1-41BB has the capacity to provide a co-stimulatory signal despite the presence of endogenous PD1 which is upregulated in stimulated &#8220;naked&#8220; NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cells. In summary, we find that co-expression of a chimeric PD1-41BB co-stimulatory switch receptor significantly enhances <i>in vitro<\/i> NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cell proliferation, functionality and anti-tumor activity. Analyses of single-cell T cell cytokine polyfunctionality helped us to unravel the mode of action of NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cells co-expressing PD1-41BB and point to their complex display of effector, stimulatory and chemoattractant cytokines as a potential driver for superior recognition of tumor cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,T cell,Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrea Coluccio<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stefanie Tippmer<sup>1<\/sup>, Petra Prinz<sup>1<\/sup>, Maja Buerdek<sup>1<\/sup>, Kathrin Mutze<sup>1<\/sup>, Barbara Loesch<sup>1<\/sup>, Kathrin Davari<sup>1<\/sup>, Giulia Longinotti<sup>1<\/sup>, Dolores  J.

To date, four anti-CD19 CAR-T and two anti-BCMA CAR-T products have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Many more T cell therapy products are currently being explored, directed towards both liquid and solid tumors as well as for other clinical indications. High-quality and robust <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> assays are essential for the discovery and characterization of lead T cell therapy products. Furthermore, despite demonstrating therapeutically successful, the further development of T cell immunotherapies has been hindered by safety concerns. Selected target antigens might be expressed in healthy tissues or engineered T cells may non-specifically bind to antigens in healthy tissues, potentially resulting in severe side effects. In addition, the random integration of the CAR- or TCR-encoding DNA cassettes in the host cell genome has the potential risk of causing insertional mutagenesis and may contribute to oncogenic transformation of the T cells. The aim of this study was to develop several <i>in vitro<\/i> assays for the assessment of target cell binding, efficacy and safety of T cell therapies using CAR-T cells targeting the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) as a model system. The z-Movi cell avidity analyzer was used to study the binding strength between the CAR-T cells and target tumor cells. Cytotoxicity co-culture assays were developed using increasing effector:target cells ratios and an impedance-based readout to quantify the viability of HER2-positive and -negative cancer cell lines in real-time, to confirm the activity and selectivity of the HER2-CAR-T cells. Furthermore, co-culture assays were also developed for a variety of primary or iPSC-derived healthy human cells (representing various tissues) to assess potential off-tumor effects of the HER2-CAR-T cells against healthy cells. In addition, an oncogenicity assay was developed to quantify the survival and proliferation of the HER2-CAR-T cells in the absence and presence of cytokines by flow cytometry, to determine whether the genomic editing of the T cells affected their cytokine-dependency. In conclusion, Charles River Laboratories developed several <i>in vitro <\/i>assays for the preclinical assessment of T cell therapy binding, efficacy, potency, specificity and safety to aid early-stage lead discovery, optimization and development, and to support Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. Charles River has the capabilities to support a full CAR\/TCR program from inception to IND filing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Immunotherapy,Cytotoxicity,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sophie Vermond<sup>1<\/sup>, Benita Quist<sup>1<\/sup>, Monique Hazenoot<sup>1<\/sup>, Rene McLaughlin<sup>1<\/sup>, David Cobeta Lopez<sup>1<\/sup>, Namrata Jayanth<sup>1<\/sup>, Folkert Verkaar<sup>1<\/sup>, Omar Aziz<sup>2<\/sup>, Maria LH Vlaming<sup>1<\/sup>, Sabrina de Munnik<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Gemma Moiset<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Leiden, Netherlands,<sup>2<\/sup>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Portishead, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e298aef9-da9e-465b-a4d4-3c45d3bad007","ControlNumber":"6370","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Macrophages are innate immune cells that can kill tumor cells and orchestrate the anti-tumor immune response. Macrophage cell therapy is an exciting new approach to treat cancer with the aim to harness the powerful activity of macrophages to reignite the immune system. Patient derived macrophages, however, are difficult to genetically engineer and do not proliferate, which makes generating high-quality cells at clinically relevant scales challenging. To address this, we have developed an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) approach to macrophage cell therapy. These cells can be genetically engineered at the iPSC stage and then differentiated into billions of highly functional iPSC derived macrophages (iMACs). This allogenic cell therapy product can then be cryopreserved and stored for immediate use in the clinic when the patient is ready.<b> <\/b><br \/>Here we show that iMACs function like normal macrophages. They migrate towards tumor cells, respond to challenges through innate immune receptors, and produce immune recruiting and activating cytokines and chemokines. iMACs also express high levels of antibody receptors and we show that these cells can be directed to kill tumors <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> via antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis. Furthermore, we have conducted a robust screen to develop a novel CAR that is optimized for use in iMACs. These receptors can be engineered into iMACs at the iPSC stage and trigger robust tumor cell killing. In summary, these data highlight the therapeutic potential of iMACs in oncology and support the further development of this technology for clinical use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Cancer,Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Huafeng Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, May Sumi<sup>1<\/sup>, Christine Huh<sup>1<\/sup>, Fereshteh Parviz<sup>1<\/sup>, Jessica Mastroianni<sup>1<\/sup>, Jane Healy<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole Stevens<sup>1<\/sup>, Leah Mitchell<sup>1<\/sup>, Susanne Lang<sup>1<\/sup>, Dan Kaufman<sup>2<\/sup>, Robert Hollingsworth<sup>1<\/sup>, David  T.

Most clinical centers utilize bulk, randomly isolated TILs from the tumor tissue for <i>ex vivo<\/i> expansion and infusion. Only a minor fraction of these administered TILs recognize tumor antigens and most are non-mutated public antigens. Moreover, expression of these antigens on normal cells can trigger central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. Against this background, cancer neoantigens derived from private mutations represent an ideal class of cancer antigens to target because they are highly tumor specific by nature, therefore reducing the potential induction of central and peripheral tolerance. We recently developed a new technology to enrich TILs with predefined neoantigen specificities, which we termed Selective Neo Antigens Peptides TILs (snapTILs). Here we describe the efficacy studies of a melanoma and pancreatic cancer patient&#8217;s snapTILs done in autologous settings both <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Our workflow consisted of a multistep process performed on a patient-specific basis. Briefly, mutations were called by whole-exome sequencing of tumor vs. normal DNA to generate a peptide library. The peptides were further filtered using an in-silico prediction algorithm and our proprietary peptide-MHC binding assay. Selected peptides were then incubated with TILs isolated from the patient&#8217;s tumor biopsy, resulting in TIL population enriched of T cells that recognize the neopeptides (snapTILs). After rapid expansion, snapTIL efficacy was tested by checking their ability to infiltrate in patient-derived tumor organoids, their activation status (IFN&#947;), cytotoxicity (Granzyme B), and T-cell exhaustion markers. Lastly, snapTILs <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy was tested in human melanoma and pancreatic cancer xenograft models using hIL-2 transgenic mice.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our initial data showed that the levels of infiltration of snapTILs into tumor organoids was significantly higher compared to IL2-stimulated TILs in both cancer models. Also, snapTILs recognized tumors with great specificity as they showed significantly less infiltration in organoids generated from generally uninvolved tissues from the same patients. Moreover, snapTILs were found to be more cytotoxic in nature than the IL2-stimulated TILs in terms of IFN&#947; and Granzyme B secretion after coculture with autologous tumor cells. Our <i>in vivo<\/i> data confirmed these observations by showing 70% tumor growth inhibition in highly immunogenic melanoma and 50% tumor growth restriction in a poorly immunogenic pancreatic tumor model. In conclusion, our approach proves the potential for personally tailored immunotherapies to yield more effective and safer cancer treatments using snapTILs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tithi Ghosh Halder<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shelby Rheinschmidt<sup>1<\/sup>, Sydney Adamson<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Larson<sup>2<\/sup>, Taylor Bargenquast<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan Rodriguez del Villar<sup>1<\/sup>, Serina Ng<sup>1<\/sup>, Kate Gutowsky<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexis Weston<sup>1<\/sup>, Trason Thode<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohan Kaadige<sup>1<\/sup>, Erin Kelley<sup>1<\/sup>, Jorge Soria-Bustos<sup>1<\/sup>, Jorge Giron<sup>1<\/sup>, John Altin<sup>1<\/sup>, Raffaella Soldi<sup>1<\/sup>, Sunil Sharma<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>TGen (The Translational Genomics Research Institute), Phoenix, AZ,<sup>2<\/sup>HonorHealth Clinical Research Institute, Scottsdale, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6c1f4dbb-f332-4f70-bf42-6de4b68d90ef","ControlNumber":"7714","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

We sought to overcome this by &#8216;seeding&#8217; the tumor with TILs via administration of autologous lymphocytes (ALT). We hypothesized that prior administration of ALT will enhance subsequent immunomodulatory therapies (e.g. immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) or co-stimulation). To evaluate this, we initially generated a pro-infiltrative TIL phenotype. CD45.1 splenocytes (C57\/Bl6 background) were co-cultured with either IL2 and Concanavalin A (Con A) or IL7 and Con A for 5 days. Flow cytometric analysis found that both conditions resulted in similar CD4:CD8 ratios (20:80%) but IL7 co-culture upregulated expression of VLA-4, a pro migratory integrin. We then compared the entry of TILs into tumor bearing CNS when co-cultured with either IL2 or IL7. 8&#8211;10-week-old C57\/Bl6 mice (n=5-6 per group) were implanted orthotopically with 30,000 CT2AvIII cells (syngeneic glioma) which established for 14 days. Mice received (1) CD45.1 lymphocytes activated with IL-7 and Con A (single intravenous (IV) injection, 1 x 10<sup>7<\/sup> cells) or (2) CD45.1 lymphocytes activated with IL2 and serial Con-A stimulation. Mice were sacrificed 3- and 48-hours following ALT and brains analysed for CD45.1+CD3+ populations. Groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. Mice in Group 1 demonstrated significantly enhanced entry of CD8+ effector and memory T cells into tumor bearing hemispheres at both time points following administration compared to Group 2 (p = 0.005, p = 0.0159 respectively). By 48 hours post ALT, IL7 co-culture resulted in an average 810.1% expansion of CD8 T cell numbers in tumor bearing CNS compared to counts at Day 0. We then evaluated if mice with a TIL enriched CNS might be more responsive to ICB or co-stimulatory therapy. 8&#8211;10-week-old C57\/Bl6 mice (n=5-7 per group) were implanted with 30,000 CT2AvIII cells that established over 10 days. On day 10, mice received IV ALT of either IL7 T cells only, or IL-7 and treatment courses of IP ICB (anti-PD1, anti-CTLA 4 or anti-41BB). Mice given ICB following IL7 ALT demonstrated a median survival (aPD1: 27 days, aCTLA-4: 25 days) similar to mice given IL7 ALT alone (25 days). However, 4\/7 mice who received IL7 ALT and anti-41BB were still alive 45 days post tumor implantation (p=0.0004). Taken together, we demonstrated that certain <i>ex vivo<\/i> autologous lymphocyte co-culture conditions can generate a T cell population which infiltrates tumor bearing CNS in significant numbers. Further, we found that seeding a tumor with TILs prior to stimulatory therapy yields long term survival <i>in vivo<\/i>. Future work will focus on optimizing <i>ex vivo <\/i>culturing approaches for ALT and determine whether therapeutic efficacy is due to expansion of resident TILs at the tumor site, or ongoing recruitment of endogenous T cells from the periphery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Immuno-oncology,Immunostimulation,Integrins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kirit Singh<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kelly  M.

However, the &#8220;prone-to-exhaustion&#8221; phenotype of the final TIL product after rapid expansion during manufacture and the presence of various immunosuppressive mechanisms in tumor microenvironment (TME) compromises the persistence and anti-tumor efficacy of TIL post infusion. To discover potential immunoregulatory targets that could maximize the function of TIL, we established a genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 screening platform, ImmuT Finder<sup>&#174;<\/sup>, to unbiasedly identify functional gene targets in primary T cells. Notably, this platform employed T cells bearing a tumor-antigen specific TCR-T that were repeatedly stimulated by tumor cells with cognate tumor antigen and demonstrated similar exhaustion profile as TIL. We selected top 30 targets after several rounds of screening and quickly validated their function in a 96-well array. Then, the top targets that showed significantly enhancement in proliferation and function of TCR-T were further selected, and their combinational effects on TIL were tested both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, double KO of GT304 and GT312 (GT316) stands out as the most potent combination, which significantly improves TIL proliferation and cytokine release, eradicates tumor growth in both CDX and PDX mouse models and promotes long-term in vivo persistence with low-dependence on IL-2. Specific and potent sgRNAs targeting both targets have been selected, and manufacturing process of GT316 TIL product has been developed (KOReTIL<sup>&#174;<\/sup>). In summary, these data demonstrated that our ImmuT Finder<sup>&#174; <\/sup>platform enables unbiased discovery of potent and novel targets for the development of T cell therapy and support the clinical assessment of GT316 as a next-generation TIL therapy.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) comprise up to 40% of GBM tumors and predominantly demonstrate an M2 phenotype, favoring tumor growth while suppressing host immune response. Previously, we showed that in p50-\/- mice lacking the repressive NF-&#954;B subunit, GBM TAMs are biased toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, limiting GBM tumor growth by increasing activated tumor T cells. The present study aims to determine whether adoptively transferred immature myeloid cells lacking p50 (p50-IMC) localize to mouse GBM tumors and slow tumor growth.<br \/>Methods: Lineage-negative bone marrow (BM) cells were isolated from C57BL\/6 (B6) p50-\/- mice, expanded, and treated with Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) for 24h to produce p50-IMC. BM-derived myeloid cells from both wild-type (WT) and p50-\/- mice were subjected to analysis of M1 (TNF&#945;, IL-12b) and M2 (Fizz1, Mannose Receptor) markers via quantitative PCR after exposure to M-CSF for 24h or after M2-polarization via five days in M-CSF and then two days in IL-4. B6-derived GL261-Luc GBM cells were inoculated intracranially into wild-type B6 mice, and four days post-implantation, mice were given 5-fluorouracil to deplete endogenous leukocytes. Mice then received either no additional treatment or three doses of ten million p50-IMCs 9-, 11-, and 14-days post-implantation, and tumor growth was monitored via bioluminescence, measured following luciferin injection using the Spectrum in vivo<i> <\/i>imaging system. The number of p50-IMCs localizing to the GBM-containing brain was determined by CFSE-dye-labeling of IMC followed by flow cytometry analysis 24h after injection.<br \/>Results: Both TNF&#945; and IL-12b were increased in p50-\/- cells after 5 days M-CSF, and increased IL-12b expression was maintained even after M2-polarization with IL-4. Of the 10 million injected p50-IMCs, 0.07% of those cells were found in the brain. Despite such a small number of p50-IMCs localizing to the tissue of interest, inhibition of GBM growth was observed. Mice receiving the p50-IMC treatments (n = 4) demonstrated a 2.3- and 2.4-fold reduction in tumor growth at 15 (p = 0.13) and 18 (p = 0.14) days post-implantation, respectively, compared to control mice (n = 5). At 21 days post-implantation, tumor size was effectively equivalent between the two groups (p=0.76). p50-IMC treatment did not correlate with improved survival.<br \/>Conclusion: Loss of p50 skews myeloid cells toward a proinflammatory phenotype, even under M2-polarizing conditions. Adoptive transfer of p50-IMC transiently impairs GBM growth in an orthotopic mouse model. Although statistical significance was not attained, this may be due to the small number of animals used in this experiment. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the full potential of p50-IMC as an immunotherapy option for GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Adoptive cell therapy,Mouse models,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Patrick  J.

Although the mechanisms of antitumor effects augmentation in tumor-bearing hosts after lymphodepletion and T cell transfer have been intensively investigated, the influence of lymphodepletion followed by T cell transfer on immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs) expressed on tumor cells and immune cells remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of lymphodepletion and adoptive T cell transfer on ICMs in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, we investigated whether lymphodepletion and adoptive transfer of T cells augments antitumor effects of anti-PD-1 blockade therapy.<br \/>Methods: B6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with the MCA205 murine fibrosarcoma. On day 7, mice were lymphodepleted by sublethal irradiation with 500 cGy and were reconstituted intravenously with spleen cells from normal mice as a source of na&#239;ve T cells. These mice were injected intraperitoneally with anti-PD-1 mAb on days 7 and 14. On day 21, tumor tissues were harvested, and single cell suspensions were labeled with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for FACS analyses.<br \/>Results: The expressions of ICMs, including PD-L1, PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3 and LAG-3, were upregulated on recipient CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the tumor microenvironment. In contrast, these ICMs were significantly reduced in transferred donor T cells. Administration of anti-PD-1 antibodies after lymphodepletion and adoptive transfer of T cells significantly inhibited tumor progression. Furthermore, transfer of both donor CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was responsible for this augmentation of antitumor effects.<br \/>Conclusions: Our observations suggest that a possible mechanism of the antitumor effect augmentation mediated by lymphodepletion followed by T cell transfer is the prevention of donor T cell exhaustion and dysfunction.

Subsequently, these primed CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells were tested in a 2D and a 3D immune cell killing assay in a life cell imaging device in combination with an endpoint viability assay. The activity was compared with unspecific CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or &#945;CD2\/&#945;CD3\/&#945;CD28 beads. All T cells were tested as monotherapy and in combination with trastuzumab in JIMT-1 and SKBR-3. The antigen specific CD8+T cells displayed a significantly improved killing potential of JIMT-1 cells compared to unspecific activated or non-activated CD8+T cells. Along these lines, those cells showed the highest TNF-alpha secretion and expression of CD69 (determined by flow cytometry) among all T cell lines. Antigen-specific CD8+T cells from different settings displayed a significantly improved killing potential towards JIMT-1 than non-antigen-specific activated or non-activated CD8+T cells. The use of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) instead of isolated CD8+T cells did not influence the activity against JIMT-1 significantly. Interestingly, antigen-specific CD8+T cells activated as PBMC increased the activity of Trastuzumab significantly as compared to unspecific activated CD8+T cells. Testing of different donors revealed a donor dependent degree of killing, however in all donors the activity pattern was the same with antigen specific CD8+T cells being the most active. A direct comparison of fresh vs frozen immune cells from the same donors indicated no significant differences in the killing activity of unspecific activated CD8+T cells. Yet, there were substantial differences in antigen-specific immune cells: the killing potential of the freshly isolated immune cells was significantly higher than of the frozen. In summary, we have developed a protocol to produce antigen-specific tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells primed to the heterologous JIMT-1 breast cancer cell line. The antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells showed an increased killing potential over non-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells. In addition, they were able to increase ADCC-mediated antitumoral activity of trastuzumab. The 2D as well as the 3D immune cell killing assay proved to be robust and amendable for mid throughput screening. The impact of donor variability and fresh vs frozen immune cells must be further evaluated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),HER2,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ina Rohleff<sup><\/sup>, Matthias Bleisch<sup><\/sup>, Kanstantsin Lashuk<sup><\/sup>, <b>Julia Schueler<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Freiburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a98f490d-6725-4669-b6a3-ebd4832fb201","ControlNumber":"4455","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Their success demonstrates that a patient&#8217;s own T cells recognize and treat cancer. However, anti-PD1 therapy is most effective in the treatment of cancers with high mutational burden, ~5% of all malignancies. Therefore, an alternative strategy is necessary to target cancer with lower mutational burden (the other ~95%). Importantly, the efficacy of PD-1 blockade is associated with the recruitment of new T cells from the blood rather than the activation of pre-existing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (Yost K.E., <i>et al<\/i>. Nat. Med. 2019). Our approach is to use RNA to prime and expand T cells from the blood to cancer-specific mutations <i>ex vivo<\/i>. We can generate T cell populations reactive to as few as 8 and as many as 40 cancer-specific mutant proteins in a single production run. <i>In vitro<\/i>, these T cells have mutation-specific cytotoxicity and do not kill the normal cells. These T cells express homing receptors that allow them to infiltrate the tumor and express high levels of TNF&#945; and IFN&#947;, both of which are associated with effective tumor cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory modification of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The predominant immunophenotype of these cells is consistent with central and effector memory, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with almost no regulatory or exhausted T cells. We believe these T cells can be used as a cellular therapy in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat lower mutational burden cancers that comprise most patients&#8217; tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,Ras,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Farzonai Muzaffar<sup><\/sup>, David Ryan<sup><\/sup>, Walter Barry<sup><\/sup>, Abenezer Abera<sup><\/sup>, <b>Alfred E.

We studied expression and functional associations of the globo-series ganglioside stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA4), a cell surface marker of human embryonic stem cells, in Ewing sarcoma (EwS). Flow cytometry revealed SSEA4 expression on the cell surface of each of 13 EwS cell lines, with moderate to high expression densities in 6 of 13 (46%) cell lines. Of 31 primary EwS tumor biopsies, 21 (68%) were SSEA4 positive by immunofluorescence staining. No associations of SSEA4 positivity with molecular or clinical disease parameters were found. Comparisons of paired tumor cell subpopulations with high and low\/negative SSEA4 expression selected by cell sorting from 8 EwS cell lines revealed increased cell proliferation and colony formation of SSEA4<sup>high<\/sup> tumor cells, along with higher doxocrubicin chemoresistance and a higher propensity to migrate in transwell assays. SSEA4 negative cells selected from bulk populations of EwS cells regained SSEA4 expression during continued <i>in vitro<\/i> culture as well as after in vivo xenografting into immunodeficient mice. SSEA4<sup>high<\/sup> expression in EwS cells was not dependent on expression levels of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion transcript or its direct targets, nor associated with markers of epithelial\/mesenchymal plasticity. To retarget human T cells to SSEA4, we generated a second-generation, 41BB&#950; CAR using the antigen-binding domains of a murine anti-SSEA4 monoclonal antibody. SSEA4-specific CAR T cells specifically interacted with SSEA4 positive EwS cells in a strictly antigen-dependent manner, resulting in effective tumor cell lysis in vitro. We conclude that targeting of SSEA4 with CAR T cells or alternative immune therapeutics could be an attractive strategy to eliminate tumor cell subsets with high propensity to drive disease progression in EwS and therefore deserves further evaluation towards clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Ewing sarcoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Silke Jamitzky<sup>1<\/sup>, Bianca Altvater<sup>1<\/sup>, Carolin Krekeler<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Hoen<sup>1<\/sup>, Caroline Brandes<sup>1<\/sup>, Lisa Richter<sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Ebbinghaus<sup>1<\/sup>, Laurin Ochs<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole Farwick<sup>1<\/sup>, Katja Urban<sup>1<\/sup>, Dennis Görlich<sup>2<\/sup>, Ian Johnston<sup>3<\/sup>, Rita Pfeifer<sup>3<\/sup>, Claudia Rossig<sup>1<\/sup>, Wolfgang Hartmann<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Sareetha Kailayangiri<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University Children's Hospital Münster, Muenster, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Miltenyi Biotec B.V. & Co.

A significant limitation to use of adoptive cell therapy in solid tumors has been life-threatening off-target toxicities, including acute respiratory toxicity and cytokine release syndrome. The native T cell program releases a diverse range of toxic proteins upon activation, including interferons, interleukins, perforins, and granzymes. Rather than activate the native T-cell program, selective expression of tumor-targeting agents may be advantageous. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is known to selectively target tumor cells with minimal toxicity to normal tissues. We therefore engineered Jurkat (a human CD4+ T cell leukemia cell line) and THP-1 (a human monocytic leukemia cell line) cells to constitutively express wild-type TRAIL using a third-generation lentivirus system. These cells killed multiple cell lines across colorectal and pancreatic cancer, thus representing a possible therapeutic strategy to target GI malignancies. Furthermore, the addition of the ferroptosis induced erastin enhanced cytotoxicity of TRAIL-engineered cells, suggesting that targeting ferroptosis in addition to apoptosis is a promising strategy for enhancing immune killing. Future work will focus on overcoming TRAIL resistance, tumor trafficking, and alteration of the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,TRAIL,Colorectal cancer,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Praveen  R.

Although treatment of multiple myeloma with CAR T cells can induce deep responses, relapses frequently occur due to antigen escape and limited CAR T cell persistence. TCR-engineered T cells may mediate sustained antitumor effects upon recognition of intracellular targets, thereby significantly increasing the range of relevant target antigens. In our project, we propose to identify T cell receptors (TCRs) specifically targeting autologous myeloma cells. Tumor-reactive T cells were identified using the Berkeley Lights Lightning platform, allowing simultaneous functional analysis of up to 1500 individual T cell\/target cell interactions per run. Reactive T cells have been identified upon detection of secreted chemokines (IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, IL-2) and by measurement of CD137 surface expression. Tumor-reactive T cells showing various cytokine secretion patterns and CD137 expression profiles could be detected in each myeloma patient (7 to 26 of approx.1200 cells tested per patient). Individual tumor reactive T cells have been isolated for TCR sequencing. Recovered TCR genes will be cloned and overexpressed in autologous T cells for functional validation and analysis of tumor derived neoepitope specificity. In summary, we present a pipeline allowing identification of myeloma-recognizing T cells and recovery of bona fide tumor-reactive TCRs eligible for patient-individualized T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Multiple myeloma,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tim  R.

Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TILs) are key determinants of anti-tumor immunity in melanoma and other cancers, and single-cell RNA-sequencing has identified T cell states associated with improved clinical response to ICB, as well as adoptive T cell therapy (ACT). Despite these advances, strategies to identify and analyze tumor-reactive TILs in ICB-resistant patients remain limited. Here, we demonstrate that TILs from ICB-resistant melanoma patients can recognize and eliminate autologous tumor cells independent of class I HLA-TCR interactions. TILs eliminated matched melanoma cells in a time and dose-dependent fashion associated with secretion of effector cytokines. Strikingly, the deletion of B2M (resulting in loss of class I HLA surface expression) did not alter the activity of these TILs. Immunophenotyping studies confirmed that TILs are largely (&#62;95%) effector memory (Tem) CD8 T cells (CD45RA-CD45RO+CCR7-) and give rise to terminal effector cells after co-culture with matched melanoma cells. Further, the elimination of melanoma cells by TILs required intact JAK1\/2 signaling, although interferon-gamma (IFN&#947;) was neither necessary nor sufficient for tumor cell elimination. Together, these findings demonstrate that expanded TILs from ICB-resistant melanoma patients are capable of eliminating melanoma cells via a novel, class I MHC-independent mechanism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Resistance,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hongyan Xie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aiping Jiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Anne Jenney<sup>3<\/sup>, Yi Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Tatyana Sharova<sup>1<\/sup>, Moshe Sade-Feldman<sup>1<\/sup>, Or-yam Revach<sup>1<\/sup>, Angelina Cicerchia<sup>1<\/sup>, Martin  Q.

The Janus-kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway governs T cell activation and differentiation, and can thereby serve as a critical regulator of these properties. To take advantage of the benefits of STAT signaling in programming an antitumor T-cell response, we used synthetic biology to create a library of proteins, termed Synthetic Pathway Activators (SPAs) which constitutively drive STAT signaling without the need for external cytokine input. SPAs can be designed to engage activity of multiple STAT family transcription factors at variable levels through rational design. We have developed several classes of SPAs, including but not limited to Class I SPAs, which primarily increase pSTAT3 activity, and Class II SPAs, which increase pSTAT5 activity. When constitutively expressed in ArsenalBio Integrated Circuit T (ICT) cells, SPAs result in significant enhancements in T-cell potency and expansion. Repetitive stimulation assays, wherein T cells are challenged with tumor cells every 2 days, reveal that Class I SPAs result in 6-log or higher improved tumor cell clearance over a 2-week assay period. Across various mouse xenograft models, SPA-expressing ICTs reach at least 6-fold improved tumor growth inhibition. RNAseq and ATACseq analysis indicate dramatic changes to gene expression profiles in T cells expressing Class I SPAs, with maintenance of T cell stem-like phenotypes, and restricted accessibility of various exhaustion marker genes. Importantly, despite significantly increased levels of expansion, ICTs equipped with SPAs are not immortalized, showing no signs of cytokine-independent outgrowth. In addition, SPA-expressing ICT cells rapidly contract following tumor clearance in-vivo. The SPA platform represents a novel, tunable, and T cell intrinsic approach for engineering cell fates that result in potent anti-tumor properties.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),Exhaustion,CAR T cells,Persistence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Thomas J.

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has recently entered the standard of care for relapsed and refractory MM, following the recent FDA-approval of two CAR-T cell products, ide-cel&#174; and cilta-cel&#174;, which target the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). However, despite impressive response rates, most patients relapse within 1-3 years. Kappa (&#954;) myeloma antigen (KMA) is a tumour specific membrane associated protein expressed on malignant plasma cells in patients with kappa light-chain restricted (&#954;-type) MM. KMA is absent on normal plasma cells and haematopoietic stem cells, making it an attractive and alternative target antigen for CAR-T cell therapy for MM. The monoclonal antibody, KappaMab (MDX-1097), binds to a conformational epitope on KMA, and has been assessed in phase I, IIa and IIb clinical trials in relapse refractory myeloma patients (1). Here, we have engineered a lentiviral vector encoding a second-generation CAR expressing a scFv from MDX-1097, fused to a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and CD3 zeta chain. We successfully generated human anti-KMA CAR-T cells with high and stable CAR expression and a predominately memory T cell phenotype. The CAR-T cells selectively killed KMA-expressing tumour lines, secreted interferon-gamma upon target recognition, and demonstrated potent anti-tumour activity in a xenograft model. Anti-KMA CAR-T cell therapy therefore represents a novel and potent treatment ready to enter a phase I clinical trial for patients with myeloma. (1) Spencer et al.

Nonetheless, T-cell exhaustion, toxicity, and suppressive microenvironment limit their efficacy in solid tumors. Recently, we characterized a novel subset of tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells expressing the Fc&#947;RI receptor (Rasoulouniriana et al, 2019). Herein we detail the engineering of a novel receptor, based on the Fc&#947;RI structure, which is retrovirally transduced into PBMCs (both CD4 and CD8 T-cells). These cells, named SolidT cells, can target tumor cells using antibody intermediates. They show effective and specific cytotoxicity only when an appropriate antibody is added. Only target-bound antibodies activate these cells, while free antibodies are internalized without activation. Their cytotoxic activity is correlated to target protein density, therefore targeting tumor cells with high antigen density while sparing normal cells with low or no expression. This activation mechanism prevents premature exhaustion. Furthermore, during ADCC these cells secrete attenuated cytokine levels compared to CAR-T, thereby enhancing their safety profile. These cells eradicate established melanoma tumors, infiltrate the tumor microenvironment and facilitate host immune cell recruitment in immunocompetent mice. In NSG mice, they infiltrate, persist, and eradicate tumors. As opposed to CAR therapies, which require changing the receptor across different types of cancer, our engineered T-cells remain the same throughout tumor types, while only the injected antibody changes. As such, can be adapted to treat a wide range of solid cancers without changing the manufacturing program. Overall, SolidT cells are capable of binding tumor cells with high affinity, while preserving the cytotoxic specificity only to cells expressing a high density of tumor-associated antigens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,CAR T cells,Solid tumors,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Diana Rasoulouniriana<sup>1<\/sup>, Nadine Santana-Magal<sup>2<\/sup>, Amit Gutwillig<sup>2<\/sup>, Leen Farhat-Younis<sup>2<\/sup>, Hana Shpilt<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Shahar Dotan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Noam Pilpel<sup>1<\/sup>, Peleg Rider<sup>1<\/sup>, Yaron Carmi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gilboa Therapeutics Inc., Rehovot, Israel,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"78b6b3aa-8996-4e34-8e4f-2b9606acc919","ControlNumber":"3478","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

We postulated that ex vivo generation of vaccine-educated T cells would provide a powerful platform for adoptive immunotherapy with opportunity to augment T-cell functional potency prior to infusion. We report on an ex vivo system in which vaccine-educated T cells are further enriched for activated antigen-specific effector cells via an agonistic 4-1bb antibody. We report phenotypic and functional characteristics of 4-1bb-enriched vaccine-educated T cells.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> DC\/AML fusion vaccines were generated from C57BL\/6J mice DCs and syngeneic C1498 mCh\/luc<sup>+<\/sup> AML cells. Splenic T cells were co-cultured with autologous irradiated DC\/AML fusions in presence of IL-2\/7\/15. Selection with biotinylated agonistic 4-1bb (3H3) was performed on vaccine-educated T cells followed by expansion with anti-CD3\/CD28 activation beads. T cells were phenotyped for activation (CD25\/CD69), immune checkpoints (PD1\/LAG3\/TIM3), memory (CD44+CD62L-) and enrichment (anti-rat H&#38;L). Cytotoxicity was evaluated by luminescence. Mice were inoculated with C1498 and injected with T cells 7 days later. BLI imaging was performed and 100-day survival measured.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Vaccine-educated T cells demonstrated evidence of immune activation and memory phenotype compared to unstimulated na&#239;ve T-cell controls (TN) (7.24-fold, CD4+CD25+CD69+; 1.7-fold, CD3+CD44+CD62L-). Vaccine-educated T cells selected based on 4-1bb expression showed enhanced markers of activation (15.3-fold, CD4+CD25+CD69+) and memory phenotype (5-fold, CD3+CD44+CD62L-) compared to TN. Selection enriched for 4-1bb<sup>+<\/sup> vaccine-educated T cells resulting in enhanced antigen-specific recognition as measured by tumor lysate induction of IFNg expression. Tumor specificity and activation was maintained following CD3\/CD28-mediated expansion. The 4-1bb+ vaccine-educated T cells showed enhanced cytotoxicity (1.9-fold increase\/TN at 10:1 E\/T, P&#60;0.0001). Phenotypic and functional analysis support 3-5 days as the optimal duration of time for T-cell vaccine education.

Given the role of NK cells in the pathogenesis of MM, interest in harnessing NK cells to treat the cancer has been energized by the remarkable success of other adoptive cell therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. However, relapses associated with residual low-to-negative BCMA-expressing MM cells have been reported, necessitating the identification of additional targets. GPRC5D, expressed on MM cells from primary marrow samples with a distribution independent of BCMA.<br \/>Methods: To prevent BCMA-antigen escape and elicit a deeper and more durable response in MM, we developed a new multiplexed edited NK cell configuration to restore anti-myeloma NK cell immunity, consisting of anti-BCMA VHH and anti-GPRC5D VHH antibodies, NKG2D and 2B4 co-stimulation signaling domains, and IL-15.<br \/>Results: Dual targeting BCMA\/GPRC5D CAR-NK showed potent in vitro killing of both BCMA+ and GPRC5D+ myeloma cells. Utilizing a repeated rounds of cancer cell clearance assay, BCMA\/GPRC5D CAR NK cells showed remarkable persistence and antigen-mediated expansion of CAR-NK cells after more than 4 rounds of tumor cell re-challenges. Moreover, in comparison with single targeted BCMA CAR-NK cells, Dual targeting BCMA\/GPRC5D CAR-NK cells effectively lysed BCMA negative target cells. In addition, in BCMA-antigenic escape model, it achieved more sustained tumor control than single targeting BCMA CAR-NK cells. PD-1\/PD-L1 axis inhibition has been reported to enhance NK cell activity against MM cells by augmenting NK cell trafficking, immune complex formation, and cytotoxicity against PD-L1-expressing MM cells. We also demonstrated that combination of BCMA\/GPRC5D CAR-NK with anti-PDL1-IL15 also showed more persistent tumor control.<br \/>Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate the development of dual targeting BCMA\/GPRC5D CAR NK cells may represent a highly effective off-the-shelf therapeutic product as a monotherapy or in combinations with other immune-regulating agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,BCMA,G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cuiqing Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yifang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Tingting Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chao Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Huanyu Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingyang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Gang Ye<sup>1<\/sup>, Renhong Tang<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhuoxiao Cao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Shanghai Simnova Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

Allogenic NK cell-based therapies have also been shown to mount potent responses against hematopoietic malignancies. Unlike T-cell therapies, allogeneic NK cells do not cause toxicities such as serious cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or graft-vs-host-disease. Several groups have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of allogeneic CAR-expressing NK cells that utilize CARs developed for T-cells. However, activating receptor signaling in NK cells is different from T cells. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is regulated by a repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors. Activating receptors include natural cytotoxic receptors (NCRs) such as NKG2D, CD16, LFA-1, CD244 (2B4), and CD137 (4-1BB) and so on. These activating cell surface receptors have the capacity to trigger cytolytic programs as well as cytokine and chemokine secretion via intra-cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) such as in 2B4 and 4-1BB and\/or via other transmembrane signaling adaptors. Recent studies using NK cell-based activating receptor signaling modules such as NKG2D and 2B4 as CAR co-stimulatory domains proved increased anti-tumor activity compared to T-cell CARs.<br \/>Methods: The goal of this study is to develop next-generation NK cell-optimized CARs to improve targeting and potency of NK cell treatment. To achieve this, we constructed a library of CARs containing signaling modules from diverse T cell signaling receptors and NK cell specific signaling receptors, and then screened for CAR activity using short-term and long-term NK cell cytotoxicity assays. In comparison with T cell signaling receptors, CAR-NK cells with NK cell signaling receptors showed more potent cytotoxicity. Using a repeated rounds of cancer cell clearance assay, serial re-stimulation by fresh cancer target cells was tested. CAR-NK cells with NK cell signaling receptors showed remarkable persistence and antigen-mediated expansion of CAR-NK cells compared with T cell signaling receptors.<br \/>Results: We identified a NK cell-CAR containing two NK cell co-stimulatory domain and CD3z signaling domain,showing better persistence than T-cell CAR (CD28-CD28-zeta) and 2 previously described NK cell-CARs (NKG2D-2B4-zeta and 2B4).<br \/>Conclusions: We have successfully identified an optimized CAR suitable for NK cells that enable increased potency of NK cells compared to other CAR designs. The most potent CARs identified in our screen are being engineered into a highly effective dual targeting BCMA-GPRC5D CAR-NK cell product as a next-generation &#8220;off-shelf&#8221; cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,Costimulation,Structure-activity relationships,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cuiqing Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yifang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Tingting Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Fuwei Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingyang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Gang Ye<sup>1<\/sup>, Renhong Tang<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhouxiao Cao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Shanghai Simnova Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.
