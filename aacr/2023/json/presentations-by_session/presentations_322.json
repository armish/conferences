[{"Abstract":"Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in expression of oncogenic chimeric proteins drive tumor progression. Gene fusions are promising targets for cancer therapy in various types of cancers. Therefore, faithful detection of gene fusions is essential in precision medicine. Previously, fusions have been detected using FISH, RT-PCR and RNA-seq. Targeted sequencing provides better sensitivity as only the regions associated with the driver genes are sequenced, increasing possible coverage depth, and reducing cost. We developed a targeted RNA-based lung cancer fusion panel utilizing 5&#8217; RACE technology to construct a NGS library for detection of fusion transcripts present in total RNA from highly degraded samples, such as blood or FFPE samples. The panel is deliberately designed to cover 64 known actionable fusion genes as well as novel gene fusions. Using an in-house fusion RNA mix comprising of 52 fusion transcripts, the panel was optimized and balanced. A total of 40 lung cancer patient FFPE samples, one 6-fusion FFPE reference sample and three fusion positive cell line samples were used for validating the panel. Limit of detection (LoD) was determined using the in-house RNA mix and normal lung tissue RNA. The minimum RNA input to detect all 52 fusion transcripts was 10<sup>-4<\/sup> ng (0.1 pg) of mixture of RNAs in background of 10 ng of normal lung tissue RNA. The panel successfully detected all six fusion transcripts with 10 ng of RNA from a 6-fusion reference FFPE sample. With this confirmation, we tested clinically relevant sample types which are damaged RNAs from FFPE material. This study demonstrates the performance of our newly developed NGS fusion gene panel with clinical samples. It accommodates highly degraded RNA samples with low amounts of input. The next step would be to expand the testing to include more samples and cell-free RNAs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Fusion genes,RNA-seq,Targeted sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bongyong Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alisha Babu<sup><\/sup>, Aiguo Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Michael  Y.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women in the United States. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer is the most prevalent and includes adenocarcinoma (AD), and squamous cell lung cancers. The unique cellular biology of these cancers could potentially allow for serological detection and identification via tissue specific protein markers. Galectins are a group of &#946;-galactoside binding proteins which are known to be alternatively expressed in cancers and are being studied for their biomarker potential. Galectin-7 is expressed in epithelial tissues as well as in all layers of the epidermis as it is normally highly expressed by squamous cells. Purpose. We are evaluating potential of galectin-7 to be used as a serum biomarker and delineator of several lung cancer subtypes.<br \/>Methods. The serum concentrations of galectin-7 were measured in 96 cancer patients using ELISA. Twenty-eight samples were from adenocarcinoma lung cancer patients, 25 were from squamous cell lung carcinomas patients, 19 were from all other types of lung cancer, and 28 were from other squamous cell carcinomas of non-pulmonary origin. The serum galectin-7 concentrations in cancer patients were compared amongst themselves by their histological subtypes. One-way analysis was performed using Student&#8217;s t-test for pairwise comparisons.<br \/>Results. Galectin-7 concentrations were significantly elevated in serum samples from squamous cell lung cancer patients (n=25; mean, 1.91 ng\/mL) relative to adenocarcinoma lung cancer patients (n=24; mean, 1.02; p-value, 0.0149). Additionally, levels of galectin-7 in samples of squamous cell lung carcinomas were higher than samples of squamous cell carcinomas of non-pulmonary origin (n=28; mean, 0.33 ng\/mL, p-value, &#60;0.0001). These results show that serum galectin-7 is increased in patients with squamous cell lung cancer compared to adenocarcinoma lung cancer.<br \/>Conclusion. Potential clinical applications of this study include the measurement of galectin-7 in blood samples of cancer patients to aid in cancer screening and tumor type identification. Further explorations comprise measuring serum concentrations of galectin-7 by stage of squamous cell lung cancer and histological subtype (keratinizing, non-keratinizing, and basaloid) to determine a more nuanced understanding of the tumor molecular biology.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Squamous cell carcinoma,Galectin-7,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Avery  T.

In this study, we demonstrate the performance of a digital PCR (dPCR) based assay that reports 15 (NCCN) biomarkers using only 1 slide of FFPE tissue. ChromaCode&#8217;s High Definition PCR (HDPCR&#8482;) NSCLC Tumor Profiling Panel (Research Use Only) detects guideline biomarkers including variants for <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>ERBB2<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i>, <i>RET<\/i>, <i>MET<\/i>, and <i>NTRK1-3<\/i> with a 24 hour turnaround time and a simple PCR workflow. A total of 34 NSCLC FFPE specimens were evaluated using the HDPCR NSCLC Panel. DNA and RNA were extracted from a single 10 &#181;m section of specimen, with a sister section previously characterized with the Oncomine Precision Assay GX. The DNA\/RNA eluates (20ng DNA per well, 20ng RNA) were run with the HDPCR NSCLC Panel on the Qiagen QIAcuity dPCR instrument. Data analysis was conducted using ChromaCloud&#8482;, which includes a proprietary algorithm that can detect and quantify 6 targets (5 targets and 1 internal control) for each of the 3 wells. DNA samples discordant with the comparator assay were evaluated using the Archer DNA VariantPlex panel, while RNA discordant samples were analyzed using the Archer RNA fusion plex panel. Of the 34 specimens evaluated, 16 SNV, 13 Insertion\/Deletion, and 7 fusion positive specimens were identified using NGS. On the dPCR assay, the results show a high-level of agreement, after discordant resolution, of 95.8% across the panel. The minor allele fraction (MAF), also calculated using ChromaCode Cloud, ranged from 5% to 90%. With 20 ng input (Qubit), the average copy number of amplifiable DNA ranged from 791 copies (~2.3 ng) to 6583 copies (~19.9 ng) with a mean of 2410 copies (~7.43 ng). Here we demonstrate that the HDPCR NSCLC Tumor Profiling Panel provides comparable performance to validated NGS assays with a turnaround that enables adherence to guideline-recommended treatment, and a low sample requirement that maximizes the number of patients for molecular testing. The standard protocols used by the assay and the use of a cloud based analysis pipeline enables easy deployment of this assay in any lab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,Precision medicine,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kerri Cabrera<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jeff Gole<sup><\/sup>, Bryan Leatham<sup><\/sup>, Isabel Regoli<sup><\/sup>, Tiffany Martinez<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Richards<sup><\/sup>, Leah Herdt<sup><\/sup>, Juan Enciso<sup><\/sup>, Paige Berroteran<sup><\/sup>, Heather Carolan<sup><\/sup>, Brad Brown<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chromacode, Inc., Carlsbad, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e659308d-4212-46a9-bac5-56f2748eb19d","ControlNumber":"4984","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Prostate cancer screening is driven by prostate specific antigen (PSA), however, PSA&#8217;s screening utility is diminished in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) due to an enlarged prostate and elevated PSA, triggering unnecessary biopsies in men with this condition. Thus, there is a critical unmet medical need to identify a marker for men with these conditions. Moreover, it is crucial to test any novel biomarker in populations of different ancestry (especially African American men who have higher prostate cancer risk) to ensure results apply regardless of race. To this extent, we recently identified a cleaved fragment of Filamin A (FLNA) protein (as measured by IP-MRM mass spectrometry assessment) as a novel biomarker for stratifying BPH from prostate cancer and subsequently evaluated its utility in Caucasian and African American patients. The men had a negative digital rectal examination (DRE), PSA between 4-10 ng\/ml and all underwent prostate biopsy. In African American (AA) men, FLNA expression exhibited diagnostic utility for stratifying BPH from all prostate cancer patients (0.72 AUC, 0.82 PPV, 0.76 NPV, 14.2 OR, P Value - 1.5 e-08 in 48 BPH and 139 PCa AA men) and outperformed PSA (0.54 AUC, 0.75 PPV, 0.28 NPV, 1.1 OR, P Value 0.78). In addition, FLNA could stratify BPH from Gleason 7-10 prostate cancers (0.71 AUC, 0.66 PPV, 0.86 NPV, 12.2 OR, P Value 1.7 e-05 in 48 BPH and 60 PCa AA men) and again outperformed PSA (0.5 AUC, 0.58 PPV, 0.62 NPV, 2.18 OR, P Value 0.24). In Caucasian American (CA)<i> <\/i>men, FLNA expression exhibited diagnostic utility for stratifying BPH from all prostate cancer patients (0.68 AUC, 0.68 PPV, 0.73 NPV, 5.6 OR, P Value 1.6 e-12 in 191 BPH and 281 PCa CA men) and outperformed PSA (0.56 AUC, 0.58 PPV, 0.28 NPV, 0.55 OR, P Value 0.13). FLNA could also stratify BPH from Gleason 7-10 prostate cancers (0.74 AUC, 0.46 PPV, 0.96 NPV, 19.4 OR, P Value 1.6 e-12 in 119 BPH and 109 PCa CA men) and again outperformed PSA (0.46 AUC, 0.35 PPV, 0.38 NPV, 0.32 OR, P Value 0.03). Previously we showed FLNA along with prostate volume had superior performance over PSA in identifying patients with prostate cancer (Kiebish et al <i>Scientific Reports<\/i>, 2021 Jul 23, 11(1)). Herein, we refined our analysis and establish FLNA alone as a serum biomarker for stratifying men with BPH vs prostate cancer as well as those with high Gleason prostate cancers compared to the current diagnostic paradigm of using PSA. This simplified approach demonstrates clinical actionability as a test with utility in AA and CA men and represents a significant opportunity to decrease the need for unnecessary biopsies for prostate cancer diagnosis. A clinical test is being developed to address this important medical need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,African American,Diagnostic marker,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nischal Mahaveer Chand<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Poornima  K.

Previous studies have revealed the molecular classification of GI tract tumors through biomarkers such as gene alternations, MSI, EBV, and chromosomal instability (CIN). However, the clinical utility of these biomarkers remained limited. Here we reported a comprehensive genomic profiling study, comparing molecular characteristics between unresectable gastric and colon cancer patients. The study also investigated the potential use of molecular biomarkers for longitudinal disease monitoring.<br \/>Methods: The prospective study planned to collect tissue and plasma samples from 200 unresectable GI tract cancer patients. Currently, 17 gastric cancer patients and 11 colon cancer patients were enrolled. Baseline tumor tissue samples were collected from 19 patients and baseline plasma samples were collected from 9 patients whose tissue biopsies were unavailable. Patients were then treated with targeted and chemo- therapies. Among the patients whose baseline plasma samples were collected, longitudinal plasma samples were collected from 7 patients every 2 weeks during treatment. Baseline tissue and plasma samples were tested using the 600-genes PredicineATLAS. The study also applied PredicineCNB, a low-pass whole-genome sequencing (LP-WGS) assay, using baseline and longitudinal plasma samples to monitor disease during treatment.<br \/>Results: The PredicineATLAS assay identified 135 somatic gene mutations and 40 copy number variants among 28 patients. The median tumor mutation burden (TMB) was 4.15 Muts\/Mb while the maximum TMB was 14.30 Muts\/Mb. The genes with the most common alternations were TP53 (76% in gastric cancer and 64% in colon cancer), APC (24% in gastric cancer and 64% in colon cancer), and MYC (24% in gastric cancer and 64% in colon cancer). Meanwhile, the prevalence of PIK3CA and KRAS mutations was significantly higher in colon cancer than in gastric cancer (PIK3CA: colon 7\/11 vs. gastric 2\/17, p&#60;0.05; KRAS: colon 8\/11 vs. gastric 0\/17, p&#60;0.001). Among those 7 patients whose diseases were monitored by PredicineCNB during treatment, 5 patients were observed to have significant decrease in blood-based copy number burden (bCNB) score, after two weeks of treatment. Notably, one colon patient, who has been monitored for 5 timepoints by now, showed continually decreasing bCNB score and reached the criteria of healthy donor judging by an in-house database.<br \/>Conclusions: This study compared the variation landscape between gastric and colon cancer patients, and demonstrated the technical feasibility of genome-wide copy number variations through liquid biopsy, revealing its potential clinical utility of longitudinal disease monitoring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number variation,Molecular profiling,ctDNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Haoran Tang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Feng Xie<sup><\/sup>, Yue Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Shidong Jia<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Huidu (Shanghai) Medical Sciences, Ltd., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"da1ef147-a934-4e2b-9be7-ae1a4a459b53","ControlNumber":"3297","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

In addition to the existing standard treatment methods, it is urgent to develop new therapy methods to improve the survival rate of patients. Amino acid metabolism plays a crucial role in tumor development. Cancer cells rely on amino acids for replication, energy source, redox homeostasis, and release metabolites that recruit and stimulate immunosuppressive cells. This study constructed a novel prognostic signature model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) composed of amino acid metabolism-related genes and assessed immune cell infiltration characteristics and predictive value for patient therapy. We screened differentially expressed genes involved in amino acid metabolic pathways in LUAD tumor tissues versus normal tissues from RNA-seq data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Then we performed a multivariate cox analysis of 9 genes significantly associated with patients&#8217; overall survival, which established a new prognostic signature. Dividing the patients into high- and low-risk groups using a cutoff value of -0.36, the outcome showed that the risk score of this model could predict survival of LUAD patients with relatively high accuracy (ROC-AUC (max)=0.73). Subsequently, we utilized the ssGSEA method to quantify the infiltration of immune cells. We found that several immune cell subpopulations were significantly altered abundance between the high- and low-risk patients. Immune cell subpopulations, such as mast cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, and central memory CD4 T cell, were significantly abundant in the low-risk patients. After ESTIMATE algorithm evaluation, a method for estimating the proportion of stromal and immune cells in tumor tissues based on gene expression profiles, we observed that immune and stroma scores were markedly upregulated in low-risk patients, suggesting that the immune and stromal activity were increased. The key molecules of this signature exhibited a significant correlation with the expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Moreover, multivariate cox regression model analysis was performed with patients&#8217; age, gender, clinical stage, T stage, M stage, N stage and risk score. The results indicated that the risk score signature was a significant and independent prognostic biomarker for the prognostic prevision of LUAD patients.Finally, the risk score based on the amino acid metabolism-related signature was successfully validated by the data of LUAD patients in the GEO dataset GES30219.These findings suggest that the prognostic signature based on the expression of genes involved in amino acid metabolism may be useful and effective. We further characterized one of the 9 genes involved in tryptophan metabolism for its biological implications in tumor progression and construction of immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment by experimental procedures with human LUAD cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognosis,Gene expression,Amino acid,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Huihui Xiang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rika Kasajima<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroyuki Ito<sup>2<\/sup>, Tomoyuki Yokose<sup>3<\/sup>, Takashi Oshima<sup>4<\/sup>, Tetsuro Sasada<sup>5<\/sup>, Yohei Miyagi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Molecular Pathology & Genetics Division, Kanagawa Cancer Center Research Institute, Yokohama, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Division of Cancer Immunotherapy, Kanagawa Cancer Center Research Institute, Yokohama, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a443c1bb-6add-427e-be62-11b215a38479","ControlNumber":"4242","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

CRC patients are often treated with opioid (e.g., morphine, or synthetic opioid piritramide) analgesia for pain, nausea, and side effects of chemotherapy. These analgesics act through opioid and cannabinoid receptors, which pathways are involved in tumor progression and metastases and thus can negatively affect the survival of patients. In our previous studies, we analyzed the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in two groups of CRC patients. One group received morphine analgesia (MA) and second piritramide analgesia (PA). We found that MA associated with increased CTCs levels and significantly shorter cancer-specific survival (CSS). These findings lead to further analysis of the opioid and cannabinoid receptors tumor gene expressions. We expected that the different expression of specific receptors in tumor tissue makes a difference between the effects of MA and PA on patients&#180; survival.<br \/>Methods: Gene expression of opioid receptors &#181; (OPRM), &#954; (OPRK), &#948; (OPRD), nociceptin (OPRL) and cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1, CB2) was analyzed in RNA purified from tumor tissues in 131 patients with CRC. Expression of markers was detected using real-time RT-PCR on LightCycler 1536 from Roche. &#914;-actin gene expression was used for gene expression normalization. Specific cut-off values were calculated for each marker using maxstat R software, ver. 3.3.1. Relationship between expression of receptors in tumor tissue and patients&#8217; survival was analyzed using COX regression, Kruskal-Wallis\/ANOVA test, and Kaplan-Meier method.<br \/>Results: In total, 118 patients (45 females and 73 males, average age 68 years), of clinical stage-III were analyzed. It was found that MA in CRC patients was associated with significantly shorter cancer-specific survival (CSS; p=0,027). The univariate survival analysis revealed that CRC patients with high OPRM tumor tissue gene expression had significantly longer overall survival (OS; p=0.017) and patients with CB2 gene expression had significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS; p=0,029). All other tested opioid receptors expressions had no statistically significant effect on patients&#8217; survival.<br \/>Conclusion: The diverse opioid receptors&#8217; expressions on tumor and immune cells can affect the survival of cancer patients treated with opioid analgesia. Morphine perioperative analgesia seems to shorten the CCS in CRC patients in our study. However, further research is required to elucidate the effect of opioids on different cell populations.<br \/>Acknowledgement: This study was supported by Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic [NV18-03-00470]; Palacky University Olomouc [LF 2022_012]; European Regional Development Fund [ENOCHCZ.02.1.01\/0.0\/0.0\/16_019\/0000868) and European Union - Next Generation EU (EXCELES LX22NPO5102).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,opioid receptors,cannabinoid receptors,analgesia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Monika Vidlarova<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Josef Srovnal<sup><\/sup>, Emil Berta<sup><\/sup>, Sona Gurska<sup><\/sup>, Alona Rehulkova<sup><\/sup>, Pavla Kourilova<sup><\/sup>, Marian Hajduch<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Palacky University in Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"47562698-0277-4832-85d4-146782b075a0","ControlNumber":"4208","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

There is an alarming increase in incidence of CRC in younger patients along with well recognized racial disparities. Recent data implicate a role of microbiome in initiation and progression of CRC. <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum<\/i> (<i>Fn<\/i>), an oral opportunistic pathogen, has emerged as one of the common pathogens associated with CRC. <i>Fn<\/i> transformation from commensal to pathogen requires expression of amyloid-like FadA adhesin that plays a key role in its attachment to the colonic mucosal cells resulting in inflammatory, oncogenic, and metastatic changes. CRC initiates as polyps that go on to invade the mucosal layers and metastasize. This study analyzed the significance of <i>Fn<\/i> as a biomarker in CRC as well as to understand the etiology and metastasis of CRC. Deidentified and delinked formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections from cancerous, precancerous and non-cancerous colorectal biopsies were analyzed for <i>Fn<\/i> presence and markers in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC through immunofluorescence. EMT was studied through biomarkers such as E-cadherin, which is an epithelial cell surface protein, vimentin as an intracellular filament protein normally expressed in mesenchymal cells, and N-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule that is shown to express aberrantly in some solid tumor cells undergoing EMT. As expected, E-cadherin was abundantly expressed on the surface of epithelial cells while vimentin was found in the stromal cells in the non-cancerous tissue sections. Interestingly, the E-cadherin expression was lower in the cancerous tissue and some cancerous specimens also exhibited the vimentin positive foci within epithelial cells signifying partial EMT. N-cadherin expression was not observed in any of the specimens. The presence of <i>Fn <\/i>as analyzed through the FadA staining correlated with decline in the E-cadherin expression in some cancer specimens. To further analyze the significance of <i>Fn<\/i>, a meta-analytic study was conducted from 20 studies that indicated a significant presence of <i>Fn<\/i> not only in CRC tissues but also in fecal specimens from patients with CRC. A whole genome sequencing analysis corroborated with the abundance of <i>Fn<\/i> in CRC tissue specimens. These data suggest that analysis for <i>Fn<\/i> presence offers an attractive opportunity for intervention and targeted treatment for chemo resistant tumors. EMT analysis provides an additional corroboration in early detection of cancer progression which is pivotal in successful treatment of CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Microbiome,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Angela Huang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anjana Saxena<sup>2<\/sup>, Mintoo Patel<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Natural Science, South Florida State College, Avon Park, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Biology Department, Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3433952c-8892-42a6-9764-2338b93890fe","ControlNumber":"8023","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

This study includes 22 patients diagnosed with UTUC, from which we collected 1 peripheral blood (PB) sample prior to surgery (pre-op; n = 22) and 1 sample at follow-up (post-op; n = 11). Each patient&#8217;s sample was analyzed via our enrichment-free third generation comprehensive High-Definition Single Cell Assay (HDSCA3.0) workflow to detect rare events in the PB. Rare events include circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and large extracellular vesicles (LEVs) and are identified via a 4-channel immunofluorescence assay that captures the following morphometric expressions: pan cytokeratin (CK), vimentin (V), CD45\/CD31 (CD), and cellular nucleation (which is absent in LEVs) through DAPI (D). Through a matched sample analysis approach via a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, pre-op and post-op liquid biopsy profiles were compared to each other as well as to samples from 50 normal donors (NDs) who had no known pathology. The HDSCA3.0 analysis discovered a highly heterogeneous spread of rare events in PB samples collected from patients with UTUC in both pre-op and post-op time periods and in ND samples. For pre-op vs ND samples, significant differences were found in total rare events, total rare cells, events expressing D|V, D|CK|V|CD, D|V|CD, total LEVs, total CK+ cells, CK LEVs, and events expressing D and D|CK. For post-op vs ND samples, significant differences were in total rare events, total rare cells, events expressing D|V, D|CK|V|CD, total CK+ cells, and events expressing D|CK|V. For pre-op vs post-op samples, significant differences manifested in total LEVs, CK LEVs, and CK|CD LEVs. At follow-up, 3 patients had an increase in rare events, and 8 patients had a decrease in rare events, 4 of the 8 presenting with ND rare event levels. This study has the potential to inform how primary UTUC evolves in patients over time as well as elucidate if rare event expressions may correlate with specific disease states. By analyzing circulating rare events through channel-type classifications, different frequencies at various time points compared to ND samples can assist in clinical decision making for treating UTUC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Tumor heterogeneity,Circulating tumor cells,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Salmaan Sayeed<\/b><sup><\/sup>, George Courcoubetis<sup><\/sup>, Alireza Ghoreifi<sup><\/sup>, Amy Huang<sup><\/sup>, Jeremy Mason<sup><\/sup>, Inderbir  S.

At diagnosis, the medium-sized panel detected 276 somatic variants in 35 genes (average 3.6 variants per patient) whereas the large panel detected 351 somatic variants in 74 genes (average 4.6 variants per patient). These variants were frequently detected in methylation and epigenetic genes (25%), signaling genes (20%) and transcription factors (12%). After treatment, MRD-negativity was indicated in 27 patients by the medium-sized panel versus 23 patients by the large panel; MRD-positivity was indicated in 49 patients by the medium-sized panel versus 53 patients by the large panel. Shorter overall survival was associated with MRD-positivity as determined by both panels: medium-sized panel (hazard ratio [HR], 3.00; 95% CI, 1.01-8.93; P&#60;.05), large panel (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.00-11.57; P&#60;.05).<br \/>Conclusion: A medium-sized NGS panel detected fewer somatic mutations than large NGS panel but both panels, when used as MRD markers, are similarly predictive of overall survival in AML patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Survival,Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yonghong Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jose Solis-Ruiz<sup>2<\/sup>, Frederick  K.

PCa death is primarily attributed to therapeutic resistance. Our group and others have recently discovered a stress-induced adaptive cell state that plays a key role in therapy resistance: the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state. Cells in the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state are characterized by large cell size and polyploidization of the baseline aneuploid genome. Cells in the PACC state (e.g., pleomorphic giant cells, polyploid giant cancer cells, osteoclast like cells) have been reported in patient tumor specimens of multiple cancer types. We recently reported that in primary tumor specimens of PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with curative intent, the number of cells in the PACC state is a statistically significant negative prognostic factor for metastasis-free survival (data adjusted for CAPRA-S). These data highlight the promise of the PACC state as a predictive biomarker for recurrence. In our previous work, cells in the PACC state were identified and quantified through EpCAM immunohistochemistry (IHC) to visualize cell membranes, manually including cells with &#38;gt3x increased nuclear area compared to adjacent non-polyploid cancer cells. However, this method is labor intensive and highly subjective. There are currently no biomarkers to distinguish cells in the PACC state. To identify candidate PACC state biomarkers, we performed RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes. Across two independent RNA sequencing datasets of PC3 cells induced to enter the PACC state with IC50 cisplatin or IC90 docetaxel, the most differentially expressed gene was KRTAP2-3 (Log2FC=4.3 and 5.51, respectively). The Keratin Associated Protein 2-3 (KRTAP2-3) is encoded by one of the homologous KRTAP genes classified by high sulfur content and is primarily expressed in the cortex of the hair follicle. It has not been previously implicated in PCa or in chemotherapy resistance. Due to its differential RNA expression in the PACC state and its low expression in most normal tissues, we hypothesize that KRTAP2-3 can be used as a biomarker to distinguish cells in the PACC state in patient tumor samples. To test this directly, we optimized RNA in situ-hybridization (RNAish) for KRTAP2-3. In initial experiments utilizing PC3 cell line plugs, we found that the KRTAP2-3 RNAish signal successfully distinguished cells in the PACC state (50.6 average punctae\/cell) from non-polyploid cells (0.19 average punctae\/cell) reflecting 96% percent accuracy using sensitivity and specificity metrics. We have further confirmed positive KRTAP2-3 signal on PC3 cells induced to access the PACC state in response to cisplatin, docetaxel, and etoposide treatment. Future work will evaluate the utility of the KRTAP2-3 gene as a prognostic biomarker that marks cells in the PACC state within PCa patient tissue microarrays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Prognostic markers,Prostate cancer,polyaneuploid cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sabrina  A.

Radiation therapy with\/without concurrent chemoradiation is the most common first-line treatment. Although most patients respond to the treatment, about 30-50% of treated patients still relapse. Bulk sequencing uncovered numerous disease-associated genes, but still there is no effective targeted therapy or immunotherapy to prevent relapse. Tools for early relapse prediction at initial diagnosis still remain unavailable.<br \/>Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has emerged as a sensitive long-sought solution to low resolution in bulk seqeuncing. We launched the largest and most comprehensive scRNA-seq NPC study in the world. 55 patients were recruited. Matched biopsies from normal adjacent tumour, primary tumour and lymph node malignancy sites were harvested and 70488 epithelial cells had been successfully scRNA-seq profiled. Unsupervised clustering identified 9 different epithelial subclusters. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis identified neoplastic cells with wide-spread CNV aberrations consistent with previous bulk genomic findings. For the first time, we had also attempted to unfold single nucleotide variation (SNV) of neoplastic cells from scRNA-seq using modified Mutect2 pipeline. Our study spanned 4 years and 5 patients were reported relapsed. Encouragingly, survival analysis identified rare neoplastic subcluster 1 as the only neoplastic subcluster positively correlated with relapse. Abundance of neoplastic subcluster 1 biomarker-positive cells were verified to be elevated in FFPE primary tumours of relapsed patients collected at initial diagnosis. Deconvolution analysis of a publicly available bulk RNA sequencing dataset revealed only cells harbouring neoplastic subcluster 1 expression signature tended to positively correlate with relapse. Interestingly, cross-tissue abundance analysis identified neoplastic subcluster 1 was positively correlated with preferential colonialization at cervical lymph node. Single-cell gene-set enrichment analysis (scGSEA) suggested neoplastic subcluster 1 possessed higher metastasis and treatment resistance potential. For the first time, we had also investigated the cell-cell communications among epithelial cells and identified interaction pathways implicated in self-renewal and tumorigenic capacity of cancer-initiating cells to be associated with neoplastic subcluster 1 and relapse.<br \/>To conclude, we successfully discovered a previously overlooked rare neoplastic subpopulation in NPC that may (1) possess higher metastasis and treatment resistance capacity, and (2) play a regulatory role in tumourigenesis, and its abundance at initial diagnosis could predict relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Prognostic markers,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ka Chun Wu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ken Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Nelson Su<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeffrey Yan Ho Lau<sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony Lo<sup>3<\/sup>, Yvonne Ngar Woon Kam<sup>4<\/sup>, Raymond Tsang<sup>5<\/sup>, Joseph Chung<sup>6<\/sup>, Joshua Ho<sup>2<\/sup>, Chi Ming Che<sup>7<\/sup>, Victor Ho Fun Lee<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Clinical Oncology, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Biomedical Sciences, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Laboratory for Synthetic Chemistry and Chemical Biology Limited (HKU Health@InnoHK), Hong Kong SAR, China,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Otolaryngology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Surgery, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China,<sup>7<\/sup>Chemical Biology Centre, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"73007eec-0c75-43a3-aae0-be4fdd5668ed","ControlNumber":"5772","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

This project aims to identify a prognostic proteomic-based signature for pancreatic adenocarcinomas.<br \/>Methods: Fresh frozen tumors and matched normal samples from 125 patients were prepared for proteomic analyses using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS). Differential expression analyses were conducted on the normalized protein matrix to identify the top differentially expressed proteins (DEP) within the tumor samples. DEP were subjected to crosstalk and pathway enrichment analysis (PEA). Survival analysis based on initial univariate and subsequent 100 runs of multivariate Cox regression with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was performed to obtain a reduced list of candidate proteins associated with Overall Survival (OS). The proteins that appeared in greater than 95% of the LASSO runs were then used in a multivariate Cox model with recursive feature selection, which yielded the final 29 proteins. A risk score was built from the final 29 proteins. Consensus clustering was performed on the median absolute deviation-based top 20% highly variable proteins in tumor samples to identify proteomic-based subtypes.<br \/>Results: Proteomic analyses revealed 5614 proteins identified from 599 sample runs. Differential expression analyses revealed 398 DEP in tumor samples (FDR-adjusted p-value &#60;0.05, and |logFC|&#62;1). PEA showed that these proteins were related to focal adhesion, extracellular matrix interaction (ECM), angiogenesis, and PI3K signaling pathways. A total of 803 proteins were significantly associated with OS in a univariate Cox regression analysis (p&#60;0.05). PEA on the top 200 proteins associated with poorer OS revealed pathways related to focal adhesion, PI3K signaling, ECM and hypoxia-induced factor-1. Using LASSO multivariate Cox regression modeling, a 29-protein signature was identified, from which a risk score was calculated that dichotomized patients into high- and low-risk groups in terms of OS (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [2.3, 3.3], concordance index of 0.91). This risk score was also prognostic for recurrence and three-year survival (both p&#60;0.0001). A multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for other clinical variables revealed a significant association of the risk score with OS (HR 2.91, 95% CI [2.4, 3.5], p&#60;0.001) while maintaining the concordance index (0.907). Consensus clustering analyses revealed four proteomic-based clusters, with cluster 3 showing the worst OS (p&#60;0.001), independent of other clinical variables. PEA on the DEP within cluster 3 showed upregulation of proteins related to cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and immune-related pathways.<br \/>Conclusion: A 29-protein signature identified a sub-group of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a poorer prognosis independent of clinical variables.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Proteomics,Biomarkers,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Adel  T.

Quantifiable tumor fibrosis biomarkers are needed for patient stratification and a non-invasive approach (liquid biopsy) is preferred in particular in the advanced setting. Type I collagen (COL1) and type V collagen (COL5) are two collagens responsible for the densely packed fibrils in the fibrotic tumor microenvironment. While COL1 is the most abundant collagen, COL5 is known for controlling collagen fibril size and orientation, and therefore fibrillar collagen quality. Increased fibrotic activity results in release of collagen pro-peptides into the bloodstream of patients with cancer. In this study, we first evaluated the clinical utility of non-invasive collagen based liquid biomarkers of COL1 and COL5 in patients with various solid tumors and subsequently evaluated prognostic utility in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC).<br \/>Methods: In a discovery cohort, pro-peptides of COL1 (PRO-C1) and COL5 (PRO-C5) were measured in serum from patients with various stages of bladder-, breast-, colorectal-, head and neck-, kidney-, lung-, melanoma-, pancreatic-, prostate-, and stomach cancer (n=220) and compared to healthy controls (n=33). Based on these results, the biomarker potential of PRO-C5 was validated further in 814 patients with PC from the BIOPAC cohort (n=15, 201, 164 and 434 for stage 1-4, respectively) including assessment for associations with overall survival (OS) analyzed by Kaplan-Meyer curves and Cox regression analysis, alone, and after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, diabetes, smoking, CA19-9, stage, no. of metastatic sites, performance status, and cachexia.<br \/>Results: PRO-C5, not PRO-C1, was significantly elevated in serum from all types of cancer patients compared to healthy controls (p&#60;0.05 - p&#60;0.0001). Levels of PRO-C5 were similar in patients from the BIOPAC cohort to those found in the discovery cohort. Furthermore, when dividing patients from the BIOPAC cohort into quartiles based on PRO-C5 levels (Q1-Q4) a stepwise decrease was detected in median OS time (log rank, p&#60;0.0001). Moreover, patients in the upper quartile of PRO-C5 (Q4) had 65% increased risk of dying compared to patients in Q1 (HR=1.65, 1.35-2.02, p&#60;0.0001) and this remained significant after adjusting for other common risk factors by multivariate analysis (HR=1.69, 1.30-2.20, p=0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: Type V collagen (COL5) pro-peptides measured in serum (PRO-C5) is a promising pan-tumor fibrosis liquid biopsy with indications of independent prognostic value in patients with pancreatic cancer. In the future, this may provide means for serological subtyping of CAF subtypes which will aid in treating cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Fibroblasts,Extracellular matrix,Collagen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neel Ingemann Nissen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Astrid Z.

The significance of TLS in patients with ESCC has been sporadically reported. The study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of TLS in patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).<br \/><b>Patients and Methods: <\/b>We included two cohorts of locally advanced ESCC patients from two referral centers of Taiwan. Cohort A consisted of 99 patients treated with paclitaxel\/cisplatin-based CRT, 69 of them being neoadjuvant CRT and 30 of them being definitive CRT, between 2002 and 2015; cohort B consisted of 67 patients treated with paclitaxel\/carboplatin-based neoadjuvant CRT between 2012 and 2018. Primary tumor tissues were retrospectively collected for immunohistochemical stains by CD20 (clone L26; Zytomed, Berlin, Germany) and CD23 (clone DAK-CD23; agilent Dako, California, U.S.A.). TLS was defined as aggregation of CD20 B cells, and mature TLS was defined as TLS with CD23-positively stained germinal center. Patients&#8217; characteristics were compared between those with or without TLS or mature TLS. The impact of TLS or mature TLS on patients&#8217; overall survival (OS) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In cohort A (median age of 56 years, M:F= 88:11), no TLS, immature TLS, and mature TLS were seen in 52, 35, and 12 patients, respectively. In cohort B (median age of 55 years, M:F= 64:3), no TLS, immature TLS, and mature TLS were seen in 27, 25, and 15, respectively. In cohort A, the presence of TLS is more commonly seen in ESCC with the primary site at upper (58%) and lower segments (63%) than middle segment of esophagus (35%) (p=0.039), and the mature TLS is more commonly seen at lower segment (25%) than other segments (8%) (p=0.033). The pathological complete response (pCR) was not significant different between patients with vs without TLS in cohort A (39% vs 43 %, p= 0.75), but trended to be lower in patients with TLS than without in cohort B (28% vs 52 %, p= 0.061). Besides, pCR rate trended to be lower in patients with mature TLS than without in both cohorts (13% vs 45 %, p= 0.080, for cohort A; 28% vs 43 %, p= 0.23, for cohort B). As patients with or without TLS did not differ in their OS in both cohorts, patients<br \/>with mature TLS trended to have worse overall survival in both cohort A (HR: 1.4 [95% CI 0.33-3.05], p=0.29) and cohort B (HR: 1.6 [95% CI 0.81-2.98], p=0.15).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In two independent cohorts of locally advanced ESCC patients receiving paclitaxel\/platinum-based CRT, we did not find the correlation of the presence of TLS or mature TLS in pre-treatment primary ESCC tumor tissue with the favorable treatment outcomes.

Altered PGP9.5 expression has been suggested to play a role for resistance to chemotherapy, metastasis, and patient prognosis in several tumor entities. To comprehensively determine PGP9.5 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, a tissue microarray containing 14,913 samples from 148 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. PGP9.5 immunostaining was found in 2,667 of 11,062 analyzed tumors and considered weak in 9.8%, moderate in 5.8% and strong in 8.5% of tumors. 113 of 148 tumor categories showed at least one positive case, and 90 of these tumor categories contained at least one case with strong PGP9.5 staining. PGP9.5 positivity was most seen in various types of neuronal and neuroendocrine neoplasms (71.1-100%), germ cell neoplasms of the testis (82.1%), and in mesotheliomas (74%). PGP9 positivity was seen in 14.2% of 606 clear cell and in 45.4% of 255 papillary renal cell carcinomas (RCC). In clear cell RCC, strong PGP9.5 staining was associated with high ISUP grade (p&#60;0.0001), pT stage (p=0.0012), nodal (p=0.038) and distant metastasis (p&#60;0.0001) as well as with a shortened overall, tumor specific and recurrence free survival (p&#60;0.0001 each). In papillary RCC, strong PGP9.5 staining was significantly associated with high ISUP grade (p=0.009), advanced UICC stage (p=0.015), and shortened recurrence free survival (p&#60;0.0001). In urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder, high PGP9.5 expression was associated with muscle-invasion (p&#60;0.0001) but PGP9.5 immunostaining was unrelated to prognosis in pT2-4 carcinomas. In a joint analysis of 527 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 different sites of origin, PGP9.5 positivity was associated with high tumor grade (p=0.0021). PGP9.5 immunostaining was unrelated to pT and pN status in 207 serous high-grade and 82 endometrioid ovarian carcinoma, in 221 endometrioid endometrium cancer as well as in 292 papillary and in 89 follicular thyroid carcinomas. In ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and in 356 gastric adenocarcinomas, PGP9.5 staining was unrelated to grade, pT and pN stage. Our data provide an overview on prevalence of PGP9.5 expression in cancer. PGP9.5 expression occurs commonly in many different tumor entities. PGP9.5 overexpression is strikingly linked to patient outcome in some tumor entities (i.e. clear cell RCC) but appears to be unrelated to unfavorable tumor characteristics in various other important tumor entities (i.e. gastric, pancreatic, ovarian cancer).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognostic markers,PGP9.5,Tissue microarrays,UCH-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sekander Scherzai<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Maximilian Lennartz<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Frank Jacobsen<sup>1<\/sup>, Florian Viehweger<sup>1<\/sup>, David Dum<sup>1<\/sup>, Anne Menz<sup>1<\/sup>, Ria Uhlig<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Hinsch<sup>1<\/sup>, Doris Hoeflmayer<sup>1<\/sup>, Christoph Fraune<sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Bernreuther<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Lebok<sup>1<\/sup>, Soeren Weidemann<sup>1<\/sup>, Guido Sauter<sup>1<\/sup>, Till Sebastian Clauditz<sup>1<\/sup>, Till Krech<sup>1<\/sup>, Andreas H Marx<sup>2<\/sup>, Ronald Simon<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Steurer<sup>1<\/sup>, Eike Burandt<sup>1<\/sup>, Natalia Gorbokon<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Minner<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Academic Hospital Fuerth, Fuerth, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dc1d5d6b-76e5-4391-a8a1-ff9ec1e0998d","ControlNumber":"7095","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer diagnoses, with significantly worse survival rates as clinical staging progresses. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic utility of longitudinal peripheral liquid biopsy as a treatment monitoring tool in stage III-IV NSCLC patients throughout treatment. Liquid biopsy represents a way for physicians to non-invasively continuously monitor and understand tumor progression through analyzing serial patient blood samples. This allows for real-time, in depth analysis of patient status throughout the treatment process. This study used the third generation, enrichment-free High-Definition Single Cell Assay (HDSCA3.0) workflow to detect and characterize rare events in the 48 peripheral blood samples collected from a cohort of 10 stage III-IV NSCLC patients undergoing various treatments. This workflow uses 4 fluorescent channels corresponding to 5 biomarkers. While circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been shown to be effective as a prognostic tool for measuring treatment efficacy and patient response to treatment, we have additionally identified 6 additional rare cell phenotypes with variable cytokeratin expression, and 3 types of oncosomes. We have established a liquid biopsy profile that is unique to NSCLC as compared to 50 normal donors. Within this cohort, we found significantly higher amounts of rare cells and oncosomes in patient cohorts as compared to normal donors, highlighting the potential utility of both cellular and oncosome subtypes in disease monitoring. In addition, these rare events differ drastically in morphological parameters and channel expression, and also display temporal heterogeneity. Through the analysis of peripheral blood samples across time and treatment methodologies, we observed significant association between liquid biopsy analytes and progression-free and overall survival, supporting the utility of liquid biopsy as a clinical tool. Understanding the dynamics behind these rare groups throughout the courses of treatment may help improve prognostic utility of liquid biopsy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Cancer progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lily Bai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, George Courcoubetis<sup>1<\/sup>, Jorge Nieva<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeremy Mason<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Kuhn<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephanie Shishido<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Quantitative Biology, Convergent Science Institute in Cancer, USC, USC - University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Oncology, USC Norris Cancer Hospital, USC - University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a410cdb1-2a4b-4f35-92ef-1b67fd49ca60","ControlNumber":"3869","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Many efforts are made to search for new biomarkers to screen for immunotherapy candidates and predict the response. Neural Precursor Cell Expressed, developmentally down-Regulated 9 (NEDD9), is predominantly expressed in many cancer types but has not been studied yet in lung adenocarcinoma. Herein, we analyzed the association of NEDD9 with immune inhibitory components to understand its immune landscape in lung adenocarcinoma.<br \/>Methods: Gene expression profiles were retrieved from The Cancer Genomic Atlas Lung Adenocarcinoma cohort (n = 567). We used TIMER 2.0 for immune inhibitory cell infiltrates analysis. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was measured using the cBioPortal tool. The enrichment analysis of function and signaling pathways of DEGs in LUAD was done by gene ontology (GO) using Enrichr.<br \/><b><\/b>Results: NEDD9 is differentially expressed in LUAD tissues (P &#60; 0.00). High NEDD9 expression had better overall survival prognostic value in LUAD patients (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49 - 0.89, P = 0.0221) compared to low expression. NEDD9 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophage M2 cells (spearman&#8217;s &#961; = 0.257, P &#60; 0.001, &#961; = 0.266, P &#60; 0.001, respectively), but negatively with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) (&#961; = -0.344, P &#60; 0.001). Moreover, survival analysis based on NEDD9 expression and MDSC levels revealed a better OS group identified by low MDSC levels and low NEDD9 expression after adjustment for age, stage, and purity. In terms of immune checkpoint genes&#8217; expression, NEDD9 expression was directly correlated with CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, VSIR, and LAG-3 (&#961; &#62; 0.2, Q value &#60; 0.05). TMB was inversely associated with NEDD9 expression (&#961; = -0.1, P &#60; 0.001). GO analysis showed that genes co-expressed with NEDD9 were mainly in the phagocytic vesicles and participated in biological processes of cellular response to interferon-gamma by molecular function such as cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic signaling pathways.<br \/>Conclusion: We found that NEDD9 expression is a useful biomarker of immunosuppression in LUAD patients and can predict the response to immunotherapy. Our results suggest that NEDD9 is a favorable prognostic biomarker, which could be explained by low MDSC. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the NEDD9 value in LAUD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immuno-oncology,Microenvironment,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leen  M.

In this study, we focused on POSTN in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC) because little is known about its possible role in carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate the role of POSTN in the recurrence and prognosis of tongue cancer. A total of 97 patients diagnosed with tongue cancer in Gyeongsang National University Hospital between Jan 2012 and Dec 2017 were included. A retrospective review of medical records was performed, and the immunohistochemical staining with the POSTN antibody was done. Statistical analysis between cancer progression and POSTN expression was done. Referring to the clinical results that POSTN was related to the recurrence of tongue cancer, the effects of POSTN on HNSCC cell lines were investigated. Overexpression and depletion of POSTN were established in the HNSCC cell line. The results of POSTN in the HNSCC cell line were evaluated by colony-forming, migration, invasion, wound healing, and flow cytometry in vitro and in vivo. We also investigated the effects of POSTN overexpression and depletion on invasion, migration, and cell apoptosis. High expression of POSTN in HNSCC was related to cancer recurrence. In multivariate analyses, High expression of POSTN was a statistically significant risk factor for tongue cancer recurrence (HR, 16.8; p=0.040). Also, POSTN inhibits colony-forming, migration, invasion, and wound healing. This study showed that POSTN in HNSCC is a positive correlation with recurrence. And we also confirmed that POSTN promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. POSTN plays an essential role in the growth and metastasis of tongue cancer and may be positioned as a therapeutic target for head and neck cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,Akt,Recurrence,Oral cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jung Je Park<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ji Hyun Seo<sup>1<\/sup>, Seongjun Won<sup>1<\/sup>, Somi Ryu<sup>1<\/sup>, Seung-Kuk Baek<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoon Woo Koh<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gyeongsang National Univ., Jinju, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Koreal University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4ea967a9-3047-4018-807c-6d9e2a7d724c","ControlNumber":"4233","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Distinguishing BC patients with different prognosis can help to make clinical strategies. In our study, we tried to identify novel prognostic genetic biomarkers for BC by using multi-omics data and establish a risk score (RS) signature with genetic biomarkers which have high predictive value. A combined significance (<i>p<\/i><sub>combined<\/sub>) of each gene was calculated by Fisher&#8217;s method based on the <i>p<\/i> value of the difference examination of the respective index in RNA-seq, CNV, and DNA methylation data of corresponding genes from TCGA-BRCA dataset. Genes with a p<sub>combined<\/sub> &#60; 0.010 were subjected to univariate cox and Lasso regression to screen out hub genes, whereby a RS signature consisted of six genes, C15orf52, C1orf228, CEL, FUZ, PAK6, and SIRPG, was established. With the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), multivariate cox regression, Nomogram, and decision curve analysis (DCA), the predicted performance of the RS signature was assessed in TCGA-BRCA, GSE7390, and GSE20685. The predicted performance in TNBC patients was emphatically analyzed in TCGA-BRCA and GSE103091, while immune characteristics were also explored. Basing on the data from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database and related R package, we further examined the drug sensitivity of TNBC patients with different RS. With survival rates having significant differences in all KM analyses and most area under ROCs reaching 0.700, the RS signature could distinguish the prognosis of patients, even stratified by disease stages or subtypes. The RS also showed a stronger predictive ability than traditional clinical indicators, including age, tumor topology (T), regional lymph node (N), metastasis (M), and TNM stage. The down-regulated expressions of many immune checkpoints were observed in TNBC patients with higher RS, while the sensitivity of many antitumor drugs was reduced in those with higher RS, except for BI2536 (CAS No.: 755038-02-9), which demonstrated a smaller half maximal inhibitory concentration (which mean a higher drug sensitivity) in TNBC patients with higher RS. In conclusion, the six genes RS signature established based on multi-omics data exhibited well performance in predicting the prognosis of BC patients, regardless of disease stages or subtypes. Contributing to a more personalized treatment, the RS signature might benefit the outcome of BC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Biomarkers,Multiomics,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zeyu Xing<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuting Hong<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Cancer Center\/ National Clinical Research Center for Cancer \/ Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>ChosenMed Technology Co.

Among HNSCC, HPV+ HNSCC patients have a favorable prognosis; however, approximately 20-30% suffer recurrence. Given the morbidity of current therapy, therapeutic de-escalation for HPV+ HNSCC is being explored in many clinical trials but is hampered by absence of accurate molecular classifiers to identify tumors at high and low risk of recurrence. Being able to risk stratify patients can help with therapeutic decisions, maintain high cure rates and decrease treatment associated complications. We assemble a NanoString panel to capture our recently developed NF-&#954;B RNA signature that can distinguish patients requiring aggressive therapy from patients who are appropriate for reduced intensity treatment. Our custom gene set can select HPV+ head and neck cancer patients that may benefit from therapy de-escalation. Several advantages of using a NanoString technology, including smaller amounts of patient samples and less processing time that allow real-time patient-specific results. This makes our Nanostring panel suitable to be used in clinic to identify HPV+ head and neck cancer patients for therapeutic de-escalation without compromising their survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,NF-&#954;B,NanoString,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sulgi kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, travis Schrank<sup><\/sup>, aditi Kothari<sup><\/sup>, Hina Rehmani<sup><\/sup>, Jason Tasoulas<sup><\/sup>, Xue Li<sup><\/sup>, Wendell Yarbrough<sup><\/sup>, Natalia Isaeva<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"07aac703-61a7-4098-94a9-b09c92dfa802","ControlNumber":"7218","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S. kim, <\/b> None..<br><b>T.

However, targeting mutant KRAS is still challenging. Kinase inhibitors are ideal targeted therapeutics for mutant KRAS-driven cancer. In our previous study, an esiRNA screening was prepared to identify some vital kinases that took part in KRAS mutant-driven pancreatic cancer. The <i>STK31<\/i> was identified as a potential therapeutic target in KRAS mutant PDAC. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of <i>STK31<\/i> in KRAS mutant PDAC as well as its therapeutic potential. The results demonstrated that <i>STK31 was <\/i>upregulated in KRAS mutant PDAC patients with poor survival. STK31 was also highly expressed in PDAC cell lines with KRAS mutant background. Inhibition of <i>STK31<\/i> in KRAS mutant cell lines significantly reduced PDAC cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Gain and loss of function experiments revealed that <i>STK31<\/i> was a downstream target of KRAS in PDAC. Pharmacological inhibition of several signaling pathways involved in KRAS showed MAPK\/ERK signaling involved in <i>STK31<\/i> regulation. Then, further mechanistic study validated that c-Jun, regulated by KRAS\/MAPK\/ERK signaling, directly regulated the transcription level<i> <\/i>of<i> STK31<\/i> by binding to its promoter region. In summary, our results show that <i>STK31<\/i> promotes PDAC cell proliferation under the control of the KRAS\/MAPK\/ERK\/c-Jun transcriptional axis in PDAC. <i>STK31<\/i> may act as a potential target in PDAC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Pancreatic cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuting Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Shing Chun Tang<sup><\/sup>, Yangchao Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"87605144-bf06-486c-961b-b59f1cb6921f","ControlNumber":"2191","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, the sensitivity of these approaches remains subpar and there is significant risk of false negative results. We analyzed the most proximal biofluid (urine) in localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients, and performed two orthogonal ctDNA analytical techniques, one focusing on driver mutation detection, and another focusing on genome-wide copy number alterations. The primary objective of this combinatorial approach was to sensitively detect ctDNA MRD, predict pathologic complete response (pCR), and improve patient risk-stratification.<br \/>Methods: Urine samples from 74 localized bladder cancer patients were collected preoperatively on the day of curative-intent radical cystectomy (RC) to assess urine tumor DNA (utDNA). We performed ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) of urine cfDNA from all 74 patients as well as 15 healthy adults. Tumor fraction (TFx) level based on genome-wide copy number alterations was estimated using ichorCNA. Variant allele frequency (VAF) based on single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) was estimated by uCAPP-Seq. We also noninvasively inferred tumor mutation burden (iTMB). pCR was determined by surgical pathology. A random forest (RF) model with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was utilized to predict disease status. Kaplan-Meier (KM) and Cox proportional hazards model survival analyses were performed to assess overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).<br \/>Results: Our study cohort consisted of 74 patients, of which 58 (78%) harbored localized MIBC, and 16 (22%) harbored treatment-refractory high-risk localized NMIBC. Among MIBC patients, 64% (37\/58) received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. VAF, iTMB and TFx levels significantly predicted pCR status. Our RF model incorporating these three utDNA parameters achieved a sensitivity of 87%, a negative predictive value of 77%, and a positive predictive value of 65% for predicting residual disease. AUC for the model was 0.80 (p&#60;0.0001). KM analysis revealed that both PFS (HR = 3.00, <i>P<\/i> = 0.01) and OS (HR = 4.81, <i>P<\/i> = 0.009) were significantly worse for patients predicted by the model to have residual disease. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models confirmed the significance of our MRD predictions. Survival analyses performed on MIBC, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and held-out validation subgroups corroborated these findings.<br \/>Conclusions: Integration of ULP-WGS with uCAPP-Seq enabled robust detection of residual urine tumor DNA with high sensitivity and predicted survival in localized bladder cancer patients. In the future, this type of multimodal urine-based genomic analysis may lead to more precise risk stratification and nonoperative clinical decision-making for bladder cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Machine learning,Liquid biopsies,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pradeep Singh Chauhan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander  L.

Here, we report that dynamic ctDNA <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations is a key point associated with a shorter survival, which may help to elucidate prognosis in patients with MBC.<br \/>Methods: This study included 406 hormone receptors positive MBC patients who received systemic treatment under an IRB-approved clinical trial (NU16B06) at Northwestern University Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center. Plasma samples were collected from each patient at multiple time points: before treatment (Time point 1), and then 3 months (Time point 2), 6 months (Time point 3), 9 months (Time point 4), 12 months (Time point 5) and 24 months (Time point 6) after initiation of systemic treatment respectively. Plasma ctDNA was isolated using a Qiagen circulating nucleic acid kit, and then was analyzed using the Guardant360 Health next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay. All statistical analyses were conducted Mann-Whitney U test by IBM SPSS version 23.0.<br \/>Results: Of the 406 patients, <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations were found in 18 hotspots from 59 patients (ESR1<sup>Mut<\/sup>, 14.5%) at either time points. There were 347 patients without any mutation (<i>ESR1<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup>, 85.5%). Among the 59 patients who have ESR1 mutations, 41 (69.5%) patients have <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations at only one time point, 6 patients (10.2%) have <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations at 2 time pints, 5 patients (8.5%) have <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations at 3 time points, 2 patients (3.3%) have <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations at 4 time points, and 5 patents (8.5%) have <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations for 5 time points respectively. The median survival times for patients in <i>ESR1<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup> group is 11.5 years compared to 6.4 years for patients in <i>ESR1<\/i><sup>Mut <\/sup>group (P=0.0134). This result indicated that patients without <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations at any time point have 1.81 times longer median survival time than patients who have <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations at any time point. Furthermore, 41 patients who have <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation at only one time point have longer survival time (7.1 years) compared to 18 patients who have <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation at more than 2 time points (5.1 years) (P&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Dynamic development of ctDNA <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations at different time points during the treatment significantly correlated with prognosis and survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Longitudinal dynamics of <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutation for treatment monitoring may offer important message for minimal residual disease and expand the early predictive role of prognosis for clinical decision-making in metastatic breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Circulating cell-free DNA,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qiang Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jianhua Jiao<sup>2<\/sup>, Lorenzo Gerratana<sup>3<\/sup>, Paolo D’Amico<sup>1<\/sup>, Seema Singhal<sup>1<\/sup>, Youbin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew A.
