However, our studies and others have demonstrated that orchestrated circulating tumor stem cells (CTSCs) lead multi-cellular cluster formation with 25-50 times higher metastatic propensity and predict worse prognosis than solo circulating tumor cells (CTCs). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CTSC clusters, we have advanced multiple complementary methods for multi-omic characterization, including FDA-approved CellSearch, immunofluorescence staining and histology analyses, flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, and intravital imaging of migrating tumor cells and CTCs <i>in vivo<\/i>. Combining, computational ranking, machine learning, and experimental investigation, we have identified multiple stemness markers such as CD44, ICAM1, and CD81, promoting cluster-mediated metastasis. Using protein structure modeling and interface prediction-guided mutagenesis, we demonstrate that membrane CD81 interacts with CD44 through their extracellular regions in promoting tumor cell cluster formation and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in human and mouse models. Proof-of-concept neutralization antibodies against these driver molecules inhibit CTSC cluster formation and reduce metastatic burden of triple negative breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huiping Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

To capture the full complexity of tumor-microenvironment interactions, including mechanisms of immune evasion and immunotherapeutic response, such settings are no longer adequate. The problem is that finding rare disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the context of minimal residual disease, or monitoring metastasis in live mice requires that we employ fluorescent proteins like GFP or luminescent proteins like firefly luciferase, which are viewed as &#8220;foreign&#8221; by the host. Here, we document these responses and demonstrate how they impact the metastatic cascade. We demonstrate the level of host tolerization required to overcome immune responses directed against GFP, and how to achieve it. Finally, we describe how we can take advantage of this response to study mechanisms by which DTCs evade immune surveillance, and how to overcome them.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cyrus M.

Tumor antigen-specific T cells are the main component of effector immune cells in anti-tumor immune responses, but their systemic deployment in breast cancer patients and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a cluster of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell exhibiting tissue-resident memory (T<sub>RM<\/sub>) phenotype in<sub> <\/sub>the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) of 487 cases of breast cancer patients, whose abundancy specifically predicts improved lung, but not other target organ metastasis-free survival. Also, high lung CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T<sub>RM <\/sub>infiltration is associated with lower metastatic burden in breast cancer patients. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed that in multiple mouse cancer models, CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>RM<\/sub> accumulate at early tumor stages when lung metastasis was not identified. Functionally, the CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>RM<\/sub> isolated from pre-metastatic lungs of the animals were tumor antigen specific and cytotoxic to the tumor cells. Nevertheless, the abundancy of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>RM<\/sub> in the lungs were dramatically decreased in the lungs upon metastasis establishment. Moreover, in <i>Cd8<\/i><sup>cre\/+ <\/sup><i>Itgae<sup>loxp\/+ <\/sup><\/i>-diphtheria toxin receptor conditional knockout mice, we unambiguously demonstrated that specific depletion of the CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T<sub>RM <\/sub>subset facilitates lung metastasis<i> in vivo<\/i>, while adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T<sub>RM <\/sub>successfully inhibited lung metastasis and prolonged survival of the mice. Mechanistically, using cell-tracing techniques in the photo-convertible Kaede-Tg mice,we found that tumor-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T<sub>RM <\/sub>were generated in the TDLNs of the mice and were recruited to the lungs via CCL25\/ CCR9 signaling axis. However, the circulating exosomes secreted by primary tumor cells were taken up by alveolar macrophages and polarized them to release IDO1 and impaired anti-tumor T cell immunity, facilitating lung metastasis. More importantly, inhibition of IDO1 effectively retrieves T<sub>RM<\/sub>-mediated protection against lung metastasis. Collectively, we have revealed a cross-talk between tumor cells and the inflammatory environment of distant organs, which could drive lung metastasis by impairing EICD. Our findings also highlight the therapeutic potential of orchestrating EICD in turning &#8220;cold&#8221; metastatic tumor foci to &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Erwei Song<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
