[{"Abstract":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, yet highly lethal, tumor that originates in the excretory glands of the head and neck. It is a locally aggressive disease, with more than half of patients presenting with perineural invasion and\/or bone erosion. The current standard of care consists of surgical excision followed by radiation. Many healthy patients are left with positive margins after surgery and receive systemic therapy in addition to adjuvant radiation without evidence showing added benefit for that approach. Despite extensive surgery, long-term survival rates remain low due to a high incidence of locoregional disease progression and metastatic disease to the lung, liver, brain, or bones, sometimes several years after definitive treatment. Extensive genome analysis of ACC has uncovered a high mutation rate of the proto-oncogene MYB, typically as a genomic translocation resulting in an MYB fusion event with one of the following gene loci: nuclear factor I\/B (NFIB), transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFBR3) or RAD51B. The translocation approximates an enhancer to the MYB regulatory element which can be transactivated by the MYB fusion product, thus leading to the overexpression of MYB via a positive feedback mechanism. Currently, detection of systemic disease relies on diagnostic imaging, which can be imprecise, costly and time-consuming. Years of routine imaging is very impractical, attrition rates are high, and patients often present years later with symptomatic metastatic disease. A rapid and sensitive molecular-based blood screening tool would allow for continuous monitoring and earlier detection of metastatic ACC, ideally improving survival outcomes for these patients. In this study, we hypothesized that the dysregulation in MYB, and the reliance of ACC cells on MYB for survival and progression could be harnessed to develop a molecular screening tool to monitor for metastatic disease of ACC. We developed a blood-based PCR screening probes for metastatic disease in patients with a history of ACC. By analyzing blood samples from four cohorts: healthy individuals (no history of cancer) (n=6), patients with a history of ACC but with no evidence of disease for longer than 3yrs (NED) (n=16), patients with newly diagnosed local disease (n=8), and patients with confirmed metastatic disease (n=7), we demonstrate that our assay was able to detect significantly elevated levels of aberrant MYB expression in all blood specimens from our metastatic disease cohort (p &#60; 0.01). Additionally, our probes were able to detect aberrant levels of MYB in the blood of a patient 11 months before imaging techniques identified metastatic lung lesions. These findings indicate that we can harness a specific ACC genetic trait to develop a sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive molecular screening assay from blood to detect metastatic ACC. We continue to expand and validate these findings by screening existing and new ACC patients every 6 months.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Metastasis biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Screening,Metastatic tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Acadia  H.

At present, no established biomarkers are available for predicting the metastasis risk and prognosis of patients with cSCC. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote the progression of cancer, but their role in cSCC is largely unknown. Here, we have examined the potential of CAF markers in the assessment of metastasis risk and prognosis of primary cSCC.<br \/>Experimental Design: We utilized multiplexed fluorescence immunohistochemistry for profiling of CAF landscape in metastatic and non-metastatic primary human cSCCs, the actual metastases, and in premalignant and benign epidermal lesions. Quantitative high-resolution image analysis was performed with two separate panels of antibodies for CAF markers and the results were correlated with clinical and histopathological parameters including disease-specific mortality.<br \/>Results: Increased stromal expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), &#945;-smooth muscle actin, and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) were associated with progression of premalignant epidermal lesions to invasive cSCC. Furthermore, elevation of FAP and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-&#946; (PDGFR&#946;) expression was associated with the risk of metastasis of primary cSCCs. High expression of PDGFR&#946; and periostin correlated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, a multi-marker defined CAF subset, PDGFR&#945;-\/PDGFR&#946;+\/FAP+, was associated with invasion and metastasis and independently predicted poor disease-specific survival.<br \/>Conclusions: These results show, that fibroblast activation evolves during the progression of cSCC. High PDGFR&#946; expression alone and multimarker combination PDGFR&#945;-\/PDGFR&#946;+\/FAP+ are potential biomarkers for the progression of primary cSCC to metastatic stage, and for poor prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Metastasis biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Skin,Squamous cell carcinoma,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jaakko  S.

One of the key problems is that currently there is no robust molecular biomarker to determine whether the tumor has spread or is at risk of spreading to the regional lymph nodes, the first echelon that OSCC spreads to. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are functional nanoparticles that are bound by natural protein-lipid bilayers. They are deliberately packaged and proactively secreted by all types of cells and serve as intercellular communication vehicles. Tumors release an excess of EVs which are loaded with the molecular and genetic cargo of the parental tumor cells.<br \/>Methods: Following ethical approval and written informed consent, pre-surgical plasma as well as matched post-surgical lymphatic drainage fluid were collected from 20 OSCC patients (nodal disease n=6, no node n=14), and control plasma was also collected from healthy donors. EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation, quantified and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot. Immune profiling of 37 EV surface markers was determined using flow cytometry with the MACSPlex Exosome kit.<br \/>Results: Lymphatic exudate was greatly enriched in EVs in comparison to plasma. Common EV tetraspanins, platelet markers, cancer-related proteins, as well as characteristic markers of immune cells were detected in both plasma and lymphatic exudate EVs based on normalized median fluorescence intensity (nMFI). The presence of OSCC led to an altered composition of blood cell-derived EVs. Elevated levels of CD3, CD25, and CD86, and cancer stem cell marker CD133 were observed in the plasma EVs. However, there were no significant changes in EV markers in plasma between patients with and without lymph node metastasis. Notably, EVs isolated from plasma and lymphatic exudate revealed completely divergent signatures of EV surface markers. Among them, cancer-related protein CD24 was found to be the most highly expressed EV marker in lymphatic exudate from patients with nodal disease (nMFI 1.28&#177;0.50 versus 0.84&#177;0.32, p&#60;0.05) and likewise correlated with advanced disease stages (nMFI 1.17&#177;0.40 versus 0.70&#177;0.27, p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: Plasma-derived EVs are promising non-invasive biomarkers for cancer detection. This study shows that lymphatic exudate is a better source of EV biomarkers due to its high abundance of tumor-related factors directly from draining lymph nodes. In addition, CD24, as reported, is indicative of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and it may serve as a predictor for lymph node metastases and progression of OSCC. These findings shed new light on the understanding of OSCC metastases and provide impetus for consideration of CD24-based liquid biopsy testing and possibly novel immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Metastasis biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Liquid biopsies,Biomarkers,Oral cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xinyu Qu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Leanne Lee Leung<sup>1<\/sup>, Cherrie Wing Kei Ng<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiu Ching Chan<sup>2<\/sup>, Zigui Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Katie Meehan<sup>1<\/sup>, Xianhai Zeng<sup>3<\/sup>, Jason Ying Kuen Chan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Microbiology, Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Ear Nose Throat (ENT), Institute of ENT & Longgang ENT Hospital, Shenzhen, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"31df2870-2c0e-4719-8f4e-40a3d914a58d","ControlNumber":"1538","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

However, it remains unknown if such association is pertinent in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We performed a secondary analysis of ACIS study to determine if the response to dual androgen receptor axis-targeted therapy (ARAT) in in docetaxel na&#239;ve metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) varies based on M-stage at diagnosis and if prior local therapy plays an effect modifying role in the association of M-stage at presentation with survival.<br \/>Patients and Methods: In this phase III randomized controlled trial, mCRPC patients with no prior exposure to androgen biosynthesis signaling inhibitors were randomly assigned to either apalutamide or placebo combined with abiraterone and prednisone. Cox regression models were applied for radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS) with interaction terms between M-stage and treatment regimen. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the adjusted association of M-stage with rPFS and OS after considering the effect modification by prior local therapy (LT).<br \/>Results: Among 972 evaluable patients -432 had M0, 334 had M1 at diagnosis while M-stage was unknown in 206. We did not find any statistically significant heterogeneity of treatment effect on rPFS (interaction p=0.13; HR for placebo in M0 group: 1.42 [1.13-1.79]; M1\/unknown group: 1.11 [0.90-1.37]), and OS (interaction p=0.87; HR for placebo in M0 group: 1.02 [0.81-1.29], and M1\/unknown group: 1.00 [0.82-1.23]) based on M-stage at diagnosis. There was no significant association of M-stage with rPFS (HR for LT group: 1.08 [0.84-1.40], HR for no LT: 0.91 [0.67-1.24]) and OS (HR for LT: 1.04 [0.81-1.33] and no LT: 0.95 [0.70-1.29]) with no significant heterogeneity depending on receipt of LT (interaction p-value of 0.94 and 0.93, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: We did not find a statistically significant heterogeneity in efficacy of dual ARAT based on synchronous versus metachronous presentation.

Identifying personalized treatment strategies to prevent and treat metastases remains an unmet clinical need. Alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) cells are self-renewing epithelial stem cells that have been identified to initiate a majority NSCLCs. Previously, we have reported the presence of multiple AT2 cell types in micrometastatic circulating tumor cell-derived xenograft (CDX) models and patient metastatic tumors. These findings provide a rationale to further study whether and how AT2 cells contribute to metastatic progression.<br \/>Hypothesis: We hypothesize that AT2 cell types have a functional role in metastasis tumorigenicity of NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: A library of NSCLC patient-derived circulating tumor cell (CTC) lines, xenograft (PDX) models, and publicly available data sets of patients&#8217; NSCLC tumor tissues were subjected to single cell\/bulk RNA sequencing and analysis to determine the frequencies and expression patterns of AT2 subclones. Using magnetic bead sorting AT2 cells were enriched and AT2-associated tumorigenicity, migratory and invasion capacity determined using 3D culture and PDX models. The effects of AT2 depletion on PDX tumor characteristics were evaluated histologically. Frequencies of AT2 phenotypes in primary and metastatic tumors were validated in human tissue microarrays and patient CTCs.<br \/>Results: An additional AT2 population was identified in NSCLC brain metastases and primary lung tumors that had metastasized already. However, this additional AT2 cell population was absent in primary lung tumors of patients that had not metastasized and in patients with lymph node, pleural and liver metastases. AT2-depleted NSCLC cell lines had reduced tumorigenicity in PDX models in comparison to tumors derived from whole cell populations. In addition, tumors derived from AT2 depleted cell lines were highly necrotic. AT2-depleted cell lines showed decreased migratory and invasion capacity in 3D models. Further, AT2 phenotypes were identified at high rates in NSCLC patients&#8217; metastases and CTCs.<br \/>Conclusion: Findings indicate an important role of AT2 cells in metastatic progression, beyond their known role in NSCLC initiation. The role of AT2 in metastasis migration, invasion and growth offers unique opportunities to identify novel therapeutic targets. Expansion of translational findings on AT2 cells has high potential for clinical impact to prevent or treat metastatic disease in NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-06 Metastasis biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Animal models,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kanve  N.

A customized gene panel was designed and developed for detection gene signatures.<br \/>Procedure: The customized gene panel consists of 1327 genes, including 900 genes in signaling pathways in oncology &#38; immuno-oncology, which including Nature Kill (NK) cells, neutrophils, Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), DCs, monocytes, Tregs, B cells, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), TGF&#946;, EMT, interferon-&#947; signature, IL-17, &#946;-catenin etc. and 15 house-keeping genes. The validation included in silico probe design, feasibility testing, data comparison with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and precision studies in six cancer indications including: Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), Colorectal Cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (OC), ovarian cancer (GC).<br \/>Data Summary: After the In-silico probe design for all genes the custom probe pool for quality control test in biological samples was performed by evaluating directional and expected expression of 1327 selected genes in 59 FFPE samples from six indications. All probes performed as expected according to specification; gene expression signatures data were consistent with the different cancer indication tested. Expected differential expression of the selected genes was based on RNA-Seq data as reported in TCGA. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) performed on the entire data et, showed a distinct clustering of samples by indication, demonstrating that the custom panel was able to reliably identify each indication. For the validation, precision studies including inter-well, inter-day, inter-processor, inter-sequencer and site-to-site comparisons were performed using FFPE tissue lysate pools prepared from each of the 6 indications. Predefined acceptance criteria are &#8805; 90% of all Lin`s Concordance Correlation Coefficients (LCCC) comparisons to be greater than 0.90. The results showed that the predefined acceptance criteria were met, which are 95.9% of LCCC &#62; 0.90 for inter-well repeatability, and 100% of LCCC &#62;0.90 for inter-day, inter-processor, inter-sequencer and inter-site comparisons.<br \/>Conclusions: The designed panel met all the predefined quality and analytical acceptance criteria, also, the reported results is corrected with TCGA RNA-Seq data, and the precision studies confirmed its performance. Customized gene panel can be possibly utilized for potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers identification to inform new cancer therapies development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene profiling,Assay development,Precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vittorio D'Urso<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dorothee Foernzler<sup>1<\/sup>, Dennis O’Rourke<sup>2<\/sup>, Danyi Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jorge F Sanchez-Garcia<sup>2<\/sup>, Heidi Giese<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Clarke IV<sup>3<\/sup>, XiaoZhe (Janet) Wang<sup>4<\/sup>, Andreas Machl<sup>4<\/sup>, Ti Cai<sup>4<\/sup>, Juergen Scheuenpflug<sup>5<\/sup>, Zheng Feng<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Clinical Genomics, Clinical Biomarkers & Technologies, Clinical Measurements Sciences, Merck Healthcare KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Clinical Genomics, Clinical Biomarkers & Technologies, Clinical Measurements Sciences, EMD Serono, Billerica, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Data Science, Clinical Measurements Sciences, EMD Serono, Billerica, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Companion Diagnostics & Biomarker Strategies, Clinical Measurements Sciences, EMD Serono, Billerica, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>Clinical Measurements Sciences, Global Research & Development, Merck Healthcare KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7a147a50-4ed7-4e29-938a-0500550ad4a4","ControlNumber":"4414","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

Tumors with few lymphocytes in contact with tumor cells can be divided into desert or excluded phenotypes based on lymphocyte absence\/paucity or restriction to the peritumoral stroma, respectively. Standard methods to systematically identify and characterize immune exclusion for patient stratification are lacking.<br \/>Methods: Slides from colorectal (CRC), non-small cell lung (NSCLC), ovarian (OC), pancreatic (PDAC), and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) were stained with multiplex IHC (mIHC) for CD8 and panCK. Pathologist assessment (PA) was done to classify the tumors as: desert, with a paucity of CD8 T cells; excluded, with CD8 T cells not penetrating the tumor parenchyma; and infiltrated, with CD8 T cells within the tumor parenchyma. For the carcinomas, adjacent sections were stained with a multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) panel containing CD8 and a tumor cell marker. Image analysis (IA) was performed on the mIF images to quantify CD8 cell density in the tumor parenchyma and stroma to categorize immune phenotypes.<br \/>Results: Immune phenotypes were classified for 143 samples based on PA of mIHC images and 103 samples by IA of mIF images (see Table 1). Immune exclusion as determined by both PA and IA was highest in CRC, PDAC, and TNBC. IA differed from PA in 25 (24.3%) cases. Pathologist review of the discordant cases revealed discrepancies were generally due to tumor heterogeneity, thresholding, assessment of cells at the tumor-stroma boundaries, necrosis, and artifacts.<br \/>Conclusion: Immune exclusion is highly prevalent in the examined carcinoma types. IA-based approaches, guided by pathologist input, offer promise to quantitatively determine tumor immune phenotypes in a quick and systematic way to guide patients to the most effective therapy.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{1AC20F56-FA5B-41DF-A1BF-0C8A832C3C93}\"><caption>Table 1<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Pathologist Assessment Classification<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Image Analysis Classification<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tumor Type<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Desert (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Excluded (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Infiltrated %<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Desert (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Excluded (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Infiltrated %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CRC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (15.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 (70.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (15.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (30.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11 (55.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (15.0)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NSCLC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (28.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12 (57.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (14.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (28.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9 (42.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (28.6)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (15.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9 (45.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8 (40.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9 (45.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (15.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8 (40.0)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PDAC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (28.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 (66.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (4.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (33.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12 (57.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (9.5)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TNBC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (14.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15 (71.4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (14.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (19.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10 (47.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (33.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">LMS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (15.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (5.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16 (80.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">UPS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (20.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (5.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15 (75.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">143\/103<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">28 (19.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">66 (46.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">49 (34.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">32 (31.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">45 (43.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">26 (25.2)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Histopathology,Image analysis,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Florent Peyraud<sup>1<\/sup>, Fredrick  D.

With many anti-cancer therapeutic strategies focused on targeting or harnessing the immune system, or components thereof, quantification of circulating cytokines has become important to describe the pharmacodynamic and mechanistic effects of these investigational therapies. To support these efforts, new multiplexed immunoassay panels have been developed to expand the available options for broad spectrum characterization of cytokine profiles from biospecimens. Here we characterize the analytical performance of one such panel based on proximity extension assay technology to measure 45 cytokines in plasma.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures<\/b> Plasma samples (n = 27) from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), along with age-matched plasma samples (n = 6) from healthy normal subjects were analyzed using the Olink Cytokine 48 kit. Samples were thawed and processed according to manufacturer instructions for the incubation, extension, and detection on the Olink Signature Q100 instrument. A subset of the screened samples was run in quadruplicate across multiple runs and analyzed on two separate instruments.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Of the 45 cytokines assayed, 41 had values above the assay limit of detection in &#8805;75% of samples analyzed. When compared to the normal human plasma, 26 cytokines were significantly elevated (p-value &#8804; 0.05) in plasma from NSCLC subjects, including those known to be associated both with poor (e.g., IL-1&#946;, IL-6) and good prognosis (e.g., IFN-&#947;). Furthermore, many of the cytokines with significant differences were of low abundance; 13 of the 26 cytokines had mean values &#8804; 20.0 pg\/mL.

Whereas NAFL is a simple steatosis, NASH is characterized by cell injury, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning that may further progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic mechanism that can regulate gene expression patterns to establish cell identity. Here we investigated liver DNA methylation in individuals with simple steatosis and NASH, and further tested if these alterations were associated with clinical phenotypes. NAFLD is associated with abnormal DNA methylation, Advanced NAFLD is associated with hypomethylation of genes involved in TNF receptor signaling and apoptosis, and hypermethylation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, digestion and transport. We suggest that reprogramming of DNA methylation contributes to NAFLD progression and aberrant DNA methylation could be a predictive biomarker of NASH associated HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,NAFLD,epigenetics,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hanyong Go<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Seon-Kyu Kim<sup><\/sup>, Mirang Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotech, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"857e05d7-361c-468f-8326-7ff64b725f08","ControlNumber":"2176","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Here, we aim to identify molecular markers exhibiting distinct characteristics of PMP.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed RNA-seq data to identify gene signatures associated with PMP development using 19 fresh frozen tissue samples including 12 PMPs (discovery cohort). For validation, we applied those signatures into an independent cohort containing 34 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples including 25 PMPs (validation cohort). We also verified protein expression levels in the signature using immunohistochemical staining (IHC) in other independent cohort in PMP. Additionally, a transcriptomic profiling using single-cell RNA-seq was carried out to confirm the cell type-specific gene expression patterns in a separated patient group with five PMPs.<br \/>Results: In the discovery cohort of fresh-frozen tissues, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis exhibited a distinct gene expression pattern clearly dichotomizing normal and PMP samples. Genes involved in cell movement or immune response were highly expressed in PMPs. Interestingly, we found that PMP disease had a molecular heterogeneity showing epithelial as well as mesenchymal characteristics, in which both <i>CDH1<\/i> and <i>CDH2<\/i> were significantly elaborated in PMPs. We also estimated protein expression levels of PMP-associated key markers using IHC, in which a significant positive correlation between transcript and protein expressions in CDH1, whereas we could not observe such a significance but a clear tendency toward highly expression of CDH2 in PMPs. However, in a single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we discovered distinct eight cell type-specific clusters including an epithelial cell group, in which <i>CDH1<\/i> was highly expressed, and a mesenchymal cell group, in which <i>CDH2<\/i> showed a significant higher expression pattern, suggesting that PMP show dual molecular characteristics of epithelial as well as mesenchymal.<br \/>Conclusion: We explore genetic characteristics and suggest key markers of PMP development.

Saliva is attractive due its simple, virtually risk-free collection. The oral cavity and its surroundings may shed contents to saliva and it is essential to choose specific alterations that can indicate cells of origin. Common confounding contaminants may include bacteria and food debris. This study aims to test different saliva collection and processing protocols to build a path for saliva-based RNA cancer markers, by improving RNA specificity for tissue of origin (here salivary gland) and by increasing the quality of saliva extracted RNA. Saliva collection from 3 healthy subjects was performed with 5 different methodologies: gargle, non-stimulation, stimulation with gum, tabasco or ascorbic acid. These samples were protected with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution, QIAzol (Qiagen), RNAprotect Cell Reagent (Qiagen) or OrageneRNA (DNA Genotek), or without a protection step. RNA was then extracted with 4 different kits mirVana (ThermoFisher), QIAzol (Qiagen), RNEasy (Qiagen) and TRIzol Reagent (ThermoFisher). Total RNA was converted to cDNA using qScript cDNA (QuantaBio). RNA quality was evaluated on Agilent&#8217;s 2100 Bio analyzer. RNA quantity was evaluated with RiboGreen Reagent (Invitrogen) on SpectraMax M2 (Molecular Devices). RNA specificity for salivary gland origin was assessed by qRT-PCR for 2 genes HTN3<\/i> and CA6<\/i>, which are specifically highly expressed in salivary glands, normalized by GAPDH<\/i>. Quantity assessment showed an increased amount of RNA collected from unstimulated samples when comparing collection methods. For gargle, unstimulated and tabasco groups had higher RNA yields with the pellet fraction, mirVana extraction protocol and Qiazol protection. For all collection methods, we observed the best quality with the whole fraction, RNEasy extraction reagent, except for gargle. RNA protect showed the highest RNA quality, except for tabasco stimulated samples. There was no variation for gene stability considering HTN3<\/i> (mean 30.97\/SD 1.37) and CA6<\/i> (mean 34.97\/SD 0.54) CTs. HTN3<\/i> amplified earlier and more consistently than CA6<\/i> gene. Analyzing by collection method, the whole fraction was the most specific by gargle and unstimulated samples. mirVana was the best performing extraction method shared between all collection protocols, expect for ascorbic acid saliva stimulation. And Qiazol was the best protection methodology. We obtained the best RNA quality from whole saliva fraction using the RNA protect method and RNEasy extraction protocol. Our findings may build the foundation for desperately needed molecular markers for deadly diseases related to the salivary glands such as salivary gland tumors, aiming for early detection and patient surveillance. Our results also support further validation of strategies to assess saliva as a promising liquid biopsy fluid option.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Saliva,Liquid biopsies,Salivary gland ,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Laura Palmieri<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Dieila Giomo De Lima<sup><\/sup>, Adrian  D.

However, biopsy tissue is precious due to high morbidity associated with repeat biopsies, and usually earmarked for histology, leaving little or no tissue for clinical molecular diagnostics. We have identified that the fluid used to wash biopsy needles after cores contains excess tumor DNA and cells that can be diagnostically useful. Additional research of tumor DNA and tumor tissue recovered from biopsy needle washes provides an opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and treatment for brain tumor patients, while utilizing material that is otherwise thrown away.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In two cases, surgeons were instructed to save 5-15ml of fluid used to wash biopsy needles. Isothermal targeted amplification of H3.3 and H3.1 histone genes was performed on raw wash fluid. Resulting amplicons were sequenced using an Oxford Nanopore MinION. DNA extracted from wash fluid was subjected to NGS sequencing via the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 panel and compared to a CLIA certified NGS sequencing results from clinically indicated biopsy tissue.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> For case 1, 5ul of raw wash fluid was subjected to rapid Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) targeting the H3.1 and H3.3 K27M histone mutations and immediately sequenced using a MinION sequencer via rapid library preparation. Sequencing revealed a H3.3 K27M histone mutation present in wash fluid at 12% variant allele fraction (VAF). The variant call (99.99% CI) was available 1hr5mins after acquisition of material. For case 2, 5ml of wash fluid was processed using a cell-free DNA extraction kit resulting in ~250ng of recovered DNA. A LAMP assay targeting the H3.3 K27M mutation was performed on extracted DNA from wash fluid. Sequencing revealed an H3.3 K27M histone mutation present at 55% VAF, which was later corroborated using digital droplet PCR. Clinically indicated tissue from both biopsies was submitted for cancer panel sequencing in a CLIA certified setting. DNA extracted from wash fluid from both cases was subjected to Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 panel sequencing. In both cases, the panel was able to corroborate all SNV mutations reported by clinical sequencing that were also covered by the panel. Accrual of needle wash specimens is ongoing, with multiple monthly procedures.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Large amounts of diagnostically useful material is present in biopsy needle wash fluid, which is usually discarded. Isothermal assays coupled with MinION sequencing can rapidly identify clinically relevant point mutations directly from wash fluid (e.g. IDH1), and enough DNA was recovered from wash fluid from both case-studies to submit for targeted cancer panel sequencing. These results suggest biopsy needle wash fluid should be considered a first-class diagnostic resource in any cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnosis,Biopsies,Molecular diagnosis,DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jack Wadden<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Vishal John<sup>1<\/sup>, Seongbae Kong<sup>1<\/sup>, Kait Verbal<sup>2<\/sup>, Amy  K.

DGK are a family of enzymes that catalyzes the phosphorylation of the membrane lipid sn-1,2 diacylglycerol (DAG) to form phosphatidic acid. In T-cells, DGK&#950; is considered to play a key role in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. One of the signaling pathways controls T-cell proliferation and activation in response to antigen receptor engagement is controlled by extracellular-regulated kinase ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1\/2). The RASGRP\/ERK pathway plays a crucial part the polarization of microtubule-organizing center in the cytotoxic T-cells, which is required to deliver granzyme to the targeted cells. Restoring T-cell cellular DAG level and activation of ERK1\/2 in anergic T-cells via DGK inhibition has been considered a viable mechanism to assist T-cell mediate tumor cell kill. BAY2965501 showed that pERK could be activated in preclinical models. Phosphorylation of ERK (pERK) inhibition in tumor cells and its difficulty in clinical implementation has been largely acknowledged in oncology community. Circulating T-cell pERK changes as a target engagement biomarker may provide a plausible solution in clinical trial. Here, we report a development of a fit-for-purpose pERK+CD8+ assay.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> Feasibilities to detect BAY2965501 induced pERK activation was tested to minimize the expected clinical hurdles by using various conditions such as various blood collection tubes (BCT), CD3\/CD28 concentrations, and incubation times were evaluated. Whole blood was<i> <\/i>stimulated with BAY2965501 followed by activation with anti-CD3\/anti-CD28 cocktail with subsequent lysis and fixation procedure including freezing. Samples were then stained with antibodies against T-cell cell-surface markers and anti-pERK antibody followed by analyzing on a flow cytometer.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A pERK+CD8+ cell frequency increase was successfully observed after stimulation with BAY2965501 at different concentrations (e.g., 12.89% spiked vs. 30.42% non-spiked). A peak of pERK+CD8+ cell frequency was observed with incubation of anti-CD3\/CD28 at 15 min compared to 5 min or 30 min. Titration of anti-CD3\/anti-CD28 cocktail resulted in saturation observed at a concentration of 2 &#181;g\/mL (range 1-4 &#181;g\/ml). Three collection tubes were tested; 1) Sodium heparin (SoHep); 2) Citrate and 3) TruCulture. SoHep showed the highest pERK+ CD8+ cell frequency (8.29%) compared to Citrate BCT or TruCulture.

Clinical manifestations of CIPN include deficits of varying intensities of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions. Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations could strongly underlie the induction and maintenance of PN (Peripheral Neuropathy) caused by many factors, including chemotherapy. Recently, a few groups have reported epigenetic alterations as well as changes in the Gene Expression Profiles (GEP) using the DNA and RNA isolated from patients experiencing CIPN. Therefore, our goal was to determine epigenetic alterations that may serve as predictive biomarkers and\/or diagnostic biomarkers in the DNA isolated from the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of human patients who were exhibiting varying levels of CIPN. To obtain preliminary data, we analyzed the methylation status of the DNA isolated from 3 Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients who experienced different levels (grades 1-7) of CIPN. When the methylation status of the MM patients was analyzed, the DNA was differentially methylated in 12,230 regions, in comparison to a normal control. Out of the above-mentioned total, about 4,563 regions were hypermethylated and 7,667 regions were hypomethylated. These differentially methylated regions included CpG islands in the promoter, intronic, and exonic regions of various genes within the 23 pairs of chromosomes including X and Y. When the most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms were identified, about 20 of them exhibited DNA hyper-methylation with fold changes ranging from 1-4 with the highest significance of 2.0<sup>e-12<\/sup>. The ranking of the genes involved in the top 3 GO terms related to neuronal function revealed that a total of 112 were hypermethylated in all three patients compared to the control. Similarly, ranking of the genes in the top GO terms with the highest fold change of hypo-methylation revealed 176 genes. Though few other GO terms showed significant changes, they were excluded in our CIPN-related ranking analysis, because they appeared to be linked to cancer or cancer growth-related pathways. It appears that these 288 hyper or hypomethylated genes may be directly involved in the onset, progression, or maintenance of CIPN. Analysis of the functional significance of these genes would provide greater insight into the relevance of the methylation status and its impact on the functions of the neurons that might be involved in pre-disposing or causing CIPN. Our research outcomes are expected to facilitate the design of an assessment method to detect the onset and progression of CIPN in cancer patients.

Addressing the unmet need for better therapeutics, we used our Dual-Precision Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD&#178; TM) approach that merges the power of protein degraders with precision of ADC technology to design ORM-5029. It delivers a highly potent and precise catalytic GSPT1 protein degrader molecule (SMol006) selectively to HER2-expressing tumor cells via conjugation to pertuzumab. GSPT1 is a protein associated with regulation of the translational termination complex, and its loss results in activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) which ultimately leads to apoptosis. Activation of ISR triggers overall reduction of protein synthesis and activation of stress response genes (e.g., ATF3 and DDIT3). ORM-5029 is currently being investigated for safety and tolerability in an open label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation and expansion study in patients with HER2-expressing advanced breast tumors (NCT05511844). Here, we evidence that the efficacy of ORM-5029 correlates with pharmacodynamic degradation of GSPT1 and activation of ATP3 and DDIT3 transcripts both in vitro and in tumor xenografts in mice. With the aim of evaluating GSPT1 degradation and consequent activation of ATF3 and DDIT3 in pre- and post-treatment tumor samples from HER2+ breast cancer patients, we are developing an RNAscope multiplex (Leica System) assay panel. This approach combines detection of GSPT1 protein with 20zz ISH probe-mediated detection of ATF3 and DDIT3 mRNA in tumor sections. As a part of method development, we treated BT474 cells with an efficacious concentration of GSPT1 degrader and optimized the immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry protocol with our in-house generated GSPT1 antibody (MAb001). Data showed that GSPT1- MAb001 could be successfully used for both immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays. The optimized protocol is currently being developed into RNAscope multiplex workflow using BT474 FFPE sections and tissue microarrays. In summary, RNAscope multiplex assay could be used as a method to determine pharmacodynamic response in HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with ORM-5029.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,HER2,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),GSPT1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shikha Saini<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yeonjoon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Wesley Wong<sup>1<\/sup>, Tina Karunaratne<sup>1<\/sup>, Olaf Christensen<sup>1<\/sup>, Sujoy Dutta<sup>1<\/sup>, Palash Bhar<sup>1<\/sup>, Khuloud Takrouri<sup>1<\/sup>, Nathan Fishkin<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong-Ki Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Min-Soo Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Joanne Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Skaletskaya<sup>1<\/sup>, James Palacino<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Park<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Orum Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Orum Therapeutics, Daejon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1dd9f167-de1d-4bc4-b43e-e95cbf5a47a6","ControlNumber":"6530","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

However, upwards of 50% of patients are ineligible due to poor performance status, underlying kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss and\/or cardiac disease. There are currently no accepted alternative regimens with significant activity, and many cisplatin ineligible patients usually proceed directly to surgery. Prior research in other cancers has indicated intravenous vitamin C (IVC), or ascorbate, may serve as a beneficial adjuvant to less toxic therapeutic regimens. We initiated a single arm, Simon 2-stage, Window of Opportunity trial using high dose IVC with single cycle gemcitabine\/carboplatin (GCa) (NCT04046094). The primary outcome was pathologic downstaging. Twelve patients with newly diagnosed CI-MIBC were enrolled. Patients received single cycle GCa and IVC titrated to 350-400 mg\/dL for ~21 days followed by cystectomy after ~4-6 weeks. As reported, pathological downstaging (&#60;ypT2N0Mx) was present in 4 (33%) of patients. Three of the four patients had a complete response (ypT0NoMx) including one patient with plasmacytoid variant histology. Treatment was well tolerated with no attributable AE\/SAEs. Given the discrepancy in response levels, we began identifying potential markers of pharmacodynamic efficacy to inform future trials. Novel data evaluating Ki67+ cells by immunohistochemistry indicate widespread proliferation in non-responders to IVC\/GCa, whereas responding patients had visibly fewer positive cells, suggesting a direct effect on cell death and proliferation. TUNEL staining was present in all samples, although often minimally, and thus TUNEL may not yield enough signal to reliably make determinations about treatment outcomes. Urinary cytokine values were assessed using multiplex ELISA and reported as pg\/mL urine. Multiple cytokines including IL-1RA, CCL2, IL-8, CXCL10 were present at markedly high concentrations in patients with BCa. Cytokine levels generally increased between diagnostic resection and radical cystectomy indicating potential immune activation by the IVC\/GCa treatment. Cytokine levels generally fell between radical cystectomy and follow-up samples suggesting resolution of inflammation after cystectomy. In conclusion, IVC\/GCa may be a viable alternative neoadjuvant treatment strategy for patients with BCa that are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Identifying biomarkers of response remains a major area of interest to refine study designs and identify patients most likely to benefit from therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Bladder cancer,Gemcitabine,Adjuvant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin L.

Here, RWD genomics data mining was conducted using the Foundation Medicine database to explore RAS and BRAF-alterations in CRC patients and to investigate the general alterations&#8217; landscape - including rare alterations. The prevalence of microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were also explored. Methods: The prevalence of gene alterations and their co-occurrence with RAS\/BRAF-alterations in tumor tissue of CRC patients (N=42800) were investigated using the FoundationInsightsTM web platform, which includes harmonized results from the FoundationOneCDx, FoundationOneHeme, and PD-L1 assays from 2012 to March 2022. Data was collected from FMI solid and heme tests from 2012 to March 2022. Alterations that render a particular gene &#8216;altered&#8217; included single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or insertion-deletion mutations (Indels), collectively referred to as short variants (SVs), rearrangements (RE) and copy number events (CN). TMB (cut-off 10 mut\/MB) and MSI status were also characterized. Results: Altogether, 36.9% of CRC samples were RAS\/BRAF-WT and 63.1% had a known or likely functional RAS\/BRAF-alteration, respectively. Of all KRAS and NRAS alterations (SV, CN and RE regardless of annotation as functional or presence in a hotspot), SVs in exons 2, 3 and 4 constituted 96.1% and 94.2% of all alterations, respectively. Relative to all samples the potentially targetable KRAS p.G12C, p.G12D and p.G12V mutations were present in 3.6%, 15.1% and 10.2% of samples, respectively. The p.G12E variant was present in less than ten samples. The five most frequently altered potentially targetable genes were PIK3CA (19.6%), PTEN (8.7%), ERBB2 (4.7%), EGFR (2.5%) and FGFR1 (2.0%). NTRK-alterations (NTRK1\/2\/3) were present in 0.9%, ROS1-alterations in 0.4%, RET-alterations in 0.6% and ALK-alterations in 0.5% of samples, respectively. The prevalence of immuno-oncology biomarkers was also explored; overall, 9.6% of samples were TMB-high, 6.1% MSI-high and 0.6% POLE-altered. MSI-high or TMB-high samples were significantly more abundant in the RAS\/BRAF-altered subset. In the RAS\/BRAF-WT subset 4.6% were MSI-high and 7.9% TMB-high, whereas in the RAS\/BRAF-altered subset 7.1% were MSI-high and 10.6% TMB-high. Conclusion: RWD based clinical genomic profiling confirms that the vast majority of RAS-alterations in CRC are SVs in exons 2, 3 and 4. Both TMB-high and MSI-high samples are significantly more abundant in the RAS\/BRAF-altered cohort. RWD confirms that PI3K-, ERBB- and FGFR-signaling pathways are frequently altered in CRC. RWD based clinical genomic profiling has the potential to support comprehensive clinical study design as well as patient selection\/stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Colorectal cancer,BRAF,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Markus Schulze<sup>1<\/sup>, XiaoZhe (Janet) Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jawad Hamad<sup>3<\/sup>, Julia  F.

Successful immunotherapy in HNSCC is currently based on the ability to block the interaction of PD1 and PDL1 and abolish the inhibition of CD8+ T cells, thus enhancing the antitumor activity. T cells recognize peptide antigens in the context of MHC molecules through the clonally distributed T Cell receptor (TCR), which offers the means to detect and track specific T cells. We characterized TCR signatures in unique HNSCC paired samples (including L = Lymphocyte, S = Saliva, T = Tumor) to profile TCR repertoire diversity and clonality in different compartments. A total of 48 HNSCC samples corresponding to 14 patients (2 assayed 2X) were obtained from Johns Hopkins University. DNA samples were submitted for TCR sequencing (TCR-seq) via enrichment of the human TCRB locus using Human-TCRB-PD4bx. CDR3 sequences were downloaded from Adaptive ImmuneAnalyzer. For each sequence, V, D and J regions were extracted and translation to amino acid done on the CDR3 region. 8 paired (T, L, S) samples were submitted for shallow sequencing survey depth and 8 for deep assay depth. In order to better understand the TCR repertoire, we assessed the number of unique immune receptor clonotypes, their relative abundance, repertoire overlap, clonotype tracking and sequence length distribution. As expected, the deep assay revealed more clones than the survey. Using the TCR-seq deep assay, 9 out of 10 S samples harbored at least 10% of the number of clonotypes found in their paired T. As expected, L harbored a greater number and more diverse clones than T and S samples and showed partial overlap with T and S samples. Comparing the overlap between T, L and S based on a shared CDR3.aa repertoire: by shallow survey, 3\/5 S samples had at least 1 overlap with the primary T. Using the deep assay, 9 out of 10 patients (90%) showed overlap between the S and paired T. We found top public clonotypes occupying the larger part in HPV negative samples, and surprisingly no known CDR3.aa sequences annotated to HPV in HPV positive samples but annotated to other common viruses (CMV, EBV). Our study demonstrates a robust TCR repertoire in S that corresponds at least partially to the clones observed in T and circulating L. The presence of HPV did not yet yield CDR3.aa specific sequences. Future single-cell transcriptomes may identify signatures of CD8+ and CD4+ neoantigen-reactive tumor-infiltrating L in the paired S samples in addition to the viral or tumor-associated antigens present in bulk assays. Our data need to be further validated in larger well characterized cohorts that include S from cancer-free subjects. These early results support the use of saliva as a potential surrogate for diagnostic immune-profiling of tumors, for early detection and follow-up. We further envision creating a personalized TCR repertoire for individual patients from an initial tumor sample biopsy to monitor their tumor immune dynamics using saliva.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Immuno-oncology,Liquid biopsies,Saliva,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dieila Giomo De Lima<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mariana Brait<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Palmieri<sup>1<\/sup>, Fernando  T.

By controlling chromatin accessibility, BAF regulates lineage-specific transcriptional programs, including those important for AML blast cell growth and survival. FHD-286 is a highly potent inhibitor of the BAF catalytic subunits BRM and BRG1 (SMARCA2\/4), which demonstrates strong tumor growth inhibition in several AML CDX and PDX models. FHD-286 is being developed for the treatment of relapsed\/refractory AML and MDS (see Foghorn website for current status).Investigation of FHD-286 in a broad panel of AML cell lines showed that BAF inhibition affects hematopoietic transcriptional programs important for blast cell self-renewal and identity, agnostic of mutational background. Similarly, FHD-286 demonstrated broad efficacy in <i>ex vivo<\/i> treatment of AML patient-derived samples from diverse genetic backgrounds, including those with difficult to treat mutational profiles, including mtNPM1, FLT3 ITD, and Inv(3) with EVI1 overexpression. Interestingly, while higher concentrations (&#8805;90 nM) of FHD-286 predominantly induced cytoreduction, lower concentrations (&#8804;30 nM) predominantly led to differentiation-like responses. To investigate this differentiation effect, we performed immunophenotyping of cell lines and primary AML samples following prolonged treatment with FHD-286. Extended treatment (7+ days) with relevant concentrations (5-20 nM) of FHD-286 led to time- and dose-dependent upregulation of the myeloid differentiation marker CD11b, and acquisition of monocyte\/metamyelocyte morphology. CD11b+ cells expressed lower levels of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1, as well as proliferation and survival proteins Ki67, Myc and BCL2. Additionally, primary patient samples showed a loss of CD34 positivity in blasts and GMP-like cells after 7 days of ex vivo treatment, indicating a decrease in stemness in these populations. Finally, upregulation of CD11b coincided with decreased BRG1 protein, suggesting that immature blasts are characterized by high levels of BRG1. These results suggest that BAF functions to drive transcriptional programs required to maintain AML cells in an undifferentiated state, and that FHD-286 may inhibit AML cell growth by overcoming this differentiation block. Expanding on these findings, we have also demonstrated synergistic activity with multiple combination partners, including cytarabine and decitabine, in vitro. Elaboration of this in both CDX and PDX in vivo models also shows significant survival benefit in difficult to treat mutational backgrounds. Taken together, these findings suggest that FHD-286 is able to target blast progenitor populations that are heavily BRM\/BRG1-dependent, and that combination with standard of care agents can achieve profound, mutationally agnostic antitumor activity in AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Differentiation,BAF Complex,BRM\/BRG1,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mike Collins<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Astrid Thomsen<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashley Gartin<sup>1<\/sup>, Gabriel  J.

Although GLDC expression in the kidney is second highest next to the liver, very little is known as to the role of GLDC in the kidney. Thus, this study was designed to determine the role of GLDC in the renal carcinoma. We found markedly increased expressions of GLDC in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) classified as poor-risk group based on the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center prognostic model. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies revealed that cellular proliferation, colony formation, and migration were decreased in GLDC-deficient renal carcinoma cells while those were increased in GLDC-overexpressing renal carcinoma cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> xenograft studies with GLDC-deficient and -overexpressing cells also revealed that tumor sizes were noticeably decreased in GLDC-deficient cell-injected mice while those were increased in GLDC-overexpressing cell-injected mice. Mechanistically, we found GLDC regulates renal carcinoma progression via interferon (IFN) stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)-mediated pathway. Poly-IC induced mRNA expression of IFN-&#945; more strongly in GLDC-deficient cells. Expressions of IRF9 and STAT2 were increased in GLDC-deficient cells while those were decreased in GLDC-overexpressing cells. Interferon-responsive genes (IFIT1, IFI44, IFI44L, and IFI27) were also regulated by GLDC as evidenced by increased mRNA expressions in GLDC-deficient cells and increased mRNA expressions in GLDC-overexpressing cells. Knock-down of IRF9 and STAT2 in GLDC-deficient cells reversed decreased cellular proliferation, colony formation, and migration. In summary, the data in this study indicates that GLDC regulates renal carcinoma progression via ISFG3-medated pathway and lay a scientific foundation that could support a therapeutic strategy that targets GLDC for the treatment of renal carcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jin Young Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mai Thi Tuyet Pham<sup>2<\/sup>, Byung Hoon Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Ji Hae Seo<sup>4<\/sup>, Sojin Shin<sup>5<\/sup>, Eunyoung Ha<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Urology, Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Obstetrics and Gynecology, Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, Daegu, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fa96a523-0676-49e5-8d06-fe7b3230abca","ControlNumber":"1591","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
